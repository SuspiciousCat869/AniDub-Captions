1
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,500
[DEVIL A] It's the Sinner!
He's here!

2
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,125
[DEVIL B] At last!

3
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,750
[DEVIL C]
Aion! Aion has come!

4
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,208
[DEVIL D] Aion!

5
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,041
Ahhh!

6
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,291
[SATELLA]
Hmph. That's enough.

7
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,125
You've been
quite a nuisance.

8
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,875
[DEVIL D laughs]

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,083
It doesn't matter.
Aion will destroy you all.

10
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,208
[DEVIL D grunts]

11
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,000
There's no place
for you to run!

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:52,291
This Aion...
Since the day he appeared,

13
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,666
the turbulence in the
darkness has been growing.

14
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,125
Who, and what, could he be?

15
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,583
[ELDER] So, you
finally found him.

16
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,500
After all this time.

17
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,625
The documents were in
their hands at one point,

18
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,375
so we can't be
entirely sure,

19
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,166
but they seem to give
us enough information

20
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,750
to pick up his trail.

21
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,208
Yes. And where
is Rosette now?

22
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,125
She's gone to the place
where all of this began.

23
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,375
At Seventh Bell, eh?

24
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,000
[sighs] I see.

25
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,916
[AZMARIA] Jeepers.

26
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,416
[ROSETTE] If we had
left it as it was,

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,250
it would have attracted
too much attention.

28
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,666
[AZMARIA] Uh-huh.

29
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,625
[AZMARIA]
Rosette, wait for me!

30
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,916
[loud screeching]

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,458
[loud thud]

32
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,000
[AZMARIA] Huh?

33
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,666
[ROSETTE] Where did
they put that switch?

34
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,416
[CHRONO] I think that
it was over this way.

35
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,375
[AZMARIA] Uh...

36
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,166
Will you please wait?

37
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,125
[AZMARIA] Huh?

38
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,833
Rosette?

39
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,333
[AZMARIA] Rosette,
where are you?

40
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:36,041
If you can hear me,
could you please say something?

41
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,833
Huh? R-Rosette?
Are you over there?

42
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,541
Huh?

43
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,375
Oh, it's a board.

44
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,666
Huh? A board?

45
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,375
[AZMARIA yells]

46
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:09,875
[AZMARIA screams]

47
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,458
[ROSETTE] Azmaria!

48
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,875
Ahh!

49
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,750
[thonk]

50
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,416
[AZMARIA] Ow!

51
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,375
Are you all right now, Azmaria?

52
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,833
It hurts!

53
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:27,916
Yeah, well that's what you get

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,166
for screaming in
my face like that.

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,500
But they...

56
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,833
[ROSETTE] Huh?

57
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,291
[ROSETTE] Yeah, it
happened four years ago.

58
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,416
It was winter then,

59
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,375
but nothing has
changed since.

60
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,541
[CHRONO] Nor will
it ever change.

61
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,708
This place is forever
frozen as it was.

62
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,666
[AZMARIA]
Did Joshua...

63
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,875
[ROSETTE]
He didn't do anything!

64
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,333
It wasn't him.

65
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,041
Aion did all of this!

66
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,291
Azmaria, if you've truly
decided to fight alongside us,

67
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,583
you must face
what Aion can do,

68
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,333
and the forces
he's set in motion.

69
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,500
[children laugh]

70
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,250
You brats!
Come back here!

71
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,000
Come back here,
you two!

72
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,958
Just give up already!

73
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,166
You big sap!
That's not playing fair!

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,375
She's so mad,
she'll murder us!

75
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,958
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
You messed up the laundry!

76
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,583
If you've got to run around
like little hooligans,

77
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,916
do it where you won't
wreck everything!

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,583
[yelling]

79
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,916
Stop, Rosette!
It's all right!

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,666
Mash 'em good, Rosette!

81
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,291
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
You won't escape!

82
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,333
Take that!

83
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,416
[BILLY] Wah!

84
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,666
Ow.

85
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,166
You're gonna take
responsibility this time, Billy.

86
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,333
I am?

87
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,500
That's right.

88
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,041
You're going
to come clean!

89
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,041
And wash everything
you got dirty!

90
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,583
[NELLY]
Ha, ha, ha! Yay!

91
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,458
But it's your turn to
wash today, Rosette!

92
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:12,791
And I'll be glad to
clean your clock. Got it?

93
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,541
Hey, where's
the bucket?

94
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,625
Ah! It's over there!

95
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,500
[GROUP] Huh?

96
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,208
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Ahh!

97
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,916
Joshua! Oh my God!

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,083
You clobbered him!

99
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,541
I didn't do anything,
it was all Rosette's fault!

100
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,583
Do you think I should
go and get Miss Jean?

101
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,083
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Joshua! Joshua!

102
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,958
[YOUNG JOSHUA laughs]

103
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,583
[blows raspberry]

104
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,750
[YOUNG JOSHUA laughs]

105
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,125
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
I got you! I got you!

106
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,000
And you thought
you hit me?

107
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,875
Gee whiz,
what a sap!

108
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,500
You slay me, Rosette!

109
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,458
[YOUNG JOSHUA laughs]

110
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,708
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Why you!

111
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:54,541
[YOUNG JOSHUA coughs]

112
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,000
Are you all
right, Joshua?

113
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,041
Did you take
your medicine?

114
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,916
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Yeah.
But I feel great. Honest, sis.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,458
Can't you let me stay out
a little longer just this once?

116
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,291
But Joshua...

117
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,375
Come on, Rosette,
pretty please.

118
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,416
Mm.

119
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,208
Um, say, Rosette, isn't the
minister coming this afternoon?

120
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,583
Oh is he? Well then,
let's tempt the devil...

121
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,666
...and go exploring!

122
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,375
No Rosette, no!

123
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,666
Heh. Great, so she's
off with Joshua,

124
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,541
and we're left
holding the bag.

125
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,666
[BILLY] It's so unfair,

126
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,791
whenever he gets hurt
Miss Jean gets mad at us.

127
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,958
[REMINGTON] And today
as well, I see.

128
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,833
[JEAN] Yes. And I only took
my eyes off her for a second.

129
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,833
I am so sorry.

130
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,291
Well, it can't be helped.

131
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,833
Yes, but... now you wish to
take Joshua away as well.

132
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,708
True, but we can't deny that
he possesses a special talent.

133
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,333
A talent that
makes it imperative

134
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,916
that we bring him
into our order.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,625
We have been
searching for someone

136
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:04,208
with the special abilities
Joshua has for quite some time.

137
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,416
So, if you have no
further questions,

138
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,666
I believe I should
speak to him in person.

139
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,708
I don't doubt that
it's an excellent offer.

140
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,000
And yet, this does
concern Rosette as well.

141
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,500
[REMINGTON laughs]

142
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,666
[REMINGTON] Yes, that girl
really seems to disdain

143
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,750
the sight of me, doesn't she?

144
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,958
For siblings, they are
quite protective of each other.

145
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,666
Mind you, I imagine she
fears that her younger brother

146
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,833
will be taken away from her.

147
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,541
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Um, Rosette...

148
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,416
How far are we
going to go?

149
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,583
Do you really think it's
all right to stay out so long?

150
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,000
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
It's all right!

151
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,125
And we're not going back until
that weird minister goes home!

152
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,458
Haven't you noticed
how strange he is?

153
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,583
If you associate with
crackpots like him,

154
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,583
do you know what could happen?

155
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,541
You could get strapped
to a laboratory table!

156
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,791
Be subjected to weird
scientific experiments!

157
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,375
And end up pickled
in formaline!

158
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,750
I think someone's been
reading Argocy again.

159
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,708
Yeah, but that stuff in your
dime novels isn't always fake!

160
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,000
[YOUNG JOSHUA laughs]

161
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,666
But the Minister came here
from New York City,

162
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,625
isn't that right?

163
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,666
I'll bet it's more fun there

164
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,583
than out here in
the countryside.

165
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,750
It's a convent!

166
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,875
It's not like you'd
be in the city!

167
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,458
But since we're going
to have to leave here

168
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,708
when we turn
fifteen in any case,

169
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,916
I don't see how
there's much difference

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,333
between having to
leave now or then.

171
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,583
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Well I don't want to.

172
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,625
You're still
much too weak,

173
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,041
and it's much too dangerous
to go any place by yourself.

174
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,125
You're a pill.

175
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,875
No, I'm just doing an
older sister's duty.

176
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,125
Ah!

177
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,208
Ahhhhh!

178
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,208
Aaahh!

179
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,583
[thud]

180
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,625
I can't breathe.

181
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,541
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Oh, I'm sorry Rosette!

182
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,833
Ahhh!

183
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,166
[YOUNG JOSHUA coughs]

184
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,458
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Hey, this isn't a stream.

185
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,500
What is this place?

186
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,000
[YOUNG ROSETTE yells]

187
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,583
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Oh geez!
Are you all right?

188
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,750
Well of course
I'm not all right.

189
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,833
It cut me to the bone!

190
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,791
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Oh, you just scraped your knee!

191
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,333
But it hurts!

192
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,250
You are such a baby.

193
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,416
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Thank you.

194
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,833
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Sometimes I
think this is the only thing

195
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,958
you're ever glad to
have me around for.

196
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:48,791
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Hmph!

197
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,250
Well if you're done
being foolish,

198
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,541
we should go find the exit.

199
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,666
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Rosette...

200
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,166
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Huh?

201
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,750
Why can I heal everyone else's
injuries, but not my own?

202
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,666
Why can't I?

203
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,833
Look, it's fine.

204
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,500
Don't worry about
using your powers,

205
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,541
because I'll always
be here to protect you.

206
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,625
Come on. Let's go.

207
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,333
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
This door is huge!

208
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,875
It's got to be an exit.

209
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,041
There's something
written on it.

210
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,708
"An eternal... becoming...

211

Saint Magda...
and sleeping" I think?

212
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,375
What does it say?

213
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,500
I can't tell.

214
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,166
It's too--

215
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,666
[gasps]

216
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,833
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Well, it's open!

217
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,666
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Uh-huh.

218
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,833
I have a feeling
this isn't the exit.

219
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,291
Now that I think about it,

220
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,375
didn't Miss Jean
say something...

221
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,875
about the forest...

222
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,750
something about there
being an underground tomb?

223
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,666
Ah! A tomb!

224
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,166
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
It's a coffin!

225
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,666
T-T- You mean we're in a...

226

[CHRONO]
Who are you?

227
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,583
Who dares awake me?

228
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,791
Tell me.

229
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,375
[CHRONO] Who is the one
that has awakened me?

230
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,833
First tell us
who and what you are.

231
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,375
My name is Chrono.

232
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,791
And what I am is what
your people call a devil.

233
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:48,875
What do you mean
by "a devil"?

234
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,625
Just what I said. One of the
beings that you humans fear.

235
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,958
[CHRONO winces]

236
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,125
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Sir, are you all right?

237
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,833
I lack spiritual energy.

238
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,041
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
You mean you're weak?

239
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,791
You should eat something.

240
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,250
Wait just a second!

241
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,958
[CHRONO] Uh...

242
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,708
Here! Help yourself!

243
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,125
[CHRONO]
Um, thank you?

244
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
[ROSETTE] And that's
how I met Chrono.

245
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,958
At first I didn't believe it,

246
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,166
I mean, what kind of person
would call themself a devil?

247
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,583
[CHRONO] That's mean!

248
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,416
I could see you guys were
pretty strange yourselves.

249
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,541
[ROSETTE]
Who's calling who strange?

250
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,958
[ROSETTE laughs]

251
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,333
But you know,
it turned out that

252
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,875
becoming friends with a
devil wasn't so bad at all.

253
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,833
Especially since Joshua
liked that occult stuff.

254
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,916
True.

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,416
But it was kinda strange, too.

256
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,583
And that first time
that we met...

257
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,083
I was so scared of Chrono,
I couldn't believe it.

258
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,833
But that feeling disappeared
soon afterwards.

259
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,375
[AZMARIA]
So, um...

260
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,625
Do you know who was
buried down there?

261
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,541
It was the tomb
of Magdalene.

262
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,333
She whose holy name
fills the hearts

263
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,375
of we Sinners with
great trepidation.

264
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,041
But why were you
sitting in her tomb?

00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,875
[CHRONO sighs]

266
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,583
Oh excuse me! I didn't
mean for it to sound like...

00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,750
Uh, I mean... like
how it sounded... oh.

268
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,500
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Chrono!

269
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,958
[CHRONO] Huh?

270
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,166
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
We're over here!

271
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,708
[YOUNG ROSETTE laughs]

272
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,250
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
That's right,

273
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,541
and yesterday they said that
we could finally go out again.

274
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,875
[YOUNG ROSETTE] It's funny,
even though he was sick in bed,

275
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
all he could talk about
was your stories, Chrono.

276
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,708
But Chrono's stories
are really interesting!

277
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,958
And you like them too!

278
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,041
I saw how you looked
like you were going to cry

279
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,333
when he told us
"The Wind Master"

280
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,916
and "The Thunderbird's Story."

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,750
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Well those are stories

282
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,916
that should make you cry.

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,666
If they don't,
it just goes to show

284
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,541
you have a twisted personality.

285
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,833
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Don't say that about me!

286
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,000
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Huh? What do you mean?

287
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,041
A great river that
flows in the sky?

288
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,750
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
A river in the heavens...

289
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,166
Do you mean
the Milky Way?

290
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,708
[CHRONO] Un-unh.

291
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,416
It's something you can't see
with your eyes--Astral Lines.

292
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,208
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Astral... Lines?

293
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,250
Right. They're up
there, far away.

294
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,583
And from those distant streams
flow the source of all life.

295
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,666
Think of them as being
droplets of life force.

296
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,083
Like rain, they
fall to the Earth,

297
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,416
combining with
each other to form

298
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,291
puddles and pools
that we call souls.

299
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,083
Does that make sense?

300
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,000
And when each soul's
course of life has ended,

301
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,875
it ascends to the heavens,

302
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,083
splitting into
fragments once more,

303
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,875
flowing back to the great
river from which it came.

304
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,750
That is the great cycle,
the process by which

305
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,916
life has renewed itself for
billions and billions of years.

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,875
Then, if we go there, could
we meet people who've died?

307
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,875
I don't know. To be honest,

308
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,208
I'm just repeating what I've
been told by someone else.

309
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,500
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
That's... incredible!

310
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,625
This is just so incredible,
it's all so new!

311
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,833
[CHRONO] Is it? I guess I never
thought about how few see

312
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,166
how the souls of all beings

313
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,416
must continue to
flow into this world.

314
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,458
Well, Rosette,
this settles it!

315
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,041
[CHRONO]
Settles what?

316
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,541
Well, it's been
our lifelong dream

00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,000
to become world
famous explorers.

318
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't you see?

319
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,041
Africa, the Amazon,
the Antarctic!

00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,208
We're going to go to places

321
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,958
no one else has
ever been to before!

322
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,416
We'll have our names written
in all the history books!

323
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,250
And if we can find
these Astral Lines,

324
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,958
that'll be our
greatest discovery!

325
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,083
He was so excited,
and yet now he's asleep.

326
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,958
All that running around
really wore him out.

327
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,208
But I'm so glad
he still has his dreams.

328
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,833
He hasn't talked about
them much lately,

329
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,041
and I was afraid
he'd given up on them.

330
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,458
Ever since he started being
able to use his powers,

331
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,875
his fits keep getting
worse and worse.

332
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,541
[YOUNG ROSETTE sighs]

333
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,208
It's just so strange.

334
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,958
Why can he heal others,

335
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,375
but not heal his own
injuries or sickness?

336
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,083
Chrono, the truth
is that I'd rather

337
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,000
become a doctor
than a great explorer.

338
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,750
For Joshua's sake?

339
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,416
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Mhmm.

340
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,166
You're so kind.

341
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,291
[YOUNG ROSETTE laughs]

342
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,291
But it's hopeless.
There's no way I can become one.

343
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,166
It's so unfair
like that sometimes.

344
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,916
And please, don't tell Joshua
I told you this, okay?

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,291
[CHRONO] Mm.

346
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,416
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Thanks, Chrono.

347
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,333
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Just a little more!

348
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,750
Come on, Chrono,
do your best!

349
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,791
[YOUNG ROSETTE] Harder!

350
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,541
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Yeah! Huh?

351
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,666
[YOUNG ROSETTE laughs]

352
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,500
Be careful! That doesn't
look safe, Rosette!

353
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,500
[YOUNG ROSETTE yells]

354
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,041
[thud]

355
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,333
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Oh, Chrono!

356
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,833
[CHRONO chuckles]

357
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,750
[inaudible]

358
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:36,083
[CHRONO] Why do I
suddenly feel so warm?

359
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:40,333
As if the sun was shining
on me, deep inside.

360
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:45,708
I wish... it could stay
like this... forever.

361
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,958
[CHRONO] But what is this?

362
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,333
I feel as if
I'm being watched.

363
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:07,375
[CHRONO] Rosette! What's wrong?
Did something happen?

364
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,208
Joshua... he made
the decision without me!

365
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,458
[YOUNG JOSHUA coughs]

366
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,208
[REMINGTON] Some minor
formalities remain,

367
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,750
so I'll have to
come back tomorrow.

368
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,333
You'll be leaving
in one week.

369
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,208
'Til then, it would be best to
take it easy and recuperate.

370
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,500
[weakly] Yes, sir.

371
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,375
We won't know for certain until
we do a full examination,

372
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:32,041
but I suspect that your power is
putting a strain on your body.

373
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:37,166
Of course, we have no idea
why it's happened so suddenly.

374
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,291
My sister...

375
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,625
[winces]

376
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,041
She's just so strong...

377
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,708
always running around
and so full of life.

378
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:53,291
And yet she always
makes time for me.

379
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,916
But I know she could
do so much more,

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,333
if I wasn't holding her back.

381
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:04,916
And I don't want her to have to
keep worrying about me anymore.

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,416
Father, if I go with you,

383
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,583
could I become that strong?

384
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,958
[YOUNG ROSETTE sobs]

385
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:18,166
Oh. Oh, Rosette.

386
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,500
[CHRONO gasps]

387
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,500
What's wrong?

388
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,708
Chrono!

389
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,166
Stay back! You mustn't
come any closer!

390
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,833
[AION]
Hello, Chrono.

391
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,791
At long last, we meet again.

392
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,416
I trust that you've been well.

393
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
Aion!

394
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:46,333
[AION] Yes, old friend, we have
unfinished business, you and I.

395
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,041
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Look,
Rosette, look at my power!

396
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,583
I'm one of the
chosen ones!

397
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,250
[YOUNG ROSETTE] What?
What are you saying, Joshua?

398
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,541
[YOUNG JOSHUA] Why are you
looking at me like that?

399
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,500
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop the noise!

400
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,916
[AION] Yes, Chrono, why don't we
make some mischief together?

401
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,708
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
What did you do to Joshua?

402
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,875
Answer me!

403
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,916
[AION]
Next episode, "Horn."

404
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,666
[CHRONO] Rosette Christopher,
I will make a contract with you.
