1
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,250
[ROSETTE] Jeepers,
why aren't we there yet?

2
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,166
Just how much longer
is this gonna take?

3
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,208
I'm pretty sure that we're
heading in the right direction.

4
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,208
Chrono, you're holding
that upside down.

5
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,750
Hey, what's eating you, anyway?

6
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,416
Pull yourself together.

7
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,875
[CHRONO] Right.

8
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,791
If we could just hitch
a ride from someone,

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,333
we'd make it to San Francisco
in no time flat.

10
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,250
But there isn't
anyone else around.

11
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,750
[CHRONO] It looks like there's
a service station up ahead,

12
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,708
so why don't we
just stick with it.

13
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,541
All right!

14
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,166
[AZMARIA] Oh.

15
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,166
[AZMARIA] Huh?

16
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,250
Is that a...?

17
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,375
It couldn't be.

18
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,791
Lucky us!

19
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,000
Hey! Over here!

20
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,083
Hey, stop for us!

21
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,750
Hey!

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,583
They didn't even slow down!

23
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,458
Chrono, this is all your fault!

24
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,083
If you had been holding
the map right-side up...

25
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,791
[CHRONO] Hey, don't
take it all out on me!

26
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,291
Rosette,
look behind you.

27
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,500
Eh? Ahh!

28
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,375
Ahhh!

29
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,833
[coughing]

30
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,000
Huh?

31
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,083
Ahh! Satella!

32
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,791
What are you doing way out here
in the middle of nowhere?

33
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:45,041
What I do and where I do it
is no concern of yours.

34
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,375
It's quite astounding,

35
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,333
but you three are even
dirtier than usual.

36
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,833
[ROSETTE grunts angrily]

37
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,375
[AZMARIA] Oh, Miss Satella,
you're always so beautiful.

38
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,583
Ah, your honesty
is refreshing.

39
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,333
Perhaps I should reward you
with an invitation to my villa.

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,416
Azmaria is incredible,

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,958
already cozying up to the
rich folk, for crying out loud.

42
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,166
Miss Satella,
you're a life saver.

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,000
Really, thanks.

44
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,291
It's amazing,
you were actually

45
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,166
planning to walk all
the way to San Francisco?

46
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,166
It's not like
we had a choice.

47
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,666
We lost everything
when our luggage got

48
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,000
carried off on that train.

49
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,375
[SATELLA] Hmm. Could it be
that you're all penniless?

50
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,375
Well excuse us, Princess,
but unlike you,

51
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,625
we're all a little strapped
for time and money!

52
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,083
Well, I don't really have
any time to spare either,

53
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,791
but I do have more than
enough money to burn.

54
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,833
[ROSETTE grunts angrily]

55
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,208
[CHRONO] Cut it out, Rosette!
We might get the bum's rush!

56
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,791
[SATELLA] Why don't
you just sit quietly?

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,375
[AZMARIA]
Oh! It's San Francisco!

58
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,166
Please wake up, Rosette!

59
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,416
Rosette! Wake up!

60
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,416
Huh?

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,166
Huh? We're there?

62
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,291
[AZMARIA] Come on, Chrono!
Come and see!

63
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,333
Sorry, you go on.
I'll be there in a second.

64
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,750
Oh, I see.

65
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,875
Okay, we'll be waiting.

66
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,375
Wow!

67
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,958
[STEINER]
Yes, this is the best point

68
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,416
from which to view
San Francisco.

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,708
[ROSETTE] We made it.

70
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,666
Joshua is somewhere
in this town.

71
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,125
Right! Let's do it!

72
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,458
Chrono! Jeepers creepers,

73
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,541
how long does it
take you to wake up?!

74
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,875
We're finally here,

75
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,458
but we can't do anything
until you snap out of it!

76
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,333
Ahhh!

77
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,958
Chrono! What are you doing?!

78
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,750
[SATELLA] Kommen sie!

79
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,333
Rip him to shreds!

80
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,166
Mutigster!

81
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,708
Erlöschen!

82
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,000
Whoa. That hurt.

83
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,041
Chrono sure is a lot bolder
than he looks, isn't he?

84
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,500
Heh heh. Just what was
he thinking, anyway?

85
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,333
Exactly what kind of training
are you giving him?!

86
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,208
Now, now, I'll be sure
to firmly scold him.

87
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,708
But he's a devil!

88
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,541
[AZMARIA] Rosette!
It's horrible!

89
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,416
He's passed out.

90
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
[ROSETTE] What?

91
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,333
And he has a
horribly high fever.

92
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,541
Huh?

93
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,333
A fever?

94
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,041
Well slap on a bandage,
and I'm sure he'll be jake.

95
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,375
Miss Satella,
could you please

96
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,791
take us to the
Magdalene branch office?

97
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,375
Uh. Of course, but I...

98
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,708
If I may, might I suggest

99
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,208
that we take him to Miss
Satella's villa instead?

100
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,166
I believe that it
would be much closer.

101
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,541
[AZMARIA] Oh yes, please, sir!

102
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,416
I'm sorry, Rosette.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,166
We're so close to
finding Joshua, but I...

104
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,750
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,125
When you're sick you don't have
to worry about things like that.

106
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,291
Right now, the most important
thing is for you to get better.

107
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,458
[SATELLA] So, how is he?

108
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,666
[ROSETTE] He's asleep.

109
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,583
Azmaria and Steiner
are with him right now.

110
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,541
[SATELLA] Ah.

111
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,041
[ROSETTE sighs]

112
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,625
I don't think Chrono's
ever had a fever before.

113
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,500
I suspect that his
legion sense is activating.

114
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,416
[ROSETTE] Legion?

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,958
His body's constructed
like other devils, right?

116
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,541
[SATELLA] When they take damage,

117
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,208
a devil's legion power works to
restore their health rapidly.

118
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,458
[ROSETTE] Wah!

119
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,125
[SATELLA] Are you listening
to what I'm saying?!

120
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,833
[ROSETTE]
Listening...

121
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,458
Oh yeah, right.

122
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,916
We just need to bring
down his fever, right?

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,208
Okay, now we're
on the trolley!

124
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,416
Ha, ha, ha!

125
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,541
I'm gonna buy a fever reducer!

126
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,458
God, what a simple girl.

127
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,041
Miss Satella, did I just hear
Rosette go out the front door?

128
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,166
Well, yes.

129
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,833
You mean you let her
go all by herself?

130
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,083
Yeah, why not?

131
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,750
Uh? Ahh!

132
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,791
[SATELLA] Seriously, you don't
even know where the pharmacy is,

133
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,541
so why did you
run off like that?

134
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,333
I couldn't help myself.
I'm just impulsive.

135
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,958
Haven't you ever considered the
idea of thinking before you act?

136
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,500
And exactly how long
are you planning

137
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,500
to wear those filthy rags?

138
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,750
[ROSETTE] Ugh.

139
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,666
You're going to rot if
you don't change soon.

140
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,583
I don't need advice from you!

141
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,625
Ah! Sit down,
you're too close!

142
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,916
Heh. But you know, you're
a lot nicer than I thought.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,583
I wouldn't have expected
you to help me like this.

144
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,375
What are you talking about?

145
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,375
I only came with you to make
sure it gets done quickly!

146
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,916
All I want is for Chrono to
get well as soon as possible,

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,541
so you can all hurry up
and get out of my house!

148
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,125
[ROSETTE] Hah! You won't
have to say anything.

149
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,083
We'll be happy to leave.

150
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,958
[SATELLA] Well, here we are.

151
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,208
In here?

152
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,416
Yeah. They usually have
most medicines in stock.

153
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,458
[SHOPKEEPER] Take care!

154
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,500
[SHOPKEEPER] Are you looking
for something, miss?

155
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,250
Ah! Well, yes sir.

156
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,791
[SHOPKEEPER] And what
is it you're looking for?

157
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,500
Well, um...

158
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,666
[SHOPKEEPER] Please, tell me.

159
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,666
[ROSETTE laughs]

160
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,875
[SHOPKEEPER laughs]

[ROSETTE laughs]

162
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,458
[SHOPKEEPER laughs]

163
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,750
Ahh!

164
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,541
Hurry up and tell
him what you want!

165
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,916
Okay already.

166
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,583
Do you have a fever
reducer that would work...

167
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,416
...even on a devil?

168
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,208
I'm sorry, w-what
did you just say?

169
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,583
[SATELLA] Sorry to
have bothered you!

170
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,500
[SHOPKEEPER sighs]

171
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,625
[ROSETTE] O-Ow!
Let me go, you pill!

172
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,000
What kind of idiot would
say something like that?

173
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,000
What was I supposed to say?

174
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,083
There are lots of
other ways to say it.

175
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,208
By the way, this is
medicine for Chrono.

176
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,583
A normal store won't have it!

177
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,125
[SATELLA] Yeah, I've heard this
shop has a good reputation.

178
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,208
[ROSETTE] Hmm...

179
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,833
Hey, doesn't this store
look closed? It's dark.

180
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,791
Well, it's not
supposed to be.

181
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,333
It's open.

182
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,250
[SATELLA gasps]

183
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,583
[ROSETTE] Ah!
What's with this place?

184
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,625
[door creaks]

185
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,875
[gasps]

186
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,125
It won't open! It's locked!

187
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,166
Ah! Wait a second, why?

188
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,541
[ROSETTE and SATELLA scream]

189
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,750
[SHOPKEEPER B]
I'm sorry, ladies.

190
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,625
I certainly didn't
mean to scare you.

191
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,708
That would
scare anyone!

192
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,125
[SHOPKEEPER B]
Now, now, let's see,

193
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,291
a powerful fever reducer that
would work, even on a devil.

194
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,000
Was that right?

195
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,791
Choose whichever ones you like.

196
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,041
Uhh...

197
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,208
Do you have something that might
be a little easier to take?

198
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,208
[SHOPKEEPER B] Hm?
Easier to take, huh?

199
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,916
Then this would be
my recommendation.

200
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,000
Ahhh!

201
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,250
[ROSETTE] What was that?

202
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,250
There's absolutely no
way I'd give Chrono that.

203
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,041
Well that was
a waste of time.

204
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,583
Let's go home now.

205
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,208
Huh? Wait
just a second.

206
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,625
We haven't tried all of
the pharmacies yet, have we?

207
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,958
It makes no difference,
they're all the same.

208
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:30,750
[ROSETTE] Wait!

209
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,750
What are you doing?

210
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,916
They're not all the same!

211
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,875
Ach, I guess I understand.

212
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,791
Please, isn't there
something you can do?

213
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,125
[SHOPKEEPER laughs]

214
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,583
[ROSETTE sighs]

215
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,708
[SHOPKEEPER C] Beat it, kid!

216
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,791
[SATELLA] Just give up.

217
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,416
No matter where we go, no one
is going to take you seriously.

218
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,916
Besides, I don't think there
are any medicines for devils.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,416
Now magic maybe...

220
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,958
Magic?

221
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,958
[SATELLA] Wait a second,

222
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,833
what exactly are we doing
in a place like this?

223
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,416
[ROSETTE] I have an idea.

224
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,583
[SATELLA] Huh? Hey wait!

225
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,708
What are you doing
stopping all of a sudden?

226
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,875
[ROSETTE] Ha, ha!

227
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,875
Satella, I'm going
in here, okay?

228
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,250
Fortunes told?

229
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,000
[OLD WOMAN]
The reflection of your destiny

230
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,791
will be revealed to me,

231
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,083
and then I shall give you
the guidance that you desire.

232
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,750
So, shall I look?

233
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,833
You betcha!

234
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,666
And fast.

235
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,958
Ohh! Ohh!

236
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,416
[ROSETTE]
Granny? Um... Granny?

237
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,375
What are you seeing?

238
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,041
Oh, well the future is tricky

239
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,541
and sometimes it can
be difficult to see.

240
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,333
And by the way,
according to reflection,

241
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,958
there is an important ally
or close friend who is ill.

242
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,333
Is this so?

243
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,458
Yes.

244
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,625
His fever is causing
horrible nightmares.

245
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:08,291
Let me tell you a charm to
reduce his fever... no charge.

246
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:08,916
[ROSETTE] Huh?

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,166
[OLD WOMAN whispers]

248
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,458
Huh?!

249
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,666
Wait a second! Wait for me!

250
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:25,500
Ah, oh what an
unfortunate destiny.

251
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,708
[ROSETTE] We're here!

252
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,125
[AZMARIA gasps]

253
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,625
Welcome back!

254
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,958
So, has Chrono
gotten any better?

255
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,208
No, he's still asleep.

256
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,375
I see.

257
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,000
So um, did they
have any medicine?

258
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,833
Truly, it was
sheer madness.

259
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,291
She mercilessly dragged
me all over the place,

260
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,208
and she even made me go
with her to a fortune teller.

261
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,333
Now I'm exhausted,

262
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,583
and all we bought was
this normal cold medicine.

263
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,875
Oh, I see.

264
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,041
What did the fortune teller
say was in your future, Rosette?

265
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,291
[ROSETTE] Ack.

266
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,333
[SATELLA] A charm
for reducing fevers.

267
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,250
A charm?

268
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,916
Uh, I almost forgot, I have
to get our dinner ready!

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,791
[ROSETTE laughs]

270
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,791
[SATELLA] Hm?

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
My God, what is it
with you three, anyway?!

272
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,541
[SATELLA yells in German]

273
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,916
You're not going to
tell me that you have

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,541
a fever now, too, are you?

275
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,750
She feels hot!

276
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,916
Huh?

277
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,416
[SATELLA] Seriously...

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,208
It's unbelievable, what are
we going to do with you?

279
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,583
Wait on me hand and foot?

280
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,583
[ROSETTE sobs]

281
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,875
This isn't funny.

282
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,541
You're a meanie.

283
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,791
[SATELLA]
Hurry up and go to sleep.

284
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,750
[AZMARIA]
Rosette, are you all right?

285
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,958
[ROSETTE snores]

286
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,875
Huh? You're going to make it?

287
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:01,750
[AZMARIA] Yes, ma'am.

288
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,125
It's important for
me to do my part

289
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,500
to help Rosette and Chrono, too.

290
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,708
Oh Steiner?

291
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,208
[STEINER] Yes milady?

292
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,500
[AZMARIA] It's all right.
Please let me do it by myself.

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,875
[AZMARIA] All right.
This is my big chance!

294
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,875
[shattering sound]

295
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,875
Huh?

296
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,375
Are you all right, miss?

297
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,833
Ahh!

298
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

299
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't worry, at least
you weren't hurt.

300
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:28,875
[AZMARIA] Yes, ma'am.

301
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,916
[crashing sound]

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,333
[AZMARIA] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

303
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,791
[SATELLA] Are you sure
you're going to be all right?

304
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,833
[ROSETTE snores]

305
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,958
[AZMARIA] It's ready!

306
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,583
It's incredible, Azmaria!

307
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,375
I really hope
they like it!

308
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,000
Don't you worry! I'm sure
they will be delighted.

309
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,958
Let's take it to them,
before it gets cold!

310
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay.

311
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,666
[knocking]
[AZMARIA] Chrono?

312
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,625
[CHRONO] Huh?

313
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,666
So, are you feeling better?

314
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,583
[CHRONO] Azmaria?

315
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,000
Your fever hasn't
gone down yet.

316
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,458
It's important for you
to eat something,

317
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,583
so you can feel better.

318
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh wow, did you make
all this yourself, Azmaria?

319
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,166
I'm not sure if
you'll like it.

320
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,000
It's delicious.

321
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,166
Ah! Thank goodness!

322
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,166
Well, then please,
take your time eating it,

323
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,500
and I'll come back for
the dishes later, okay.

324
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,500
Thanks a lot, Azmaria.

325
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,583
Ah! Azmaria...

326
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,500
Uh-huh?

327
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,083
Where's Rosette?

328
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,958
Uh, well I... uh...

329
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,166
Huh?

330
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,333
[eats noisily]

331
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,583
Ha, ha, ha.

332
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,666
Slow down, you
mustn't eat so fast!

333
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,166
[CHRONO] What? A fever?!

334
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,000
But her appetite's
as healthy as ever.

335
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,041
That is our Rosette.

336
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,208
Yeah.

337
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,333
[ROSETTE] Ah!

338
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,583
Mm. That was delicious!

339
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,666
Are you sure
that you are sick?

340
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,916
Oh Satella,
how's Chrono doing?

341
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,541
I don't think his
fever is coming down.

342
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:33,000
Regular medicine doesn't
seem strong enough.

343
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,250
What's wrong?

344
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,250
[ROSETTE]
I'm just not myself.

345
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,875
[SATELLA] Hm?

346
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,666
I need him to
get better soon.

347
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,041
Could it be... you two...

348
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,083
It's just that it's
so hard to carry bags.

349
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:46,875
Huh?

350
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,000
[ROSETTE yawns]

351
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,166
I get so tired. This town
is straight up and down.

352
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,458
What is Chrono, your servant?

353
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,416
It's just that we can't
go looking for Joshua

354
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,791
until Chrono gets better,
what a bother.

355
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,333
[snoring]

356
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,708
[SATELLA sighs]

357
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,250
[SATELLA] Honestly,
she is such an appalling girl.

358
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sure she's
only acting that way

359
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,000
because she's
worried about Chrono.

360
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,208
[SATELLA] What?

361
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,458
I know you can't tell
by the way she acts,

362
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,125
and she'll never say it...

363
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,000
But it's true.

364
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:22,250
And of course Chrono's
always worrying about Rosette.

365
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,041
Even when they're apart,

366
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,416
they never stop
thinking about each other,

367
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,750
and that's wonderful.

368
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,791
Maybe that's the answer.

369
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,500
I believe the best
medicine for Chrono

370
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,833
would be if he had Rosette
sitting there with him,

371
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,166
right by his side.

372
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,333
[SATELLA] Wait! Azmaria!

373
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh no, not you too!

374
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,083
She is resting
now, milady.

375
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,125
So, then she was
just very tired.

376
00:18:59,208 --> 00:18:59,958
Mhmm.

377
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,333
Thank goodness,

378
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,416
I was worried that she'd
come down with a fever, too.

379
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,708
Yes, I was quite worried
about her as well.

380
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,458
[STEINER] Milady.

381
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,916
[SATELLA] Mhmm.

382
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,291
They are excellent
friends, are they not?

383
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,708
Well, they're not
exactly my friends.

384
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,625
It's turned out to be
a good day, hasn't it?

385
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,333
[STEINER] All that remains
now is for Mr. Chrono

386
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,500
to recover from his illness.

387
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,500
[door opens]

388
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,166
[STEINER] Hmm?

389
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,375
[door opens]

390
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,916
[door closes]

391
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, Rosette. I hope that
at least you're feeling better.

392
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,166
You should be thinking about
your own health, Chrono.

393
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:17,083
I'll be all right if I...
can just get... some rest.

394
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,583
I'm sorry, Rosette.

395
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,791
A charm to
reduce his fever.

396
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,500
[whispering]
Hey, Chrono.

397
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,458
[wind blows]

398
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,833
[CHRONO] Rosette.

399
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,458
Sorry I caused
so much trouble.

400
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,833
Chrono, why you!

401
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,500
[CHRONO] Ah!

402
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,125
How dare you make me
worry like that...

403
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,375
[AZMARIA] Well, it looks
like they feel better.

404
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,333
[ROSETTE] I didn't have any
idea what I was going to do.

405
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,375
Thank goodness!

406
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,333
[CHRONO yells]

407
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,041
[bell rings]

408
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,041
Who may I say is calling?

409
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,458
[DUFFAU] I seek the
one known as Chrono.

410
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,583
[SATELLA] I'm an art dealer,

411
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,750
so I encounter a
variety of customers.

412
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:26,083
However, I absolutely
refuse to serve a devil!

413
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,416
[ROSETTE] But he seems
harmless enough.

414
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,333
Let's at least hear
what he has to say.

415
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,500
[SATELLA]
Then do it elsewhere!

416
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,458
Remember, he's a devil,
not a person.

417
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,500
[STEINER] Milady, would
Darjeeling be an acceptable

418
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,500
choice for the tea?

419
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,125
[SATELLA] Water should
be quite adequate.

420
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,833
And keep him out of
the drawing room!

421
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,208
[ROSETTE]
Next episode, "Pursuer."

422
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:46,000
[SATELLA] Chrono, stop!
That's my prized Wedgwood china!
