00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,333
[CLAIRE] And the angel
said, "Fear not, Mary.

3
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,916
Thou shalt conceive in thy
womb, and bring forth a son.

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,166
And thou shalt call him
by the name of Jesus."

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,875
[AZMARIA] U-Um...

6
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,833
Um, Azmaria... your line.

00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,791
[AZMARIA]
"H-How shall this be...

8
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,000
...seeing I..."

9
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,333
[ANNA] Okay! Hold it!

10
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,333
Azmaria, I know
you're nervous,

11
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,458
but when you shout like that, it
makes it seem like you're angry!

12
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,625
I'm sorry, ma'am.

13
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,458
[ANNA] All right, one more time,
from Gabriel's part!

14
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,416
But... we wanted
to take a break!

15
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,833
Oh no you don't.

16
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,666
We're not stopping
until we can get it perfect!

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,916
So... you guys in the choir
will just have to suffer.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,875
Okay then...

19
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,291
[CLAIRE] U-Uh....

20
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,250
What is it now?!

21
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,208
I think we should
rest a bit as well.

22
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,291
[ANNA] We don't have
time to rest now!

23
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,416
[CLAIRE] Aww...

24
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,541
One more time, go!

25
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,250
[ROSETTE] Excuse me!

26
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,208
Um, hi. I wonder if
I could borrow Azmaria?

27
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,166
[AZMARIA] Huh?

28
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,083
[ANNA] Ahh! Take her already!

29
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,875
[ROSETTE] Look, don't worry
about the Nativity play

30
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,166
being the highlight of
the Christmas service.

31
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,958
Just do your best!

32
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,208
But... I don't know
if I can live up

33
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,166
to everyone's expectations.

34
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,500
[ROSETTE] Trust me, Azmaria,
you'll be just fine.

35
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,583
[AZMARIA] Ohh...

36
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,791
[REMINGTON] It would appear

37
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,250
that these pictures were
taken in San Francisco.

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,958
In San Francisco?

39
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,208
[REMINGTON] Yes.
The city where we've lost

40
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,750
three agents in the
last month alone.

41
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,250
All three of them were tracking
different leads on Aion.

42
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,583
Moreover, all the
disappearances follow

43
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,416
a similar pattern of
abduction and murder.

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,750
Based on the evidence,

45
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,583
we believe the devils
must be involved somehow.

46
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,750
[CHRONO] Something...

47
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,416
important's about to
happen on the west coast.

48
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Either that, or
it's already started.

49
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,291
[ROSETTE] Then send us!
Please Sister Kate.

50
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,125
Please Sister Rosette,
compose yourself.

51
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,958
That is the reason you
joined the militia isn't it?

52
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,125
Heh.

53
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,750
Then you mean it's
really all right for

54
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,708
Chrono and I to go
and look for Joshua?

55
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,083
Hm.

56
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,291
This is sure to
lead us to Aion.

57
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,250
This time we won't
let him get away.

58
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,041
We'll make sure to bring
back Joshua, no matter what!

59
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,041
Right!

60
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,166
We'll all do it together!

61
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, thanks Azmaria.

62
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,083
Do you think all these
dresses will fit?

63
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,333
There's three left.

64
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,416
It's all right,
we'll cram them in.

65
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,291
And Chrono's
carrying it anyway.

66
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,750
What? What did you just say?

67
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,291
[ROSETTE] You're going
to make a helpless girl

68
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,458
carry such a heavy suitcase?

69
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,458
[CHRONO] Well it's not like

70
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,875
we're going on a
holiday, Rosette.

71
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,541
Do you have to
pack everything?

72
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,375
And what are these?

73
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,333
More shoes?

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,416
Hey, Rosette?

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
[ROSETTE] Huh?

76
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,125
So you're really planning
on leaving us, huh?

77
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,333
What?! Since when
is she leaving?!

78
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,416
We'll miss you, Rosette,

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,458
but this is what you've
been hoping for for so long.

80
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,583
Huh? Is this for real?!

81
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,541
[REMINGTON] I understand your
desire to hurry, Rosette,

82
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,541
but please, won't you at least
stay with us until Christmas?

[AZMARIA] I'm back.

[AZMARIA] Um... I brought the
wine and bread for tomorrow,

95
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,750
just like you told me.

96
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,833
Well go and put it
in the kitchen.

You'll find your dinner
in there as usual.

Yes... ma'am.

99
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,458
Geez, how long do we
have to be burdened

100
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,208
with putting her up here?

101
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,833
[SON] Yeah, and when she sings,
lots of birds gather around her.

102
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,875
It gives me goose pimples.

know any Christmas Carols?

Oy, not even one?

No need to apologize.

There's plenty of

do is learn them!

make most of our money.

make quite a lot of it.

00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,125
[SATELLA] You couldn't
really mean that.

163
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,250
Don't tell me you still
believe in Santa Claus

164
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,666
at your age, liebchen?

165
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,000
No! I mean...

166
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
Why should I?

167
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,708
It's not as if Santa
ever visited me, anyway.

168
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,416
Are-Are you telling us
that you never got a present

169
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,208
from Santa Claus? Not once?

170
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,041
[AZMARIA] Uh-huh.

171
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,000
[CHRONO and ROSETTE]
Whoa...

172
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,333
Oh, but I was
always a bad girl,

173
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,958
so maybe that's the
reason he never came.

174
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,791
Child, don't say such things.

175
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,666
You're most certainly
not a bad girl at all.

176
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,916
Now that Sister Hothead
and her devil there

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
are a different story
entirely, of course.

178
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,666
What'd you say?

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,500
What? Do you have a
problem, Sister Hothead?

180
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,000
[CHRONO] Gah.

181
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,958
Let's not have a fight
in the street, shall we?

182
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,875
[AZMARIA] Goodness,
I have people

183
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,000
to give presents to this year.

184
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,500
[CLAIRE] A present?

185
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:09,541
Well, it really depends on
the person you're giving it to.

186
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,666
Here's what
you can get me:

187
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,333
a pair of new boots, a jaw harp,
and a silk handkerchief!

188
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,708
Could you not be so loud?

189
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,416
It's after
bedtime curfew.

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,666
Besides, no one said a word

191
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,041
about getting you
anything, Mary.

192
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,708
[MARY] Well pbbth.

193
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,291
This is for Rosette, isn't it?

194
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,583
Uh-huh.

195
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,750
And I need one
for Chrono, too.

196
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,750
I'll tell you a trick
that works great!

197
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,625
Just give everyone you know
things you want to use yourself.

198
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,666
Actually, it might be better

199
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,583
to forget about gift
giving strategies,

200
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,000
and just go out window shopping.

201
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,833
That's right, you might
just come across

202
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,791
something that's
the perfect present.

203
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,875
Okay, good idea!

204
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,500
Oh, but I've got to
find something nice.

205
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,083
Let's see...

206
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,916
I'm going shopping for
costumes for the play tomorrow.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,666
I'll look for presents
while I'm out.

208
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,750
[CHRONO] So, what do you think?

209
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,750
[ROSETTE] Huh?

210
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,083
Wouldn't it be better
to make them a bit bigger?

211
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,041
You've got to make
them so that people

212
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,791
know you're a reindeer,
the minute they see you!

213
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,583
[CHRONO] Uh.

214
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,833
Are you nuts?
They'd fall off like that!

215
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,208
If only your horns
weren't broken...

216
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,416
then we could just glue
the antlers to them.

217
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Uhh! I wonder if
it's jake for a devil

218
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,750
to be celebrating Christmas
in the first place.

219
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,583
It's jake.

220
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,708
[ROSETTE] Sad people.

221
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,583
People in pain.

222
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,583
For adults and for children.

223
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,416
To everyone it's the same.

224
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,666
No matter who they are,
they can all become happy.

225
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,708
That is the magic
of Christmas.

226
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,666
[CHRONO] It's a good thing
we decided to stay, isn't it?

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500
We're going to
have a Christmas

228
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,750
that will kindle memories
in Azmaria's heart.

229
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,833
[ELDER] True, true.

230
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,625
Just as my eyes are
having sweet memories

231
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,083
burned into them, my dear.

232
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,416
[ROSETTE] Huh?

233
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,958
[ELDER] And may the new year
bring me many more!

234
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,791
Aaahhh!

235
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,208
[ELDER yells frantically]

236
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,083
[door opens / bells chime]

237
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,125
[AZMARIA] Uh?

238
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,041
Something caught
your fancy, my dear?

239
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,625
[SHOPKEEPER chuckles]

240
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,083
Here, look close.

241
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,666
[AZMARIA] Oh.

242
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,125
It's beautiful.

243
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,833
But would this be a
strange Christmas present

244
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:00,750
to give someone?

245
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,916
[SHOPKEEPER] Well,
who are you giving it to?

246
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,875
[AZMARIA] Oh, um...

247
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,833
Someone who's like
an older sister to me.

248
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,958
Oh, something like this
would make a girl very happy.

249
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,583
Oh, um, I'm sorry, sir,

250
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,208
but I don't have
any money right now.

251
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,958
Not to worry, my dear.
Take it with you.

252
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,958
Oh, no, sir!
I can't take it!

253
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,250
I'll bring you the
money on Christmas Eve!

254
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,250
Well I'll just hold
it for you then.

255
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,916
You will remember, right? Hm?

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,916
Yes, absolutely!

00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:58,291
[bells ring]

258
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,708
[CLAIRE] The Holy Ghost
shall come upon thee,

259
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,083
and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee.

"For with the Lord,

nothing shall
be impossible."

My soul doth
magnify the Lord.

and my spirit hath
rejoiced in God my savior.

[MARY] You were
the cat's pajamas!

267
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,291
That was
wonderful!

268
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,125
That's right, Azmaria,
you did just fine.

269
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,875
[AZMARIA] Thank you very much.

[gasps]

272
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,416
I said I would hold
something for you, didn't I?

273
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,916
I was worried you'd forget.

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,708
[SHOPKEEPER] Not to worry,
it's right here.

275
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,541
Ah.

[YOUNG MAN]
Um... excuse me, sir.

277
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,625
You didn't sell
the snow globe

278
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,625
that was in the front
window, did you?

279
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,958
[SHOPKEEPER]
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

280
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,166
[YOUNG MAN] I see.
So it's been sold.

281
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,208
I wish that you'd
said something sooner.

282
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,000
I could have ordered
another one for you.

283
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,000
But now...

284
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,333
[YOUNG MAN] Ugh...
I'm such a rube.

285
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,958
I already promised
my girlfriend, too.

286
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,375
Sorry. Excuse me.

[bells chime / door closes]

Don't worry
yourself, my dear.

289
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,833
But...

290
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,416
[AZMARIA] Yoohoo, sir!

291
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,125
Please wait!

292
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,375
Hm?

293
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,625
[YOUNG MAN] Gosh! With this
I can get my girlfriend

294
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,625
the perfect Christmas present!

295
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,541
Thank you so very much!

00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,875
Merry Christmas!

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,708
[SHOPKEEPER] Is this
what you want, my child?

298
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,958
Yes, for some reason,
I just wanted to help him.

299
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,333
He'd made a promise,
and I hadn't after all.

300
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,291
In that case, go and choose
something in its place.

301
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,958
I'll give you a big
discount on it.

[bells chime]

307
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,166
Oh yeah, those are
all of the presents

308
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,583
that everyone at the Order's
gathered and gift wrapped.

309
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,583
It's something
we do every year.

310
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,833
We deliver these presents

311

to show people the true
spirit of Christmas.

312

That's our job each year!

The spirit of Christmas?

all been good this year?

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,166
[BOY A] So hurry up and
give us our presents!

322
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,875
Huh?

323
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,208
And here you are,
Merry Christmas!

324
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,125
[children chatter]

325
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:49,958
[bells chime]

326
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,083
[ROSETTE] So, somebody had
presents for us, didn't they?

327
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,083
Uh...

328
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,458
Well I just want you
to know I love it!

329
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,958
The same here!
Thank you so much Azmaria.

330
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,291
This has been the most
wonderful Christmas ever.

331
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,541
Hey, what are you
talking about?

332
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,375
The main event
is still to come.

333
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,458
Huh?

334
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:20,375
Merry Christmas, Azmaria!

335
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,625
[ANNA] Now, now, don't just
stand there like a statue.

336
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,000
That's right, don't tarry.

337
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,000
Dun-dun-dun!

338
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,291
And to a young girl,
who until now

339
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,208
has never experienced
the blessings of Christmas...

340
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:48,083
May we humbly present this
small celebration in your honor.

341
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,166
We'll be praying for you,

342
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,041
in hope that your future
will always be bright.

343
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,541
[ELDER] Now behold
my new invention...

344
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:16,333
...the electromatic
Christmas tree!

345
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,250
[CROWD] Oh, wow!

346
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,333
[CHRONO]
Merry Christmas, Azmaria.

347
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,833
[ROSETTE] So tell me kid,

348
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,166
what do you think of your
first real Christmas?

349
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,041
[AZMARIA] Well, I... I just...

350
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,208
[AZMARIA weeps]

351
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,375
Huh? What's wrong Azmaria?!

352
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:40,208
[AZMARIA] I'm sorry! I'm just
feeling so happy right now.

353
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,625
It's more than I deserve.

354
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,000
I have a power,
other people don't,

355
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,708
and people have hated
me for that... always.

356
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:57,541
I'm not worthy of something
so... so... wonderful.

357
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,083
Oh, Azmaria.

358
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,375
[CHRONO] Everyone wanted to do

359
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,666
something special
for you, Azmaria.

360
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,375
And then, before we knew it,
it turned into this big party.

361
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,375
It's because you're
a good person.

362
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,666
Something which you're
not, ya big pervert.

363
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,291
[CROWD laughs]

364
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,791
Thank you. Thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

365
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you so very much!

366
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,333
[chattering]

367
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,666
[AZMARIA] Wah!

368
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,333
Hmm?

369
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,208
[KATE] Oh!

370
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,875
[thud]

371
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,500
[CHRONO] "This idol
of an African deity

372
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,333
is a charm against evil.

373
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,333
Since you're often
targeted by evil doers,

374
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,208
I thought you could use all
the protection you can get.

375
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,958
Signed: Satella."

376
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,166
The nerve of her!

377
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,166
It's really scary!

378
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,666
I'd throw that
thing away, quickly.

379
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,041
I'm feeling...
cursed.

380
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,333
Chrono, can a devil
even be cursed?

381
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,625
Ahhh!

382
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,000
[ROSETTE] Just look at her.

383
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,041
It's been a long time since
we've seen her smile like that.

384
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,250
[CHRONO] It sure has.

385
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:26,250
It would be nice if
next year Joshua was here.

386
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,708
[CHRONO] Mmm.

387
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,166
Merry Christmas, Chrono.

388
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,291
Well, in that case...

389
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,250
[CHRONO laughs]

390
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,000
[ROSETTE chuckles]

391
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,500
[ROSETTE] Thank you, Chrono.

392
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,791
[JOSHUA] Big sister, listen!

393
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,833
They said that Rizel is
going to bring my big sister

394
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,166
here from New York!

395
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,291
[FIORE] That's wonderful,
Lord Joshua.

396
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,541
[JOSHUA] When my
big sister arrives,

397
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,791
I'll introduce you, Big Sister.

398
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,708
Wait, my big sister is coming,
but my big sister is here?

399
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,375
There are two big sisters?

400
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,375
[FIORE] Please calm down,
Lord Joshua.

401
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,916
[JOSHUA] I see! Big Sister,
you split in two!

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,916
[FIORE] Next episode,
"Older Sister."

403
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,583
[JOSHUA] I wonder if there
are two Chronos as well...
