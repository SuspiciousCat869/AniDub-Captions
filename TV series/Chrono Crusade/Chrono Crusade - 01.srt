You get it, Chrono...

00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,625
Are you sure, Rossette?

9
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,541
You know how Sister Kate
feels about me.

10
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,541
[ROSETTE] Mmmph!

11
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,916
Oh, rats!
Sorry, Chrono.

12
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,458
[CHRONO] Heh! It's Jake.

Phew.

14
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,125
Hello, this is
Sister Rosette!

15
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,666
[KATE] Too slow!

16
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,791
Go to the East Side immediately!
It's an emergency!

17
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,666
[ROSETTE] Right.
So what's the situation?

18
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,416
[KATE] The report says
that restaurant patrons

19
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,541
have been taken hostage.

20
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,375
It may be a failed summoning.

21
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,208
[ROSETTE] But what about the
other sisters or the militia?

22
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,291
[KATE] They're all currently
working other cases.

23
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,083
You're the one
closest to the scene,

24
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,125
so be prepared to
take immediate action!

25
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,500
[ROSETTE] What?!

26
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,041
But I just finished my last
mission a few hours ago!

27
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,458
I can't handle two in one night!

28
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,458
[KATE] Our order exists
to serve Sister Rossette!

00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,250
There can be no rest for the
weary until the job's done!

30
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,250
Say... Why do you suppose Sister
Kate's always such a pill to me?

31
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,125
Heh. Could it be because
you're always doing things

32
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,125
that make her angry?

33
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,041

00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,083
[ROSETTE] Shh! Quit beating
your gums Chrono and help me...

41
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,416
Open this...

42
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,416

[ROSETTE] Aaaaaa!

Oh, good I'm glad to see
everyone is here already.

50
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,375
Um... yes...
but who are you?

51
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,875
Sister Rosette Christopher,
Order of Magdalene,

52
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,625
at your service.

53
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,291
The wet blanket's
my assistant Chrono.

54
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,333
And that, is a warrant
from a federal judge.

55
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,000
The Order of Magdalene...?

56
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:18,875
[ROSETTE] Ready, Chrono?

57
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,250
Right!

58
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,666
So... As of right now,

59
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,333
we'll be taking over
jurisdiction of this case.

60
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,125
Just leave
everything to us, sir.

61
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:33,333
Ah... I see... so the two of you
are some kind of exorcists then?

62
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,041
[ROSETTE laughs]

63
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,708
Yep, we're the good guys!

just who are those young people?

Monster exterminators.

[POLICEMAN] Monster
exterminators?!

68
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,500
I'd heard about a secret
organization the brass call in

69
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,666
to handle poltergeists
and demons...

70
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,583
but I never thought
they'd be so young...

71
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,458
So what are you feeling?

72
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,375
I sense a great hunger
that's been fed...

73
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,750
I'm afraid the hostages
are... well...

It's the bum's rush then!

We had hoped that this
time the destruction

would be kept to a minimum,
Sister Rosette,

120

and yet somehow...

121
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,625
Somehow, no matter what, you
always surpass our expectations.

122
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,458
Well I'm honored to
accept your praise, Ma'am.

123
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,708
I wasn't praising you!

124
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,375
Even the New York City Police

125
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,666
are lodging complaints
about you now!

126
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,791
Honestly, Sister Rosette,
can't you do better?

127
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,500
[ROSETTE] I'm sorry Sister Kate.

128
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,166
Rosette, could your "assistant"
be part of the problem?

129
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,875
[ROSETTE] Huh?

130
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,000
If one who lives in darkness

131
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,583
should call out to
that darkness...

132
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,583
Chrono had nothing
to do with this!

133
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,125
It's just that I...
wasn't strong enough!

134
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,583
I'll submit a written apology,
okay? Excuse me.

135
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,208
W-Wait! Come back
Sister Rosette! Please!

136
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,208
[ROSETTE] Hmm?

137
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,666
Ah... Sister Rosette.

139
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,791
When... did you
get back, sir?

140
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,000
Just now actually.

141
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,333
But I could hear you from
out in the vestibule...

142
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,958
More apologies is it?

143
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,083
[ROSETTE giggles]

144
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,625
I'm hitting on all sixes.

00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,166
Father, please!

146
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,333
The last thing that girl
needs is coddling!

147
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,791
And as for you Rosette,
we're not finished talking yet!

148
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,875
I'm concerned
about that Devil's--

149
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,416
Perhaps you're are,

150
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,833
but I've got lots of written
apologies to write so goodbye!

[KATE sighs]

154
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,583
You're the only one that
girl is truly open with.

155
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,666
What is your report, Father?

156
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,583
I'm afraid that... this news
will not be very pleasant...

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,750
Hi, Chrono!

158
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,833
[CHRONO] Eep!

159
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,041
Is Rosette writing
more apologies?

160
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,666
Still I guess
that's what happens

161
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,250
when a Servant of God
destroys a whole building...

162
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,250
No, it was the whole block!

163
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,083
Huh? Really?!

164
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,375
Actually... I'd heard
it was a whole island?

165
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,333
Whaaaaa?! Really?!

166
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,291
It must be so hard.

167
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,541
[CHRONO sighs]

168
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,291
[CHRONO] Well, it happens
every time, so...

169
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,791
[ROSETTE] It happens
every time...?!

170
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,791
[MARY, ANNA, CLAIRE]
Aaah! Rosette!

171
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,833
A whole block was it...?

172
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,291
An island...?

173
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,625
Blowing someone's mistakes
out of proportion

174
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,291
is so much fun, isn't it?

175
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,833
But were you there?
Huh?! Huh? Huh?

176
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,875
[ANNA] We definitely don't
want to be teamed up with you!

177
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:21,916
[MARY, CLAIRE] Uh huh!

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,666
[ROSETTE] Go chase yourselves,
why don't you?!

179
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,958
Aaaaw! Applesauce!

180
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,333
[CHRONO] Rosette! Wait!

181
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,125
[KATE] I feel a great
unease, Father.

182
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,916
[REMINGTON] About him you mean?

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,958
No matter how docile that
creature may appear now,

184
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,541
it's still...

185
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:45,375
[REMINGTON] Yet, does a heart
not beat in his chest as well?

186
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,666
There are things one cannot
trust on faith alone.

187
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,625
But isn't faith the process
of affirming truths

188
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,875
that one cannot see?

189
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,125
Might it be that these
uncertain times are meant

190
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,375
to test our faith, Sister?

191
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,000
So the war could
be the cause then?

192
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,833
A cause, but not the only one.

193
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,458
Others will reveal
themselves soon enough...

194
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,166
'Til then, all we
can do is wait.

195
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,541
And as to what will
become of Chrono then...

196
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,833
I cannot even imagine...

197
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,958
[ROSETTE eats noisily]

198
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,208
[ROSETTE] Hmph! The nerve
of those Dumb Doras!

199
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,166
"We don't want to
team up with you!!"

200
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,708
I'm the one who'd
turn them down!

201
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,583
Gurp!

202
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,541

[slurping]

205
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:40,625
Hey, that holy water
burned your hand...

206
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,708
Yeah, but it helped us
defeat that thing.

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,750
Thank you.

208
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,208
[CHRONO] Hmm?

209
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,375
[CHRONO] Well,
we are... you know...

210
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,916
[ROSETTE] Oh...

211
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,708
I was having...
a dream...

212
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,458
before we went to
East Side... yesterday.

213
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,750
[CHRONO] Hm?

214
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,291
[ROSETTE] In my dream,

215
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,875
Joshua was still the way
I remember him.

216
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,583
Even though I know that...

217
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,416
for me to dream about him...

218
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,916
[CHRONO] This isn't like you...

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,833
[ROSETTE] Huh?

220
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,791
Rosette never
gets discouraged.

221
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,833
[ROSETTE laughs]

222
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,875
Thanks Chrono... for worrying.

223
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,958
Hmm?

224
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,458
[CHRONO] Hmm?

225
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,875
Hee hee! I see Paris. I see
France. I see someone's...!

226
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,291
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

227
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,041
And today's pair is almost
as white as the French flag!

228
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,458
[ROSETTE] You perverted old man!
I'll kill you with this spoon!

229
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,958
Ah, and how are
you today my boy?

230
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,000
[CHRONO] Uh, well...

231
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,666
Stop ignoring me! Huh?

232
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,083
Huh... What's this?

233
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,250
[ELDER] Oh, just
a little something

234
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,000
I finished this morning.

235
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,125
I call it the "Gospel."

236
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:11,958
Gospel?

237
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,041
[ELDER] Yes, a new
mystical bullet

238
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,000
composed of rare
alchemical silver with

239
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,458
ancient Enochian transcriptions
in microscopic text!

240
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,708
As such its destructive power is
much greater than the Sacred's,

241
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,708
which merely has holy oil
packed inside its explosive.

242
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
It's still in the
testing phase of course,

243
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,583
but I was going to ask the
Order's number one markswoman

244
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,500
to test fire it
for me... until...

245
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,125
Yes! Yes!
I wanna! I wanna!

246
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,500
You know this is the sort of
thing I looooooooove... Ack!

247
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,958
Having heard her call
the Saint responsible

248
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,083
for our Holy ammo
an old pervert,

249
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,083
perhaps I should
rethink this matter.

250
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,791
Hearing things,
you were hearing things.

251
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,041
Don't be mean.
Just let me try it. Come on!

252
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,125
Well, let me fondle
your luscious breasts

253
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,500

[SISTER A] Sister Rosette?

255
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,875
[ROSETTE] Who would let
you fondle anything?!

256
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,791
[SISTER A] Sister Kate
is calling for you.

Come to her office at once.

marching orders!

will have to wait...

00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,083
this time you didn't wreck the

a Mrs. Grundy and dry up!

[COMMANDER] Are you the ones
from the Magdalene Order?

269
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,833
I'm afraid that I'd hoped that
there'd be more than two of you.

270
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,166
I'm sorry but due to an
occurrence in Boston,

271
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,958
we've had to
split our forces.

272
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,416
However, as I work with
the effort of ten men

273
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,625
I assure you
things will be fine!

00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,708
Um... well I guess we have
no choice but to believe that.

00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,666
Good, 'cause only those
who believe will be saved.

00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,291
[gun clicks]

323
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,166
[ROSETTE] Eh? Eh!

324
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,708
Chrono!
I'll unleash the seal!

325
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:15,000
[CHRONO] You can't! This power
will summon forth more violence!

326
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,291
A Gospel!

327
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,000
[CHRONO]
Please don't tell the Elder!

328
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,208
Ahhhh!

329
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,250
[ROSETTE] A-Aaaaa!

330
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,708
[ROSETTE] Bring peace
to the lost lambs!

331
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,833
I bid thee give rest
to the fangs of the wolf!

332
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,958
And call a hammer
of death unto the devil!

333
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:08,041
Can wisdom... ever
truly overcome violence?

334
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,291
[CHRONO] Is that it's true form?

335
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,208
It was stolen.

336
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,416
Taken from
its home...

337
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,833
Even so that's no reason
to hurt so many people...

338
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,833
Aaa! Oh no!

339
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,791
Huh?

340
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,750
[ROSETTE] Waugh! Huh?

341
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,208
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!

342
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,083
Chrono! Do you realize
what you've done?

343
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,041
[CHRONO] Well, the boat wasn't
responding to the helm,

344
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,875
and the engine was all
balled up so what could I do?

345
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,875
[ROSETTE AND CHRONO] Waugh!

346
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,458
[ROSETTE] I'm not the bad one!

347
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:47,583
Why is it always, always,
always like this?!

348
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,583
[ROSETTE] Chrono!
What'll I do? What'll I do?

349
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,541
[CHRONO] Oh great,
what did you destroy this time?

350
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,708
[ROSETTE] Nothing! But I lost
something very important!

351
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,125
[CHRONO] What do you mean,
"something very important"?

352
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,416
[ROSETTE] When a girl talks
about something very important,

353
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,250
isn't it obviously
what she means?

354
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,625
[CHRONO] Wha...? You couldn't
possibly mean that, could you?

355
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,791
[ROSETTE] Why are
you turning red?

356
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,916
Oh! You nasty devil!

357
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,125
[CHRONO] Next episode,
"Contractor."

358
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:47,041
[ROSETTE] Oh Lord, please
save these lost lambs!
