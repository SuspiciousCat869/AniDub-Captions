2
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,833
[CHRONO] Depressing, isn't it?

3
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,750
No! Given that we were
up all night on a mission,

4
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,875
and then they made us go
shopping on our way home,

5
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,208
I'd call it more
than depressing.

6
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,833
I'd call it the
absolute worst!

7
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,208
Look,
more lightning.

8
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,833
I'm sorry. I said I
could do it by myself,

9
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,458
but I don't think I--Ah!

10
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,458
[CHRONO] Huh?

11
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,041
Just what are
you talking about?

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,958
It was obvious to all of us that
you couldn't do it on your own!

13
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,000
[AZMARIA] But--
[phone rings]

14
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,750
Oh, the phone!

15
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,250
Are you all right, Azmaria?

16
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,166
Yeah. I'm jake.

17
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,333
[ROSETTE] Ugh.
You just stay put.

18
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,541
Answer the phone, Chrono!

19
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,083
Huh? Who me?

20
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,416
[ROSETTE]
Can't you tell I'm busy?

21
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,708
Someone's gotta drive!

22
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,250
[CHRONO sighs]

23
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,375
[CHRONO] Hello?
Oh, Father Remington.

24
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,916
Well, Rosette can't answer the--

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,208
Oh, hello, Father,
this is Rosette.

26
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,833
Is there something
I can help you with?

27
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,250
Oh, boy.

28
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,708
Should she do that
while driving?

29
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,541
Right! Yes!

30
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,833
All right, see ya later!

31
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,708
Oh, today I'm the super luckiest
girl in the whole wide world!

32
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,833
What happened?

33
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,666
Mr. Remington just
asked me to pick him up

34
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,750
at Grand Central Station.

35
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,125
[CHRONO] What?
Right now?!

36
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,708
For him to have
chosen me personally...

37
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,291
Does this mean he's
finally recognized

38
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,416
the irresistable appeal
of my beauty?

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,583
Uh, more like--

40
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,791
Now that that's settled,
it's Oldfield time!

41
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,375
[AZMARIA screams]

42
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,500
[CHRONO] But there's no room in
the car with all these packages!

43
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,166
[ROSETTE] That's why we're
going back to the convent

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,416
to unload first!

45
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,416
Although, if I dumped you here,
that would work, too.

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,125
[CHRONO] W-Wait a second!

47
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,250
Satisfied?

48
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,083
[REMINGTON] This has
become... bothersome.

49
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,416
[REMINGTON] Where in
the world could he be?

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,583
Surely he knows that being
on time is part of the mission.

51
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,541
[CHILD ] Mama!
Can I have a snack?

52
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,250
[MOTHER ] Just be patient, dear.

53
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,416
Grandma is at home,

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,833
baking a delicious
chocolate cake for us to eat.

55
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:42,250
[CHILD] But I've already
been patient for so long!

56
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,000
[MAN] He's not going to come.

57
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,791
You were supposed to
receive this, yes?

58
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,041
Who are you?

59
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,166
[MAN] A servant,
you might say...

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,541
for the ones you're
investigating.

61
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,291
[REMINGTON]
What happened to my agent?

62
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,916
[MAN] Oh, you should be
very pleased with him.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,583
He poked and sniffed around,
just as you ordered him to do.

64
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,666
[REMINGTON] Where is he now?

65
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,250
--I ate him.
--[REMINGTON] Huh?

66
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,583
[MAN chuckles]

67
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,750
There's not even a single
scrap of him left over.

68
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,458
Thanks for the snack.

69
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,583
[MAN] Uh...

70
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,333
[REMINGTON] Huh?

71
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:25,541
[laughter]

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,208
[RIZEL] I'm here...

73
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:34,916
And here... And here...

74
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:42,166
This is because
you're so dangerous.

75
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,875
So they're all hostages?

76
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,250
Yes, now hand over
that nasty little toy

77
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,208
you have in your hands.

78
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,833
Let's do business, shall we?

79
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,125
[CHRONO] I think I'm
gonna bite my tongue.

80
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,166
[ROSETTE] Come on, come on!

81
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,541
Let's hurry and
unload this stuff.

82
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,541
[AZMARIA] Okay!

83
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,333
[AZMARIA yells]

84
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,416
Are you all right, Azmaria?

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,458
[AZMARIA] I-I fell down.

86
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,750
Want me to carry it?

87
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,375
No! I can handle
carrying this much.

88
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,125
Ha, ha, ha!
Maybe I should...

89
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,375
I can do it myself!

90
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,458
I don't care
who can do it!

91
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,708
Just hurry up and get
these groceries unloaded!

92
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,458
How could you say
something... so...

93
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,041
I just want to
help everyone.

94
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, uh, you don't
have to cry over that.

95
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,083
Just do your best
to carry them,

96
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,166
and that'll be fine
with me, Azmaria.

97
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,375
[AZMARIA] Okay! Hnngh...!

98
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,375
[CHRONO sighs]

99
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,375
[ROSETTE sighs]

100
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,541
[ROSETTE] Whew!
That's the last of it!

101
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,500
Can you handle it
from here, Azmaria?

102
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,208
[AZMARIA] Yes!
Please leave it to me!

103
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,375
Oh, welcome back.

104
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,666
I didn't expect you
to get done so fast.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,416
Well, something really darb
came up, so I had to hurry.

106
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,041
[ANNA] Ah!

107
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,291
[ROSETTE] What's wrong?

108
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,250
[ANNA] Would you look at this?!

109
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,375
The wheat is completely
soaked with water!

110
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,166
We can't use
something like this!

111
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,541
[ROSETTE sighs]

112
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,541
Oh, stop kvetching.
I'll bet half the bag is usable.

113
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,416
Oh, this is all because
I fell down earlier, and--

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,958
Your stomach got upset because

115
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,083
Rosette was driving
too fast, right?

116
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,416
Now hold on, Chrono!

117
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you saying
this is my fault?

118
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,250
Well, in a way...

119
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,541
What? Reckless driving again?!

120
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,958
You have got to
be more responsible

121
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,375
and learn how to drive
a car properly, Rosette!

122
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,291
Chrono and Azmaria won't be able
to take much more of this...

123
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,666
That's right.
Why just the other day,

124
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,375
I heard Rosette got distracted
by a fruit cart while driving

125
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,416
and almost collided
with another car!

126
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
What? I heard she
ran into the cart!

127
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,500
No, no, she tried
to avoid the cart

128
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,833
and crashed into the bakery
across the street instead,

129
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,875
and both the shop
and car caught fire.

130
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,541
Ahh?!

131
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,250
We can't even ask
Rosette to go shopping.

132
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,458
[ROSETTE] Is that all
you can say to someone

133
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:57,541
who took the time to go
shopping in the pouring rain?!

134
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,333
[CHRONO] Rosette,
calm down already!

135
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
Weren't you in a big
hurry to go someplace?

136
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, that's right!

137
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,375
Fortunately for you,
I don't have time for this.

138
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,333
Gotta blow!

139
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,583
Count your blessings.

140
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,125
[CHRONO sighs]

141
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,625
Hold on. Was she even listening
to anything we were saying?

142
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,458
So where's Rosette going

143
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,750
that she has to be
in such a big hurry?

144
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,333
She's on her way
to the train station

145
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,583
to pick up Father Remington.

146
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,541
--[MARY and ANNA] Huh?
--[CLAIRE] How strange.

147
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,750
I could have sworn
Father Remington

148
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,541
went out in a car earlier.

149
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,083
[CHRONO and AZMARIA] Huh?

150
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,916
[tires screech]

151
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:47,833
Whew. Good, I made it.

152
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,708
Ha!

153
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,208
[lightning strikes]

154
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,708
It's almost time for
the princess to arrive.

155
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,250
[REMINGTON] Before that happens,

156
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
let me ask something
about all of you.

157
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,750
Just what would
you need to ask?

158
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,625
Are you working for Aion?

159
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:07,541
[laughter]

160
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,791
What are you planning
to do with Rosette?

161
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,583
[MAN] Not a thing. I'm afraid
I'm just a taxi service.

162
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,375
A certain person needs
to see her, you see.

163
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,250
A certain...

164
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,125
[lightning strikes]

165
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,791
[FIORE] Lord Joshua...

166
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,875
If you stay in this wind too
long, it will do your body harm.

167
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,750
It'll be all right, sister.

168
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,708
[gasps]

169
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,583
[JOSHUA] The warmth
of your hand...

170
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:02,541
When I hold it like this,
I remember those days...

171
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,416
Those sweet days...

172
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,250
[lightning strikes]

173
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,583
[REMINGTON] That was close.

174
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,000
Given these
weather conditions,

175
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,208
the roads are
probably impassable.

176
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,333
I wouldn't be surprised if
Rosette gave up and went home.

177
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,083
[MAN] Still hoping for a chance?

178
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,041
No, you couldn't
have any hope left.

179
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,416
Blame it on paternal concern.

180
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,416
For the four years since I
brought her into the Order,

181
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,833
and even before that, actually,

182
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,791
I thought of myself as
that girl's guardian.

183
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,208
As such, I have a
duty to protect her.

184
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,708
That's why...

185
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,333
...I just can't hand
her over without a fight.

186
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,166
[REMINGTON] Above me.

187
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,500
Ah! There you are!
I finally made it, sir!

188
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,541
I'll bet you're glad
I'm here to get you!

189
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,291
[doors creak]

190
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,791
[ROSETTE] Huh?

191
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,666
Nice to meet you,
Sister Rosette.

192
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,375
By coincidence, we have
also come to get you.

193
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,791
Lord Joshua is
waiting, Sister.

194
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,208
Joshua?!

195
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,708
What's going on?

196
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,791
And just what do you mean,
"Joshua is waiting for me"?

197
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,000
Tell me!

198
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,125
Say something!

199
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,583
What are you--?

200
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,583
--[ROSETTE gasps]
--[REMINGTON] Look up!

201
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,333
Second skylight, east side.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,208
[gun cocks]

203
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,208
Rosette.

204
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
[ROSETTE] What in the
blazes is going on here?

205
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,541
And what did they
just say about Joshua?

206
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,916
Later, not now.

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,083
[RIZEL] My, what an
appalling older sister.

208
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,916
What would Lord Joshua
say if he saw you now?

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,041
[ROSETTE] Who are you?!

210
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:23,666
[RIZEL] Moi? A puppet master,
Sister Rosette.

211
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,416
A puppet master?

212
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,375
Does that mean that
all these people are...

213
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,375
Yes, but it's
not permanent.

214
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,875
They're merely
under a spell.

215
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,875
[RIZEL] Which makes them
helpless marionettes.

216
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,750
And if I desire...

217
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,333
Do you understand, Sister?

218
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,000
[MOTHER] Sister, please save me.

219
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,916
[MAN] Yes, merciful sister.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,708
[CHILD] I'm scared, Mama.

221
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,708
[RIZEL laughs]

222
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,041
[RIZEL] Tell me,
oh holy warriors,

223
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,166
will you just stand
back and watch

224
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,875
as these poor unfortunate
lambs are led to the slaughter?

225
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,833
Will you?

226
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,375
What do you want?!

227
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,375
[RIZEL]
Heh. Your soul is the key...

228
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,416
Obey without question,

229
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,375
and their lives will
be spared, Sister.

230
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,041
Don't listen,
Rosette!

231
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,583
[CHILD] The train will
be arriving here soon.

232
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,583
If you get on board, you
can go see Lord Joshua.

233
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,458
This is all Aion's trap!

234
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,750
[whispered]
Aion!

235
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,375
[CHILD] No, this is
Lord Joshua's desire.

236
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,041
He wants to see
his older sister.

237
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,916
Please hurry to see him.

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,291
Lord Joshua is waiting.

239
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,000
He looks like he's
in so much pain,

240
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,875
so much he can't even eat.

241
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,958
[whispered] Joshua...

242
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,958
[coughing]

243
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,041
Where is he?!

244
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,000
Where's Joshua?!

245
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,416
Is it true that
he's suffering?

246
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,375
[crowd laughs]

247
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,750
Stop it! Let me
see my brother!

248
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,416
Rosette, calm d--!

249
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,833
Father Remington!

250
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,166
Lord Joshua wishes
to see you alone.

251
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,083
So the good minister
will wait for you here.

252
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,375
Cease this foolish resistance,
and we'll escort you there.

253
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,500
[GUARD B] You are the
only one who can save

254
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,333
Lord Joshua
from his suffering.

255
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,750
Rosette!

256
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,125
[RIZEL laughs]

257
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,375
I'm sorry, Father Remington.

258
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:38,875
[AZMARIA] Ahh!

259
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,666
W-What happened?

260
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,458
I broke some
of the china!

261
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,541
Do you realize you just broke
one of Sister Kate's teacups?

262
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,500
Aw!

263
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:53,958
But why would the
handle just come off?

264
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,375
[KATE] Hello, this is
the Magdalene Order.

265
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,416
W-What was that?

266
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,083
Shots being fired at
Grand Central Station?

267
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,875
Yes, I understand.

268
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,708
Very well, please
keep me informed.

269
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,791
[KATE sighs]

270
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,083
Huh? You two.

271
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,416
Uh, Sister.

272
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,458
Did you just say
Grand Central Station?

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,041
[GUARD A] Sister Rosette, your
wisdom is truly to be commended.

274
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:37,125
[GUARD B] I'm certain that Lord
Joshua will be so delighted.

275
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,375
[GUARD B] What is the matter?

276
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,000
[GUARD A] The train
is about to leave.

277
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,958
Don't go, Rosette!

278
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,916
[ROSETTE] Father Remington!

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,625
Joshua is--

280
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,875
[REMINGTON yells]

281
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,041
[ROSETTE] Remington!

282
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,291
[RIZEL] What trouble he is.

283
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,041
After all his lessons,
he's still trying to interfere.

284
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,291
Out of respect for his
sister, I showed mercy,

285
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,750
but now I have no choice.
You die, here!

286
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,333
Remington!

287
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:54,958
[REMINGTON yells]

288
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,041
Father Remington!

289
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
Ahh!

290
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,583
Rosette!

291
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,916
Father Remington!

292
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,625
Father Remington,
I'm so sorry!

293
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,041
[REMINGTON] We can talk later.

294
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,583
[ROSETTE gasps]

295
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,125
[RIZEL] You shall not escape.

296
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,583
[REMINGTON] I'm getting
quite tired of you.

297
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,166
[RIZEL] All I was trying to do

298
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,166
was take you to your
beloved younger brother.

299
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,083
Why do you defy me so,
Sister Rosette?

300
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,000
I must have been crazy
to think I could trust

301
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,416
a coward who hides behind
a shield of innocent people.

302
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,083
[RIZEL] Oh, so you don't
want to see Lord Joshua.

303
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,125
Of course I want
to see Joshua!

304
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,083
[I want to see him.

305
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,291
I'd love to fly to him
as fast as I could.

306
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,500
I want to care for him,
to hold him in my arms.

307
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,500
And if he's in pain and agony,
I'd gladly take his place.

308
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,250
[RIZEL] Of course you would.

309
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,958
Only you can save Lord Joshua.

310
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,166
[ROSETTE] And that's why

311
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,708
there's no way I'll
ever accept your help!

312
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,375
That's right. I'm the
only one who can save him.

313
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,750
And I'll rescue Joshua
from your evil clutches,

314
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,791
no matter what price
I have to pay.

315
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,625
[RIZEL] I have no choice.

316
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,875
You shall come with me;
I will make you!

317
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,583
Aim for their necks!

318
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,166
[ROSETTE] Ah!

319
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,833
[RIZEL laughs]

320
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,833
[RIZEL] So many to fight.

321
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:46,000
What can a little two-legs
like you possibly do?

322
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,375
[ROSETTE yells]

323
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,666
[REMINGTON yells]

324
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,250
Rosette, are you all right?

325
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,083
[ROSETTE] Fine!

326
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:07,166
[crowd laughs]

327
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,125
You can't escape.

328
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,041
[gasps]

329
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,166
Rosette!

330
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,833
[CHILD laughs]

331
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,041
Father Remington!

332
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,041
[REMINGTON] Roset--

333
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:38,500
[RIZEL] No! A crucifix barrier!

334
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,333
Rosette!

335
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,250
Chrono!

336
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,625
Are you all right?

337
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,250
I think I used a few
too many crucifixes.

338
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,083
Azmaria...

339
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,666
Rosette!

340
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,250
[RIZEL] Chrono! You!

341
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,208
You haven't changed
at all, Rizel.

342
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,083
Still using the same
old disgusting methods.

343
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,208
[RIZEL] Silence!

344
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,583
Your unsightly form is
fitting for a dog of God!

345
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,166
[ROSETTE] Why, you!

346
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,625
[gasps]

347
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,250
[RIZEL] Alas, an
unexpected intrusion

348
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,666
has come up, dear Sister.

349
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,500
How sad that I
could not take you.

350
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,041
But we shall meet again.

351
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,291
Oh yes, we shall.

352
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,125
Uh...

353
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,500
[CHRONO] You were so reckless.

354
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,166
You could have
waited, you know.

355
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,833
We could've gotten
here really quick.

356
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:55,333
She said that Joshua
was suffering so much.

357
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,166
But he's always been weak.

358
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,416
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,625
[ROSETTE] I swear
I will save him.

360
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,916
No matter what.

361
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,458
I swear it.

362
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,333
[REMINGTON] Rosette...

363
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,375
What's this?

364
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,333
Something that
you need to see.

365
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,875
These papers were
in their hands,

366
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,333
so they might have been
tampered with to throw us off,

367
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,458
but with any luck, they'll
provide us with some clues.

368
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,208
[gasps]

369
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,916
[REMINGTON] For four years,
we've been searching.

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,666
And a few months ago,
we finally got a lead.

371
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,208
[ROSETTE] Joshua!

372
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,708
[ROSETTE] Hey, Azmaria,
did you ever dream about

373
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,458
what you'd be when you grew up?

374
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,500
[AZMARIA]
No, I'm afraid I was too busy

375
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,125
trying to keep my
relatives from hating me.

376
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,583
[ROSETTE] That's so sad!

377
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,375
I really feel for you.

378
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,250
[AZMARIA] Well, what was
your dream, Rosette?

379
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,500
[ROSETTE] I just...
wanted to be strong.

380
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,416
To be able to protect the people
who are near and dear to me.

381
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,875
[AZMARIA] Then that means
your dream has really

382
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,416
come true, hasn't it?

383
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,416
[ROSETTE]
Next episode, "Joshua."

384
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,416
[AZMARIA]
Siblings that get along?

385
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,125
I'm so jealous.
