1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,791
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,000
- ( vocalizing )

3
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:38,666
( singing in Japanese )

4
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,916
- Ryomou: UNCHO KAN'U
OF 1800 YEARS AGO,

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,041
YOU GAVE ME THIS DRAGON!

6
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,708
SO I WILL RETURN
YOUR DESPICABLE CURSE!

7
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,916
HERE AND NOW!

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,333
HEAVEN AND EARTH...

9
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,708
WHITE WAVE SHOCK!

10
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,833
- Kan'u:
THANK YOU, CHOU'UN.

11
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,250
I COULD HEAR YOUR VOICE.

12
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,458
EVEN THOUGH
SPIRITS OF THE PAST

13
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,541
TRY THEIR VERY BEST
TO TRICK ME,

14
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,208
IT DOES THEM NO GOOD.

15
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,708
- I THANK YOU, RYOMOU.

16
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,666
YOUR STRENGTH AS A FIGHTER
LIBERATED YOU

17
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,333
FROM THE SPELL
OF A BITTER GRUDGE

18
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,000
AND HELPED TO SAVE
YOUR VERY SOUL.

19
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,833
NOW, KAN'U,
LET'S GO BACK TO SEITO.

20
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,708
OUR LEADER NEEDS YOU.

21
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,500
TO BE HONEST,
WE ALL NEED YOU.

22
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,583
- Ryomou: SAJI!

23
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,250
RYOFU.

24
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,041
( gasps )
- Kentei: IN YOUR CONDITION,

25
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,250
I DOUBT VERY MUCH
THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE

26
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,041
TO PUT UP A FIGHT
AGAINST ME.

27
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,916
- ( gasps )

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,041
- I SENSE FEAR COMING
FROM YOUR EXHAUSTED CHI.

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,875
- YOU BASTARD!
- I'LL DECIDE THE FIGHT

30
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,625
BETWEEN UNCHO KAN'U
AND SHIMEI RYOMOU. 

31
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,083
YOU WILL BE THE SACRIFICE,

32
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:55,041
THE SACRIFICE THAT EVOKES
THE MOBILIZATION OF MY ARMY.

33
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,750
- SO THAT'S KENTEI.

34
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,250
- Kan'u: SHIMEI RYOMOU,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

35
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,583
- Koukin: 1800 YEARS AGO,

36
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,416
HAKUFU SONSAKU,
THE LITTLE CONQUEROR OF KOTOU,

37
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,583
TOOK A POISON ARROW
TO THE EYES DURING AN ATTACK

38
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,875
AND DIED AT
THE YOUNG AGE OF 26.

39
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,125
WHY?

40
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,833
WHY'D SHE HELP HAKUFU?

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,041
- Sousou: SHUUYU.

42
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,958
- KOUKIN SHUUYU.

43
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,916
BACK DURING
THE BATTLE OF RED CLIFFS,

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,833
HE LED THE WU ARMY
TO VICTORY

45
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,791
WITH A STRATEGY SO BRILLIANT

46
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,416
IT EVEN SUCCEEDED
IN FOOLING HIS ALLIES.

47
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,750
- WHILE WE WERE AT KYOSHO,

48
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,541
I ONLY WISH WE HAD
A RIGHT-HAND MAN LIKE YOU

49
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,833
TO HELP HIS EMPEROR.

50
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,541
- Koukin: IT CAN'T BE.

51
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,250
MOUTOKU SOUSOU?!

52
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,541
- 1,800 YEARS AGO,

53
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,875
THERE WAS FAR TOO MUCH BLOOD
THAT WAS SPILT.

54
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,208
THE CHAIN OF NEGATIVE KARMA
CONTINUES TO THIS DAY

55
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,000
THROUGH THE SACRED BEADS.

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,666
IF ALL THIS CONTINUES,

57
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,416
THEN THE ONLY
INEVITABLE OUTCOME...

58
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,291
- Kyocho: CAN BE NOTHING LESS
THAN TOTAL OBLIVION.

59
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,458
- I WISH IT WEREN'T.

60
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,291
BUT STILL, I CAN'T DENY
THAT YOU MAY BE RIGHT. 

61
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,250
WE ARE, AFTER ALL,
NOTHING MORE THAN PAWNS--

62
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,250
PAWNS TO BRING BACK
THE THREE KINGDOMS.

63
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,916
- Kyocho: HOWEVER, 
THERE IS ONE PERSON

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,750
WHO CAN SEVER THE NEGATIVE KARMA
OF THE SACRED BEADS.

65
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,000
- ( gasps )

66
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,041
- AND THAT PERSON IS...

67
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,291
- IT'S HAKUFU.

68
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,625
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO CAN SAVE OUR DESTINY?

69
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,458
CAN SHE REALLY?

70
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,333
- ( pants )

71
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,000
- ( grunts in pain )

72
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,875
- ( rumbling )

73
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,375
- ( shallow breathing )

74
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,583
( gasps )

75
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,500
- Kan'u: KENTEI.

76
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,625
- HOW DARE YOU.

77
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,958
HOW DARE YOU TRICK US
INTO FIGHTING LIKE THAT!

78
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,416
EVEN IF YOU ARE EMPEROR,

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,375
YOUR ACTIONS ARE
BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE.

80
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,625
I, KAN'U, WILL
NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

81
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,500
- YOU FOOL.

82
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,958
DO YOU NOT REALIZE
HOW POWERLESS YOU ARE?

83
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,958
YOU MAY BE THE REINCARNATION
OF AN ANCIENT WARRIOR,

84
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,166
BUT ONCE YOU'VE
EXCEEDED YOUR LIMITS,

85
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,333
ONLY DEATH REMAINS.
- ( laughs )

86
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,875
I PROMISE YOU.  BY THEN,
YOU WON'T BE ALIVE EITHER.

87
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,791
- Chou'un:
HER INJURIES ARE SEVERE.

88
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,250
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

89
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,541
HER CHI IS DEPLETED.
AND YET...

90
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,291
THE GREAT UNCHO KAN'U--

91
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,125
WHAT DAUNTLESS
AND HEROIC VALOR.

92
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,666
SHE TRULY FIGHTS

93
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,125
LIKE A GOD.

94
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,333
- ( pants )

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,791
- Ekitoku:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

96
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,083
IF ALL YOU DO
IS STAND THERE,

97
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,666
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA GET KILLED!

98
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,791
- ( gasps )
- KAN'U!

99
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,375
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

100
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,250
- Ten'i: ( grunts )

101
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,625
COME OUT, YOU SNAKE.

102
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,291
REAL FIGHTERS DO NOT RUN
AND REAL FIGHTERS DO NOT HIDE.

103
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,791
- ( gasps )

104
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,166
- ( screams )

105
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:56,458
- WHY?  TELL ME WHY YOU'RE
 TRYING TO KILL ALL OF US.

106
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,958
IS IT THAT YOU'RE
BEING CONTROLLED

107
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,666
BY THAT WEIRD
HOODED MONSTER?

108
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,083
IS THAT IT?

109
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,083
SNAP OUT OF IT!

110
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,000
( screams )

111
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,583
( strains )

112
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,416
HURRY!
YOU HAVE TO HURRY

113
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,875
AND GIVE ME YOUR HAND!
- BUT WHY?

114
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,833
- HURRY UP!

115
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,875
- I DON'T GET IT.

116
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,166
- I-- I CAN'T!

117
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,333
- ( screams )

118
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,166
- ( gasps )

119
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,333
( screams )

120
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,958
- I KNOW YOU.

121
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,500
CHUUTATSU SHIBAI!

122
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,375
- Moukaku: DAMN.

123
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,958
YOU REALLY FOUGHT HARD,
DIDN'T YOU, FUCKWIT?!

124
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,708
( snickers )

125
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,250
- SISTER.
- HMM?

126
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,708
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

127
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,625
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO DAMN LONG?

128
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,791
- IT TURNS OUT

129
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,375
WE WERE VERY WRONG...
- HUH?

130
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,500
- ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY
MEANS TO BE A FIGHTER.

131
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,458
- HMM.

132
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,958
OF COURSE I ALREADY
KNEW THAT, YOU IDIOT.

133
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,666
BUT IT TURNS OUT,
THAT WHAT WE NEEDED

134
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,875
WASN'T A STRATEGY,

135
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,625
BUT A LEGION
OF STRONG ENEMIES.

136
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,333
- I CAN'T AGREE MORE.

137
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,458
- IT FEELS GOOD KNOWING
THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE HERE

138
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,500
WORTH BREATHING MY AIR.

139
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,416
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
WITH ME ON THAT?

140
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,541
YOU FUCKWITS!
- Men: YEAH!

141
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,708
- Shibai: THE BODY OF
SHIBAI, WHO YOU KILLED

142
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,125
IN THE BATTLE 
OF RED CLIFFS,

143
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,500
HAS LONG SINCE LEFT
THIS MORTAL PLANE. 

144
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,291
- DID YOU SAY "SHIBAI"?

145
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,833
- HER SOUL, HOWEVER,
HAD NOWHERE TO GO

146
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,083
AND AIMLESSLY WANDERED
ABOUT IN HELL,

147
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,791
CALLING OUT
IN SEARCH OF ANYTHING.

148
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,458
- I DON'T GET IT!

149
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,666
- THE POWER OF THOSE WHO HEARD
THIS UNWAVERING CALL...

150
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,291
- Kentei: ALL CAME TOGETHER

151
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,375
TO CREATE THIS
INVINCIBLE BODY.

152
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,041
I WILL KILL EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF YOU FIGHTERS!

153
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,958
I AM THE NEW RULER

154
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,625
WHO BRINGS DESTRUCTION
AND CHAOS TO THIS WORLD.

155
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,291
I AM KENTEI...

156
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,375
COMPLETELY REBORN!

157
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,833
- Koukin: IT WAS SOUSOU.

158
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,333
HE SAID HAKUFU
COULD BE THE ONE

159
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,916
TO CHANGE OUR DESTINY.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,666
FOREVER.

161
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,708
BUT HOW CAN
SHE EVEN DO IT?

162
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,500
- Kyocho: SHE CAN.
- ( both gasp )

163
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,791
- BACK DURING
THE BATTLE OF RED CLIFFS--

164
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:08,791
BACK THEN, IF THE DRAGON
HAD ENDED UP SWALLOWING SOUSOU,

165
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,541
I'D PLANNED ON
KILLING HIM MYSELF

166
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,666
AND TAKING
MY OWN LIFE AS WELL.

167
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,250
HOWEVER,
SONSAKU SAVED SOUSOU

168
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,833
WHEN THE DEVIL KING
POSSESSED HIM.

169
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,666
- Koukin: DID SHE REALLY?

170
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
HAKUFU?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

171
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,541
SOUSOU WOULD SACRIFICE
PRACTICALLY ANYTHING

172
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,000
FOR ULTIMATE DOMINANCE.

173
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,750
- CONVERSELY, RYUUBI
WOULD SACRIFICE HERSELF

174
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,708
AND CHOOSE DEATH IN ORDER
TO HELP A FRIEND IN NEED.

175
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,541
BUT SONSAKU WOULD DO
NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS.

176
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,666
UNLIKE THE OTHERS,
SHE WAS BENEVOLENT

177
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
TOWARD BOTH
VASSALS AND ENEMIES.

178
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,416
SHE IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
A TRULY IDEAL RULER.

179
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,041
- ( sword clinks )
- HUH?

180
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,166
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

181
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,166
- WITH THIS?

182
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,083
I'LL BE FIGHTING KENTEI.

183
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,208
I'VE HEARD STORIES.

184
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,333
STORIES OF ANCIENT MALICE
AND ILL WILL

185
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,916
ARE SEALED IN THIS SWORD.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,666
EVEN KENTEI...

187
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,375
CAN'T FIGHT THIS.

188
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,250
( gasps )

189
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,791
( gasps )
- ( groaning, growling )

190
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,041
- ( Koukin grunts )

191
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,125
( screams )

192
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,875
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!

193
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,541
UNLESS YOU'RE
THE LITTLE CONQUEROR,

194
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,041
YOU CAN'T WIELD IT.

195
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,416
THE SWORD'S EVIL
IS SURE TO OVERPOWER YOU.

196
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
- AND YOU THINK I CARE?!

197
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,750
I DON'T.

198
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,541
I'LL KEEP TRYING
EVEN IF IT KILLS ME.

199
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,541
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
FOR HAKUFU.

200
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,958
I CAN'T JUST QUIT
ON HER NOW.

201
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,833
- ( bird wings flap )
- ( gasps )

202
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,375
- Hakufu: KOUKIN.

203
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,708
- ISN'T THAT...

204
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,625
- HAKUFU.
- ( gasps )

205
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,333
- IT'S THE WATER DRAGON'S CHI.

206
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,958
- ( rumbling, cracking )

207
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,083
- IT CAN'T BE 
ANOTHER ENEMY!

208
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,708
- IT'S NOT.

209
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,375
IT'S SONSAKU!

210
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,666
- IT'S THE LITTLE CONQUEROR
OF KANTO.

211
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,666
TO MY PLANS, YOU ARE NOTHING
MORE THAN A DEADLY POISON,

212
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,583
A WRENCH IN
THE COGS OF DESTINY.

213
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,458
I CANNOT STAND BY
AND LET YOU LIVE.

214
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,125
- OKAY, I'LL SAY HONESTLY,

215
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,083
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHO THE HECK YOU ARE,

216
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,875
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT STUPID PEOPLE

217
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,666
WON'T COME TO THEIR SENSES
BY THEMSELVES.

218
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,625
SO I'LL KNOCK 
SOME INTO YOU.

219
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,708
OOPS, I SAID "STUPID" AGAIN.

220
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,041
I FORGOT ONLY STUPID PEOPLE
SAY STUPID.

221
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,000
- ( sighs )
YOU WILL DIE.

222
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,916
- COME ON,
THE BATTLE STARTS NOW!

223
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,875
- Goei: OH, GOOD GREIF.

224
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,125
WHY DOES THAT GIRL
INSIST ON WORRYING ME

225
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,416
BY ALWAYS JUMPING INTO THINGS
WITHOUT THINKING?

226
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,291
SHE'S SUCH
A TROUBLEMAKER.

227
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,583
- OUR HISTORY
IS CHANGING GREATLY.

228
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,666
AND YOUR DAUGHTER HAKUFU

229
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,666
IS AT THE CENTER 
OF THE MAELSTROM.

230
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,666
- BEFORE I EVEN REALIZED IT,

231
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,708
SHE HAD INHERITED
THE WISHES OF HER FATHER.

232
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,583
- IT WAS ABOUT
TWO YEARS AGO.

233
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,625
A LONE FIGHTER VISITED THE
SACRED STONE IN THE MOUNTAINS.

234
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,916
BUT EVEN THE MAN THAT PEOPLE
SAID WAS LOYAL IN PEACE,

235
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,375
BUT A TRAITOR IN CHAOS,

236
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,791
HIS TWISTED SOUL
WAS SAVED

237
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,541
BY THE SHOHOU HAKUFU SONSAKU.

238
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,875
HAI!

239
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,000
- Choukou: UKITSU,
YOU MUST REALLY HATE ME,

240
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,250
DON'T YOU?

241
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,333
I HAD A FEELING
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

242
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,083
YOU MUST THINK
I'M A TERRIBLE MASTER.

243
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,708
THROUGHOUT HISTORY,
THE POWER OF SOVEREIGNTY

244
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,166
HAS BEEN BUILT UPON
SACRIFICES OF ALL KINDS.

245
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,833
EVEN NOW,
YOUR SOUL CONTINUES

246
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,583
TO BATTLE TOGETHER WITH
THAT UNRELENTING FOOL. 

247
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,041
WHO WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT

248
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,458
THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE CASE, HUH?

249
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,791
- ( Hakufu grunts )

250
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,166
( screaming )

251
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,625
- ( rumbling )

252
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,416
- WHAT SUDDENLY BROUGHT
BIG SISTER HAKUFU'S MOTHER HERE?

253
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,208
COULD SOMETHING
HAVE HAPPENED TO BIG SISTER?

254
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,375
- Genpou: BIG SISTER HAKUFU
HAS GROWN STRONGER AGAIN.

255
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,500
- HUH?

256
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GENPOU?

257
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,125
- HER DRAGON
IS DANCING IN THE SKY.

258
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,833
BIG SISTER'S DRAGON

259
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:19,291
WATCHES OVER US
FROM HIGH IN THE SKY.

260
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,291
- BASTARD!

261
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,541
- Kakouton:
HANG ON A SECOND.

262
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,666
HE SORT OF
LOOKS LIKE SONSAKU.

263
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,708
- I'VE HEARD THAT PETS
OFTEN RESEMBLE THEIR MASTERS.

264
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,416
OH, BY THE WAY,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

265
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,083
DOESN'T KYOSHO
NEED PROTECTION?

266
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,333
- THANKS FOR YOUR CONCERN,
BUT WE CAN HANDLE IT.

267
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,041
I'M A BIT MORE
WORRIED ABOUT 

268
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,083
HOW NANYO IS HOLDING UP
WITHOUT ITS LEADER.

269
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,333
- WELL, I'M HAPPY FOR ONCE

270
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,666
THAT SHE DOESN'T ACT
LIKE YOUR TYPICAL LEADER.

271
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,708
SHE HAS THESE MYSTERIOUS--

272
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,625
NO, I'D SAY HER POWERS
WERE MORE CRAZY THAN ANYTHING.

273
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,000
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU NEVER KNOW.

274
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,000
SHE MIGHT BE THE TYPE
OF PERSON WHO MAKES HISTORY.

275
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,458
YOU THINK SO TOO, DON'T YOU?

276
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,666
- ( meows )

277
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
- ( grunts )
- ( metal grinds )

278
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,041
- ( screams )

279
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,666
- ( screams )

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
- ( running footsteps )

281
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,333
- ( gasps )

282
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,166
UH, MISS GENTOKU!

283
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,041
- MAA-CHAN,
PLEASE HELP ME.

284
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,166
- ( gasps )

285
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,875
( gasps )

286
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

287
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,416
- YOU'VE BEEN LYING THERE
UNCONSCIOUS FOR A WHILE. 

288
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,083
YOU DID WEAR YOURSELF OUT
IN THAT FIGHT.

289
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,625
SO TAKE IT EASY FOR NOW.

290
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,750
- THAT GIRL,
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

291
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,416
OH, NO!
WHERE'S MASTER?

292
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
- THAT SWORD OF YOURS
ONCE STOPPED EVIL,

293
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:06,333
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO DESTROY MY ARMOR.

294
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,833
WITH THE POWER OF
THE CONQUEROR'S DRAGON,

295
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,083
IT HAS BECOME A FRIGHTENING
MAGICAL SWORD.

296
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,750
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

297
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,208
FINISH ME OFF.

298
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,875
RELISH THE TASTE OF VICTORY
YOU SO LONG FOR.

299
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,083
YOU WANT MY BLOOD.

300
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,625
IT'S HOW YOU FIGHTERS
HAVE LEARNED

301
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,000
TO ENJOY THE KILLING
IN EACH VICTORY.

302
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,375
- SONSAKU, WHY DON'T YOU
KILL HIM ALREADY?

303
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,333
HE USED NOTHING BUT VIOLENT 
EGREGIOUS TRICKS TO TRAP US.

304
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,041
HE TRIED TO DESTROY US.

305
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,625
- EVEN THOUGH
I MAY BE A FIGHTER,

306
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,708
I HAVE NEVER ONCE
ENTERED A FIGHT

307
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,083
WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING.

308
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,916
- THE SACRED BEAD AND
IT'S DESTINY ARE A PART OF ME,

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,208
BUT I STILL SETTLE
ALL BATTLES MY OWN WAY.

310
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,416
THAT WAY I'M STILL ME.
- ( gasps )

311
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,375
- YOU'RE SUCH A FOOL.

312
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,458
I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU REGRET THOSE WORDS.

313
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,750
( grunts )

314
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,250
- ( moaning )

315
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,666
- ( Kentei winces )
- ( moaning continues )

316
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,625
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

317
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,000
MY FOLLOWERS!
ALL OF MY CHILDREN!

318
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,708
- Koumei:
YOUR AMBITIONS END HERE.

319
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,333
GO QUIETLY TO HELL AND
NEVER SHOW YOUR FACE AGAIN.

320
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,208
THE BULBS THAT YOU USED
TO BRING THOSE DARK SOULS

321
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,125
BACK TO THE LIVING 
WILL ALL BE BURNED.

322
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,541
KENTEI-- OR SHOULD
I SAY CHUUTATSU SHIBAI?

323
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,000
- Shibai:
KOUMEI SHOKATSURYOU,

324
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,250
YOU'VE STOOD IN THE WAY

325
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,333
OF ULTIMATE DOMINANCE
ONCE AGAIN.

326
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,583
SO BE IT.

327
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,458
- Kentei: YOU PEOPLE
HAVE WON THIS TIME, 

328
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,083
BUT IT'S ALL THE SAME
IN THE END.

329
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,833
THERE IS NO FUTURE
FOR FIGHTERS.

330
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,083
YOU CANNOT
ESCAPE THE DESTINY

331
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,541
THAT LIES IN THE GLOW
OF YOUR SACRED BEADS.

332
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:15,041
IT WILL ALL COME
IN DUE TIME.

333
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:19,208
YOUR DESTRUCTION IS INEVITABLE.
- WHO'S VOICE IS THAT?

334
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,583
- IT'S KENTEI'S.

335
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,083
- WHAT DOES HE MEAN?
- Kentei: THEREBY BRINGING IT

336
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,625
UPON YOURSELVES EVEN MORE!
- DAMNED IF I KNOW.

337
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,125
- BEWARE.

338
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,083
I WILL BE REINCARNATED
AGAIN AND AGAIN

339
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,708
UNTIL THE LAST FIGHTER
IS NOTHING BUT DISTANT MEMORY.

340
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,791
OVER AND OVER...

341
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,708
AND OVER AGAIN...

342
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,375
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

343
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,958
- ( end theme playing )

344
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

345
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,458
- Moukaku: HEY, MOUYUU,

346
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,416
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
"IKKI TOUSEN" MEANS?

347
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,708
- Mouyuu:
IT MEANS THE STRENGTH

348
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,000
TO TAKE ON A THOUSAND
ADVERSARIES.

349
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:37,333
- EVEN AT ONE A MINUTE,
THAT'S 1,000 MINUTES.

350
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,791
IN HOURS, THAT'S, UH...
- 16 HOURS AND 40 MINUTES.

351
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:41,875
THAT'S A LONG TIME.

352
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,375
WHAT IF I GET
HUNGRY ALONG THE WAY?

353
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,708
- YOU'LL BE KILLED, OF COURSE.
NEXT TIME ON:

354
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,375
"IKKI TOUSEN, XTREME XECUTOR"...

355
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,083
"FUTURE UNLIMITED."
- IT'S THE LAST EPISODE,

356
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,666
BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN
IN IT, FUCKWITS!
