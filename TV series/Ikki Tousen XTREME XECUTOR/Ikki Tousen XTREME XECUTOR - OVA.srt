1
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,458
- ( train approaching )

2
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:05,958
- ( punch landing )
- ( grunts )

3
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,958
- COME ON, LET'S GO!

4
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,291
LET'S KILL THESE PUNKS!

5
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,000
- COME ON, LET'S DO THIS!
- THEY'RE GONNA FIGHT.

6
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,791
- ( shouts )
- ( grunts )

7
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,416
- ( shouts )

8
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,458
- Koukin: RYOMOU!

9
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,708
- AAH!

10
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,791
- WHERE THE HELL HAS
OUR LEADER GONE?

11
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,166
- SHE GOT OFF THE TRAIN

12
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,708
TO GET SOME SWEET JELLY
AT NAGOYA STATION

13
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,708
AND THEN I LOST HER.

14
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,625
- THAT IDIOT!

15
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,833
- YOSHO ACADEMY,
RAKUYO HIGH, KYOSHO...

16
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,666
WHAT ARE THEY ALL DOING HERE?

17
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,166
- I GUESS THEY'RE PROBABLY HERE
FOR THE SAME REASON WE ARE.

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,541
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.
LET'S GO!

19
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,500
- RIGHT!

20
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,583
- QUITE SCHOOL TRIP
THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE.

21
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,500
- ( humming )

22
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,541
- HEY!
- HUH?

23
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,916
- WHATCHA READING, GENTOKU?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,208
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING?

25
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,958
- I PUT IT TOGETHER
THIS MORNING.

26
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,916
- Koumei: INTERESTING.
- UH...

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,250
- SERIOUSLY.

28
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,166
- YOU GUYS ARE READING
THIS CRAP TOO?!

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,125
SHOULDN'T YOU BE TRAINING
INSTEAD OF DOING

30
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,875
CREATIVE WRITING PROJECTS?!

31
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,416
WHICH REMINDS ME,
WHERE IS KAN'U?

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,625
AAH!  THINKING MAKES
MY BRAIN HURT!

33
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,750
- CHOUHI, YOU HAVE NO BRAIN.

34
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,208
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

35
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,250
- HERE, I MADE A COPY
FOR YOU TOO.

36
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,958
- KAN'U ISN'T HERE.

37
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,041
SHE'S OUT SEARCHING
THE SURROUNDING AREA.

38
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,583
- OH, I SEE.
SO HOW MANY OF THOSE

39
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,375
STUPID BOOKS DID YOU
DECIDE TO BRING WITH YOU?

40
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,333
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE HERE
FOR THREE DAYS.

41
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,083
- Announcer: ATTENTION
PATRONS OF KYOTO STATION...

42
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,708
- ( people screaming )
- ...A CONFLICT HAS BROKEN OUT

43
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,541
INSIDE THE STATION,
INVOLVING KANTO FIGHTERS.

44
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,958
THE SITUATION IS
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

45
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,000
THE STATION STAFF
WILL DIRECT YOU TO SAFETY.

46
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,375
- WHAT THE--?!
- OH!

47
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,250
- NANYO, KYOSHO.

48
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,375
- WHY ARE THEY HERE?

49
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,916
- SEITO!

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
- Kyosho student:
SEITO STUDENTS!

51
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,208
- YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, RIGHT?

52
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,833
- YEAH, I KNOW.

53
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,458
GET THEM!
- ( men shouting )

54
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,375
- ( chuckles )
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

55
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,958
- LOOKS LIKE
THEY REALLY WANNA FIGHT.

56
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,458
- LEADER, YOU AND KOUMEI
GO UPSTAIRS.

57
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,875
WE'LL HANDLE THINGS DOWN HERE.

58
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,708
- YOU CAN I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THEM MYSELF.

59
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,125
- ENGAGING THEM IN BATTLE
WOULD MAKE YOU MISS YOUR BUS.

60
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,333
- WELL, I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THOSE TWO UP THERE.

61
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,375
BEFORE THE REST
EVEN GET CLOSE.

62
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,291
- Rikuson: SEITO'S HERE TOO?

63
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,958
IT'S NO DIFFERENT
FROM BEING BACK IN KANTO.

64
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,375
- NO WAY THIS IS A COINCIDENCE.

65
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,083
FEELS LIKE A SETUP.
- Koukin: GAKUSHU! 

66
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,291
- AH, YOU'RE OKAY.

67
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,750
- DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
OUR STUPID LEADER ANYWHERE?

68
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,500
- NO.
YOU HAVEN'T FOUND HER, EITHER?

69
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,375
- MAYBE SHE GOT LEFT BEHIND
IN NAGOYA STATION.

70
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,375
- IF SHE DID,
FORGET ABOUT HER.

71
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,333
- ( both gasp )

72
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,875
- AAH!

73
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,208
- KAKOUEN?

74
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,708
- ( groans )

75
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,875
- GOD ON HIGH IS ALMIGHTY.

76
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,166
IT'S HIS DIVINE JUDGMENT
THAT IS ABSOLUTE.

77
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

78
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,500
LEAVE AT ONCE.

79
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,458
- ( grunts )

80
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,291
- AAH!

81
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,791
- ANYONE HAVE A PLAN?

82
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,833
- GAKUSHU!
I'M ON MY WAY!

83
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,500
- THOSE WHO STAND IN MY WAY
SHALL BE JUDGED WITHOUT MERCY.

84
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,458
- ( groaning )

85
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,875
- ( slightly gasping )

86
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,000
- ( shouts )

87
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,000
- WE'LL SETTLE THIS IN KANTO.

88
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,625
- ARE YOU OKAY?

89
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,000
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

90
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,208
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
IT'S NOT SAFE.

91
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,500
- All: MM.

92
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,291
- EKITOKU!
- HUH?

93
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,125
- Ryomou: SEITO ACADEMY?
- Soujin: HOLD IT!

94
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,041
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
TO BEAT UP OUR CLASSMATES.

95
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,458
- Ekitoku:
WELL, YOU GUYS STARTED IT!

96
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,291
- UH... NO.
THIS ALL STARTED

97
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,250
BECAUSE NANYO CAME LOOKING
FOR TROUBLE.

98
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,625
- Ryomou: STOP YOUR BICKERING.
NONE OF US HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

99
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,458
WE ALL HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO.

100
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,291
- Ekitoku: NO ARGUMENTS HERE.
I MEAN, WE'RE RIGHT

101
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,250
IN THE MIDDLE OF
OUR SHUUGAKU TRIP.

102
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,541
- WHAT'S A SHUUGAKU TRIP?

103
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,958
- UH... ( stammering )

104
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,583
- GENTOKU, OVER THERE.

105
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,125
KYOTO... FIGHTERS.

106
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,750
- GREETINGS, KANTO FIGHTERS!

107
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,375
WE JUST WANTED TO
WELCOME YOU TO KYOTO!

108
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,083
- All: HIP HIP, HOORAY!

109
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,291
- LET'S ALL TAKE CARE
OF THE WELCOME WAGON FIRST.

110
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,833
- COUNT ME IN!

111
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,458
- LIKE WE HAVE A CHOICE.

112
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,666
- ATTACK!

113
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,166
- ( men shouting )

114
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,166
- Announcer: A MAJOR CONFLICT
BETWEEN KANTO AND KYOTO FIGHTERS

115
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,208
HAS BROKEN OUT
NEAR THE MAIN STAIRWAY.

116
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,291
THE SITUATION IS
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

117
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,000
STATION MANAGEMENT REQUESTS
YOU KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

118
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,916
- THE SHUUGAKU CLASS TRIP.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,083
A TRAINING JOURNEY
EMBARKED UPON

120
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,875
DURING THE BIG FIGHTERS'
TOURNAMENT

121
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,375
TO REPLENISH THE SPIRITUAL 
ENERGY OF THE SACRED BEADS.

122
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:16,000
KYOTO, THE GREATEST CITY
OF SPIRITS IN ALL OF JAPAN--

123
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,916
IT'S HOME TO MANY FIGHTERS,

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,125
ALL WHO CARRY THE SPIRITS OF THE
GREATEST WARRIOR GENERALS.

125
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,750
THEY CARRY <i>TSUBA,</i>

126
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,125
OR SAMURAI SWORD HAND GUARDS,
WHICH ARE CONNECTED

127
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,000
TO OUR SACRED BEADS.

128
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,041
THE MORE FIGHTERS
THEY DEFEAT IN BATTLE,

129
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,500
THE MORE <i>TSUBA</i>
 THEY COLLECT.

130
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,208
IT IS HOPED THAT
THE SHUUGAKU JOURNEY

131
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,791
WILL FOSTER IMMENSE GROWTH
AND ABUNDANT MEMORIES

132
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,458
TO ALL FIGHTERS
THAT PARTICIPATE.

133
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,708
( chuckles )

134
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,833
I WISH I COULD SAY
THAT I AGREE.

135
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,208
- THE TRAVEL AGENCY SCREWED UP.

136
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,083
THE RESERVATIONS FOR US ARE
ALL WRONG.

137
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,916
DON'T WORRY. I MADE SURE
THEY FIXED OUR ITINERARY.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
BESIDES, YOU DON'T LOOK
QUITE YOURSELF.

139
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,416
- THANKS A LOT.

140
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,583
I PREFER TO SETTLE
OUR ISSUES WITH KANTO

141
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,666
IN KANTO.

142
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,791
- ( deeply sighs )

143
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,750
- HMM?

144
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,083
- BARELY MADE IT.
HMM?

145
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,083
HUH?

146
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,375
TON-CHAN.

147
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,625
AAH.

148
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,541
- HMM.

149
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,375
FOR YOU.

150
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,333
- ( screams )

151
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,416
- LET'S GO.
- UH, SURE.

152
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,375
LATER.

153
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,625
- Announcer:
WE REPEAT-- TO ALL PATRONS,

154

155
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,166
HAS BROKEN OUT
NEAR THE MAIN STAIRWAY.

156
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,250
THE SITUATION IS
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

157
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,666
WE ASK YOU, PLEASE 
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

158
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,958
- ( jingles )

159
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,291
- THESE ARE THE SOULS OF

160
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,791
SAMURAI WARRIOR GENERALS?

161
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,083
RYOMA SAKAMOTO WOULD CRY.

162
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,791
- RYOMA SAKAMOTO WASN'T
A WARRIOR GENERAL.

163
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,875
- FALL BACK!

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,708
- YOU GUYS ARE RUNNING AWAY?

165
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,125
I KNOW YOU'RE TERRIFIED
OF ME, BUT COME ON!

166
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,250
- I SMELL SMOKE.

167
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,666
- ( all gasp )

168
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,000
- PUSH!

169
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,125
- TAKE COVER!

170
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,833
- THIS IS BAD!

171
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,625
- Ryuubi: KAN'U!

172
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,291
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!
WHERE WERE YOU?!

173
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,291
- KYOTO STATION...

174
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,125
IS VERY BIG.

175
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,875
- YOU GOT LOST?

176
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,083
- KAN'U!

177
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,458
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

178
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,833
- OH-- YOU'RE WELCOME.

179
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,125
- I THINK KAN'U IS EXCITED.

180
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,666
- IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

181
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,833
- SORRY FOR TAKING SO LONG.

182
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,041
HERE'S MY APOLOGY...

183
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,000
- ( jingles )

184
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,041
- Ryomou: A SINGLE STRIKE.

185
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,958
KAN'U REALLY IS THAT GOOD.

186
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,333
- HI!

187
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,916
- HAKUFU!
- HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,083
- I HAD TO PEE.

189
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,708
DID I JUST MISS SOMETHING?

190
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,041
WHERE'S THE FIGHT? 
WHERE'S THE BATTLE?

191
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,666
- IT JUST ENDED.
- HUH?!

192
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,000
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A STUPID LEADER!

193
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,750
- HEY!

194
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,750
YOU KNOW THE ONE WHO SAYS
STUPID FIRST IS REALLY STU--

195
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,750
- STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!

196
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,208
( echoing )

197
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,291
- SO THIS IS A <i>TSUBA.</i>

198
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,500
HOW MANY DID YOU COLLECT,
KOUKIN?

199
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,958
- I'D SAY ABOUT 15 MAYBE.

200
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,500
BUT GAKUSHU AND RYOMOU HAVE
COLLECTED A LOT MORE OF THEM

201
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,375
THAN I HAVE.

202
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,791
- BUT IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE

203
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:26,500
IF YOU GET KILLED REPLENISHING
YOUR SPIRITUAL ENERGY.

204
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,083
- MOU-CHAN, IT'S NOT FAIR.

205
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,166
YOU HAVE SO MANY <i>TSUBA.</i>

206
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,666
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
JUST ONE OF THEM YET.

207
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,333
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU GO OFF ON YOUR OWN.

208
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,000
- LET'S SING, MOU-CHAN.
IT'S OUR SCHOOL TRIP.

209
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,375
- WILL YOU PAY ATTENTION!

210
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,583
- IS THAT SEITO'S GUIDEBOOK?

211
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,708
- YEAH.  IT SEEMS WE BOTH USED
THE SAME TRAVEL AGENT,

212
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,875
SO OUR SCHEDULES OVERLAP
QUITE A BIT.

213
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,041
NEXT IS...

214
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,208
HUH?
THERE THEY ARE.

215
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,166
- IT'S RYU-CHAN.
HI, GUYS!

216
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,541
- MISS SONSAKU!  HI!

217
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,000
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU!

218
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,458
- ( groans )
HEY, DRIVER!

219
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,666
GO FASTER!

220
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,041
- OH, NO.
THEY PASSED US.

221
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,625
- PLEASE, DON'T DISAPPOINT
OUR LEADER.

222
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,583
- YES.

223
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,250
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T!
COME ON, HURRY UP!

224
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

225
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,666
- I FEEL SICK.
SLOW DOWN OR I'M GONNA THROW UP.

226
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,625
- DO NOT BACK DOWN.

227
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,250
THE FIRST OF US TO BACK DOWN
WILL LOSE THE FIGHT.

228
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,125
- KAN'U, WE'RE GOING TOO FAST.
IT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

229
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,541
- EKITOKU, YOU WOULD DARE ACCEPT
DEFEAT FROM PATHETIC NANYO?

230
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,541
- NO, I WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
BUT--

231
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,750
- I DO NOT WISH TO SEE
OUR LEADER DISTRESSED OUR UPSET.

232
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,791
THAT WOULD AFFECT
OUR TEAM SPIRIT. 

233
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,708
I HAVE SWORN UPON MY LIFE
NOT TO ALLOW ANYONE

234
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,541
OR ANYTHING TO HARM GENTOKU.

235
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,666
- UH, KAN'U?

236
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,875
- ( exhales )
- ( gasps )

237
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,166
WHY IS SHE SLEEPING?

238
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
- IT'S IN HER NATURE.

239
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,333
- Ekitoku: KAN'U!

240
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,333
- NEVER BACK DOWN!

241
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,041
- Koukin: HAKUFU, STOP IT!

242
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,208
- GO!

243
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,958
- NOW I'M REALLY SICK.

244
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,208
- AAH!

245
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,500
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

246
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,541
- OWWIE!

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,416
- PLEASE TRY TO CALM YOURSELF,
KAN'U.

248
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,166
WE'RE HERE TO COLLECT <i>TSUBA.</i>

249
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,750
WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS SORT
OF BEHAVIOR.

250
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,250
- THAT'S TRUE.
FORGIVE ME.

251
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,750
- BESIDES,

252
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,916
YOU'LL SOON ENOUGH HAVE YOUR
CHANCE TO FIGHT, I PROMISE.

253
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,875
- Hakufu: WOW!
A REAL SAMURAI TOWN!

254
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,375
- Ryomou:
TRY TO CONTROL YOURSELF.

255
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,708
- Koukin: LOOKS LIKE
NO ONE'S HERE.

256
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,666
- WE HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE
TO OURSELVES.

257
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,666
IT SAYS THAT UNTIL MIDNIGHT,

258
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,750
SPIRITS THAT WERE UNABLE
TO FIND FIGHTERS TO POSSESS

259
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,291
WILL ROAM THE STREETS.

260
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,375
- SPIRITS?
YOU MEAN GHOSTS, RIGHT?

261
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,500
- "DEFEATING A SPIRIT DOES NOT
EARN A <i>TSUBA,</i>

262
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,166
SO USE CAUTION.

263
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,625
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN TOWN IS
A GIANT <i>TSUBA</i>

264
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,625
THAT CONTROLS
ALL OF THE OTHERS.

265
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,500
AVOID THEIR ATTACKS
AS YOU SEARCH EVERY CORNER.

266
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,291
BE CAREFUL AND GOOD LUCK."

267
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,291
THIS GUIDEBOOK SURE IS HANDY.

268
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,708
- WELL, IT DOES POSSESS
A LEVEL OF DETAIL

269
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,083
THAT OUR LEADER CERTAINLY LACKS.

270
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,958
- YEAH, AND THAT'S NOT ALL
THAT SHE LACKS.

271
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,416
- ONE GIANT <i>TSUBA.</i>

272
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,416
WE SHOULD GET MOVING
BEFORE IT'S DARK.

273
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,291
YOU'RE STILL NOT HEALED.
STAY HERE AND REST.

274
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,458
- THANK YOU, RYOMOU.

275
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,541
- I PROMISE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

276
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,041
- PLEASE DO.

277
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,208
WE CAN'T LET SEITO 
GET THE JUMP ON US.

278
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,666
WE'LL SPLIT UP AND SEARCH.

279
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,083
- THAT'S A GREAT PLAN.

280
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,958
- WHEN DID MOU-CHAN
 BECOME OUR LEADER?

281
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,750
- ( gasps )

282
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,708
- ( grunts )

283
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,541
- INTERESTING.

284
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,000
IT SEEMS YOU REACT TO
THE PRESENCE OF FIGHTERS.

285
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,000
BUT YOU MUST KNOW
I'VE FOUGHT FISTS

286
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
MUCH SHARPER THAN YOUR BLADE!

287
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,291
- ( grunts ) -
YOU WON'T FIND A SUITABLE BODY!

288
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,750
HA!

289
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,333
- ( shouts )

290
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,583
- BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM!

291
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,291
( gasps )

292
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,458
THE <i>TSUBA</i> MUST BE
THAT DIRECTION.

293
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,041
- I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
YOUR PRESENCE.

294
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,291
FOUND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

295
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,500
- AAH!

296
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,125
- CHOU'UN, YOU PUT ON
QUITE A SHOW.

297
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,416
- THANK YOU. BUT THEY WERE
HARDLY WORTHY ADVERSARIES.

298
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,875
IT WAS DISAPPOINTING.

299
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,000
- MERELY WANDERING SPIRITS
WITHOUT BODIES.

300
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,666
THEY ARE NO MATCH FOR US.

301
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,458
- I CONCUR.

302
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,583
OUR COMMON ADVERSARY IS
ELSEWHERE.

303
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,875
- I'M GOING AFTER IT.

304
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,291
- I WON'T LET YOU.

305
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,583
- THE CONTROLLING <i>TSUBA</i> IS
PROBABLY BEYOND THERE.

306
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,583
RIGHT?  ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU AND I ARE BOTH LOOKING FOR?

307
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,041
- WE ARE LOOKING FOR
THE CONTROLLING <i>TSUBA,</i>

308
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,791
BUT ALL THAT MATTERS IS
FOR ONE OF US TO FIND IT.

309
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,083
IF YOU TRUST IN YOUR FRIENDS,

310
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
YOUR PATH BECOMES CLEAR.

311
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,000
I'M SURE THAT YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

312
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,708
- ( both grunting )

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
- YOU WILL REMAIN HERE,
QUIETLY UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

314
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,750
OR UNTIL ONE OF MY FRIENDS
COLLECTS THE CONTROLLING <i>TSUBA.</i>

315
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,291
- DO YOU REALLY PLACE
THAT MUCH TRUST IN YOUR FRIENDS?

316
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,333
- ( scoffs )

317
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,625
WHY, YOU DON'T
TRUST YOUR FRIENDS?

318
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,125
- I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT.

319
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,250
SONSAKU'S IRRESPONSIBLE,
CARELESS AND STUPID.

320
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,708
SHE'S UNRELIABLE,
INCREDIBLY GULLIBLE,

321
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,291
AND DID I SAY STUPID?

322
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,666
SHE'S A STUPID GIRL
WHO USES THE WORD STUPID

323
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,125
LIKE IT'S THE ONLY ONE
SHE KNOWS.

324
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,750
I'M ASHAMED TO
CALL HER LEADER.

325
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,375
- HMM.

326
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,708
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA

327
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,458
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
SHE'S CAUSED ME.

328
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,458
HOW CAN I TRUST HER
TO FIND THAT <i>TSUBA?</i>

329
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,375
SHE'S COMPLETELY HELPLESS
WITHOUT ME AND SHUYUU.

330
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,208
THAT'S WHY!

331
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,166
I CAN'T REMAIN HERE QUIETLY!

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,916
- QUITE A CHALLENGE.

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,250
- I LIKE A CHALLENGE.

334
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,666
- I WON'T GO EASY.

335
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,125
- I KNOW.

336
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,708
- ( both grunting )

337
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,916
- NINJA?!

338
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,875
- ( Koukin grunts )

339
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,250
- KOUKIN, YOU'RE AWESOME.

340
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,833
WHEN DID YOU LEARN TO BE
SUCH A STRONG FIGHTER?

341
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,833
- AW, COME ON!

342
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,916
THERE'S MORE THAN WE EXPECTED.

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,416
RYOMOU MIGHT BE IN DANGER.

344
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,583
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

345
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,375
MOU-CHAN WILL NEVER BE
DEFEATED BY THIS.

346
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,333
- LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE PLACE.

347
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,791
- IT APPEARS SO.

348
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,208
THANKS TO YOUR IMPATIENCE,

349
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,791
WE SEEM TO BE
THE FIRST ONES HERE.

350
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,083
- ( rumbling )
- ( gasps )

351
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,041
- ( roars )

352
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,875
- FORWARD ATTACK?

353
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,375
- HER RIGHT ARM.

354
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,416
( grunts )

355
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
- ( grunts )
MY SHEATH.

356
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,250
- ( grunting, exhales )

357
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,375
JOINT LOCK.

358
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,791
( groans )

359
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,708
( groaning )

360
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,916
- ( both groaning )

361
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,125
- JUST GIVE UP.

362
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,375
- ( all gasp )

363
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,375
- Hakufu: MOU-CHAN!

364
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,958
- Ryuubi: SHIRYUU!

365
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,750
- ( traffic sounds )

366
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,750
- I'M AN "A"-RANKED FIGHTER.

367
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,000
WHY AM I DOING MANUAL LABOR?

368
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,250
- KEEP QUIET.
REPAIRING THE DAMAGE

369
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,083
WE'VE ALL DONE IS
THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

370
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,875
- I'M KIND OF ENJOYING THIS.

371
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,958
- HEY!  HOW COME OUR LEADER 
ISN'T HELPING OUT WITH THIS?

372
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,208
HE SHOULD BE DOWN HERE.
- ( grumbles )

373
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,625
WELL, THEY--
HE'S RECUPERATING.

374
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,333
- Sousou:
KYOTO'S A PLACE THAT'S SEEN

375
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,458
CONTINUOUS BLOODSHED
FOR 1200 YEARS,

376
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,291
FROM THE HEIAN PERIOD
UNTIL THE FALL OF THE SHOGUNATE.

377
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,708
THIS CITY HAS BEEN INFESTED,

378
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,083
TEEMING WITH ALL SORTS
OF MONSTERS AND MURDERERS.

379
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,458
NO WONDER IT MAKES
OUR SACRED BEADS DANCE.

380
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,291
I WONDER-- THE FIGHTERS
I KILLED AT SEKIHEKI...

381
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,375
ARE THEIR SPIRITS
WANDERING ABOUT IN CHINA?

382
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,166
- I DON'T KNOW.

383
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,916
- IF IT'S GOD'S WILL,
THEN IT SHALL BE THEIR FATE.

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,750
- WELL THEN, SHALL WE GO
HAVE SOME FUN?

385
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,958
- HEY, YOU!

386
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,875
WE'RE HERE TO THANK
YOU FOR BEING SO GOOD

387
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,416
TO OUR YOUNGER BROTHERS.

388
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,583
- SO, DO YOU THINK TON WOULD
MIND TOO MUCH IF WE FOUGHT HERE?

389
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,500
- ( exhales )

390
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,958
- ( gasps )
YOU'RE AWAKE!

391
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,291
MOU-CHAN, WE FOUND YOU 
AND SHI-CHAN FROM SEITO

392
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,541
LYING TOGETHER ON THE GROUND.

393
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,208
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

394
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,541
- RYU-CHAN AND THE OTHERS
TOOK HER AWAY.

395
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,375
APPARENTLY SHE WAS
UNCONSCIOUS TOO.

396
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,083
- UNCONSCIOUS?

397
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,458
BOTH OF US WERE BADLY INJURED
IN THE BATTLE,

398
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,083
BUT BEFORE I PASSED OUT,
I SAW A DRAGON ON THE POND.

399
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,708
AND I REMEMBER THE BIG <i>TSUBA.</i>
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

400
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,833
DID YOU GET IT?
- IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT.

401
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,958
SO THE SPIRIT WAS LONG GONE
BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE.

402
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,000
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
YOU WERE BOTH HEALED BY

403
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,541
THE EFFECTS OF
THE SPIRIT ENERGY.

404
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,750
I TALKED TO THE STRATEGIST
FROM SEITO ACADEMY

405
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,750
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE THOUGH
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.

406
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,916
- THAT'S KOU-CHAN.
- UM, YEAH, THAT'S HER.

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,958
SO THAT MEANS NOW
THE BOTH OF YOU HAVE

408
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,916
A LOT MORE SPIRITUAL ENERGY.

409
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,916
- SO I SEE.

410
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,041
- I'M SO JEALOUS OF YOU,
MOU-CHAN.

411
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,666
I HAVEN'T ACCUMULATED
ANY SPIRITUAL ENERGY YET.

412
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,083
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE LAZY,
SONSAKU.

413
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,041
- YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR BED.

414
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,250
- HOLD ON.
WHY ARE BOTH YOU GUYS

415
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,000
ROLLING OUT YOUR FUTONS
IN HERE?

416
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,041
AREN'T YOU IN SEPARATE ROOMS?

417
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,958
- OH, COME ON, MOU-CHAN.

418
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,208
THIS IS OUR SCHOOL TRIP,
WHICH MEANS WE GET TO SPEND

419
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,791
ALL NIGHT TALKING ABOUT BOYS.

420
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,666
- TALK ABOUT B-BOYS?

421
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,750
- WE NEED TO KNOW, PLEASE.

422
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,250
- Both: PLEASE!

423
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,166
- ( sighs )

424
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,333
- Gakushu: I'M HEALED!

425
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,333
- SUCH A FAST RECOVERY.

426
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,750
KYOTO'S AMAZING.

427
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,750
THE OLD TOWN HAD MANY SPIRITS,

428
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,250
BUT THERE SHOULD BE EVEN MORE

429
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,125
SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
- INTERESTING.

430
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,583
ESPECIALLY SINCE KYOTO HAS
A LOT LESS PEOPLE THAN TOKYO.

431
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,250
THERE MIGHT EVEN BE MORE <i>TSUBA</i>

432
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,916
HIDING OUT THERE FOR US TO FIND.

433
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,958
- THE QUESTION IS:
HOW DO WE FIND THEM?

434
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,916
- WHAT DOES THE GUIDEBOOK SAY
ABOUT IT?

435
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,958
- IT SAYS...

436
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,375
- Ryuubi: 
I THINK SHIRYUU FELL ASLEEP.

437
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,916
THAT'S GOOD.

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,458
- WE SHOULD GET TO SLEEP TOO.

439
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,916
WE HAD A REALLY LONG DAY.

440
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,958
- YES, WE DID.
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.

441
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,666
SLEEP TIGHT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

442
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,000
- MM.
- GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.

443
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,125
- I'M TURNING THE LIGHTS OFF.

444
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,416
- I'M TOO WORKED UP TO SLEEP.

445
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,000
( exhales )
GENTOKU.

446
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,375
SHE'S ALREADY ASLEEP.

447
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,000
- ( giggles )
I'M STILL AWAKE.

448
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,125
- OH, REALLY?

449
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,166
- IT'S SO WEIRD.

450
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,166
TURNING OFF THE LIGHTS
ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL MORE AWAKE.

451
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,833
KAN'U, WOULD YOU MIND IF
WE TALKED FOR A WHILE?

452
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,666
MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP.

453
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,375
- SURE.  YOU AND I CAN TALK
IF YOU LIKE.

454
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,750
- THAT'S AWESOME!

455
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,750
IT JUST WOULDN'T FEEL
LIKE A REAL SCHOOL TRIP

456
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,791
WITHOUT A LITTLE GIRL TALK
UNDER THE COVERS.

457
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,500
- EKITOKU, STAYING UP LATE IS
BAD FOR YOUR COMPLEXION.

458
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,166
- HUH?

459
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,000
- ( moans )

460
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,750
I'M COLD.

461
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,166
- ( laughs )
- Ryuubi: KOUMEI...

462
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,625
( giggles )
THAT TICKLES.

463
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,291
- GENTOKU, YOU'RE SO WARM.

464
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,750
- KOUMEI, PLEASE.
THAT'S AGAINST SCHOOL RULES.

465
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,500
- UH...

466
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,333
- I WANNA GO SHOPPING
FOR SOUVENIRS.

467
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,333
WHAT'S KYOTO KNOWN FOR?

468
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,125
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!

469
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,125
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT SOUVENIRS
ARE JUST JUNK

470
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,708
THEY SELL TO STUPID TOURISTS?!

471
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,666
- ( sighs )
THEN WHAT SHOULD I BUY?

472
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,750
- ( sighs )

473
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,541
I'D BE HAPPY WITH
ANY GIFT FROM YOU.

474
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,416
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

475
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,250
- WHY WOULD BE
EXPECTING A GIFT?

476
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,125
- YOU COULD TAKE ME HOME
AS A GIFT.

477
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,500
- KOUMEI!

478
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,916
WHY ARE THE TWO OF YOU
ACTING SO WEIRD?

479
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,500
- ( Shiryuu chuckling )

480
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,791
- SHIRYUU, DID WE WAKE YOU?

481
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,625
- OF COURSE.

482
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,458
WOULD ANYONE HERE MIND IF
I JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION?

483
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,458
- THIS FINALLY FEELS LIKE
A REAL SCHOOL TRIP.

484
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,041
EVEN THERE WE'RE ONLY HERE
TO COLLECT <i>TSUBA.</i>

485
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,375
- IT'S KINDA FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

486
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,083
HERE WE ARE, FELLOW FIGHTERS,

487
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,291
ENGAGING IN SOMETHING
AS ORDINARY AS GIRL TALK.

488
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,291
- KAN'U, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

489
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,875
- ( sighs )
I WONDER...

490
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,333
WHAT IF I WAS BORN
AN ORDINARY GIRL? 

491
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:11,250
STUDIED AND PLAYED
LIKE AN ORDINARY GIRL?

492
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,666
- ( all gasp )
- LIVED LIKE AN ORDINARY GIRL?

493
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,958
MY LIFE WOULD BE SIMPLE,
PEACEFUL AND FUN.

494
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,791
I WOULDN'T BE
CONSTANTLY IN DANGER

495
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,250
OR WORRYING ABOUT
COLLECTING <i>TSUBA.</i>

496
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,458
I COULD JUST LIVE MY LIFE
FOR ME.

497
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,625
BUT THEN, WOULD I
HAVE MET ALL OF YOU?

498
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:29,041
IF I HADN'T BEEN BORN
GENTOKU RYUUBI,

499
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,041
WOULD WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS?

500
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,041
WOULD I HAVE MET YOU,
EKITOKU?

501
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,875
KOUMEI, SHIRYUU?
AND KAN'U?

502
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,750
DO YOU THINK WE WOULD HAVE?

503
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,458
- WHO KNOWS?

504
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,000
- DIFFICULT TO SAY.

505
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,791
- Kan'u: OF COURSE YOU WOULD.
- HMM?

506
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,375
- NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE
BORN IN THIS WORLD,

507
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,416
MY PLACE IS AT YOUR SIDE.

508
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,833
IT'S JUST THAT AT THIS
PARTICULAR TIME,

509
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,500
WE HAPPENED TO BE BORN
AS KAN'U AND GENTOKU. 

510
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,875
THIS SACRED BEADS
MAY INFLUENCE OUR LIVES,

511
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,041
BUT I WON'T ALLOW THEM
TO AFFECT OUR BOND.

512
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,458
NEVER.

513
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,833
WE MAY HAVE BEEN BORN
ON DIFFERENT DAYS,

514
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:06,458
BUT ON THE DAY THAT WE DIE,
WE WILL DIE TOGETHER.

515
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,750
- OH, KAN'U.

516
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,125
- CAN WE ALL TAKE THAT OATH?

517
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,375
- OF COURSE WE CAN, KOUMEI.

518
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,083
- ( gasps )
YES!

519
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,750
- All: ALL OF PRESENT HERE
DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR

520
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,958
WE MAY HAVE BEEN BORN
ON DIFFERENT DAYS,

521
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:30,125
BUT ON THE DAY WE DIE,
WE DIE TOGETHER.

522
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,708
- IT'S MORNING!

523
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,541
MOU-CHAN, RIKU-CHIN, WAKE UP!

524
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:56,291
COME ON, WAKE UP!
LET'S GO GET BREAKFAST!

525
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,291
- ( groans )

526
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,583
BE QUIET!

527
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,541
- ( door slams )

528
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,125
- MOU-CHAN IS SCARY
IN THE MORNING.

529
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,583
SHE'S SCARY
IN THE DAYTIME TOO.

530
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,958
BUT SHE'S SO CUTE
WHEN SHE'S SLEEPING.

531
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,166
OH, GOOD MORNING, KOUKIN.

532
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,583
- GOOD MORNING.
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

533
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,875
- THEY'RE STILL SLEEPING.

534
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,791
PROBABLY STILL EXHAUSTED
FROM YESTERDAY.

535
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,958
THEY'RE NOT TRAINING
HARD ENOUGH.  HMM!

536
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,291
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

537
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,583
SINCE YOU DIDN'T
FIGHT WITH THEM.

538
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,375
- I DIDN'T, DID I?

539
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,833
OH, WHATEVER.
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO THEM.

540
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,208
TODAY THEY'LL SEE
MY BEST MOVES.

541
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,208
( gasps )
A GIFT SHOP!

542
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,708
- HE BEST MOVES, HUH?

543
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,333
- WE'LL SEE.

544
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:39,458
- I NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING NICE FOR CHUUBO.

545
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,666
BUT I'M NOT SURE
WHAT SHE'D LIKE.

546
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,416
HMM?  UGLY.

547
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,958
WHO'D BUY THAT?

548
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,291
- ( grunts )
IT'S YOU AGAIN.

549
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,666
- HUH?  KAN-CHAN, SO YOU'VE
BEEN STAYING HERE TOO?

550
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,666
- DON'T CALL ME THAT.

551
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,458
- HUH?!  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!
WHY NOT?!

552
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:01,375
- ( groans )

553
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,541
I'LL TAKE FIVE OF THESE.

554
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,416
- HUH?
YOU'RE BUYING FIVE?

555
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,750
WHAT HORRIBLE PERSON
WOULD WANT THAT AS A GIFT?

556
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,000
- ( grunts )

557
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,208
- AAH!

558
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,625
- HAKUFU!

559
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,916
- BEST TO KEEP HER ON A LEASH,
OR ELSE.

560
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
PROBLEM?

561
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,291
- DAMN YOU!

562
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,541
OKAY, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

563
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,166
I MUST BE LOSING
MY SPIRITUAL ENERGY.

564
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,666
- HAKUFU!

565
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,666
- NICE CATCH.

566
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,333
- ( groans )
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

567
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:32,791
- GOOD QUESTION.

568
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,208
I ALWAYS CARRY MY GREEN
DRAGON BLADE WITH ME.

569
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,666
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT AND YOU KNOW IT!

570
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,125
( grunts )
UH-OH.

571
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,791
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

572
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,583
- AAH!

573
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,750
- HEY, YOU BITCHES!

574
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,708
- ( gasps )

575
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,250
- OUR YOUNGER AND OLDER BROTHERS

576
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,500
WANNA GIVE SOME PAYBACK!

577
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,291
THE ONE WITH
THE GLASSES IS MINE.

578
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,875
- NO!  GENTOKU!

579
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,375
- COMING THROUGH!

580
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,500
- ( gasps )

581
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,541
- TAKE THIS!

582
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,916
- ( screams )

583
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,416
- WHOA!

584
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,291
THAT REALLY DOES FEEL FANTASTIC.

585
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,375
I CAN FEEL GREAT POWER
GROWING WITHIN ME.

586
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,333
IS THIS SPIRITUAL ENERGY?

587
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:16,333
- COME ON, SPIRITUAL ENERGY
DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

588
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,708
- STUPID GIRL INDEED.

589
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,833
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR, HUH?

590
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,083
- TAKE THAT!

591
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,500
- ( groans )
- DID YOU LIKE IT?

592
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,250
HOW ABOUT THIS?

593
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:27,791
- SHAMEFUL.
SHE ENJOYS INFLICTING VIOLENCE.

594
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,916
SUCH DISGRACE.
- AAH!

595
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,375
- ( exhales, groans )

596
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,708
UNFORGIVEABLE.

597
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,625
- ( men yelling )

598
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,958
- UNFORGIVEABLE!

599
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,333
- KAN-CHAN!
THAT'S TOO MUCH!  STOP!

600
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,250
- DON'T CALL ME KAN-CHAN!

601
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,500
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STARTED THIS.

602
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
- ( murmurs )
- STOP!

603
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,083
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

604
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,041
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

605
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,625
- KAN-CHAN, STOP!

606
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,125
- SILENCE!

607
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,958
- ( grunts, groans )

608
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,583
OKAY, I GET IT.

609
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,458
I DON'T WANNA CAUSE
ANYMORE TROUBLE.

610
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,125
LET'S STOP THE FIGHT
FOR TODAY.

611
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,125
THIS FIGHT HASN'T EVEN
STARTED YET!

612
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,708
HA!
- AAH!

613
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,166
( grunts )
- ( groans )

614
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,625
- OH, NO...

615
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,625
- I'LL KILL YOU.

616
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:27,458
- Ekitoku:
KAN'U'S GONE TOTALLY CRAZY.

617
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,375
- Ryuubi: WHERE IS SHE?
WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

618
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,583
- THAT WAY.

619
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,083
- WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

620
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,958
- ( car horn honking )
- YEP, THERE SHE IS.

621
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,875
- WHERE IS SHE?
- RYOMOU, LOOK AT THIS.

622
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,916
- Reporter:
THIS JUST IN-- A FIGHT

623
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,416
HAS BROKEN OUT IN KYOTO.

624
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,375
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
INSTIGATED BY FIGHTERS

625
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,791
FROM KANTO.
ACCORDING TO REPORTS...

626
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,708
- SONSAKU'S FAMOUS.
SHE'S ON TV.

627
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,708
- ( groans ) 
STUPID IDIOT.

628
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,250
- Hakufu:
I SAID I WAS SORRY!

629
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,166
- APOLOGIZE BY DYING!

630
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,625
- ENOUGH!

631
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,833
HA!

632
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,625
AAH!

633
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,541
- HA!
- ( shouts )

634
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:11,541
SORRY ABOUT THIS!

635
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:12,833
I'LL HAVE TO PAY YOU BACK.

636
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,208
- ( grunting )

637
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,166
- WELL, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

638
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,166
TAKE THIS!

639
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,916
HA!

640
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,500
( groans )

641
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,125
- YOU CALL THAT FIGHTING?

642
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,458
- ( pole clangs )
- ( gasps )

643
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,625
- YOU CALL YOURSELF
NANYO'S LEADER?

644
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,000
THEN WHY DO YOU REFUSE
TO ATTACK ME DIRECTLY?

645
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,458
- IF THIS IS HOW
NANYO ACADEMY FIGHTS,

646
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,916
THEN YOU ALL MUST BE NOTHING
BUT A BUNCH OF WEAK IDIOTS. 

647
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

648
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,291
I KNOW I'M PRETTY STUPID.

649
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,708
I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH OR
THE SKILL TO FIGHT LIKE YOU DO,

650
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,375
BUT I-- I CAN'T--

651
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,333
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO CALL
MOU-CHAN OR KOUKIN STUPID TOO!

652
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,416
HOW'S THIS FOR DIRECT?!

653
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,250
- ( groaning )

654
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,791
( shouts )
- ( gasps )

655
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:18,833
- TAKE THIS!

656
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,833
- ( shouts )

657
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,125
- ( groans )

658
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,833
- ( both grunting )

659
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,916
- ( giggles )

660
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,041
- HMM.

661
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,916
- ( both shouting, grunting )

662
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,625
- ( panting )

663
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,708
- ( panting )

664
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,250
( grunts )

665
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,875
I DON'T WANT YOUR SYMPATHY.

666
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,958
- AND I WOULD NEVER GIVE IT.

667
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:48,416
I CAN BEAT YOU EVEN 
WITH ONE EYE CLOSED.

668
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,875
- IS THAT A JOKE?
- UH, NO.

669
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,291
- WELL, IT SUCKED!

670
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,750
- I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

671
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,958
( groans )
- AHH!

672
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:02,041
- ( both grunting, groaning )

673
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,500
- HA!

674
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,208
- Ekitoku: UGH.

675
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,166
WHY ARE YOU GUYS HERE?

676
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,666
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR HAKUFU.

677
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,833
- DO YOU THINK THEY'RE UP THERE?

678
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,083
- ( all gasp )

679
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,291
- Ryomou: SONSAKU!

680
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,500
- Koukin: HAKUFU!

681
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,750
- Ryuubi: KAN'U!

682
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,416
- Ekitoku: KAN'U!

683
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,750
- YOU STAY BACK!
- STAY AWAY!

684
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,750
DON'T WORRY.

685
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,083
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

686
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:47,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.

687
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,166
- ( all murmur )

688
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,708
- ( both grunting )

689
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,000
- HA!

690
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,166
- HA!

691
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,625
- ( whimpers )

692
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:20,916
- ( both groan softly )

693
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,916
- KAN'U!

694
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,875
- HAKUFU!

695
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,375
- WHAT IS THAT?

696
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,125
- THE <i>TSUBA!</i>

697
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,708
- BUT WHY?

698
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,541
- IT APPEARS THAT
THE <i>TSUBA</i> RAINED DOWN

699
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,916
IN REACTION TO
THEIR EPIC BATTLE.

700
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,041
I THINK.

701
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,916
- KAN'U.

702
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,583
- ( groans )
KOUKIN...

703
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,250
IS IT BREAKFAST TIME YET?

704
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,666
- ( all sigh )

705
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,375
- HEY.
- All: HUH?

706
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,708
- PLEASE TELL HAKUFU THAT--

707
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:04,166
THAT THE TWO OF US CAN
SETTLE THIS BACK IN KANTO.

708
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,333
- UNDERSTOOD.
- ( sighs )

709
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,291
- ( exhales )

710
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,708
- I MEAN THIS SINCERELY...

711
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,291
YOU HAVE A REALLY STUPID LEADER.

712
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,916
- Ryomou: YES, WE DO.

713
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,958
- ( traffic sounds )

714
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,375
- SO...

715
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,583
SHALL WE SAY THIS ONE
DOESN'T COUNT?

716
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,583
- SHUT UP.

717
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,208
- KAN'U SEEMS ANGRY.

718
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,875
- QUIET.

719
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:39,250
- HI, THERE.
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

720
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,666
- HUH? 
- HERE.

721
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,708
- OH.

722
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,333
- WHAT ARE THEY?

723
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,125
- I THOUGHT THEY'D MAKE
GOOD SOUVENIRS

724
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,958
OF OUR SHUUGAKU TRIP
IF WE ALL KEPT ONE.

725
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,625
DO YOU LIKE THEM?

726
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,750
- THEY LOOK PRETTY STUPID.

727
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,291
- THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU.

728
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,083
I WOULD BE HONORED
TO HAVE ONE.

729
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,875
- ( giggles )

730
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:04,125
- KOUKIN, DO YOU THINK
THAT BATTLE

731
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,083
MIGHT HAVE MADE ME
STRONGER?

732
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,291
- NOT SURE.

733
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,250
I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT
WHEN WE GET HOME.

734
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,625
- WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS
STRENGTHEN YOUR MIND

735
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,666
AND STOP ACTING LIKE
A STUPID LEADER.

736
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,208
- WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?

737
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,208
- ( jingling )

738
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,291
- SO NOW I CAN BUILD

739
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,916
MY MUSCLES IN SPIRITUAL POWER

740
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,291
AT THE SAME TIME.

741
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,833
TWO BIRDS, ONE STONE.

742
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,041
- Female announcer:
THE SHINKANSEN FROM HAKATA

743
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,291
AND BOUND FOR TOKYO
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY.

744
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,250
PASSENGERS SHOULD PREPARE TO
BOARD ON THE PLATFORM.

745
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,833
- WE SHOULD GET GOING.
- OKAY.

746
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,250
LET'S GO HOME!

747
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:38,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

748
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,083
- Girl: LOOK, THE BULLET
TRAIN'S COMING!

749
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,541
- HELLO.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

750
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,541
- Ekitoku:
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

751
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,666
- Soujin:
WOW, TALK ABOUT COINCIDENCE.

752
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

753
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,750
I REALIZED I NEVER REPAID YOU
FOR TRYING TO TAKE MY LIFE.

754
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,291
- THAT'S NEWS TO ME.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

755
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,000
- UH, YOU GUYS LEFT!

756
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,833
YOU LEFT US THERE ALONE TO FIX
THE DAMAGE OURSELVES!

757
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,458
- NO, NOT HERE.

758
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,916
WE SHOULDN'T FIGHT
ABOUT THIS HERE.

759
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,333
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

760
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,708
I'M COMPLETELY HEALED.

761
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,625
- I FEEL TOTALLY AWESOME!

762
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,791
- WELL, I FEEL MORE AWESOME
THAN YOU.

763
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,541
- HAKUFU!
RYOMOU, PLEASE STOP HER.

764
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:20,666
HUH?

765
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,041
- LET'S SETTLE OUR ISSUES
WITH KANTO IN KANTO.

766
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,416
- ( whimpering )

767
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,208
- WELL, AS THEY SAY,

768
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,541
HOME IS WHERE
THE BEST BATTLES ARE.

769
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,916
RIGHT?
