1
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,541
- ( theme music playing )


2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,333
- ( vocalizing )


3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:39,041
( singing in Japanese )


4
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,625
- SHIRYUU CHOU'UN,

5
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,250
IF YOU TAKE ONE MORE STEP
TOWARDS US...

6
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,583
I'LL SEPARATE GENTOKU RYUUBI'S
HEAD FROM HER BODY.

7
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,666
- SO IF I PROMISE TO FIGHT YOU
UNDER YOUR TERMS,

8
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,083
DO YOU GUARANTEE THAT
YOU WON'T LAY A FINGER ON,

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,583
OR HARM OUR LEADER IN ANY WAY?

10
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,458
- PLEASE DON'T AGREE TO THIS,
SHIRYU!

11
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,875
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

12
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,500
I DIDN'T SURRENDER
WITHOUT REASON,

13
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,125
I DID AS SHE ASKED
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA SEE

14
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,750
ANYMORE PEOPLE GET HURT.

15
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,958
- LEADER...

16
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,208
- YOU HAVE MY WORD.

17
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,166
HOWEVER, KEEP IN MIND
THAT IF YOU LOSE,

18
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,458
SEITO WILL CEASE TO EXIST
AS OF TODAY.

19
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,250
- A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT.

20
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,125
OKAY, A LITTLE MORE.
RIGHT THERE!

21
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,375
HOLD STEADY, AND...

22
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,750
ALL RIGHT!
FINALLY GOT IT!

23
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,666
OKAY, NOW LET'S GO MORE
TO THE LEFT.

24
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,083
AND SHIFT, SHIFT.

25
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,000
- WHAT KIND OF FRUIT IS THIS?

26
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,166
- WHO CARES WHAT IT IS.

27
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,375
I HAVEN'T EATEN IN FOREVER.

28
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,000
HERE GOES NOTHING!

29
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,208
( groans )

30
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,208
IT'S SOUR.

31
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,625
- DELICIOUS.
- HUH?

32
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,583
NO WAY!

33
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,833
( gasps )

34
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,916
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

35
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,416
- I'M GUESSING
IT'S NANBAN HIGH.

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,541
- ( gasps )

37
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,041
SO THAT MEANS...

38
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,041
YOU AND I HAVE TO SNEAK IN THERE
AND RESCUE EVERYBODY ELSE,

39
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,750
AM I RIGHT?
- ( sighs, grunts )

40
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,166
- HEY, WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

41
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,625
- QUIET.
DOWN THERE.

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,625
- HUH?

43
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,041
KAN'U.

44
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,208
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE
ABLE TO GET CHOUHI TOO.

45
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,083
KAN'U, ON MY HONOR
AS A FIGHTER,

46
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,875
I PROMISE
I WILL COME FIND YOU.

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,666
- THIS IS COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS!

48
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,791
WHAT ELSE DOES THE LETTER SAY?

49
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
- Rikuson: "SHIMEI RYOMOU
AND KOUKIN SHUYUU

50
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,000
ARE NOW OUR HOSTAGES.

51
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,416
WE DEMAND THAT NANYO'S LEADER
SURRENDER AND PLEDGE

52
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
HER UNDYING ALLEGIANCE
TO THE ALMIGHTY KENTEI.

53
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,750
IF SHE REFUSES TO COMPLY,

54
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,541
WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY
OF BOTH HOSTAGES."

55
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,625
I'D BET YOU ANYTHING THAT
AN IDENTICAL LETTER

56
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,250
WAS SENT TO BOTH
KYOSHO AND SEITO.

57
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,958
- SO THAT MEANS THE BIG
FIGHTERS' TOURNAMENT

58
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,583
WAS ALL A TRAP?

59
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,041
- IT ONLY MAKES SENSE,

60
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,958
SINCE THE ENEMY'S OBJECTIVE
WAS TO SPLIT EVERYONE UP.

61
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,375
THIS COULD BE BAD.

62
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,583
- YES, WE SHOULD
CONSIDER OURSELVES FORTUNATE

63
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,500
THAT SONSAKU'S NOT
WITH US NOW.

64
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,375
- ( bell dings )

65
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,583
- YAHOO!

66
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,000
THIS FEELS GREAT!

67
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,458
WHOO-HOO!

68
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,916
- WAIT FOR ME!

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,625
YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST FOR ME,
BIG SISTER!

70
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,500
- PEDAL FASTER, BIG SISTER!
FASTER!

71
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,916
- ARE YOU DOING OKAY UP THERE?!

72
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,500
- YOU HAVE TO COME UP HERE,
CHUUBO.

73
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,541
THE VIEW REALLY IS
SOMETHING ELSE.

74
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,416
- OH, DON'T BE SILLY.
I CAN'T CLIMB.

75
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,333
- AH!  AHH!  AHH!

76
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,750
AH-CHOO!

77
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,666
- OH, DID BIG SISTER
CATCH A SUMMER COLD?

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,291
BIG SISTER HAKUFU!
I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY

79
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,875
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO EAT LUNCH.
- ( giggles )

80
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

81
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,291
AND YOU GOT GENPOU NAKED
AS WELL?

82
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,625
- WHY DON'T YOU 
JOIN US, CHUUBO?

83
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,583
THE WATER'S COOL
AND FEELS GREAT.

84
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,041
- I CAN'T JUST--

85
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,875
WHAT IF SOMEONE WERE
TO SEE THE TWO OF YOU?

86
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,625
HOW SHAMELESS CAN YOU BE?

87
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,500
- OH, COME ON, NOBODY'S
WATCHING US THIS FAR OUT.

88
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,333
HA!  GUESS MISS MODESTY'S
TOO EMBARRASSED

89
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,541
TO COME IN, RIGHT?

90
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,000
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,625
WANTING TO ACT LIKE A LADY.
- HUH?

92
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,000
( snickers )

93
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,875
OW OW OW OW OW!
IT HURTS!

94
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,083
OW!  MY POOR LEG'S CRAMPED!

95
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,375
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
BIG SISTER?

96
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,916
- ( yells )

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,583
- NOW JUST TRY
AND GRAB MY HAND.

98
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,333
- HA!  SUCKER!

99
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,333
- AAH!

100
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,875
- GOTCHA!

101
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,541
- OH!
THAT WAS MEAN!

102
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,291
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TRICKED ME.

103
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,666
- AND OFF IT GOES!

104
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,166
AND NOW FOR THE FINAL 
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE...

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,250
- NO!

106
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,666
- THERE!
NOW YOU CAN HAVE

107
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,875
AS MUCH FUN AS US TWO.

108
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,458
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

109
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

110
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,666
AAH!

111
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,458
AMAZING.

112
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,125
- AND BACK YOU GO.

113
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:27,083
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE
ABLE TO CONTROL WATER AT WILL?

114
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,041
- AW, MAN.

115
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,916
I'M JUST LAYING HERE RELAXING

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,125
WHILE KOUKIN AND MOU-CHAN ARE
OFF DOING THEIR BEST

117
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,916
IN THE TOURNAMENT.

118
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,250
- Ryomou: THE WOUND HE SUFFERED
WHILE BATTLING RYOFU

119
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,083
SHOULD HAVE HEALED BY NOW.

120
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,083
SO WHY IS SAJI...

121
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,083
STILL--

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,333
SAJI!  WHAT'S WRONG?!

123
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,750
- LUCKILY THE DOCTOR SAYS
IT'S NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

124
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,708
- BUT IT WAS STILL A SURPRISE.

125
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,458
AND TO SEE YOU
COLLAPSE LIKE THAT.

126
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,666
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I WAS FEVERISH

127
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,708
FROM MY DATE WITH YOU,
MOU-CHAN.

128
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,375
- DON'T BE STUPID.
I WAS REALLY WORRIED!

129
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,583
- THANK YOU, MOU-CHAN.

130
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,500
- ALL THIS HAPPENED,

131
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,666
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO GO.

132
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,916
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,250
- ( munching loudly )

134
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,500
HEY!  HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO KEEP US COOPED UP IN HERE?!

135
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,916
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THE TOURNAMENT?!

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,666
I DEMAND TO SPEAK
TO YOUR LEADER!

137
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,041
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

138
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,666
( groans )
MORON.

139
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,666
FUCK YOU!
IF YOU WON'T TALK TO ME,

140
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,000
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING ELSE
TO TALK--

141
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,375
- SAVE YOUR BREATH ALREADY.

142
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,125
NOTHING YOU SAY WILL
DO US ANY GOOD.

143
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,541
- AND WHY'S THAT?

144
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,166
- ONE THING I BET
YOU DIDN'T KNOW

145
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,583
IS THAT NANBAN HIGH IS
MADE UP OF REJECTS

146
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,041
FROM ALL THE OTHER SCHOOLS.
- HANG ON.

147
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,875
UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN,
I HEARD RUMORS THAT 

148
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,791
YOU GUYS HAD AN ALLIANCE
WITH THEM AT ONE POINT. 

149
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,500
- AT ONE POINT.
BUT EVEN BACK THEN,

150
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,458
WE COULDN'T ACTUALLY 
TALK WITH THOSE GUYS.

151
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

152
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,250
- BEFORE THEY STARTED TRYING
TO CONTROL EVERYTHING,

153
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,500
THEY HAD ENOUGH PROBLEMS

154
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,208
TRYING TO DECIDE WHO WAS
GONNA BE THEIR LEADER.

155
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,750
AND WHEN ALL WAS
SAID AND DONE,

156
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,333
THEIR LEADERS WERE
TWO SISTERS--

157
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,208
MOUKAKU AND MOUYUU.

158
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,791
- Shuhou:
AND THESE TWO ARE RUTHLESS.

159
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
THEY WEREN'T WILLING TO HELP
THEIR FRIENDS

160
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,583
OR COOPERATE WITH ANYONE.

161
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,250
BECAUSE OF THAT,

162
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,916
IT'S A WONDER THEY EVER GOT
TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,458
TO TRAP ALL OF US
LIKE THEY DID.

164
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,875
- WHAT THEN?

165
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,375
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S KENTEI,

166
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,125
AND NOT THOSE TWO
WHO ARE LEADING THE SHOW?

167
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,833
- PROBABLY.

168
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,833
THEN AGAIN THAT DOESN'T
HELP US VERY MUCH.

169
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,500
SINCE WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHO KENTEI IS.

170
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,500
- ( door opens )

171
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,208
- HEY!

172
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,625
DON'T TOSS THE INJURED AROUND
LIKE THEY'RE SANDBAGS!

173
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,291
- CHOUHI, WAKE UP!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

174
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,750
- ( groans )

175
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,750
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

176
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,166
- WE'RE AT NANBAN HIGH.
WE'RE BEING KEPT IN A CELL.

177
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,833
HOLD ON, WASN'T KAN'U
WITH YOU EARLIER?

178
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,083
- DID YOU LOSE HER
WHEN YOU JUMPED OFF THE BOAT?

179
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,875
- KAN'U.

180
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,125
I REMEMBER NOW.

181
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,125
SHE CAN'T EVEN SEE.

182
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,625
I COULDN'T EVEN HELP HER.
DAMMIT!

183
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,750
- HA!

184
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,958
SO WHAT DUMB BASTARD WAS
STUPID ENOUGH

185
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,375
TO SEND US SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

186
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,666
- PLEASE CALM DOWN, KAKOUTON.

187
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,666
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER
THAT KENTEI ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

188
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,416
TRYING TO GAIN SUPREMACY
OVER KANTO.

189
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,750
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

190
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,375
COME TO THINK OF IT,

191
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,583
WE AREN'T EVEN SURE
WHO KILLED KAKUKA, EITHER.

192
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,833
I'D BE DISRESPECTING HIM
IF I LOST SIGHT

193
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,750
OF THE TRUE REASON
THAT WE FIGHT.

194
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,750
AND TO LOSE THAT WILL BE 
TRULY DISGRACEFUL FOR US.

195
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,041
- I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE ON THAT ONE.

196
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,833
- MOUTOKU.

197
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,333
- HEY, TON.
COME TAKE A WALK WITH ME.

198
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,083
THERE'S SOMEPLACE 
I WANT YOU TO SEE.

199
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,083
BACK IN THE DAY,

200
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,250
YOU, ME AND KAKUKA CAME HERE
ALL THE TIME, DIDN'T WE?

201
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,916
- YEAH, BUT THAT STUPID FOOL,

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,791
HE HAD THE ROTTEN NERVE TO DIE
BEFORE THE REST OF US.

203
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,166
- ( water splashes )

204
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE WATER?

205
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,458
- TON.

206
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,458
KAKUKA IS STILL ALIVE.

207
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,458
- ( sharply gasps )

208
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,083
- YO.

209
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,875
YOU ALWAYS DID HAVE
TERRIBLE TASTE IN CLOTHES.

210
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,041
- BUT YOU--

211
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,250
AREN'T YOU DEAD?

212
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,500
- ( chuckles )

213
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,583
I DON'T KNOW.

214
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,291
WHAT MATTERS IS
RIGHT NOW

215
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,166
THERE'S A CRAZY BASTARD LOOSE,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

216
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,333
- WHAT'S THAT?

217
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,958
COME ON, CAN'T YOU GIVE ME
A STRAIGHT ANSWER?!

218
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,666
- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

219
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,958
BUT KYOCHO AND SOUJIN ARE
AT THE TOURNAMENT?

220
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,708
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
THEY ARE.

221
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,750
AND NOW WE HAVE TO HURRY UP
AND RESCUE THEM.

222
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,958
- SOMEONE WILL,
BUT IT WON'T BE US.

223
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,500
- WHO?

224
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,958
- IT'LL BE THOSE
FROM ACROSS THE HORIZON.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,416
- WOW!

226
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,875
IT'S BEEN
PRACTICALLY FOREVER

227
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,583
SINCE I'VE HAD
A CHUUBO BOXED LUNCH!

228
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,875
- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO EAT
AS MUCH AS YOU'D LIKE.

229
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,708
- WELL, DON'T MIND IF I DO.

230
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,166
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!

231
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,541
AH, DELICIOUS!

232
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,708
HMM?

233
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,125
- HUH?

234
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,000
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

235
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,250
- SOMEBODY'S WATCHING US.
- HUH?!

236
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,083
WHE-- WHERE ARE THEY?

237
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,666
- THEY'RE NOT HERE.

238
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,500
THEY'RE WAY...

239
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,291
WAY OVER THERE.

240
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,166
- ( birds squawking )

241
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,666
- YOU SEEM TO MISS THE THRILL
 OF FIGHTING, HAKUFU SONSAKU.

242
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,458
- IS THAT SOUSOU FROM KYOSHO?

243
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,166
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

244
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,625
- WAY BACK WHEN,

245
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,250
AT THE BATTLE OF RED CLIFFS...

246
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,250
YOU SAVED MY LIFE

247
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,416
WITH THE POWER
OF YOUR LIFE FORCE.

248
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,416
- WITH WHAT?
THE POWER OF MY LIFE FORCE?

249
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,250
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

250
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,958
- THEN ANSWER ME
THIS QUESTION.

251
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,291
WHAT IS IT THAT
WE FIGHTERS FIGHT FOR?

252
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,958
- HUH?

253
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,250
I DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
MORE THRILLING TO ME

254
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,875
THAN FIGHTING STRONG OPPONENTS.

255
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,500
AND THE STRONGER
THE OPPONENT I FIGHT,

256
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,500
THE MUCH STRONGER I BECOME.

257
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,083
- SO, IS THAT ALL?
- HUH?

258
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,833
- YOU'RE A LEADER, AREN'T YOU?

259
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,375
- UH, YES?

260
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,291
- SO TELL ME WHY YOU WANT
TO BECOME STRONGER.

261
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,875
- UH, WELL, UH...

262
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,875
I WANT TO BECOME STRONGER,
BECAUSE...

263
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,916
BY BECOMING STRONGER,

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,041
I'M ABLE TO PROTECT PEOPLE.

265
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,291
( gasps )

266
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,125
WAS THAT IT?
- THERE'S AN ENEMY.

267
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,750
AN ENEMY WHO DESPISES
US FIGHTERS,

268
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,083
AN ENEMY WHO WANTS
TO DESTROY US.

269
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,250
- DESTROY?
- GO.

270
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,125
FULFILL YOUR MISSION
AS A FIGHTER

271
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,500
AND YOUR MISSION
AS A LEADER.

272
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,708
YOU MUST DO IT
FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE

273
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,625
WHO WILL TRUST 
AND FOLLOW YOU.

274
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,583
THEREIN LIES
YOUR GREATEST STRENGTH.

275
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,333
- I'M SORRY, CHUUBO.

276
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,541
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO ENJOY
YOUR BOXED LUNCH

277
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,041
SOME OTHER TIME.

278
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,125
- AS LONG AS IT'S
A PROMISE, BIG SISTER.

279
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,958
- PLEASE TAKE CARE,
 BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

280
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,333
- I'LL SEE YOU TWO
AGAIN LATER.

281
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,083
- SEE YOU SOON!

282
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,416
POOR BIG SISTER.

283
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,708
EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR HER.

284
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,666
A GREAT BATTLE IS
SUMMONING BIG SISTER.

285
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,541
- Chuubo: BIG SISTER...

286
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,208
- WELCOME TO MY GREAT CASTLE,
UNCHO KAN'U.

287
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,000
- WHO ARE YOU?!

288
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,166
- MY NAME IS KENTEI.

289
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,375
I AM SUPREME RULER
AND EMPEROR.

290
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,958
- I SEE.

291
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,166
SO YOU'RE THE FOOL
WHO THINKS HE'S KENTEI.

292
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,916
- YOU'D BEST
WATCH YOUR TONGUE.

293
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,375
DO NOT FORGET THAT
YOUR FRIENDS ARE MY HOSTAGES.

294
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,208
- WHY DID YOU SO DEFILE
 OUR SACRED TOURNAMENT?

295
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,833
ON WHAT GROUNDS DID YOU
BESMIRCH ITS NAME?

296
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,208
IF YOU WISHED FOR
ULTIMATE SOVEREIGNTY,

297
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,208
YOU NEEDED ONLY
TO FIGHT US FAIRLY!

298
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,583
- ( chuckles ) 
FIGHT, YOU SAY?

299
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,291
THAT IS THE ONLY THING

300
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,583
FOOLS LIKE YOU
EVER KNOW AND LIVE FOR.

301
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,791
YOUR DESTINY IS ONE OF
MUTUAL DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

302
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,708
- YOU'RE WRONG!

303
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,833
WE FIGHTERS WORK HARD EVERY DAY
TO HONE OUR SKILLS,

304
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,250
AS WE DREAM OF ACHIEVING
COMPLETE DOMINANCE.

305
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,208
WE EACH SHARE THAT DREAM

306
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,958
AND FIGHT FOR THAT SINGLE BOND
BETWEEN US!

307
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,541
- YOU SPOUT SUCH NONSENSE.

308
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:14,791
ONLY THE FEW CHOSEN 
SHALL WRITE HISTORY.

309
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,000
NO NUMBER OF YOU
LOWLY FOOT SOLDIERS

310
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,625
WILL MAKE ANY REAL DIFFERENCE
IN THIS WORLD.

311
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,208
AND YOU WILL AMOUNT TO 
NOTHING MORE THAN MICE.

312
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,625
- FINE THEN.

313
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,916
WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN
AND LEARN

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,458
HOW WEAK
THIS MOUSE REALLY IS.

315
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,083
COME DOWN HERE AND FIGHT ME
IN SINGLE COMBAT.

316
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,708
- ( chuckles )
 DO NOT WORRY.

317
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,333
THE BIG FIGHTERS' TOURNAMENT
WILL BE HELD.

318
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,666
HOWEVER...

319
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,250
- ( growling )

320
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,833
- ...IT WILL BE
ACCORDING TO MY RULES.

321
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,291
( laughing )

322
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,458
- MY EYE.

323
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,375
- KAN'U...

324
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,291
( groaning )
I'M COMING NOW.  AAH.

325
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,125
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE MOVING AROUND
IN YOUR CONDITION.

326
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,958
- IF YOU FIGHT, YOU'LL JUST MAKE
YOUR INJURIES WORSE.

327
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,583
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

328
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,291
IF I DON'T GO TO KAN'U,
WHO KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN.

329
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,458
- QUIT YOUR BAWLING ALREADY,
YOU WHINY FUCKWIT.

330
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,375
- AAH!
- MOUKAKU!

331
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,500
- HEH HEH.  I JUST STOPPED BY
TO KILL SOME TIME,

332
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,291
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU'D ALL BE SO SPUNKY.

333
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,583
- MOUKAKU.
YOU'RE NANBAN HIGH'S LEADER.

334
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,583
- DAMN YOU!
WHAT'VE YOU DONE WITH KAN'U?

335
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,916
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

336
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,958
YOU WERE PASSED OUT
THE ENTIRE TIME,

337
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,458
SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW,
WOULD YOU?

338
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,375
- WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT?!

339
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,333
THAT THE FOOLISH WOMAN
GAVE HERSELF UP

340
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,375
IN ORDER TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

341
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,583
SHE'S PROBABLY WITH KENTEI
RIGHT NOW, AS WE SPEAK.

342
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,000
- JUST WHO IN THE WORLD IS
KENTEI?

343
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,583
AND WHY IS HE WORKING WITH YOU?

344
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,000
- SO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHO KENTEI IS?

345
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,708
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'D KNOW?

346
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,833
THIS WAS NOTHING MORE THAN
A SITUATION

347
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,291
WHERE OUR OBJECTIVES
COINCIDED WITH EACH OTHER.

348
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,708
BOTH OF US WANTED
NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE

349
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,000
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU
KANTO FIGHTERS DEAD!

350
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,791
- KAN'U IS SOMEWHERE CLOSE BY.

351
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,416
THAT EXTREME FIGHTING SPIRIT
I'VE BEEN SENSING...

352
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,416
IS NO DOUBT COMING FROM HER.

353
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
- ( sobbing )
KAN'U, WHY DID YOU DID THAT?

354
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,375
WHY DID YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

355
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,000
I'M A FOOL.
I'M NOTHING BUT A DAMN FOOL!

356
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,750
- ( shouts )

357
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,125
- ( roaring )

358
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,083
- ( groans )

359
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,958
- Kan'u: I COULDN'T JUDGE
 ITS DISTANCE IN THE AIR.

360
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,541
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

361
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,791
( shouts )

362
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,333
- ( laughs )

363
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,333
THAT'S MORE LIKE UNCHO KAN'U.

364
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,416
NOW LET IT ALL OUT.

365
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,083
FOR THE STRONGER YOU ARE,

366
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,875
THE BETTER IT IS FOR ME.

367
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,541
YOUR AMAZING STRENGTH

368
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,541
WILL ONLY BRING OUT THE EVIL
INSIDE OF YOU.

369
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,125
- HOW?

370
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,958
A BLOW LIKE THAT
SHOULD'VE SHATTERED ITS SKULL.

371
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,791
AAH.

372
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,541
UNTIL I BRING EKITOKU BACK
WITH ME TO SEITO,

373
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,791
I CAN'T GET KILLED...

374
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,583
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

375
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,583
I JUST CAN'T!

376
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,416
GENTOKU!
( echoing )

377
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,750
- ( grunts )

378
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,208
( shouts )

379
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,541
( grunts )

380
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,625
- DO YOU WISH TO KEEP GOING?

381
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,708
- SHIRYU...

382
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,541
IT IS VERY CLEAR
THAT THE MATCH IS OVER.

383
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,333
SO WILL YOU--

384
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,916
WILL YOU PLEASE 
JUST LET HER GO?

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,125
- I WILL ADMIT MY TOTAL DEFEAT.

386
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,875
HOWEVER...

387
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,125
( running steps )

388
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,666
- ( sharply gasps )

389
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,833
- I WILL ATONE
FOR THIS DISGRACE

390
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,333
BY PUTTING AN END
TO MY PATHETIC EXISTENCE.

391
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,708
- ( sharply gasps )

392
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,375
ANSWER ME THIS:
WHY IS IT THAT WE FIGHT?

393
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,750
WHY WE HURT, AND WHY WE SPILL
EACH OTHERS' BLOOD?

394
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,750
- LEADER, YOU MUST STOP THIS.

395
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,666
- WE ALWAYS FIGHT FOR OUR
SCHOOLS AND FOR SACRED BEADS.

396
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,875
BUT IS IT WORTH IT?

397
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,458
WORTH ALL THE CASUALTIES?

398
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,708
I KNOW THAT IT MIGHT BE
OUR DESTINY,

399
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,291
BUT I DON'T--

400
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,041
I DON'T WANNA BE A FIGHTER

401
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,083
SO MUCH THAT I WANNA LOSE
THE ESSENCE OF MY HUMAN SOUL.

402
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,500
I BELIEVE...

403
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,125
THAT LIFE IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.

404
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,583
IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

405
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,125
- Mouyuu: WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH ME?

406
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,000
- FIRST, WE WILL TREAT
YOUR WOUNDS.

407
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,208
THAT IS THE WILL
OF OUR GREAT LEADER,

408
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,583
THE KINDHEARTED
GENTOKU RYUUBI.

409
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,291
- WHY DID YOU SPARE ME?
THERE IS NO POINT.

410
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,500
AS LONG AS HE CONTINUES TO SEEK
THE LIFE OF SEITO'S LEADER,

411
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,875
HE'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE
DIFFERENT PLANS.

412
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,291
- YOU'RE REFERRING TO KENTEI?

413
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,416
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL US
EVERYTHING THAT YOU KNOW

414
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,541
ABOUT KENTEI.

415
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,500
PLEASE, FOR GENTOKU'S SAKE.

416
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,791
- VERY WELL.

417
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,041
WHEN I SAW THE FACE THAT WAS
HIDDEN UNDER THAT MASK--

418
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,125
- ( howling )
- ( gasps )

419
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,583
IT CAN'T BE.

420
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,625
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

421
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,583
- ( growling )

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,500
- IT SEEMS OUR TIME IS UP.

423
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,916
IT'S HERE.

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,375
THIS MUST BE THE NEXT PART
IN HIS PLAN.

425
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,625
- ( end theme playing )

426
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

427
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,708
- Chuubo: GENPOU,
DO YOU THINK OUR BIG SISTER

428
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,208
WILL BE ALL RIGHT?

429
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,416
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU IS STRONG
WHEN IT COUNTS,

430
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,000
SO IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

431
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,583
- BUT WE CAN'T BE
TOO CERTAIN.

432
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,583
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO BIG SISTER.

433
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,791
- SHE'S HAD SILLY SCREWUPS
FROM TIME TO TIME.

434
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,125
- DO YOU HAVE ANY GOOD ADVICE
YOU COULD GIVE HER?

435
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,750
- SUN TZU TEACHES,

436
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,833
"THE UNEXPECTED
WINS THE BATTLE."

437
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,708
NEXT TIME ON "IKKI TOUSEN:
XTREME XECUTOR"...

438
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,541
"SILENT TEARS."

439
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,958
- HOLD ON, GENPOU,

440
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,333
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE JUST
STOLEN MY LINE.
