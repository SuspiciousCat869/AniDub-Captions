1
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,333
- Goei: YOU MUST
LEAVE THIS HOUSE

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,875
AND THIS TOWN, UNDERSTAND?

3
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,958
YOU MUST CONQUER
THE COUNTRY.

4
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,833
- WHY DON'T YOU KICK ME?

5
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,083
- HUH?
( grunts )

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,750
- WHAT WAS THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE?

7
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,958
YOU THINK YOU
ACTUALLY KICKED ME?

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,250
- HAKUFU SONSAKU?!

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,333
- ( gasps )

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,666
- JUST DIE NOW!
WHY DON'T YOU FINISH QUICKLY?

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,833
- Koukin: IT CHANGES COLOR
THE MORE FIGHTERS YOU DEFEAT.

12
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,166
- Hakufu: DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU'RE STRONGER

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,083
THAN I AM, KOUKIN?

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,833
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN IF I DEFEAT THIS PERSON,

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,750
I'LL GET STRONGER.
( roars )

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,166
- IMPERIAL ORDERS--
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,208
ISSUING A LOT OF THEM
LATELY, SAJI.

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,250
USUALLY THE JOB
OF ISSUING EDICTS IS RESERVED

19
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,166
FOR THE LEADER ALONE.
DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY.

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,625
- IT'S BEEN AWHILE,
GENPOU SAJI.

21
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,416
YOU'RE LOOKING
PRETTY HOT THESE DAYS.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,541
Saji: HOUSEN RYOFU.

23
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,000
I'M EXCITED TO SEE MORE OF YOU.

24
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,333
- HOW DARE YOU?
HOW DARE YOU DO THIS TO KOUKIN!

25
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,458
YOU BASTARD!

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,166
- ( grunts )
WHAT'S THIS?

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,250
IT'S STRANGE.

28
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,583
INSIDE OF HER BODY
I FELT SOMETHING.

29
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,333
SOMETHING EXCEPTIONALLY
STRONG HAS AWAKENED.

30
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,916
IS IT THE SOUL
OF THE SHO HAOU?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,833
- ( Ganryo grunts )
WHO... WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

32
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,583
- OH. GUESS YOU'RE
STILL ABLE TO TALK.

33
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,250
- ( screams )

34
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,916
- Ryofu: TELL POPS I'M SORRY.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I WON'T BE GOING BACK THERE.

36
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,375
WE CAN'T FINISH TRAINING
LIKE WE HAD PLANNED.

37
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,416
- WHAT'S THE POINT IN REPEATING
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,291
1800 YEARS AGO?

39
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,250
ALL IT WILL LEAD TO
IS DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

40
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,625
- TOUTAKU!

41
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,666
- WHAT I AM ASKING OF YOU

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,708
IS TO BRING RAKUYOU HIGH SCHOOL
UNDER THE RULE OF KYOSHO.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,625
IS THAT MOUTOKU SOUSOU?

44
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,875
- THIS IS THE PART WHERE
EVERY TIME I READ IT

45
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,041
I STILL GET EMOTIONAL.

46
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,041
( sobs )
- Ekitoku: HEY!

47
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,000
WHY AREN'T YOU OUT
TRAINING WITH KAN'U?

48
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,916
GENTOKU RYUUBI
OF SEITO ACADEMY

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,375
IS DESTINED TO BE A FIGHTER.
SO SHARPEN UP NOW!

50
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,000
- ( screams )

51
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,333
- ( groaning )

52
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,833
( screams )

53
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,416
- ( girl screams )

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,166
- ( creature shrieks )

55
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,500
- I MAY BE MOUTOKU SOUSOU,
BUT BEFORE THAT

56
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,500
I WAS KAKUKA'S FRIEND.
HE WAS MY BROTHER.

57
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,000
NANYO, SONSAKU--
DESTROY THEM!

58
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,125
- Bashoku: SOUSOU LAUNCHED
A SURPRISE ATTACK ON NANYO,

59
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,708
AS ACCORDING TO PLAN.

60
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,791
- TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE
KEEPING THE TREASURE.

61
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,208
- ( panting )

62
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,541
THE TREASURE?

63
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,541
DO YOU MEAN THE DRAGON JADE?
- ANSWER ME.

64
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,958
WHERE IS IT?!

65
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,875
- ( humming )

66
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,416
- GENTOUKU, YOUR
BREASTS ARE BIG.

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,458
- HUH?

68
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,375
( laughing )
THAT TICKLES!

69
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,541
--YOU'RE SUCH A WEIRD GIRL.
- KOUMEI ONLY LOOKS

70
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,125
LIKE A CHILD.

71
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,666
SHE HAS TOLD ME,
"YOU MUST BE READY.

72
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,958
THE BATTLE OF RED CLIFFS
WILL SURELY HAPPEN AGAIN

73
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,208
IN THIS ERA."

74
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,166
- SO GLAD YOU WERE ABLE
TO MAKE IT, UNCHO KAN'U.

75
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,291
- THINK AGAIN, SOUSOU.
I DID NOT SUBMIT TO YOU.

76
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,625
WHAT I DID WAS ALL FOR SEITO.

77
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,916
- Shibai: WELL, I CAN
SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,541
THE LITTLE CONQUEROR.

79
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,791
A LONE HORSEMAN
RIDING IN TO TAKE OVER.

80
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,041
- NOT TO CONQUER.
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

81
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,541
NO, I'M HERE FOR OTHER REASONS.
I'M HERE FOR REVENGE

82
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,666
AGAINST THE ONE
WHO HURT MY FRIENDS!

83
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,625
( yells )

84
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,583
- Koukin: SO DOES THAT MEAN?

85
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,250
- Saji: YEAH.
IT'S ABOUT SONSAKU.

86
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,416
WELL, IF SONSAKU REALLY IS
THE LITTLE CONQUEROR,

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,125
THEN SHE SHOULDN'T
DIE SO EASILY.

88
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,291
- I'M THROUGH PLAYING GAMES,
KOUMEI SHOKATSURYO.

89
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,416
JUST HAND OVER
THE DRAGON JADE RIGHT NOW

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,541
AND I'LL SPARE
YOUR PATHETIC LIFE!

91
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,791
- SHIBAI!

92
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,708
--I WON'T LET YOU KILL GENTOKU!
- ( screams )

93
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,833
- Koumei: GENTOKU CAN'T
CONSCIOUSLY HANDLE THE POWER

94
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,166
OF HER DRAGON.

95
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,750
SOUSOU'S DRAGON
WILL CONSUME HER.

96
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,916
- WE CAN'T STAND HERE TALKING
ABOUT IT, GENTOKU'S GONNA DIE!

97
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,583
- Hakufu: RYUU-CHAN!

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,333
- I'LL KILL EVERY
LAST ONE OF YOU!

99
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,583
- READY, MISS SONSAKU!

100
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,708
- OKAY, LET'S KICK ASS!
- HA-AAA!

101
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,541
- SOUSOU, GET READY TO LOSE!

102
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,000
- ( roars )

103
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,666
- Koukin: AND THUS THE FIGHTERS
OF KANTO CONCLUDED

104
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,583
THEIR RE-LIVED BATTLE
OF THE RED CLIFFS.

105
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,458
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE END...

106
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,750
OF THE STORY.

107
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,625
- ( low rumbling )

108
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,583
- ( roars )

109
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
- OKAY!

110
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,458
- ( beeping )

111
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,500
- MAN, I AM BORED
OUTTA MY SKULL.

112
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,666
- BETTER THAN FIGHTING
OR GETTING KILLED.

113
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,625
- WASN'T THAT LONG AGO
THAT WE WERE FIGHTING

114
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,750
ALL THE TIME.

115
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,166
THEN THE BATTLE OF
RED CLIFFS HAPPENED

116
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,916
AND NOW THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT TO DO.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,166
- MMM-HMM.

118
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,791
- Girl: ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
- HUH? WHO IS THAT GIRL?

119
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,750
- TWO, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
- MMM-HMM.

120
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,000
THREE, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

121
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,875
HMM.

122
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,750
- YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A STUDENT
FROM KYOSHO ACADEMY.

123
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,750
BUT CUTE GIRLS ARE ALWAYS
WELCOME TO TRANSFER. HEE.

124
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,083
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE
A STUDENT BODY AS HOT AS YOURS!

125
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,083
GOOD TO KNOW.

126
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,833
--ARE YOU BUSY RIGHT NOW?
- HUH?

127
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,125
- IF NOT,

128
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,041
YOU WANT
TO HAVE A GO AT ME?

129
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,416
- UH... UM...

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,458
- DUDE, ABOVE YOU!

131
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,416
- ( grunts )

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,625
- ( grunts )
- ( yelps )

133
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,958
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO PICK A FIGHT?

134
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,958
- AND WITHOUT ANY BACKUP?
WHAT SHOULD WE DO, MAN?

135
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,791
- IDIOT. WE GOTTA DO
OUR JOBS AS GUARDS.

136
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,083
UM, GUYS CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

137
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,291
YES?

138
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,458
-WHICH ONE OF YOU TWO
IS THE STRONGER ONE?

139
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,625
Both: HUH?

140
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,208
 STRONG FIGHTERS ARE THE
ONES I LIKE BEST.

141
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,916
- YOU LIKE STRONG?
I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S STRONG.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,958
IT JUST SO HAPPENS I'M KYOSHO'S
NUMBER-ONE FIGHTER--

143
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:54,958
( gasps )

144
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,708
YOU'RE NOT NUMBER
ONE AROUND HERE!

145
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,833
NOT EVEN CLOSE,
YOU BIG LIAR!

146
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,666
- ( shudders )
WHY YOU--

147
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,291
- STOP IT!
YOU'RE RIGHT!

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,625
THE NUMBER ONE AT KYOSHO
IS SOMEONE ELSE!

149
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,541
( whimpers )
- TAKE ME TO HIM THEN, ASSWIPE!

150
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,333
TAKE ME TO MOUTOKU SOUSOU!

151
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,333
- ( grunts )

152
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,958
( grunts )

153
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,791
- ( gasping, murmuring )

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,125
- Kyocho: MR. MOU.

155
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,833
- ( grunts )

156
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,291
- Girl: OH?

157
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,541
THE ENTRANCE
MIGHT NOT BE MUCH,

158
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,666
BUT INSIDE THIS PLACE
ISN'T HALF BAD.

159
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,625
STILL, THOSE EXCUSES
FOR GUARDS

160
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,416
HARDLY PUT UP
A FIGHT AT ALL.

161
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,708
MAYBE KYOSHO'S NOT ALL
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

162
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,916
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU JUST SAY?

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,166
TRY SAYING THAT
ONE MORE TIME.

164
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,000
- Guy: THIS GIRL, DUDE.
- HM?

165
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,416
- SHE JUMPED THE BACK GATE
AND BEAT US UP.

166
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,625
SHE DEMANDED I TAKE HER
TO SEE OUR LEADER SOUSOU.

167
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,708
WHAT?

168
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,166
THE BACK GATE?
OH, I'M SUCH A DUMMY.

169
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,166
I BROKE INTO THE WRONG
GATE. MY BAD, GUYS.

170
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,291
I'LL GO BACK TO
THE FRONT ENTRANCE

171
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,916
AND START MY ATTACK
AGAIN FROM THERE.

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,458
- WHAT?!
- BUT YOU KNOW,

173
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,916
YOU COULD JUST TAKE ME TO
SOUSOU AND SAVE ME SOME TIME.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,250
Huh? ( laughs )
SURE THING.

175
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,666
I'LL TAKE YOU TO
MOUTOKU SOUSOU!

176
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,500
REALLY?

177
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,041
YOU'RE NOT LYING?
- NO.

178
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,000
SCOUT'S HONOR.
I SWEAR AS A FIGHTER

179
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,583
I WILL PERSONALLY
TAKE YOU TO SEE SOUSOU.

180
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,166
RIGHT AFTER I RIP YOUR
BOOBS OFF YOUR CHEST

181
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,333
AND HANG THEM FROM THE FLAGPOLE.

182
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,791
- HMMM.

183
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,208
NO!

184
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,000
- ( laughs, grunts )
- HERE YA GO!

185
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,375
YOU SAID YOU WANTED MY BOOBS
TO HANG FROM THE FLAGPOLE

186
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,125
SO I GAVE YOU ONE.
( slurps ) YUMMY!

187
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,333
- A SNACK CAKE?
- THOSE AREN'T REAL?!

188
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,333
- WHO CARES IF MY BOOBS
ARE FAKE?

189
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,791
BREASTS DON'T MATTER.
I'M STILL GONNA WIN.

190
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,708
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

191
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,583
- BOOBS MATTER MOST!
HUH?

192
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,416
- YOU GUYS WANNA TRY SOME?

193
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,083
- OH...

194
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,791
- IDIOTS.
YOU FELL FOR IT AGAIN.

195
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,000
THIS'LL TIDE ME OVER BUT I
WANT TO GET BACK TO MY SCHOOL

196
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,541
BEFORE LUNCH ENDS.

197
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,083
SO THEN...

198
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,041
CALL OUT
MOUTOKU SOUSOU ALREADY!

199
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,625
TODAY IS THE DAY
HE DRAWS HIS LAST BREATH!

200
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,541
- SOMEONE'S ATTACKING KYOSHO!

201
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,250
- IS IT SEITO OR NANYO?

202
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,291
- NAH, IT'S SOME CRAZY GIRL
FROM THE BAKERY.

203
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,416
- Soujin: KYOCHO!

204
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,958
- SOME GIRL IN THE YARD
IS BEATING PEOPLE UP.

205
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,750
EITHER SHE'S NUTS OR STUPID.

206
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,291
- Kyocho: WHERE'S MR. MO--
I MEAN, OUR LEADER?

207
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,333
- Soujin: I THINK HE WENT OUT
SOMEWHERE WITH TON.

208
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,625
YOU REMEMBER, LIKE THEY
USED TO DO ALL THE TIME.

209
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,208
BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHERE OUR LEADER IS?

210
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,458
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

211
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,083
AS THE HEAD OF KYOSHO'S
SECURITY, IT'S MY JOB.

212
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,333
( laughs )
- ( blows thud, groaning )

213
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,958
- Soujin: HEY YOU!
WHAT'S ALL THE RACKET?

214
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,500
YOU A ONE-MAN
INVASION FORCE?

215
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,458
- YOU'RE NOT SOUSOU,
WHO'RE YOU?

216
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:57,333
- KYOSHO ACADEMY THIRD YEAR,
SHIKOU SOUJIN, A-RANK FIGHTER!

217
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,833
- OH SURE, SHE'S
AN "A" ALL RIGHT.

218
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,083
IF YOU MEAN HER BRA'S CUP SIZE.
- SHH.

219
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,416
- IF YOU SAID WHAT I THINK,
YOU JUST STEPPED ON A LANDMINE!

220
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,833
I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS!
- HE WAS JUST JOKING.

221
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,333
- HEY! YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

222
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,875
DON'T YOU DARE QUESTION
MY RANK OR MY BOOBS!

223
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,291
- OH GREAT.
THIS SCHOOL'S FULL OF LIARS.

224
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,708
- HEY, YOU TWO!
- RIGHT!

225
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,125
- ( screaming )

226
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,083
- WHAT? HOW COULD SHE--
( grunts )

227
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,166
- JUDGES SAY "PERFECT 10!"

228
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,541
- HEY!

229
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,916
STOP!
DON'T LET HER IN THE SCHOOL!

230
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,541
- GET THAT CHICK!
- GET HER!

231
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,833
- WE'RE GONNA GET YOU!

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,833
- GET HER!
STOP THAT GIRL!

233
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,666
HUH?

234
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,166
THAT BITCH!
I'LL KILL HER!

235
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,583
- WHOA!

236
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,083
- YOU IDIOT.
THIS IS THE THIRD FLOOR.

237
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,125
YOU'RE TRAPPED UP--!

238
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,041
OH NO!

239
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,750
- UH UH, TESTING MICROPHONE.
TESTING ONE, TWO, THREE.

240
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,125
AHEM!
I AM MOUKI BACHOU,

241
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,291
A FIRST-YEAR STUDENT
AT RYOUSHUU HIGH SCHOOL!

242
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,500
I'VE COME TO TAKE REVENGE
ON KYOSHO'S LEADER

243
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,666
FOR KILLING MY BROTHER
BUNYAKU KANSUI.

244
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,458
MOUTOKU SOUSOU,
I WILL HAVE BLOOD FOR BLOOD.

245
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,375
COME FIGHT ME!

246
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,166
- ( gasps )

247
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,083
- Bachou: ARE YOU SCARED,
SOUSOU?! I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME!

248
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,791
STOP HIDING AND
FACE ME LIKE A MAN! 

249
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,750
OPEN UP, YOU BITCH!

250
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,708
- DON'T PRETEND LIKE
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN!

251
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,208
TODAY IS THE ANNIVERSARY

252
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,583
OF THE DAY THAT YOU
KILLED MY BROTHER!

253
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,083
I'VE COME TO BRING
JUSTICE TO HIS KILLER.

254
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,375
I WILL AVENGE MY BLOOD!

255
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,791
IF YOU'RE REALLY
A LEADER, SOUSOU,

256
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,625
THEN FIGHT ME ONE ON ONE!

257
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,291
- ( crackles )
- ( giggles )

258
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,833
SURE WENT DOWN EASY
FOR SUCH A HULKING AMAZON.

259
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,208
SERVES HER RIGHT.

260
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,875
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
DEFENDING THAT IDIOT SOUSOU.

261
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,208
ISN'T SHE A TRANNY?

262
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,208
I MEAN AT SOME POINT THIS
GIRL HAD TO BE A DUDE.

263
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,666
- THINK SHE'S PRE-OP
OR POST-OP?

264
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,916
- ( panting )

265
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,708
- ( laughs )
- ( clanks )

266
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,833
- ( gasps )

267
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,875
- ( mutters )

268
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,500
( growls )

269
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,250
( sobbing )

270
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,875
- MOU...TOKU.

271
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,166
- Soujin: YOU CAN YAMMER OVER
THE LOUDSPEAKER ALL YOU WANT.

272
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,666
SOUSOU'S NOT COMING!
- Bachou: NOW I GET IT!

273
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,541
YOU'RE THE A-RANK
CLASS CLOWN!

274
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,791
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?!

275
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,458
- YOUR NOSE IS SO RED
AND FUNNY-LOOKING

276
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:23,041
I FIGURED YOU HAD TO BE!
SORRY. I HOPE THAT DIDN'T HURT.

277
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,916
- ( groans ) OPEN UP!
OPEN THIS DOO--

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,875
- ( growls )

279
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,125
THIS IS AN OLD
BATTLE SCAR!

280
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,166
- IF YOU SAY SO.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

281
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,708
WHERE IS SOUSOU?
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?

282
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,916
- ( laughs ) MOUTOKU IS
THE LEADER OF KYOSHO!

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,500
HE WOULDN'T BOTHER
WASTING HIS TIME

284
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,166
WITH A LITTLE PISSANT LIKE YOU!

285
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,500
- YOU COULD SAY THAT,

286
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,125
BUT I BET THE REAL REASON
IS BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID.

287
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,500
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S AFRAID!

288
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,500
YOU'RE HIDING UP ON
THE WATER TOWER!

289
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,958
GET DOWN HERE AND FIGHT!
- MY PLEASURE.

290
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,583
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK!

291
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,291
WELL... THE COMIC RELIEF
IS STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

292
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,875
- THIS SMART-MOUTHED BRAT
IS A LOT MORE POWERFUL

293
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,625
THAN SHE SEEMS.

294
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,333
HUH?
- ( screams )

295
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,625
HEY HEY, LET GO!

296
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,791
- KYOCHO, LEAVE HER TO ME!

297
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,166
- MR. MOU IS NOT IN RIGHT NOW.

298
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,166
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
I'LL LISTEN.

299
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,291
- ( growls ) I'M SICK
OF ALL THESE WEIRD GUYS!

300
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,291
IF SOUSOU'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW,
THEN JUST CALL HIM!

301
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
I'M NOT ABOUT TO GO HOME
EMPTY-HANDED.

302
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,125
I WON'T LEAVE
UNTIL I GET WHAT I WANT...

303
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,416
AND I WANT VENGEANCE!

304
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,166
DID YOU THINK
I WAS BORN YESTERDAY?

305
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,166
THAT I WOULD BELIEVE
YOUR PATHETIC LIES?!

306
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,750
HE'S PROBABLY CURLED UP
INTO A LITTLE BALL,

307
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,041
QUIVERING IN FEAR,

308
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,000
WHILE HIS UNDERLINGS
FIGHT HIS BATTLES FOR HIM.

309
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,250
I HEARD THAT WHEN SOUSOU
WAS MUCH YOUNGER

310
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,250
OTHER KIDS WOULD PICK ON HIM.
- ( gasps )

311
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,333
- THAT'S WHY I'M SURE HE'S
REALLY A WEAK LITTLE COWARD

312
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,666
AND THAT HIS BIG TOUGH-GUY
IMAGE IS JUST AN ACT!

313
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,125
- HEY, STOP TALKING SMACK ABOUT
OUR LEADER OR I'LL HAVE TO--

314
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,625
- TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID.
- HUH?

315
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,458
- PLEASE DON'T BE MEAN.
DON'T SPEAK ILL OF MR. MOU.

316
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,333
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME?
UNTIL MOUTOKU SOUSOU

317
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,375
PAYS FOR HIS CRIMES
HE'S COMMITTED,

318
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,250
I'M NOT TAKING
ANYTHING BACK!

319
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,416
- INSULTING MR. MOU IS...

320
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,916
UNFORGIVABLE!

321
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,041
- ( gasping )

322
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,833
( screams )

323
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,375
( grunts )

324
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,458
OW.
WHAT-- WHAT WAS THAT?!

325
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,625
- ( groans )
NO WAY.

326
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:44,000
- DAMN IT!
MY BUTT IS STUCK.

327
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,416
- ( whooshing )

328
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,083
- WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
( screaming )

329
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,083
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

330
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,458
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO SAVE ME!

331
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,000
I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY!

332
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,791
- PLEASE STAY STILL.
- ( rattling )

333
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,375
- I WON'T. I WON'T STOP!

334
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,875
I HAVEN'T LOST YET!
- THAT'S DANGEROUS.

335
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,125
- ( screams )

336
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,791
- SORRY.

337
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,208
- HOT DAMN!

338
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,875
THAT GIRL...
I WONDER IF SHE MADE IT.

339
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,291
- Sousou: MORE IMPORTANT THAN
ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW,

340
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,416
WE NEED TO REMEMBER
WHO WE ARE AND FIND OUR WAY.

341
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,875
IF WE LOSE SIGHT
OF OURSELVES,...

342
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,208
WHAT'S INSIDE
WILL TAKE OVER

343
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,500
AND WE'LL END UP
FIGHTING FOREVER.

344
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,416
- THE BATTLE'S OVER.
STOP WORRYING.

345
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,541
OUR LIVES ARE OUR OWN.

346
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,291
IF I FIGHT NOW IT'S
BECAUSE I WANT TO FIGHT.

347
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,333
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME
A FIGHTER. NOT SOME BEAD.

348
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,166
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS
ABOUT DESTINY,

349
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,875
OR SPIRITS FROM
1800 YEARS AGO.

350
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,791
NOTHING'S GONNA
CONTROL MY LIFE BUT ME.

351
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,791
- ( thunder rumbles )
- WHAT THIS?

352
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,041
I THOUGHT THE NEWS SAID
IT WASN'T GOING TO RAIN.

353
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,291
I'M SO UNLUCKY.

354
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,458
- WHAT HAPPENED, BRO?
WHO BEAT YOU UP?

355
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,958
- ( wheezing )

356
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,708
STOP IT, SOUSOU!
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

357
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,333
- KANSUI... KANSUI!

358
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,750
- ( knocks )
- ( gasps )

359
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,125
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
DID YOU GET CAUGHT IN THE RAIN?

360
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,416
- ( snorts )
I'M ALL RIGHT.

361
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,416
- Bachou: THAT GIRL...

362
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,458
DAMN IT! I SHOULD'VE
BEEN ABLE TO--

363
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,416
STRONGER.

364
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,375
I WILL BECOME
STRONGER FOR NEXT TIME.

365
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,500
( sobbing )
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN!

366
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,000
DAMN IT.

367
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,208
- ( footsteps )

368
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,125
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
SLEEP IN THE RAIN.

369
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,833
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH COLD?

370
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,125
- WHO ARE YOU?

371
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,708
- ( theme music playing )

372
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,333
( singing in Japanese )

373
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,666
- HELLO, I'M MOUKI BACHOU!

374
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,583
"IKKI TOUSEN" HAS FINALLY
MADE ITS INTERNATIONAL DEBUT!

375
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,875
WE'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING
SOME TERRIBLE MONSTERS

376
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,000
AND EVIL SPACE ROBOTS THIS
SEASON, SO STAY TUNED!

377
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,833
YOU DON'T WANT TO
MISS ANY OF THE ACTION.

378
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,708
WHAT? THERE ARE
NO SPACE ROBOTS?

379
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,625
WE'RE JUST UP AGAINST
SOME UGLY-ASS FIGHTERS?!

380
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:50,625
NO WAY, NO WAY,
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!

381
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,041
NEXT TIME ON "IKKI
TOUSEN XTREME XECUTOR":

382
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,166
"GATHERING ALLIES."
