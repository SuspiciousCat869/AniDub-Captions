1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,375
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,333
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,625
- ( footsteps )

4
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,375
- ( growling )

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,666
- ( gasps )

6
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,208
UNCHO KAN'U,

7
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,541
THERE'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

8
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,666
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

9
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,375
WHO ARE YOU?

10
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,000
- WE'RE FRIENDS.
HAVE YOU REALLY FORGOTTEN?

11
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,791
- ( man laughs )
- ( gasps )

12
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,416
- KAN'U HAS LOST HER SIGHT.

13
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,708
SHE CANNOT TELL IF YOU
ARE FRIEND OR FOE.

14
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,416
BUT I SHALL ASSIST HER.

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,875
THE PERSON BEFORE YOU
IS YOUR ARCH-ENEMY.

16
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,500
FOLLOW THE DESTINY YOU ARE
BOUND TO FROM THE PAST:

17
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,333
FIGHT!
- ( gasps )

18
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,375
- Kan'u:
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN

19
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,750
THE ONE WHO
SET A TRAP FOR ME,

20
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,750
THE ONE WHO SEVERED
MY HEAD.

21
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,125
I MAY DIE BUT MY HATRED
FOR YOU WILL REMAIN

22
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,125
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY!

23
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,166
- WHAT TRAP?
- Man: THE TRAP SET

24
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,666
BY THE ONE
WHOSE DESTINY YOU INHERITED.

25
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,916
THE SACRED BEAD YOU WEAR
CAME WITH EVERYTHING

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,041
FROM THAT SOUL'S PAST,
INCLUDING VENDETTAS.

27
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,458
THE TIME HAS COME. OLD SCORES
MUST BE SETTLED HERE AND NOW.

28
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,958
WELCOME COMBATANTS

29
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,250
TO THE BIG FIGHTERS
TOURNAMENT!

30
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,500
- I GET IT NOW.
YOU MUST BE KENTEI.

31
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,333
CALL YOURSELF WHATEVER
THE HELL YOU WANT, I DON'T CARE,

32
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,208
BUT I WON'T FIGHT
LIKE A DOG. I WONT!

33
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,541
( grunts )
- ( screams )

34
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,625
- Kentei: WHAT NOW?
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO FIGHT,

35
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,250
BUT IT APPEARS THAT KAN'U
IS LOOKING FOR ONE. 

36
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,208
- Kan'u:
ARE YOU AFRAID, RYOMOU?

37
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,250
- ( scoffs )

38
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,291
- ( engine humming )
- ( waves splashing )

39
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,708
- Chou'un: SHOULDN'T YOU
CONSIDER GETTING SOME SLEEP?

40
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
- UH.

41
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,333
THANKS.
BUT I'M ALL RIGHT.

42
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,375
I COULDN'T SLEEP ANYWAY.

43
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,833
MOU-CHAN IS AT NANBAN HIGH

44
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,708
AND KOUKIN WENT IN MY PLACE

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,833
AND NOW THEY'RE
IN TERRIBLE DANGER.

46
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,500
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT,

47
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,083
THERE'S NO WAY I
COULD GET ANY SLEEP.

48
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,166
AND AFTER HE SENT
THAT BIG NASTY GUY

49
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,041
TO TRY AND TAKE
RYUU-CHAN'S HEAD OFF--

50
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,291
IT'S TOTALLY UNFORGIVEABLE.
HE MUST PAY.

51
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,083
THAT GUY WHAT'S-HIS-FACE?
- YOU MEAN KENTEI?

52
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,000
- RIGHT!
THAT'S THE GUY--

53
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,416
"KENNY G" OR "CHIANTI" OR
WHATEVER THE HECK HIS NAME IS.

54
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,166
WHEN I MEET HIM I'M GONNA
GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND.

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,750
I WILL SAY TO HIM, "YOU LOSER.
PREPARE TO GET YOU BUTT KICKED!"

56
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,250
( laughs )
- ( scoffs )

57
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,375
( chuckles )

58
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,416
I ENVY YOU.

59
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,375
- HM? HOW COME?

60
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,708
- YOU'RE CHEERFUL AND YOU
HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR,

61
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,208
EVEN WHEN THE SITUATION
IS SO SERIOUS.

62
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,500
- HUH?

63
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,833
- SONSAKU, WILL YOU LEND ME

64
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,291
YOUR JOY AND GOOD HUMOR
AND HELP ME TO SAVE MY LEADER?

65
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,208
- I WILL! HAKUFU SONSAKU
AT YOUR SERVICE!

66
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,166
- STRATEGIST KOUMEI,
WHAT'RE YOUR THOUGHTS?

67
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO KENTEI IS?

68
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,666
I MEAN HIS ACTUAL IDENTITY.
- STRATEGIST RIKUSON,

69
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,875
MY GUESS IS
HE HATES FIGHTERS.

70
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,750
PERHAPS THIS KENTEI PERSON
HAD A SACRED BEAD OF HIS OWN,

71
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,041
BUT HE DIDN'T LIKE HIS FATE
SO NOW HE'S LASHING OUT.

72
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,208
HE'S MAD. IT'S LIKE HE'S
CURSING EVERY ONE OF US

73
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,291
WHO BEARS A SACRED BEAD
AND HAS A DESTINY TO FULFILL.

74
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,541
THE BIG FIGHTERS TOURNAMENT
WAS A TRAP.

75
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,250
HE JUST WANTED TO LURE KAN'U
AND THE OTHERS TO HIM.

76
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,500
I DON'T THINK HE DID
ALL THIS JUST TO KILL THEM.

77
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,916
CLEARLY HE HAS SOME
ULTERIOR MOTIVE

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,333
AND THAT MAKES ME UNEASY.

79
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,500
- ( grunting )

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,083
- ( chuckles )
MORE... MORE BLOOD!

81
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,750
I REQUIRE EVERY LAST DROP
YOU SPILL WHILE IN BATTLE.

82
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,416
IT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER
TO ACHIEVE MY OBJECTIVE.

83
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,666
- ( gasping )

84
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,166
- ( roaring )

85
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,416
- ( roaring )

86
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,250
- WHAT'S THAT VOICE?

87
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,916
( groans )

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,833
MY EYE...

89
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,333
IT'S THROBBING!

90
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,041
- ( roars )

91
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,041
- MY GOD. WHAT IS IT?

92
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,375
- Ekitoku: KAN'U, NO!

93
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,916
STOP IT!

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,250
- HUH? CHOUHI?
SOMETHING WRONG?

95
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,541
- DON'T FIGHT HER!
YOU CAN'T!

96
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,791
YOU MUSTN'T FIGHT
SHIMEI RYOMOU!

97
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,541
NOT IN THE STATE YOU'RE IN!
- RYOMOU'S NOT HERE.

98
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,958
IS SHE FIGHTING?
- DID YOU NOT HEAR WHAT I SAID?

99
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,125
A DARK EVIL IS ENVELOPING
KAN'U'S FIGHTING SPIRIT

100
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,416
AND IT'S REACTING TO HER.

101
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,250
NOT AGAIN.

102
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,083
IT'S HAPPENING
ALL OVER AGAIN!!

103
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,875
- I STILL FEEL IT.
THE PAIN FROM WHEN YOU SEVERED

104
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,750
MY HEAD FROM MY BODY.
IT NEVER ENDS.

105
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,625
FOR 1800 YEARS I'VE SUFFERED
BECAUSE OF YOU.

106
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,208
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

107
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,125
HAS THE SACRED BEAD
TAKEN YOU OVER?

108
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,833
WHERE'S KAN'U'S SOUL?

109
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,375
- AS LONG AS BATTLES
STILL EXIST IN THE WORLD,

110
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,916
MY SOUL WILL REMAIN
DOMINANT!

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,708
THIS IS DESTINY! THIS IS
WHAT IT IS TO BE A FIGHTER!

112
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,791
- YOU ARE WRONG!

113
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,541
I'M MORE THAN JUST
MY INHERITED FATE.

114
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,500
IT DOES NOT CONTROL ME!

115
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,916
I AM NANYO FIGHTER
SHIMEI RYOMOU!

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,833
- Ekitoku: LET ME OUT!
IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH!

117
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,291
IF I DON'T STOP THEM
THEY'LL DESTROY EACH OTHER!

118
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,291
AND LEVEL HALF THIS PLACE
IN THE PROCESS! ( grunts )

119
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,333
ASSHOLE!
YOU'LL REGRET THAT!

120
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,250
- COOL IT!
TRY TO KEEP CALM!

121
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,583
- DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID!
- Ekitoku: NO.

122
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,875
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

123
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,916
SOMEONE HAS TO STOP
THEM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,833
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

125
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,916
- BACK IN THE ERA OF
THE THREE KINGDOMS...

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,583
- ...THOSE TWO
WERE MORTAL ENEMIES.

127
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,500
SHIMEI RYOMOU SET A TRAP
FOR UNCHO KAN'U,

128
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,458
AND ONCE KAN'U WAS CAUGHT
RYOMOU DECAPITATED HIM.

129
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,166
BUT IN DEATH KAN'U
GOT REVENGE,

130
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,541
CURSING AND HAUNTING RYOMOU
UNTIL HE DIED AS WELL.

131
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,208
- Soujin: YUCK.
THAT'S FUCKED UP.

132
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,833
- Koukin: IF CHOUHI'S RIGHT,
IF RYOMOU AND KAN'U

133
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,708
REALLY ARE FIGHTING
NO HOLDS BARRED,

134
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,333
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MUCH
WORSE THE POWER OF THEIR GRUDGES

135
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,125
IN THEIR SACRED BEADS
COULD MAKE THINGS.

136
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,791
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE NANBAN.

137
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
THAT'S WHY THEY OUSTED
THEIR OLD LEADERSHIP.

138
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,583
THEY'RE NOT CRUEL
AND THEY DON'T FIGHT DIRTY.

139
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,708
THEN AGAIN I HEARD THEY
RECRUITED A NEW STRATEGIST.

140
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,833
SO WHO KNOWS
ANYTHING ANYMORE?

141
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,458
- STRATEGIST?

142
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,750
- Woman: I KNOW YOU.
YOU ARE SHIBAI, ARE YOU NOT?

143
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,250
- ONCE YOU AND I LIVED
AND FOUGHT TOGETHER,

144
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,375
BUT I AM NO LONGER
THAT PERSON.

145
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,708
- ( gasps )

146
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,125
I WILL LIVE FOR YOU,
SERVE YOU.

147
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,958
I WILL GIVE
MY LIFE FOR YOU.

148
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,041
YOU HAVE BUT
TO SAY THE WORD.

149
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,458
I WOULD DO ANYTHING.
PLEASE TRUST ME.

150
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,625
PLEASE SHARE YOUR SECRETS.

151
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,541
PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO SEE YOUR FACE!

152
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
- REGRETFULLY
I CANNOT DO THAT.

153
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,791
- ( sighs )

154
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,916
- I HAVE MADE MANY PAINFUL
SACRIFICES INCLUDING MY BODY

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,541
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE
MY DESIRED OBJECTIVE.

156
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,083
THE ONE STANDING BEFORE YOU

157
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,208
IS NOT THE CHUUTATSU SHIBAI
YOU ONCE KNEW.

158
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,166
- THAT'S FINE.
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

159
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,625
YOU REMAIN MY ONE,
MY ONLY...

160
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,833
YOU ARE STILL
MY MOTHER MARY.

161
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,500
- WATCH ME, I WILL
RE-MAKE THIS WORLD.

162
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,000
- WHAT YOU THOUGHT POSSIBLE
ONLY IN DREAMS WILL BECOME REAL.

163
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,625
THE FLAMES OF HELL
WILL RAIN DOWN

164
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,083
AND SHALL CONSUME
THE FOOLISH AND UNWORTHY.

165
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,666
WHILE THOSE OF A RIGHTEOUS HEART
WILL BE WELCOMED

166
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,833
THROUGH THE GATES
OF PARADISE.

167
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,500
WE WILL BEAR WITNESS
AS THIS COMES TO PASS.

168
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,666
WHAT RISES
WILL BE A NEW EDEN,

169
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,166
A TRUE KINGDOM
OF GOD ON EARTH.

170
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,708
- Bachou: MAN, HOW DEEP
DOES THIS PLACE GO?

171
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,458
IT'S LIKE A JUNGLE
MADE UP OF ROOTS

172
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,041
INSTEAD OF TREES.
( sighs )

173
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,125
MMM.

174
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,750
THAT DAY,
SHE TOTALLY KICKED MY BUTT.

175
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,750
IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE.

176
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,208
YET NOW HERE WE ARE
WORKING TOGETHER.

177
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,625
STRANGE HOW THINGS
TURN OUT SOMETIMES.

178
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,083
- HM?
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

179
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,958
- YEAH.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

180
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,041
- OH.

181
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,041
- UH, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, KYOCHO?

182
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,833
COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT MOUTOKU SOUSOU?

183
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,541
- AH.
- UM... DON'T WORRY.

184
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,166
IT'S NOTHING BAD.
I JUST REALIZED

185
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,416
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM.
I WAS WONDERING

186
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,458
IF YOU COULD TELL ME
WHAT HE'S LIKE?

187
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,083
- MR. MOU IS... OF ALL
THE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD,

188
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,000
HE'S THE ONE
I WANT TO PROTECT.

189
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,666
I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE
TO SAVE HIS.

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,125
- YOU WOULD LAY DOWN
YOUR LIFE...

191
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,833
FOR HIM?

192
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,458
- Kansui: LISTEN UP! I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU THE ONE THING

193
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,458
YOU NEED TO KNOW TO GET
OUT OF ANY KIND OF TROUBLE,

194
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,250
NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS.

195
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,000
- OKAY.

196
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,500
- NEVER FORGET
HOW STRONG YOU REALLY ARE.

197
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,083
- MM-- BUT, BRO,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

198
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,083
- FIGURE IT OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

199
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,083
- DON'T BE A JERK!
C'MON, TELL ME!

200
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,541
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

201
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,458
SOMEDAY
SOMEONE WILL COME ALONG

202
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,875
YOU'D BE WILLING TO GIVE
YOUR LIFE TO PROTECT

203
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,333
AND YOU'LL BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO PROTECT THEM.

204
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,041
- I THINK I SEE
STAIRS BACK THERE.

205
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,291
- HUH?

206
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,750
- ( both grunt )

207
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,083
- UP AHEAD
I SENSE A FIGHT.

208
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,333
IT'S INTENSE,

209
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,291
AS IF THEIR SPIRITS ARE
DEVOURING EACH OTHER.

210
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,416
- WHAT?!
BUT THAT MEANS...

211
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,791
THE TOURNAMENT'S
STARTED ALREADY.

212
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,083
I HAVE TO HURRY AND GET THERE.

213
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,458
IF I DON'T I MIGHT MISS
MY CHANCE TO COMPETE!

214
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,625
- WAIT A SECOND!
- HOLD ON, KAN'U! I'M COMING.

215
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,458
CHOUHI!
I'M ALMOST THERE!!

216
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,416
( grunts, gasps )

217
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
- ( gasps )
YOU'RE THE DOUBLE SWORD FIGHTER

218
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,750
WHO ATTACKED US ON THE SHIP!
- ( gasps )

219
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,416
MOTHER MARY,
LEAVE HER TO ME.

220
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,250
- HEY!
WAIT A SECOND!

221
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,375
- ( both grunting )

222
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,500
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
SHE'S NOTHING,

223
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,125
LITTLE MORE THAN A MOUSE.

224
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,625
THE NANBAN FIGHTERS
CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.

225
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,500
- ( panting )

226
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,500
( yelps )

227
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,666
- ( muffled grunts )
- ( footsteps marching )

228
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,041
- WHEW! LET'S GO!

229
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,958
WE'LL MAKE A RUN FOR IT!
- YOU SHOULD GO HIDE IN THERE.

230
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,541
- ( gasps ) BUT THEN I--
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

231
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,958
- I WON'T FIT.
IT'S TOO NARROW.

232
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,000
- WAIT HOLD ON A SECOND.
NO WAY!

233
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,125
NOT AGAIN!

234
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,000
- Koumei: WHERE DOES
THIS PATH LEAD TO?

235
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,000
- Mouyuu: IT GOES
TO NANBAN'S BASEMENT.

236
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,583
THE SCHOOL SITS
ATOP A MOUNTAIN.

237
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,916
IT'S ROCKY AND STEEP.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,375
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
CAREFUL.

239
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,291
I SENSE A DARK AND BLOODTHIRSTY
AIR ABOUT THIS PLACE.

240
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,708
- LEADER, UMM...

241
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,791
WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU'RE DOING?

242
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,291
- I'M LEAVING MARKS ON THE PATH
SO WE DON'T GET LOST.

243
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,458
- ( sighs )

244
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,166
OF ALL THE SCHOOLS AND LEADERS

245
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,916
I COULD HAVE BEEN
STRATEGIST FOR,

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,166
I GOT STUCK WITH
THE IDIOT AT NANYO.

247
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,958
- Hakufu: HEY, RIKU-CHAN,
WANT ME TO CARRY THAT SWORD?

248
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,583
- Rikuson: SOUSOU ENTRUSTED YOU
WITH THIS VALUABLE WEAPON.

249
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,166
BUT YOU LOSE THINGS.
SO I'LL HOLD ONTO IT FOR NOW.

250
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,291
- Hakufu: WOW!
LOOK AT THAT BUDDHA!

251
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,875
- THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE,
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE HERE.

252
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,375
- IN ANCIENT CHINA, GREAT LORDS
AND EMPERORS WOULD BUILD

253
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,583
SIMILAR STONE STATUES OR TEMPLES
NEAR THE WALLS OF THEIR CASTLES.

254
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,333
- COOL! YOU KNOW
A LOT, RIKU-CHAN.

255
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,666
- Koumei: OH.

256
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,500
MOUYUU, CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT THESE ROOTS ARE?

257
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,666
- Hakufu: WHOA! THE PLACE
IS COVERED WITH THEM!

258
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,750
- THERE WEREN'T ROOTS
HERE BEFORE.

259
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,375
- Hakufu: IF THEY'RE
WEEDS OR SOMETHING,

260
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,916
LET'S CLEAR THEM AWAY!

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
- ( thumps )
- AH... MMM!

262
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,958
HA! WHAT WAS THAT?!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

263
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,833
- IT FELT SO STRANGE.

264
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,208
WHEN I GRABBED IT
I THOUGHT I FELT A PULSE.

265
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,833
- ( faint moaning )
- ( gasps )

266
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,166
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

267
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,166
- IT'S COMING FROM BACK
WHERE THE THICK ROOTS ARE.

268
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,916
- HAI!

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,333
- IT CAN'T BE!
THAT LOOKS LIKE BLOOD.

270
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,875
- UH.

271
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,375
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THEM?

272
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,916
- THEY'RE THE SOUTHERN KANTO
FEDERATION.

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,333
- DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE?

274
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,666
- NO WAY.

275
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,875
COULD KOUKIN OR MOU-CHAN
HAVE ENDED UP

276
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,541
AS PLANT FOOD
LIKE THOSE GUYS DID?

277
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,333
KOUKIN! MOU-CHAN!

278
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,375
WHERE ARE YOU?
ANSWER ME.

279
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,333
KOUKIN!

280
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,291
- ( gasps )
HAKUFU?

281
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,958
- WHAT IS IT?

282
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,916
- HAKUFU!
( echoing )

283
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,708
- Rikuson: LEADER SONSAKU,
ARE YOU OKAY?

284
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,541
- I THINK I JUST HEARD KOUKIN.

285
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,125
THAT MEANS HE'S ALIVE!

286
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,125
- LOOK BEHIND YOU!
HURRY GET AWAY!

287
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:54,000
- AAH!
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

288
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,708
- SONSAKU!

289
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,041
- DON'T! YOU'LL GET
CAUGHT IN IT YOURSELF!

290
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,166
- SHE NEEDS ME!

291
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,708
- Chou'un: HONESTLY,
I DON'T THINK SO.

292
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,041
- REMEMBER SONSAKU DOES
HAVE THE POWER OF A DRAGON.

293
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,875
I'M SURE SHE CAN
HANDLE A FEW PLANTS

294
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,500
WITHOUT GETTING SO
MUCH AS A SCRATCH.

295
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,416
GOING AFTER HER WILL
TAKE TIME WE DON'T HAVE.

296
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,208
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
- THIS IS WRONG.

297
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,083
THESE ROOTS ARE
FEEDING SOMETHING.

298
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,958
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S BEYOND THEM.

299
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,125
THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY
THAT WHATEVER IT IS

300
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,125
HAS SOME CONNECTION
TO KENTEI.

301
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,166
- Hakufu: STUPID PLANTS!

302
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,125
( panting )

303
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,833
MAN!
I HATE THOSE ROOTS!

304
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,791
I'M GONNA BUST UP
EVERY SINGLE ONE!

305
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,625
I'LL GIVE 'EM A RIGHT JAB
AND A LEFT HOOK AND-- HUH?

306
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,500
WAIT A SEC, WHERE AM I?

307
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,583
- ( rattles )

308
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,375
( beeps )

309
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,583
- ( whimpers )

310
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,750
WHAT IS THAT?

311
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,375
( yelps )

312
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,000
HA!
STOP FOLLOWING ME!

313
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,458
- MASTER!

314
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,333
DON'T RUN AWAY.
IT'S ME!

315
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,791
- I KNOW THAT VOICE.
IT'S YOU, RIGHT?

316
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,291
- YES! YAY!
YOU ACTUALLY REMEMBERED ME!

317
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,250
THANK YOU!
- WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

318
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,750
- ( groans )

319
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,625
IT'S ME!
YOUR DISCIPLE MOUKI BACHOU!

320
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,625
- OH YEAH... BOCHIN!

321
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,791
- IT'S "BACHIN"!
IT MEANS PIPSQUEAK

322
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,833
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GAVE ME THE NICKNAME!

323
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,916
- COME TO THINK OF IT, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU AROUND LATELY.

324
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,250
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
- ARE YOU REALLY THAT DENSE?

325
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,708
I'VE BEEN AT THIS SCHOOL
THE ENTIRE TIME.

326
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,750
I STOWED AWAY ON THE SHIP
TO COME WITH YOU.

327
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,458
BUT ON THE DAY THE BOAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO LEAVE YOU MISSED IT.

328
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,083
WHAT HAPPENED? I HEARD YOU
FELL ASLEEP ON THE TRAIN!

329
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,625
- ( chuckles ) UH YEAH.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

330
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,041
BUT NOW
I'M HERE AND WITH YOU.

331
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,666
- YUP! I CAN'T REMEMBER THE
LAST TIME I WAS SO EXCITED!

332
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,166
- OH, AND ALSO
RYUU-CHAN'S IN BIG TROUBLE.

333
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,875
SHE'S SICK.
- MISS GENTOKU'S SICK?

334
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,083
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

335
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,541
AND IT'S ALL THAT WEIRD
HENTAI GUY'S FAULT!

336
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,041
- YOU MEAN KENTEI?
I BET THAT WAS HIM.

337
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,166
- WHAT?
YOU KNOW HIM, BACHIN?

338
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,625
- I THINK I SAW HIM.
HE HAD ON A HOODED CAPE

339
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,916
THAT, LIKE, COVERED HIS HEAD
AND HE WORE A MASK.

340
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,708
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME, MASTER?

341
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
HUH?

342
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,000
WHA...?

343
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,541
( groans )

344
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,750
- ( hisses )

345
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,250
- ( whimpers )

346
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,458
IT'S A SNAKE!

347
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,000
- ( hissing )

348
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,833
- ( sobbing )

349
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,250
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, BACHIN?
GET UP AND FIGHT!

350
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,458
- I CAN'T!
I HATE SNAKES.

351
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,250
I'M MORE AFRAID OF THEM
THAN ANYTHING!

352
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,500
- YOU CAN'T BE SCARED!
YOU'VE WORKED TOO HARD

353
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,166
TO GIVE IN TO FEAR!
- EH... WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

354
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,083
- FOCUS! REMEMBER THAT
SPECIAL TRAINING WE DID?

355
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,000
- OUR TRAINING?

356
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,291
- "DON'T THINK BUT STILL THINK,"
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

357
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,541
DON'T THINK!
- DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

358
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,166
THINK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE!

359
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,583
( grunting )

360
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,625
- ( groans )

361
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,250
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

362
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,208
- IF I STRIKE AN IRON
WHILE IT'S HOT

363
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,833
IT'LL BURN ME!

364
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,750
DON'T BURN BRIDGES!
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET HOME!

365
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,208
WHEN YOU CUT FLESH,
YOU MUST ALSO CUT BONE!

366
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,833
- FOCUS YOUR ATTACK AND HIT HIM
WHERE IT HURTS MOST!

367
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,416
- RIGHT!

368
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,625
- ( hisses )

369
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,708
- ( clanks )

370
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,250
- AN EYE FOR AN EYE.
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.

371
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,208
AND A KICK IN THE HEAD!

372
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,625
- ALL RIGHT!
SHALL WE GO FINISH THE JOB?

373
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,250
- YOU BET!
LET'S DO IT!

374
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,458
- ( both yelling )

375
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,916
- A ROLLING STONE...
- NEEDS TO GET OUTTA MY WAY!

376
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,458
- RIGHT! TIME TO GO
AND RESCUE EVERYBODY!

377
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,958
- YES, MASTER!
LET'S GO!

378
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,541
- BY THE WAY...

379
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,791
DO YOU KNOW THE WAY OUT?
- OY!

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,833
- ( theme music playing )

381
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,958
( singing in Japanese )

382
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,833
- Bachou: MASTER,
LET'S SLIP PAST

383
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,333
THE GUARDS
AND RESCUE EVERYONE!

384
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,875
- Hakufu:
HUH? HOW?

385
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,666
OUTSIDE THIS ROOM THERE'S
TONS OF ENEMY THUGS

386
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,000
CRAWLING ALL OVER
THE PLACE...

387
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,750
- LEAVE THAT TO ME!
SEE?

388
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,750
I CAN MAKE US A DISGUISE
OUT OF ALL OF THE STUFF

389
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,791
IN THIS TRASH BIN.

390
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,125
- OH! YOU MEAN WE'RE
DOING COSPLAY?

391
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,208
CAN YOU MAKE ME
A SEXY NURSE?

392
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,000
- MASTER! BE SERIOUS!

393
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,875
NEXT TIME ON "IKKI
TOUSEN XTREME XECUTOR":

394
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,375
"ANGRY LOVE."

395
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,083
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I'D
RATHER BE SANTA, ANYWAY!

396
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,875
- MASTER, ARE YOU
REALLY THAT STUPID?
