1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,875
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,833
- ( phone ringing )

4
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,750
- ( phone ringing )

5
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,791
- HI, SAJI?

6
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,375
UH, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE
TO TALK TO ME?

7
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,916
- Housen:
SORRY?

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,541
- A WOMAN'S VOICE?

9
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,208
SORRY, I MUST HAVE
DIALED WRONG.

10
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,833
I THOUGHT
THIS WAS SAJI'S NUMBER.

11
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,000
- WHO'S CALLING?

12
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,125
HE'S NOT HERE.
OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY,

13
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,833
HE LEFT WHILE I WAS
STILL ASLEEP.

14
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:45,000
BY ANY CHANCE,
ARE YOU THE GIRL I SAW BEFORE?

15
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,166
THE ONE WHO ALMOST GOT
A PIPE TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

16
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,625
MOU-CHAN WAS IT?
- EXCUSE ME?

17
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,000
- SAJI WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT YOU BEFORE WE WENT TO BED.

18
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,916
HE CALLED YOU CARELESS, SAID YOU
COULDN'T FINISH A FIGHT.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,041
- ( phone hangs up )
- OH.

20
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,166
- YOU'RE AN ASS, SAJI.

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,791
HOW COULD MAKE FUN OF ME
LIKE THAT?

22
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,416
- ( phone ringing )

23
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,125
- IDIOT.

24
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,041
- Saji:
A LITTLE TOO CARELESS,

25
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,125
JUST LIKE ALWAYS,
EH, MOU-CHAN?

26
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,708
HERE, YOU CAN HAVE THE REST.

27
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,083
I'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE.

28
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,500
CLEANING UP
IS A MAN'S JOB.

29
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,333
- WAIT, SAJI!

30
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,333
THAT WAS HER.

31
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,625
- WHAT'S THIS?

32
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,541
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN OUT HERE WAITING?

33
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,541
- IT WAS YOU ON THE PHONE,
WHY DID YOU COME OUT HERE?

34
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,500
- GUESS, WHY DO YOU THINK?

35
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,041
HERE.

36
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,958
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

37
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,833
YOU LOVE SAJI.
- WHAT?!

38
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,541
I DON'T LOVE HIM.
HE'S A JERK.

39
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,208
- YOU'RE SO OBVIOUS.

40
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,666
BUT, I WAS JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS

41
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,291
TO KEEP SAJI
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

42
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,750
AND I ENDED UP FALLING FOR HIM.

43
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,458
SO WHO AM I TO JUDGE
HOW YOU FEEL?

44
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,125
- SURVEILLANCE?

45
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,333
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

46
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,208
- YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW,

47
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,375
YOU HAVE NO CLUE
WHO THE MAN YOU LOVE REALLY IS.

48
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,916
A MEETING IS BEING HELD TODAY

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,750
AT YOSHU ACADEMY TO FORM
AN ANTI-TOTAKU ALLIANCE.

50
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,041
KAKU OF RAKUYO HIGH SCHOOL

51
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,208
IS SCHEMING TO PREVENT
THAT FROM HAPPENING.

52
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,833
BUT SHE'S NOT THE MASTERMIND
BEHIND THE CURTAIN

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,208
WHO'S SECRETLY PULLING
ALL THE STRINGS.

54
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,791
- IT SHOULD BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

55
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,375
- ( people running )

56
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,583
- WHAT IS THAT?

57
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,166
WHAT'S GOING ON?

58
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,291
- ( screaming )

59
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,541
- Kentei: AN 1800 YEAR OLD
VENDETTA MANIFESTED AS A DRAGON.

60
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,208
IT ENTERED RYOMOU
AND SETTLED BEHIND HER LEFT EYE.

61
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,291
THE DRAGON MAY NOT HAVE
KILLED HER IMMEDIATELY

62
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,083
BUT IT IS MERELY DORMANT.

63
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,291
ONE DAY IT WILL BURST OUT
FROM WITHIN HER,

64
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,000
AND RYOMOU WILL DIE
IN A RAIN OF HER OWN BLOOD.

65
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,125
JUST AS HER FOREBEAR DID.

66
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,750
- I REMEMBER.

67
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,083
I FELT A THROBBING PAIN
INSIDE MY LEFT EYE THAT DAY.

68
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,958
AND EVERY DAY SINCE!

69
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,166
AND ALL BECAUSE OF KAN'U!

70
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,625
- Yougai:
THIS FRIGGIN' SUCKS.

71
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,250
I CAN'T TAKE IT, HOW LONG
ARE THEY GOING TO KEEP US

72
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,708
COOPED UP?
- JUST CALM DOWN.

73
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,791
WE'LL BE RELEASED
ONCE THE SOUTHERN SCHOOLS

74
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,291
REACH AN AGREEMENT.

75
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,708
THEY'LL SURRENDER TO NANBAN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

76
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,583
BUT THOSE GUYS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM.

77
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,083
KYOSHO, SEITO, AND NANYO
ARE THE THREE SCHOOLS

78
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,250
THAT CONTROL KANTO. THEY'VE
FOUGHT SOME SERIOUS BATTLES

79
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,166
FOR THE POWER THEY HAVE,
THEY WON'T JUST SUBMIT.

80
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,875
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE ALSO HAVE NO IDEA

81
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,166
WHAT'S GOING ON
BEHIND THE SCENES.

82
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,083
THERE COULD BE SECRET ALLIANCES.

83
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,208
- HUH?

84
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,666
HEY, WAIT.

85
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,250
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

86
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,875
- Yougai:
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

87
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,208
I WAS JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.

88
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,000
- IF THERE WERE A CONNECTION,

89
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,541
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW,
WOULD WE?

90
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,458
- A CONNECTION?

91
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,166
THAT GIRL WHO WAS
WITH THE NANBAN FIGHTERS

92
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,666
WHEN THEY ATTACKED US
ON THE SHIP--

93
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,375
I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S THE ARCHER TEN'I.

94
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,666
FROM KYOSHO.

95
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,791
- COME TO THINK OF IT,

96
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,250
I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED
SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR.

97
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,500
HUH?

98
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,250
HEY, I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT!

99
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,708
I'M A PRISONER
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS!

100
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,000
- THEN EXPLAIN ABOUT THE GIRL.

101
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,000
- Soujin: SHE'S NOT
REALLY A KYOSHO FIGHTER.

102
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,958
ACTUALLY, SHE NEVER WAS.

103
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,500
SHE DIDN'T ANSWER TO SOUSOU.

104
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,708
SHE WAS A LACKEY
OF OUR OLD STRATEGIST, SHIBAI.

105
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,041
- Koukin:
CHUUTATSU SHIBAI.

106
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,208
FORMER STRATEGIST
OF KYOSHO ACADEMY.

107
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,541
DURING THE BATTLE OF RED CLIFFS
SHE FOUGHT KAN'U

108
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,458
AND WAS DEFEATED. THEN SHE
DISAPPEARED. DIDN'T SHE?

109
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:18,416
IS IT POSSIBLE
SHE COULD BE KENTEI?

110
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,791
- ANYWAY, WE SHOULD BE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

111
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,750
HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE.

112
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,375
WE COULD PLAY DEAD.

113
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,750
- I DON'T THINK SO.
GOT ANY <i>GOOD</i> IDEAS?

114
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,000
- HM... HEY, I KNOW!

115
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,500
- JUST GREAT!

116
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,250
YOU COMPLETELY KNOCKED
THE GUY OUT COLD.

117
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,000
NOW WE CAN'T GET
ANY INFO FROM HIM

118
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,875
ABOUT WHERE KOUKIN
AND THE OTHERS ARE!

119
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,166
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
HE HAD FIGURED IT OUT

120
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,833
SO I KICKED REALLY HARD.

121
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,041
- I MADE THE DISGUISE PERFECTLY.
NO ONE CAN TELL.

122
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,041
- Bachou:
MASTER!

123
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,458
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE STAIRS
UP AHEAD OF US.

124
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,916
- WHAT?  YOU MEAN THERE'S
NO ESCALATOR?

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,750
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

126
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:35,166
IT'S JUST A FEW STAIRS.

127
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,833
- BACHIN, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

128
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,958
- THIS LOOKS LIKE
JUST A STOREROOM, NO ONE'S HERE.

129
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,458
OH, WAIT!
I SEE ANOTHER ROOM IN THE BACK.

130
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
THAT BELONGS TO KAN'U.

131
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,000
- NOW, BACHIN!

132
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,458
- ( fighting )

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,583
- I CAN RETURN THIS TO KAN'U.

134
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,791
- Hakufu:
THIS IS TERRIBLE, BACHIN!

135
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,083
YOU KNOCKED THEM UNCONSCIOUS
THIS TIME, TOO.

136
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,833
- MASTER, AMBUSHING THEM
FROM ABOVE WAS YOUR IDEA.

137
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,750
PLUS, YOUR GUY'S
ALSO OUT COLD.

138
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,833
- FOCUS, DON'T OVERDO IT
THIS TIME.

139
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,458
- NO PROBLEM.
HEY, SOMEONE'S COMING.

140
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,041
OH, WOW.
HE SEEMS AWFULLY BIG.

141
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,375
- Hakufu: GOOD,

142
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,500
HOPEFULLY HE WON'T GO DOWN
FOR THE COUNT SO EASILY.

143
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,500
- WAIT, MASTER!

144
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,041
- 'KAY, SO THIS IS
YOUR FRIEND, THEN?

145
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,250
- YES, MASTER.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

146
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,833
- IN THAT CASE, THAT MAKES
YOU AND ME FRIENDS, TOO.

147
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,250
NICE TO MEET YOU!
- I'M KYOCHO.

148
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,375
- Bachou: HANG ON A SEC,
SOMETHING JUST OCCURRED TO ME.

149
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,083
KYOCHO'S FRIEND
AND GOLDFISH POOP

150
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,500
ARE PROBABLY IN THE SAME PLACE.

151
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,208
- THAT MAKES SENSE,
BUT WHERE ARE THEY?

152
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,625
WE THINK THEY'RE
SOMEWHERE TOGETHER,

153
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,583
BUT HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT
WHERE THAT PLACE IS?

154
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,708
HM...

155
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,583
- MASTER!

156
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,333
I HEARD SOMETHING ONCE ABOUT
FIGHTERS WITH SHARED FATES.

157
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,458
THEIR SACRED BEADS CAN CONNECT
THEM TO ONE ANOTHER.

158
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,583
WHAT IF YOU USE THE POWER
OF THE SACRED BEAD

159
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,666
TO TRY AND FIND GOLDFISH POOP?

160
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,791
- GREAT IDEA, I'LL TRY THAT!

161
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:36,833
'KAY, HERE IT GOES.

162
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:43,250
- ( humming )

163
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:50,291
- ( humming continues )

164
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,541
- Hakufu:
I SENSE SOMETHING!

165
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,833
- DID YOU FIGURE OUT
WHERE THEY ARE?!

166
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,083
- OVER THERE...

167
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,541
IT SMELLS LIKE CURRY!

168
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,541
- GREAT.

169
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,416
- I'M HUNGRY.

170
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,625
GIRL'S GOT TO EAT, RIGHT?

171
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,333
- YOU'RE RIGHT!

172
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,791
- IT SURE DOES SMELL DELICIOUS.

173
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,791
- HOW'S FOOD GOING TO HELP US
FIND KOUKIN AND THE OTHERS?

174
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,041
- EVERYONE'S GOT TO EAT.
THAT'S A FACT.

175
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,250
SO NANBAN HAS TO FEED
THEIR PRISONERS.

176
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,291
- NICE THINKING, BACHIN!

177
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,500
- YOU READY?
JUST LIKE WE ALL PLANNED IT.

178
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,958
- Soujin:
OW-WW!  IT HURTS!

179
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,125
IT HURTS SO MUCH!

180
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,750
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, SOUJIN?
- OH, MY STOMACH!

181
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,166
- IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ALL
HAVE FOOD POISONING.

182
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,000
HEY, YOU MORONS, DO SOMETHING!

183
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,375
- Koukin:
DO YOU HAVE ANY MEDICINE?

184
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,291
THEY'RE REALLY SICK,
THEY COULD DIE!

185
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,375
- GET 'EM!

186
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,666
- ( screams )

187
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,666
- I FOUND KOUKIN!

188
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,083
- HAKUFU?

189
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

190
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,458
- Bachou:
AND MOUKI BACHOU, I'M HERE, TOO!

191
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,958
- YOU'RE NOT DEAD!

192
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,583
WAY TO STAY ALIVE, BACHOU!

193
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,125
- THANK YOU, GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE ALIVE TOO, CHOUHI.

194
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,708
- Kyocho:
ARE YOU ALRIGHT, SOUJIN?

195
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,333
- Soujin:
WELL, SORT OF.

196
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,791
- Koukin:
THANKS FOR SAVING US, HAKUFU.

197
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:27,833
- SURE, ANYTIME.

198
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,416
- Yougai: OKAY, WE HELPED YOU
ESCAPE. NOW YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

199
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,833
- Shuhou:
SEE YOU.

200
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,750
- THEY COULD HAVE
AT LEAST STAYED FOR THE MEAL.

201
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,375
- Ekitoku: I SEE, SO GENTOKU'S
DRAGON HAS BEEN AWAKENED AGAIN.

202
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,583
- YES IT HAS.
MASTER SUIKYOU SAYS SHE'S SICK.

203
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,750
KAN'U MAY BE HER ONLY HOPE.

204
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,500
BY THE WAY, WHERE IS SHE?

205
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,291
- I'M NOT SURE.

206
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,666
I SENSE SOMETHING BAD. SHE'S
DEFINITELY IN SOME TROUBLE.

207
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,500
- WE THINK SHE MIGHT BE FIGHTING
NO HOLDS BARRED WITH RYOMOU.

208
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,250
- YOU MEAN, TO THE DEATH?

209
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,208
BUT THEY'RE FRIENDS,
WHY WOULD THEY FIGHT LIKE THAT?

210
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,958
- Soujin:
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THOSE TWO

211
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,750
HAVE BAD KARMA BETWEEN THEM.

212
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,333
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

213
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,375
THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO BIG
TO SEARCH EVERYWHERE.

214
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,750
- I WANTED TO RETURN THIS
BACK TO KAN'U.

215
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
BUT HOW WILL WE FIND HER?

216
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,958
- HOLD ON A SEC, IS THAT
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

217
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,208
- I FOUND IT ON THE WALL
IN THE STOREROOM.

218
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,416
- Ekitoku:
THE GREEN DRAGON BLADE.

219
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,375
I CAN HEAR IT,

220
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,666
THIS BLADE IS CRYING OUT
TO BE RETURNED TO KAN'U.

221
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,625
- Mouyuu: WE'RE JUST ABOUT
AT THE CENTER OF THE BASEMENT.

222
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,250
- WHAT IS THAT THING?
IT'S ENORMOUS.

223
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,666
- IT'S WHAT ALL THE ROOTS
THAT ARE GROWING

224
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,916
ALL OVER THESE CATACOMBS
SEEM TO BE FEEDING.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,166
- Bashoku:
IS THIS REALLY NANBAN HIGH?

226
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,458
- Mouyuu:
GOOD QUESTION.

227
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,041
I'VE BEEN WONDERING THAT MYSELF.

228
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,333
- THIS ISN'T
JUST A GIGANTIC TREE.

229
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,500
- Bashoku: MISS KOUMEI, WHAT
ARE THESE STRINGS OF BULBS?

230
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,708
- Koumei:
THIS IS...

231
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,750
- Chou'un:
STRATEGIST, TELL US

232
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,208
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

233
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,291
- Koumei:
SOMETHING UNSPEAKABLY EVIL.

234
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,333
DARK SOUL RESURRECTION.

235
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,791
- Chou'un:
WHAT IS THAT?  IS IT A SPELL?

236
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,375
- Rikuson:
MORE LIKE ALCHEMY.

237
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,916
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC METHOD
FOR RAISING THE DEAD.

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,916
- Koumei:
IT'S A TABOO PRACTICE

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,916
THAT HAS NONETHELESS
BEEN ATTEMPTED MORE THAN ONCE

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,666
SINCE ANCIENT TIMES.

241
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,375
IT IS A GHASTLY
AND DEPLORABLE METHOD

242
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,375
OF RESTORING LIFE
TO THE DECEASED.

243
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,125
HOST BODIES ARE GROWN
ARTIFICIALLY

244
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,208
TO ACCOMMODATE WANDERING SOULS
THAT MAY BE BITTER OR VENGEFUL.

245
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,000
THE ONLY WAY
FOR THESE GRUESOME CREATIONS

246
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,166
TO FULLY MATURE IS TO SPILL
BLOOD OF FIGHTERS

247
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,416
AND FEED IT TO THEM.

248
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,208
THIS IS THE HORROR

249
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,333
THAT WAS KENTEI'S TRUE PLAN.

250
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,416
- Rikuson:
SO THOSE GLOWING PODS

251
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,791
ARE ALIVE?

252
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:16,541
- Mouyuu: NANBAN HIGH SCHOOL
HAS BECOME A DEN OF MONSTERS.

253
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,500
- Ryomou:
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

254
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,291
IT'S EITHER KILL

255
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,291
OR BE KILLED!

256
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,458
- MY SACRED BEAD IS PULSING
WITH ENERGY.

257
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,583
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I CAN HEAR SOMETHING.

258
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,750
THERE'S NO MISTAKING IT,

259
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
WHAT I'M HEARING
IS DEFINITELY A FIGHT.

260
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,750
- Kan'u:
RYOMOU!

261
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,083
- Ryomou:
KAN'U!

262
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,791
- I FEEL HER.

263
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,083
STRATEGIST.

264
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,958
- YES, CHOU'UN,
WHAT'S WRONG?

265
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,375
- THERE IS A FEROCIOUS BATTLE
GOING ON RIGHT ABOVE THIS TREE.

266
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,166
- IS KAN'U THERE?
CAN YOU SENSE HER?

267
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,916
- I BELIEVE SO.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,458
MAY I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION
TO GO INVESTIGATE?

269
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,208
- Soujin:
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE TWO?

270
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,916
THEY BOTH LOOK DEAD.

271
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,375
- Hakufu:
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

272
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,416
- Soujin: IT'S A TRAP!

273
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,916
THE NANBAN GUYS
WERE WAITING FOR US!

274
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,083
- I DIDN'T EXPECT
NANYO'S LEADER

275
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,208
TO COME RESCUE
HER FIGHTERS PERSONALLY.

276
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,083
YOU'VE SAVED ME THE TROUBLE
OF HAVING TO HUNT YOU DOWN.

277
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,833
- THAT'S THE MAN I SAW BEFORE!

278
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,041
- WHICH MEANS YOU MUST BE...

279
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,416
- YOU'RE KENTEI!

280
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,541
- YEAH, THAT GUY!

281
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,000
- CORRECT.

282
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,500
I AM UNEQUIVOCALLY
THE ONE AND ONLY

283
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,416
TRUE BEARER OF THE TITLE

284
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
KENTEI EMPEROR
OF THE LATER HAN.

285
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,000
- Koukin:
BUT IF YOU REALLY ARE KENTEI,

286
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,083
WHY BOTHER PRETENDING
THIS WAS A TOURNAMENT?

287
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,583
YOU COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY
ISSUED AN IMPERIAL ORDER

288
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,125
FOR US TO COME
AND PAY HOMAGE TO YOU.

289
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,791
- FIGHTERS ARE SIMPLE
AND STUPID.

290
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,041
YOU KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT
THE INSTINCT TO FIGHT.

291
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,708
I REQUIRE THIS PRIMAL ENERGY
TO FULFILL MY MASTER PLAN.

292
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,916
AND RIGHT NOW, KAN'U
AND RYOMOU ARE SUPPLYING IT.

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,333
- YOU EVIL MONSTER!

294
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,750
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH KAN'U?

295
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,625
- Kentei: SHE AND RYOMOU
ARE FIGHTING IT OUT.

296
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,583
SETTLING AN ANCIENT BLOOD FEUD
IN THE ARENA BELOW US.

297
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,541
THEY'RE FIGHTING TO THE DEATH.

298
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,916
IT WILL BE OVER SOON.

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,750
- NEVER!  WE'LL STOP YOU.

300
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,833
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE
GOING TO LET THEM DIE.

301
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,833
- IT'S TOO LATE.
BESIDES, IN A FEW MINUTES

302
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,875
YOU'LL ALL BE DEAD, TOO.

303
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,333
EVERY NANBAN FIGHTER
IS HERE TO MAKE SURE OF IT.

304
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,083
YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ALL OF THEM.
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY.

305
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,166
- NO!  WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

306
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,500
- SO MANY OF THEM,
DEFINITELY MORE THAN A HUNDRED.

307
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,083
- HEY, CHOUHI!

308
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,416
- WHAT IS IT?

309
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
- Bachou: HERE!

310
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,083
HURRY, GO FIND KAN'U.

311
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,833
THESE PATHETIC NANBAN MORONS
ARE ALL MINE.

312
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,208
- HANG ON,
DON'T GO HOGGING THEM ALL.

313
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,208
KENTEI MESSED WITH US TOO.
AND I'M MAD AS HELL.

314
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,625
HE WANTS A FIGHT, HE'LL GET ONE!

315
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,000
I'M GOING TO KICK SOME ASS

316
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,291
AND THEN SOME!

317
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,750
- LET'S DO THIS!

318
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,541
YOU GOT ME ALL FIRED UP!

319
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,083
ONE!

320
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,416
- AND TWO!

321
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,750
- THAT'S THREE!

322
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,125
- Bachou: CHOUHI!

323
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,583
WHEN YOU GIVE THAT TO KAN'U,

324
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,125
PLEASE TELL HER I SAID HI.

325
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,666
- THANKS BACHOU, I WILL.

326
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,625
- KAN'U...

327
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,416
- WHAT'S ALL THE BIG RUSH,
SPEED RACER?

328
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,750
YOU REALIZE THEY'RE BOTH
PROBABLY DEAD ALREADY, RIGHT?

329
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,833
- OUT OF THE WAY,
I HAVE TO SAVE MY FRIEND!

330
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,291
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!

331
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,000
- DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES
IN A BUNCH.

332
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,333
FRIENDS, FAMILY, NONE OF IT
REALLY MATTERS IN THE END.

333
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,708
WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE
AND IT'S ALL ON THE LINE,

334
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,041
YOUR OWN LIFE'S THE ONE
YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE.

335
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,458
- YOU BITCH.

336
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,041
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I PITY YOU.

337
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,500
- PITY ME?

338
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,000
- YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LOVE
OR TRUST ANYONE.

339
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,375
IF YOU DID, YOU'D UNDERSTAND
HOW I FEEL.

340
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,166
FOR KAN'U AND FOR THE ONES
I LOVE,

341
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,625
I WOULD GLADLY PUT MY LIFE
ON THE LINE.

342
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,291
- THAT'S ALL BULLSHIT!

343
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,833
FUCK YOU!

344
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,958
- PATHETIC BITCH!

345
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,083
- WHAT THE HELL?!

346
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,083
- HANG ON, KAN'U.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

347
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,375
I'LL BRING
YOUR GREEN DRAGON BLADE,

348
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,250
I SWEAR.

349
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:47,208
BUT BEFORE THAT, I'M GOING
TO KICK SOME SERIOUS NANBAN ASS!

350
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:02,000
- ( theme music playing )

351
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

352
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,875
- Soujin: I'M SICK
OF THIS ALREADY.

353
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,333
WHEN DO WE GET TO GO HOME?

354
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,875
- Kyocho:
NO IDEA.

355
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,625
I DON'T KNOW ANY
MORE THAN YOU DO.

356
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,166
- THERE'S
NO TV HERE.

357
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,625
I MISSED MY SOAPS THIS WEEK.

358
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,000
NOW I'LL BE BEHIND
ON THE STORIES.

359
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,375
- I THINK STAYING ALIVE
IS MORE IMPORTANT

360
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,000
THAN KEEPING UP ON YOUR
FAVORITE SOAP OPERAS.

361
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,458
WATCH OUT, IT'S COMING
AT YOU. - UH-OH!

362
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,750
NEXT TIME ON "IKKI TOUSEN
XTREME XECUTOR--"

363
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,458
"SHREDDED
DARKNESS."

364
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,208
COULD SOMEONE MAYBE RECORD
THIS WEEK'S SOAPS FOR ME,

365
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,958
PLEASE?
