1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:22,166
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,583
- ( Goei laughing )

4
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,083
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT
YOU WERE MY IDIOT DAUGHTER,

5
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,083
BUT I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW
HOW DOWNRIGHT STUPID YOU WERE.

6
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,458
- OKAY, NOW ISN'T THAT
A BIT TOO HARSH?

7
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,541
- Goei: SO YOU LEFT THE HOUSE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING

8
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,916
AND BOARDED THE TRAIN.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,375
YOU THEN WENT AND FELL ASLEEP

10
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,375
ON THE YAMANOTE LINE
AND JUST KEPT RIDING

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,041
IN CIRCLES UNTIL
YOU WOKE UP.

12
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,458
SERIOUSLY, HOW DEVASTATINGLY
STUPID CAN YOU GET?

13
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,916
- OKAY, I GET IT!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,041
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER YOURSELF FORTUNATE

15
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,958
THAT KOUKIN WAS ABLE
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE

16
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,083
AT THE BIG FIGHTER'S
TOURNAMENT.

17
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,500
- WHAT?  BUT IT'S NO GOOD
IF KOUKIN FIGHTS.

18
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,416
MOU-CHAN AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONES

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,083
GOING OUT THERE
AND WINNING.

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,375
AND AFTER OUR GREAT VICTORY,

21
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,083
WE WERE GOING TO
TURN INTO A HIGH SCHOOL

22
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,125
SINGING AND DANCING
FIGHTER DUO.

23
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,791
AND THEN WE'D MAKE
OUR WORLD DEBUT

24
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,375
AS IDOLS!

25
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,583
- Man: MOU-CHAN!

26
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,416
MOU-CHAN, I LOVE YOU!

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,583
( cheering )

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,500
- YAY!

29
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,500
AND THEN I COULD FINALLY
SAY GOOD-BYE

30
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,833
TO THE AWFUL OLD HAG I'VE
BEEN STUCK WITH FOR SO LONG

31
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,166
AND LIVE THE GOOD LIFE
IN A LUXURIOUS CONDO--

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,916
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!
- ( yelps )

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,750
- Goei: HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
ABOUT YOUR ONE AND ONLY MOTHER?!

34
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,875
- Hakufu: I'M SORRY.
THE TRUTH JUST SLIPPED OUT!

35
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,583
- WHAT?!
- UHH... NO, I WAS KIDDING.

36
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,583
THE TRUTH DIDN'T
SLIP OUT AT ALL.

37
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,708
OH?  WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

38
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,125
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

39
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,083
A POSTCARD JUST CAME
IN THE MAIL FOR YOU.

40
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,750
- AWW. I WONDER HOW
CHUBO'S BEEN DOING LATELY.

41
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,333
- Chubo: "GREETINGS.

42
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,166
WHILE THE SUN CONTINUES
ITS MERCILESS STROKE OF HEAT

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,666
ACROSS THE LAND,

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,041
I HOPE THAT EVERYONE
HAS BEEN DOING WELL.

45
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,000
GRANDMOTHER, GENPOU, AND I
ARE ALL KEEPING VERY WELL.

46
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,375
EVERY DAY THAT
WE SPEND HERE 

47
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,041
IS FULL OF TRANQUILITY.

48
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,208
AND THE DAYS I SPENT
WITH YOU AT NANYO ACADEMY

49
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,625
NOW SEEM LIKE
THE DISTANT PAST,

50
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,625
AS IF THEY WERE
MANY LIFETIMES AGO.

51
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,458
IF YOU HAPPEN TO
FIND THE TIME,

52
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,375
PLEASE CONSIDER
COMING TO VISIT US HERE.

53
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,458
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY
WHEN I CAN SEE YOU,

54
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,041
YOUR MOTHER,
AND KOUKIN AGAIN.

55
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,791
AND I HOPE WITH
ALL MY HEART

56
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,041
THAT DAY WILL BE
VERY SOON.

57
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,625
I HAVE TO GO,

58
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,208
BUT PLEASE CONTINUE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

59
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,041
AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

60
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,583
SINCERELY,
CHUBO."

61
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,708
- I UNDERSTAND.

62
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,916
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,083
- ( cell phone beeps )
- ( sighs )

64
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,916
- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED ANY LESS OF HER.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,250
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S THE FIRST TIME

66
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,000
SHE'S DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

67
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,250
- Yougai: YEAH, BUT DO YOU THINK
WE CAN REALLY TRUST THEM?

68
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,833
- HMM?
- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

69
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,791
THAT THE REAL KENTEI
SENT THE IMPERIAL LETTER?

70
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,166
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
IF HE GOT TOGETHER

71
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,375
WITH THOSE GUYS AT NANBAN,

72
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,041
THEN CHANCES ARE IT MEANS--

73
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,208
- THOSE RABID SISTERS ARE 
NO DOUBT BOUND TO SHOW UP,

74
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,333
RIGHT? SO AFTER THEY GO
AND SEVER TIES WITH US,

75
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,583
THEY HAVE THE ARROGANCE
TO SEND A LETTER LIKE THIS.

76
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,000
- IF NOTHING ELSE, 
I CAN PAY THEM BACK

77
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,250
FOR PUTTING A SCAR ON THIS
BEAUTIFUL HEAD OF MINE.

78
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,416
- ANYWAY YOU LOOK AT IT,
THIS TOURNAMENT IS STILL

79
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,333
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE FEDERATION.

80
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,875
- Men: YEAH!
- ALL RIGHT?

81
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,958
- Koukin:
THE SOUTHERN KANTO FEDERATION.

82
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,875
I HEAR THEY HAVEN'T ALLIED
WITH ANY LEADER OR SCHOOL,

83
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,416
BUT HAVE COME TOGETHER FOR
SOVEREIGNTY IN ALL OF KANTO.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,708
AND NOW THAT THERE'S
A THREE-WAY STALEMATE,

85
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,708
JUST AS KOUMEI SHOUKATSURYO
OF THE THREE KINGDOMS

86
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,958
ERA PREDICTED,

87
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,666
THEY'RE BECOMING
A RISING NEW POWER.

88
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,666
REPRESENTING KYOSHO ARE...

89
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,708
KYOCHO CHUUKOU,

90
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,375
A SUPER A-RANK HEAVY HITTER.

91
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,291
SHE REFUSES TO LET ANYONE
NEAR THEIR LEADER SOUSOU.

92
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,125
AND SHIKOU SOUJIN,

93
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,208
A B-RANK OFFENSIVE COMMANDER,

94
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,458
AND LEADER OF
MANY SUBORDINATES.

95
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,333
- ( yawns )

96
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,541
- AND OF COURSE,
SEITO'S REPRESENTATIVES ARE...

97
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,375
KAN'U,

98
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,791
AND HER GOOD FRIEND
CHOUHI.

99
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,333
I WONDER IF THE POWER
OF THE SACRED BEADS

100
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,416
IS TRYING TO CREATE
YET ANOTHER EPIC BATTLE.

101
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,333
SHIMEI RYOMOU DIED
AS A RESULT OF A CURSE

102
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,125
FOR HAVING BEHEADED
UNCHO KAN'U.

103
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,916
SUCH INTERTWINING DESTINIES.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,750
- Ryomou: I FEEL IT.

105
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,333
IT'S FAINT.

106
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,166
BUT I CAN FEEL
THE CHI OF BATTLE

107
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,666
SLOWLY PULLING ME IN.

108
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,166
- Ekitoku: HEY, KAN'U? WHAT'S
UP WITH THE GRIM EXPRESSION

109
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,333
YOU'VE GOT GOING ON THERE?
- HMM?

110
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,333
- YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
INTO BATTLE, YOU KNOW.

111
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,166
IF YOU DON'T GO IN 
COMPLETELY FOCUSED,

112
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,166
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GIVE IT YOUR ALL.

113
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,750
- I'M FEELING FINE.

114
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,625
THE LAST TOURNAMENT
I WENT TO,

115
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,541
I HAD NO ONE ELSE
TO DEPEND ON,

116
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,625
BUT THIS TIME
I HAVE YOU WITH ME.

117
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,291
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

118
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,041
AS LONG AS THE TWO OF US
ARE TOGETHER.

119
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,375
YOU AND I ARE BOUND
BY UNBREAKABLE TIES

120
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,208
THAT HAVE US FIGHTING TOGETHER
THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR LIVES.

121
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,333
- UNBREAKABLE TIES.

122
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,125
AND IF I RECALL CORRECTLY,
WE JUST FOUND ANOTHER ONE 

123
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,583
TO ADD TO THE MANY THAT
BIND US TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE?

124
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,333
- OH, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THAT LOUDMOUTH BRATTY GIRL,

125
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,666
AREN'T YOU?

126
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,125
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I HADN'T SEEN HER IN AWHILE

127
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,583
AND THEN I'D HEARD
SHE'D GONE OVER

128
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,541
FOR SOME SPECIAL TRAINING

129
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,333
WITH SONSAKU
AT NANYO ACADEMY.

130
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,958
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU MEAN HAKUFU SONSAKU?

131
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,291
- SHE'S REALLY QUITE
THE SLICK ONE, ISN'T SHE?

132
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,583
- IN THE WORLD OF COMBAT,
THERE ARE NO LIMITS

133
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,708
TO WHAT A PERSON SHOULD DO

134
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,416
IN ORDER TO BECOME
A STRONGER FIGHTER.

135
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
SHE MUST HAVE HER REASONS,

136
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,416
AND WE HAVE NO RIGHT
TO JUDGE HER FOR THAT.

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
- WELL, IN THAT CASE, I'LL BE
SURE TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,916
HOW MUCH STRONGER
SHE'S BECOME

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,416
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HER.

140
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,916
- ( chuckles )
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

141
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,291
- KYOCHOU?

142
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,833
IT WAS SO EARLY I DIDN'T HAVE
TIME TO EAT THIS MORNING.

143
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,000
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING?
- NO, I DON'T.

144
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,708
- AWW, MAN.

145
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,083
( groans )
HUH?

146
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,500
OH, SO YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING.

147
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,958
- HMM?

148
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,250
- SO IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE HUMAN AFTER ALL.

149
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,708
THANKS FOR THE FOOD.

150
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,250
- HUH?  THAT'S FUNNY.

151
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,416
- Kyochou: SORRY,
BUT THAT FOODS NOT MINE.

152
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,250
- UH--
- HMM?

153
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,333
( screaming )

154
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,458
SO YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED
YOUR LESSON YET, HAVE YOU?

155
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,500
- HA!  DON'T GET THE IDEA
THAT I'M HERE BECAUSE OF YOU.

156
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,458
I CAME TO CHEER
FOR MY MASTER

157
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,125
WHO WILL BE COMPETING
IN THE BIG FIGHTERS TOURNAMENT.

158
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,958
- FOR YOUR MASTER?
- HOLD ONTO YOUR HAT.

159
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,291
MY MASTER IS NONE OTHER THAN
THE LEADER OF NANYO ACADEMY.

160
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,208
THE HAKUFU SONSAKU!

161
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,458
- WHO'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

162
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,125
- I DON'T KNOW.

163
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,458
- WHAT DOES THAT GIRL
THINK SHE'S DOING HERE?

164
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,875
- SONSAKU HAS A DISCIPLE?

165
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,458
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

166
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,458
- WELL...
WELL, YOU SEE...

167
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,583
IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED.

168
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,250
- OKAY, SO YOU'RE HERE.

169
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,708
BUT I NOTICE THAT YOUR MASTER
IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

170
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,416
SHE'S NOT SWIMMING BEHIND
THE SHIP BY CHANCE, IS SHE?

171
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,750
- WH-- WHY YOU...

172
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,833
- Koukin: UH, BACHOU.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

173
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,583
- OH, GOLDFISH POOP.
SO WHERE'S MASTER?

174
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,458
- WELL, YOU SEE,
IT'S ABOUT THAT.

175
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,000
- WHAT?! SHE GOT ON
THE YAMANOTE LINE

176
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,000
EARLY IN THE MORNING 
AND THEN FELL ASLEEP?

177
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,708
AND WENT AROUND AND AROUND
AND AROUND IN CIRCLES

178
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,916
AND ONLY REALIZED
SHE WAS LATE

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,875
AFTER WAKING UP AT NOON?!

180
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,333
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO YELL
IT OUT SO LOUDLY LIKE THAT.

181
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,833
- ( men laughing )
- ( sighs )

182
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,500
- Koutei: I HEARD RUMORS THAT
THE HEAD OF NANYO WAS AN IDIOT,

183
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,666
BUT NEVER THOUGHT
SHE WAS THAT STUPID.

184
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,375
- Yougai: WHO CARES
HOW STRONG YOU ARE 

185
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,291
IF YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF
AN IDIOT TO EVEN USE IT?

186
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,250
- Shuhou: WHAT A PERFECT MATCH
THOSE TWO MAKE.

187
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,916
A STUPID MASTER
FOR A STUPID DISCIPLE.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,708
- DON'T YOU...

189
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,666
DARE LAUGH!

190
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,375
I WON'T FORGIVE YOU.

191
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,041
HOW DARE YOU LAUGH AT ME!

192
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,291
- BACHOU.  CHILL.

193
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,458
- HUH?

194
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,250
- YOU WANT TO HAVE IT
OUT HERE, DO YOU?

195
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,375
- YOU BET I DO.
I WON'T JUST STAND BY

196
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,791
WHILE YOU LAUGH
AND SMACK TALK ME AND MY MASTER.

197
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,833
- JUST LET IT GO.
- SHUT UP!

198
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,791
ANYONE WHO STANDS BY
WHILE THEIR MASTER IS INSULTED

199
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,666
IS NOT FIT TO CALL THEMSELVES
A TRUE FIGHTER!

200
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,916
- ( men murmur )

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,416
- ( grunts )

202
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
- ( chuckles )

203
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,916
- ( groans )

204
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,666
( whimpers )
- HEY.

205
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,000
- NO!
- SHE'S SEASICK?

206
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,125
- ( men laughing )

207
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,333
- WELL, THAT'S NO GOOD.

208
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,250
I GUESS SHE ISN'T ANY
STRONGER AFTER ALL.

209
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,083
- IT SEEMS SHE'S
QUITE A WAYS OFF

210
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,333
BEFORE SHE CAN JOIN THE RANKS OF
THE SEITO FIVE TIGER GENERALS.

211
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,000
- Ekitoku: HEY YOU! WHY DON'T
YOU GET A GRIP ALREADY?

212
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,708
- ( sighs, gags )

213
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,000
- ( chuckles ) SO WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO DO NOW, KYOCHO?

214
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,500
- NOTHING.

215
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
IT DOESN'T EVEN
CONCERN ME.

216
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,708
- WELL, OKAY THEN.

217
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,666
- MAN, THAT REALLY
RUINED THE MOMENT.

218
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,583
- OH, WELL.
THAT'S THAT.

219
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,416
- YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

220
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,916
- SO THAT'S SONSAKU'S
APPRENTICE?

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,583
- ( Bachou groans )

222
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,041
- YOU KNOW,

223
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,041
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM
ONE LITTLE BIT.

224
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,625
- PERHAPS.

225
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,625
BUT HE DOES HAVE 
AN UNUSUAL POWER.

226
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,041
- Moukaku: YOU'RE RIGHT.

227
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,125
BUT WHEN I LOOK UP
AT HIS UGLY FACE, 

228
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,333
HE MAKES ME
WANT TO PUKE.

229
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,416
- SO WHAT'S THE LATEST
ON THE STATUS OF OUR PLANS?

230
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,166
- OF COURSE WE'RE GOING
THROUGH WITH THEM, IDIOT.

231
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,208
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE
HE TOLD US.

232
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,625
TAKING OVER KANTO WAS SOMETHING
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN PLANNING.

233
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,458
- I KNOW.

234
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,875
- JUST REMEMBER THAT
TAKING OVER NANBAN HIGH SCHOOL

235
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,250
IS JUST THE FIRST STEP,
GOT IT?

236
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,250
( chuckles )
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

237
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,125
YOU READY TO DANCE,
FUCKWITS?

238
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,625
- ( girls laughing )

239
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,833
- SO I GUESS HER FATHER
AND HER TEACHERS

240
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,500
WEREN'T ENOUGH FOR HER.

241
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,458
- I HEARD THE GIRL TRIED
TO GET IN WITH SHIBAI AS WELL.

242
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,166
- SHE'S QUITE THE BRAT,
ISN'T SHE?

243
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,333
- LOOK AT YOU.
YOU POOR LITTLE THING.

244
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,833
YOU'RE SOAKING WET.

245
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,291
- YOU'LL CATCH A COLD.

246
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,250
- LET'S STRIP HER.
- ( laughs ) GOOD IDEA.

247
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,166
- Ten'i: STOP.

248
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,041
( gasping )

249
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,416
( grunts )

250
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,250
( panting )

251
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,541
- Shibai: TEN'I!

252
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,916
YOU NEED TO STOP, TEN'I.

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,375
YOU'VE DONE QUITE ENOUGH.

254
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,041
- ( screams )

255
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,750
- Shibai:
THERE.  I'VE GOT YOU.

256
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,166
YOU LITTLE TROUBLE MAKER.

257
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,625
- Ten'i: THAT MOMENT,
FROM THAT SECOND,

258
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,583
MY LIFE WAS YOURS,
MOTHER MARY.

259
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,541
NO MATTER THE COST,

260
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,291
I WILL GLADLY
GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU.

261
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,583
- Kentei: REMEMBER MY SOUL
WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

262
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,250
BECAUSE OF THAT,

263
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,333
NOBODY IN THIS WORLD
WILL EVER BE ABLE TO

264
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,500
HURT YOU AGAIN.

265
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,541
YOU WILL SOON BE
FULLY REBORN,

266
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,166
LIKE ME.

267
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,708
JUST AS I WAS REBORN.

268
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,458
- ( car horn honks )

269
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,000
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU!

270
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,833
- CHUBO.

271
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,291
( giggles )
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

272
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,458
- YOU LOOK JUST AS WELL
AS WHEN I LEFT YOU.

273
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,458
THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

274
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,125
- AND THEN
BEFORE I KNEW IT

275
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,791
SHE BECAME MY DISCIPLE.

276
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,166
- THAT'S A BIG
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU.

277
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,208
BUT I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING SO WELL.

278
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,791
- OH, YEAH.  MOM TOLD ME
TO TELL YOU SHE SAYS HI.

279
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,958
YOU KNOW HOW THAT OLD HAG
IS STILL RUNNING AROUND

280
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,625
CHASING AFTER YOUNG STUDS.
- OH? ( giggles )

281
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,541
- AND YET, NO MATTER
HOW IMMATURE SHE ACTS,

282
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,458
SHE STILL CALLS ME 
HER STUPID DAUGHTER

283
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,041
EVERY TIME SHE SEES ME.
SHE'S RELENTLESS.

284
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,125
- HMM.
HEY, BIG SISTER?

285
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,666
- HMM?  WHAT'S UP?

286
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,583
- WELL, UH...
IT'S ABOUT--

287
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,333
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT!
CHIBI THE CAT IS GOOD TOO.

288
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,708
- ( meows )
- Chubo: OH, I SEE.

289
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,083
- AND AS FOR KOUKIN...
- YES?

290
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,750
- HE'S AT THE BIG
FIGHTERS TOURNAMENT.

291
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,666
- BIG FIGHTERS TOURNAMENT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

292
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,166
WHERE YOU CAN DO BATTLE WITH
A BUNCH OF AWESOME STRONG GUYS.

293
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,583
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO MYSELF,
BUT THERE WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM

294
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,125
AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,
AND WELL, YOU KNOW.

295
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,041
( laughs )
HUH?

296
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,250
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG,
CHUBO?

297
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,833
- JUST HOW DANGEROUS
OF A POSITION

298
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,708
IS BIG BROTHER KOUKIN
IN RIGHT NOW?

299
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,916
- OH?  OH, DON'T WORRY.
HE'LL BE OKAY.

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,083
FOR FIGHTERS LIKE US,
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

301
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,666
ISN'T A BIG DEAL AT ALL.

302
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,125
- I WISH I HAD BEEN RAISED
A FIGHTER LIKE YOU TWO.

303
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,708
IF I HAD BEEN
RAISED A FIGHTER,

304
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,958
NOT ONLY WOULD I BE ABLE

305
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,875
TO SPEND A LOT MORE
OF MY TIME WITH YOU,

306
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,416
BUT I COULD SPEND IT WITH
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN AS WELL.

307
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,333
( sighs )
- CHUBO!

308
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,541
I TOLD YOU.
DID YOU FORGET ALREADY

309
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,291
THAT YOU'RE MY DARLING
LITTLE SISTER

310
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,041
WHENEVER AND WHEREVER
EITHER OF US ARE.

311
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,291
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

312
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,708
- EVEN WHEN WE'RE
NOT TOGETHER, WE ARE.

313
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,708
I KNOW KOUKIN FEELS
THE SAME WAY TOO.

314
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,208
EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOT TOGETHER,

315
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,458
WE'RE ALL STILL
TOGETHER IN SPIRIT.

316
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,250
- YES.

317
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,208
- OKAY, NOW IT'S TIME
TO PLAY HARD!

318
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,583
- OH, BIG SISTER.

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,750
- ( sighs )

320
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,750
- Koukin: YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER. 

321
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,833
- ( sighs )

322
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,666
- I WANTED TO COME
AND THANK YOU FOR

323
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,750
STANDING FOR HAKUFU BEFORE.

324
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,000
- OH, LOOK.
IT'S THE GOLDFISH POOP.

325
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,583
DAMN IT.  IF I DIDN'T 
GET SEASICK LIKE THIS,

326
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,750
I'D NEVER LET THOSE
STUPID JERKS GET AWAY WITH IT.

327
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,583
- ( sighs )

328
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,083
- SAY, KYOCHO,

329
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE CHANCES ARE

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,583
THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE IN
THE BIG FIGHTERS TOURNAMENT?

331
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
- DON'T KNOW.
- OH, YEAH.

332
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,041
WASN'T SHE SAYING ABOUT
MOUTOKU BEING AN ENEMY

333
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,208
OR SOMETHING?

334
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,750
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY
REASON WHY THAT IS? 

335
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,708
- ( sighs )

336
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,958
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT STILL... 

337
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
WHOEVER IT IS,

338
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:55,166
I REFUSE TO JUST STAND BY 
AND LET THEM KILL MR. MOU.

339
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,166
- Kan'u: EKITOKU.

340
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,708
- Ekitoku: YEAH?
WHAT IS IT, KAN'U?

341
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,958
- DO YOU NOT FEEL IT?

342
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,666
THERE'S AN EVIL ENERGY.

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,916
- EVIL ENERGY?

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,583
- All: HUH?
- WHY DID THE SHIP JUST STOP?

345
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,916
- HUH?

346
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,708
- WHERE'D ALL THIS
FOG COME FROM?

347
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,875
- ( water splashes )
- ( gasping )

348
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,083
- Shuhou: SOMEBODY JUST
JUMPED OVERBOARD.

349
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,791
- HEY, RYOMOU.
- SHUYUU, STAY ON GUARD.

350
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,875
- HUH?

351
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,250
- WE'VE BEEN TRICKED.
THIS IS A TRAP.

352
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,250
- TRY NOT TO FREAK OUT,
KYOCHO.

353
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,666
( squeals, sighs )

354
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,583
- YOU MAY WANT TO
WATCH YOUR STEP. 

355
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,583
- Kan'u: THE MALEVOLENCE...

356
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,958
IS GETTING CLOSER.

357
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,375
- ( grunts )

358
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,750
YOU...

359
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,708
WHICH SCHOOL 
ARE YOU WITH?

360
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,708
( screams )

361
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,875
- I WONDER IF KAN'U AND ALL
THE OTHERS ARE DOING OKAY.

362
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,208
EVEN THOUGH ALL THREE OF US

363
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,541
MADE THE OATH OF THE
PEACH GARDEN ON THAT DAY,

364
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,416
IT SEEMS LIKE I'M
THE ONE LEFT BEHIND

365
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,708
WHEN THEY GO OFF AND FIGHT.

366
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,458
- ( door opens )
- HUH?

367
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,875
- MAY I HAVE THE NOBLE HONOR
OF JOINING YOU IN THE BATH? 

368
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,166
- Ryuubi: SHIRYU?

369
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,958
YOU BROUGHT YOUR SWORD?

370
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,458
EVEN IN THE BATH?

371
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,916
( sighs )

372
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,458
- EXCUSE ME.

373
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,916
( sighs )

374
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,541
I FEEL ALIVE.

375
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,125
- UH, HEY...

376
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,916
UM, SHIRYU?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THOSE TWO.

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,375
I PROMISE YOU THAT
THEY WILL BE JUST FINE.

378
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,500
- YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE TOURNAMENT?

379
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,916
WASN'T KOUMEI SAYING THAT
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TOURNAMENT

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,083
SEEMED REALLY SUSPICIOUS?

381
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,916
- Shiryu:
ALL THE MORE REASON.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,916
IF THERE ARE SPARKS SHOWERING
SEITO BEHIND THIS TOURNAMENT,

383
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,500
THEN WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN
TO CALMLY BRUSH THEM AWAY.

384
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,833
AND IT'S NOT
JUST THOSE TWO,

385
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,041
BUT EVERY ONE OF YOUR
RETAINERS FEEL THIS WAY.

386
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,583
- ( sighs )

387
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,833
BECAUSE OF THAT...

388
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,750
IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME

389
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,916
THAT PEOPLE DO NOTHING BUT GET
THEMSELVES HURT ON MY BEHALF.

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
IT MAKES ME
SO VERY VERY SAD.

391
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,666
I CAN'T STAND IT.
( crying )

392
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,125
- A LEADER SHOULD NOT
BE PAINED BY SUCH THINGS.

393
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,916
THAT THEIR SUBORDINATES' BLOOD
IS SPILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

394
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,375
- HUH?
- KAN'U AND CHOUHI,

395
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,125
AND EVERY WARRIOR OF SEITO,

396
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,291
IF IT'S SOMETHING
THEY RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF

397
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,791
FIGHTING FOR THE ONE
THEY BELIEVE IN...

398
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,000
THEN IT IS A BEAUTIFUL
AND BLISSFUL WOUND.

399
00:18:56,083 --> 00:19:00,125
- BEAUTIFUL? BLISSFUL?
- ( water splashes )

400
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,708
- WHAT IS IT SHIRYU?

401
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,791
- A LARGE RAT.

402
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,416
OR RATHER,
A VICIOUS TIGER.

403
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,750
- ( gasps )

404
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,708
- ARE YOU ATTACKING
KNOWING FULL WELL

405
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,875
THAT THIS IS THE HOME
OF OUR HONORABLE LEADER?

406
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,583
SEITO ACADEMY'S
SECOND YEAR STUDENT,

407
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,291
SHIRYU CHOU'UN
WILL TAKE YOU ON.

408
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,583
- NANBAN HIGH SCHOOL
SECOND YEAR STUDENT MOUYUU.

409
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:37,041
MY ONLY PURPOSE HERE IS TO TAKE
THE HEAD OF GENTOKU RYUUBI.

410
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,083
( shouts )

411
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,333
( grunts )

412
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,208
( grunts )

413
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,416
- Kouchuu:
I'LL BE YOUR OPPONENT AS WELL.

414
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,833
KANCHOU KOUCHUU
IS HERE TO FIGHT.

415
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:01,791
- ( exhales )

416
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,208
- SHIRYU CHOU'UN,

417
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,041
THIS MATCH WILL BE
CONCLUDED AT A LATER DATE.

418
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,375
- HOLD IT!

419
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,791
- Ryuubi: SHIRYU.

420
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,291
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
LEADER?

421
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,833
- ( gasps )
YOUR ARM.

422
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,916
- I SUPPOSE I'VE ADDED TO MY
BEAUTIFUL AND BLISSFUL WOUNDS.

423
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,041
- ( sighs )

424
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,041
( crying )

425
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,791
SHIRYU...

426
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,875
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GOING TO FIND

427
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,666
ONCE THIS BLANKET
OF FOG IS FINALLY CLEAR?

428
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,833
- HEY, ARE WE GONNA BE OKAY?

429
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,458
- I DON'T KNOW. BUT STOP
BEING SUCH A DAMN COWARD.

430
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,333
- LOOKS LIKE YOU DREW
THE SHORT STRAW

431
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,833
TAKING THE PLACE
OF SONSAKU.

432
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,291
- NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN
THIS EXCITED IN AWHILE.

433
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,916
- IT CAN'T BE.
I REALLY HOPE THIS DIDN'T TURN

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,583
FROM A BIG FIGHTERS
TOURNAMENT

435
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,083
INTO SOME HAUNTED
GHOST TOURNAMENT.

436
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,666
- ( Shoujin sneezes )
- ( screams )

437
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,333
( groans )
JEEZ.

438
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,583
- ( sniffles )
IT'S GOTTEN UNUSUALLY COOL, HUH?

439
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,500
- SHH.  STAY ALERT.
THEY'RE COMING.

440
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,333
- ( grunts )

441
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,875
- ( men gasp )

442
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,291
- LOOK AT THAT SPEAR.

443
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,750
IT CAN'T BE!

444
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,708
- ( men gasp )

445
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,833
( gasping )

446
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,541
- ( laughing )

447
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,791
- ( theme music playing )

448
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

449
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,708
- Shiryu:
LEADER, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

450
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,041
- Ryuubi: SHIRYU,
OF COURSE I AM. YOU SAVED ME.

451
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,125
- Shiryu: SINCE KAN'U
ISN'T AROUND TO RISK HER LIFE,

452
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,625
I WILL RISK MY LIFE
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

453
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,625
WHILE I HAVEN'T MADE
THE OATH OF THE PEACH GARDEN,

454
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,958
I HAVE DECIDED IN MY HEART

455
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,375
THAT I WILL FOLLOW YOU
TO THE GRAVE.

456
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,125
- Ryuubi: NO WAY.
IN THAT CASE,

457
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,666
WHY DON'T WE
JUST MAKE AN OATH RIGHT NOW.

458
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,458
I'LL CALL IT
"THE OATH OF THE BATH."

459
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,833
NEXT TIME ON
"IKKI TOUSEN XTREME XECUTOR,"

460
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,458
"BONDS OF A SOUL."

461
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,666
IT'S A PROMISE.

462
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,708
- Shiryu: LEADER.
