1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:22,166
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,083
- HEY, BACHOU?

4
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,916
- WHAT IS IT, KANSUI?

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,916
- LISTEN UP, SIS.
FROM NOW ON,

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,541
REMEMBER TO COUNT
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

7
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,666
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE UP AGAINST

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,083
BEFORE YOU PICK A FIGHT?

9
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,000
- SORRY, BRO.
I HATE MATH.

10
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,125
- QUIT ACTING SO DUMB.

11
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,458
IF I HADN'T BEEN HERE,
THINGS WOULD'VE BEEN BAD.

12
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,208
REAL BAD.
- ( chuckles )

13
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,958
BUT BRO, YOU'RE ALWAYS HERE.

14
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,500
- ( groans )

15
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,125
IF YOU WANT TO
BECOME STRONGER,

16
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,958
FIGHT STRONGER
INDIVIDUAL FIGHTERS,

17
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,416
NOT HUGE HORDES OF THUGS.

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,125
- BUT I THOUGHT
ALL THE STRENGTH I NEEDED

19
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,458
CAME FROM MY SACRED BEAD?

20
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,125
- NOT ALL OF IT.

21
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,958
SOME POWER COMES FROM
THE SOUL YOU INHERITED,

22
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,208
BUT TRUE STRENGTH 
REQUIRES TRAINING.

23
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,958
- THEN LIKE I SAID,

24
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,000
IF I GET INTO TROUBLE,
I ALWAYS HAVE YOU.

25
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,125
- I'M NOT GONNA 
BE HERE FOREVER.

26
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,416
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE
ON YOUR OWN.

27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,541
- WHAT?  YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

28
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,875
- ( chuckles )
THAT'S MY LITTLE SIS.

29
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,125
WHAT A BABY.

30
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,625
SHE STILL NEEDS ME
TO BE THERE

31
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,083
TO HOLD HER HAND.

32
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,458
SO HERE I AM.
- JEEZ.

33
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,000
I'M NOT HELPLESS.

34
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,083
IT'S NOT AS IF
I'M STILL IN DIAPERS.

35
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,083
- ( chuckles )
- ( groans )

36
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,375
- ( gasps )

37
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,166
- WHAT'S WRONG, BRO?

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,708
YOU OKAY?

39
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,166
( gasps )
- BACHOU...

40
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,791
- KANSUI, HANG ON.

41
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,041
( gasps )

42
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,000
( gasps )

43
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,541
( screams )

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,958
( sighs )

45
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,041
KANSUI...

46
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,583
- ( knocks on door )
- ( gasps )

47
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,708
( yelps )
- Ryuubi: GOOD MORNING.

48
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,625
- UH, I'M UP.
JUST A SEC.

49
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,666
- YOUR CLOTHES ARE
BACK FROM THE LAUNDRY.

50
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,166
- UHH...

51
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,750
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE A FEVER?

52
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,625
YOU WERE SOAKED.
POOR THING.

53
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,875
YOU LOOKED SO BEAT UP.
- ( sighs )

54
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,208
- Ryuubi: IT REALLY 
DID A NUMBER ON YOU.

55
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,458
LISTEN TO THE WEATHER MAN,
FROM NOW ON

56
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,291
DON'T GO OUT IN STORMS.
IT'S DANGEROUS.

57
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,958
- OKAY.

58
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,791
- Ekitoku: SO THIS IS
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN HIDING?

59
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,250
- Ryuubi:
OH, HI, EKITOKU.

60
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,250
- HEY LOOK,
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE

61
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,666
SPEAKING IN FRONT
OF BIG CROWDS,

62
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,083
BUT YOU PROMISED.

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,041
NOW KAN'U'S PISSED.
- UHH... OH.

64
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,958
- HMM?

65
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,416
- ( gasps )

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,083
- COME ON.
WE'RE GOING.

67
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:22,375
- WAIT, EKITOKU.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

68
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,833
- AS YOU KNOW,
THERE HAS BEEN A CEASEFIRE

69
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,416
IN EFFECT BETWEEN
KYOSHO AND NANYO ACADEMIES

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,833
EVER SINCE THE BATTLE
OF RED CLIFFS.

71
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,500
BUT YESTERDAY
I RECEIVED A REPORT

72
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,250
THAT KYOSHO ACADEMY
WAS ATTACKED.

73
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,125
THE SCHOOL RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS ATTACK

74
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:35,875
REMAINS UNKNOWN.

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,666
UNTIL WE KNOW THE FACTS,

76
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,458
WE MUST BE ON HIGH ALERT.

77
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,333
BEFORE WE CONCLUDE,
OUR LEADER WILL ADDRESS YOU.

78
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,208
- ( girls gasp )
- LEADER, IF YOU PLEASE.

79
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,083
- UH--
- YOU CAN DO IT, LEADER.

80
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,708
COME ON, GO GET THEM.

81
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,125
- Ryuubi: OKAY.

82
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,500
- THAT WIMPY GIRL
IS A LEADER?

83
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,541
- UM... GOOD MORNING.

84
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,291
I'D LIKE TO THANK
EVERYONE FOR--

85
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,541
OW! OH, OW.

86
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,958
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

87
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,375
- ( laughing )

88
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,708
- ( chuckles nervously )
JUST A BIT LOWER.

89
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,083
UM, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY...

90
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,958
TO SAY...

91
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,541
- FELLOW STUDENTS
OF SEITO ACADEMY...

92
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,208
- "FELLOW STUDENTS
OF SEITO ACADEMY,"

93
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,208
UH...

94
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,708
- OUR GREAT ANCESTOR
ONCE SAID...

95
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,708
- "OUR GREAT ANCESTOR
ONCE SAID..."

96
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,291
- LISTEN TO ALL
POINTS OF VIEW,

97
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,125
REJECT WHAT IS DOUBTFUL,

98
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,291
SPEAK CAUTIOUSLY
ABOUT THE REST, 

99
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,166
AND YOUR MISTAKES WILL BE
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.

100
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,333
- UH... "LISTEN TO
ALL POINTS...

101
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,166
REJECT DOUBT."
- BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE REST.

102
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,208
- "BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT BREASTS."

103
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,500
- PERFECT.
- NO WAY.

104
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,541
SHE'S A TOTAL DUNDERHEAD.

105
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,458
- WOW, YOU'RE POPULAR,
KAN'U.

106
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,333
ANOTHER GREAT HAUL.

107
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,500
- PLEASE SAY YOU'LL SHARE
SOME OF YOUR DELICIOUS TREATS.

108
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,125
- FIRST I WANT ANSWERS.

109
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,166
YOU PROMISED WE WOULD
HAVE A MEETING THIS MORNING

110
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,541
SO YOU COULD GO OVER
YOUR SPEECH.

111
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,166
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO REHEARSE.

112
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,750
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO MISS IT,

113
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,583
BUT I WAS DOING 
SOME OTHER STUFF

114
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,333
AND I FORGOT.

115
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,250
- THERE'S NO EXCUSE.
YOU'RE THE LEADER.

116
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,250
- Bachou: HOLY CRAP!

117
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,666
THIS GUMMY CANDY
ONLY JUST WENT ON SALE.

118
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,125
AND THIS ONE'S THAT 
PLUM FLAVORED GUMMY.

119
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,958
IT'S ONLY BEEN OUT
A FEW DAYS.

120
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,208
THESE ARE SOLD OUT
EVERYWHERE.

121
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,250
- WHO IS THAT?

122
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,791
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
FIND THEM HERE. 

123
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,166
I SEE.

124
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,791
SO YOU WENT OUT,

125
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,791
YOU GOT CAUGHT IN
THE STORM UNPREPARED,

126
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,208
GENTOKU FOUND YOU
AND BROUGHT YOU BACK HERE.

127
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- SHE WAS SOAKED TO THE BONE.

128
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,791
WE CAME BACK.
BOTH OF US NEEDED A BATH,

129
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,708
THEN I PUT HER TO BED.
- I DON'T APPROVE OF YOU

130
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,916
PICKING UP STRANGE GIRLS

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,541
AND BRINGING THEM BACK
TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

132
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,708
- HUH?

133
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,041
- THE TWO OF YOU,

134
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,541
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T...

135
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,958
DO IT TOGETHER.

136
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,583
- Ryuubi:
DO WHAT TOGETHER?

137
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,458
- TAKE A BATH.

138
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,208
- OF COURSE WE DIDN'T.

139
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,791
I JUST LEANT HER
MY PANTIES.

140
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,416
- YOUR PANTIES?
- I HAD TO.

141
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
HER CLOTHES WERE ALL
WET AND DIRTY.

142
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,916
I PUT THEM IN THE WASH.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,083
- Kan'u: YOU CAN'T JUST LET
RANDOM PEOPLE WEAR YOUR PANTIES.

144
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,833
- Ekitoku:
HEY, CAUGHT IN THE RAIN GIRL.

145
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:00,916
- HMM?
- YOUR NAME?

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,750
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US.

147
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,250
- MOUKI BACHOU.

148
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,083
I'M A FIRST YEAR STUDENT
AT RYOUSHUU HIGH.

149
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,041
- MOUKI!
- BACHOU!

150
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,250
- Kan'u: IN THE TIME
OF THE THREE KINGDOMS,

151
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,583
MOUKI BACHOU WAS
A COMMANDER OF GREAT SKILL.

152
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,833
BUT HE WAS ALSO
KNOWN FOR HIS BRUTALITY.

153
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,916
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIVE
TIGER GENERALS

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,583
AND DUBBED BY GENTOKU RYUUBI

155
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,416
"BACHOU THE SPLENDID."

156
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,416
A FIGHTER BEARING
BACHOU'S DESTINY 

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,666
HAS FINALLY APPEARED.

158
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,083
- HUH.

159
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,833
- IF SHE REALLY IS
WHO YOU SAY,

160
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,583
THEN MAYBE I WAS
SUPPOSED TO FIND HER.

161
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,041
- Both: HUH?!
- JUST A MINUTE.

162
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,875
WERE YOU THE ONE WHO ATTACKED
KYOSHO ACADEMY YESTERDAY?

163
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,541
- UH-HUH.  I AM.

164
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,208
- DON'T JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS COVER INDEED.

165
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,291
OKAY.  WHO DID YOU
GO THERE TO FIGHT WITH

166
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,875
ALL BY YOURSELF?

167
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,458
- SOUSOU.
- ( all gasp )

168
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,291
- YOU ATTACKED KYOSHO

169
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,625
AND THEN YOU PICKED A FIGHT
WITH ITS LEADER?

170
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,458
- Bachou: I DID.
- DID YOU ACTUALLY

171
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,375
TAKE ON SOUSOU
IN COMBAT?

172
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,458
- NO, I DIDN'T.
HE WASN'T AT THE SCHOOL

173
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,833
WHEN I WENT THERE.
- ( all sigh )

174
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,416
- DO YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH?

175
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,125
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU
PICK A FIGHT WITH SOUSOU?

176
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,625
- THE REASON IS...

177
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,875
- SPIT IT OUT.

178
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,916
- EKITOKU, THAT'S ENOUGH.
DON'T BADGER HER.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,666
- BUT I WANT TO KNOW.
- LEAVE HER ALONE.

180
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,166
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY.

181
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,500
EVERYONE HAS THINGS THEY
LIKE TO KEEP PRIVATE.

182
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,333
- I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

183
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,333
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

184
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,166
SO KAN'U KNOWS ABOUT
HOW YOU SNEAK OFF CAMPUS

185
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,500
SOME NIGHTS AND GO INTO
TOWN TO EAT BURGERS?

186
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,750
- NO I DON'T!
- Kan'u: EKITOKU,

187
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,666
HAVE YOU BEEN
CHEATING ON YOUR DIET?

188
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,208
- SOMETIMES I SLIP.
BUT NOT MUCH.

189
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,958
- Kan'u: SO THIS IS WHY
YOU'VE BEEN SO SLOW

190
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,333
AND WEAK LATELY
DURING PRACTICE.

191
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,875
YOU DISAPPOINT ME,
EKITOKU.

192
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,916
- AWW, KAN'U.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,083
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE 
BEING A BIT HARD ON ME?

194
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,666
- CALM DOWN NOW.
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

195
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,666
- SHUT YOUR FACE!
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT

196
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,583
FOR BLABBING ABOUT
MY FAST FOOD RUNS!

197
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,958
YOU AND YOUR BIG MOUTH,
HOW COULD YOU?

198
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,708
- I WAS ONLY
TELLING THE TRUTH!

199
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,625
- Ekitoku: YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO TELL ALL OF IT!

200
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,958
- Kan'u:
STOP THAT, EKITOKU.

201
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,166
GET YOUR FINGERS 
OUT OF HER MOUTH.

202
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,583
GENTOKU IS OUR LEADER.

203
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,250
- Ekitoku:
YOU SURE IT'S NOT BECAUSE

204
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,708
YOU'D RATHER HAVE
YOUR OWN FINGERS IN HER MOUTH?

205
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,208
- Kan'u: SHUT UP, EKITOKU.

206
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,791
WAS IT REALLY NECESSARY
TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

207
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,583
- ( gasps )

208
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,541
OH, SORRY.
I SPACED OUT.

209
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,458
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
SOMETHING FROM A LONG TIME AGO.

210
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,208
- ( sighs )
MAYBE...

211
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,375
- RIGHT, I'VE DECIDED.

212
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,041
MISS RYUUBI, I MEAN MISS
RYUUBI, OH MY GREAT LEADER.

213
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,583
- YOU MEAN ME?

214
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,000
- PLEASE ALLOW ME TO
STAY HERE WITH YOU. 

215
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,333
- ( all gasp )
- I COULD LEARN SO MUCH

216
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,333
FROM MISS KAN'U
AND MISS CHOUHI'S STRENGTH.

217
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,541
AND FROM MISS RYUUBI'S
WISDOM AND KINDNESS AS WELL.

218
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,583
I WISH TO LEARN 
FROM ALL OF YOU.

219
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,500
YOU'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE
I CAN SERVE WITH ALL MY HEART.

220
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,625
- WOW, THIS IS
ALL SO SUDDEN.

221
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT TO SAY.

222
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,166
( gasps )
- I CAN BE YOUR TIGER GENERAL

223
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,750
LIKE I WAS IN THE PAST.

224
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,583
KAN'U, CHOUHI,

225
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,000
LET'S ALL THREE US OF WORK
TOGETHER TO PROTECT AND SERVE

226
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,583
MISS GENTOKU.

227
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,916
- HOLD ON!

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,208
WHO THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?!

229
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,166
PROVE IT.  SHOW US.

230
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,000
IF YOU'RE SO CERTAIN
YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES.

231
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,208
- HMPH!

232
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,500
( shouts )

233
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,333
HMPH.

234
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,291
- YOUR ATTACK'S
NOT HALF BAD.

235
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,041
LET'S SEE HOW AGILE YOU ARE.

236
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,750
GO FETCH!

237
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,541
- ( giggles )

238
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,916
( grunts )

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,833
- WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY.

240
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,583
- ( grunts )

241
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,291
( chuckles )

242
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,083
- BE CAREFUL UP THERE,
OKAY?

243
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,416
- ( gasps, whimpers )

244
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,708
( screams )

245
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,583
- WHAT'S WRONG?

246
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,416
- A SNAKE!
DON'T BIT ME.

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,833
( screams )

248
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,833
- YOU'VE GOT TO
BE KIDDING ME. 

249
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,250
( laughing )
THIS IS HYSTERICAL.

250
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,583
ONE OF THE FAMOUS FIVE
TIGER GENERALS

251
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,208
IS TERRIFIED OF
A LITTLE SNAKE?

252
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,083
LOOKS LIKE THIS TIGER
IS REALLY JUST A FRAIDY CAT.

253
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,916
- KAN'U?

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,083
- ( sighs )

255
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,583
- ( gasps, screams )

256
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,958
( panting )

257
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,916
- KAN'U JUST SAVED
YOUR SORRY BUTT.

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,083
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
BE THANKING HER?

259
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,666
- ( grunts )
- WHAT'S THAT?

260
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,458
YOU CALL THAT GRATITUDE?

261
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,708
- ( gasps )

262
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,583
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING,

263
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,958
THE POWER OF
THE SACRED BEADS

264
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,541
MUST HAVE BROUGHT YOU AND
I TOGETHER FOR A REASON.

265
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,541
I'M SURE THAT MEANS
THERE WILL COME A TIME

266
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,958
WHEN THE TWO OF US
WILL NEED ONE ANOTHER.

267
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,000
- ( gasps )

268
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,458
- JUST LIKE THE EVENTS

269
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,375
THAT LED TO EKITOKU,
KAN'U, AND I

270
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,833
MAKING OUR OATH
UNDER THE PEACH TREES.

271
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,500
- Ekitoku: HELLO?  YEAH.
I JUST GOT HERE.

272
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,791
SO, HOW'S IT BEEN
GOING OVER THERE?

273
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,375
REALLY?  THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

274
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,916
I'M ITCHING TO JUMP IN 
AND GET MY HANDS DIRTY.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,250
WHAT'S THAT?  NO PROB.
TALK TO YOU LATER.

276
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,000
I CAN DO IT.
I CAN DO IT.

277
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,708
I CAN...

278
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,583
( straining )

279
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,666
...NOT DO IT.

280
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,958
( sighs )
- NEED HELP?

281
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,750
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

282
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,708
THOSE BAGS WEIGHED A TON.
- ( sighs )

283
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,583
THEY SAY NO ROAD IS LONG
WITH GOOD COMPANY,

284
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,000
BUT THEY NEVER HAD TO
CARRY ALL THESE BAGS.

285
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,291
WHAT'S IN THEM ANYWAY?

286
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,416
WE ONLY NEEDED TO
BRING THE ESSENTIALS.

287
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,833
- THEY ARE MY ESSENTIALS.

288
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,666
I DON'T GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT THEM.

289
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,333
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE PRACTICALLY
EXTENSIONS OF MY BODY.

290
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,541
LOSING THEM WOULD BE
LIKE LOSING AN ARM. 

291
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,583
- IF THEY'RE SO PRECIOUS
TO YOU, FOUR-EYES,

292
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,416
WHY DON'T YOU
CARRY THEM YOURSELF?!

293
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,166
- Ryuubi: I'M SORRY.

294
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,916
- ( chuckles )

295
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,833
- THIS IS A NICE PLACE,
ISN'T IT?

296
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,541
THE COUNTRYSIDE
IS LOVELY,

297
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,458
AND THE COOL AIR
SMELLS SWEET.

298
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,875
- YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HOW ROUGH
THIS SCHOOL IS, RIGHT?

299
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,291
SEITO ACADEMY HAS
A NASTY REPUTATION.

300
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,791
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
MY BEST FRIEND KAN'U

301
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,208
IS THERE ALREADY.
SHE CLEANED HOUSE

302
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,625
AND TOOK OUT THE TRASH.

303
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,541
- OH? KAN'U SOUNDS
LIKE A NEAT FREAK.

304
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,208
SHE REALLY MUST
LIKE THINGS CLEAN.

305
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,125
- WHAT?  YOU'RE JOKING,
FOUR-EYES.

306
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,791
I MEANT TRASH LIKE
RIFFRAFF AND SCUM.

307
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,000
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING
RIFFRAFF AND SCUM?

308
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,791
CHANGE OF PLANS, LADIES.
SORRY TO BREAK UP YOUR PARTY,

309
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,083
BUT NEW STUDENTS MUST PASS
ENTRANCE EXAMS.

310
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,833
- OH, YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

311
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,833
WE TOOK THOSE TESTS
A LONG TIME AGO.

312
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,291
- YOU IDIOT.  THAT'S NOT 
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

313
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,250
THIS CHICK LOOKS DANGEROUS.
I'M SURE SHE'S BAD NEWS.

314
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,333
YOU WANT TO TEST ME, BITCH?
BRING IT ON.

315
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,416
ANYTHING YOU CAN DISH OUT
I CAN HANDLE.

316
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,333
- YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF SPIRIT, GIRL.

317
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,166
BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND
DEFYING US

318
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
UNLESS YOU PREFER
DYING YOUNG.

319
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,916
- JUST TRY IT!

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,833
HEY, FOUR-EYES.
STICK CLOSE.

321
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,000
GET BEHIND ME
AND I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.

322
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,833
WHAT THE--?
THEY GOT YOU ALREADY?

323
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,291
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

324
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,000
- ( grunts )

325
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,458
- ( screams, grunts )

326
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,083
- LET'S STRING HER UP IN
THE TREES FOR A NIGHT

327
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,916
SO SHE LEARNS WHO'S
BOSS AROUND HERE.

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
- OKAY.
- STOP. DON'T DO IT.

329
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,000
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR VIOLENCE.

330
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,541
- SO MAYBE YOU WANT TO
TAKE HER PLACE THEN?

331
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,125
( chuckles )

332
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,458
- ( yelps )

333
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,833
( gasps )

334
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,375
- JUST A BUNCH OF BOOKS.

335
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,791
- THEY'RE GOOD KINDLING.

336
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,958
WE COULD MAKE
A BIG BONFIRE

337
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,958
AND BURN THEM.
- GOOD IDEA.

338
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,458
- PLEASE, DON'T DO THAT.

339
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,041
- THOSE BOOKS MEAN 
A LOT TO YOU, NERD?

340
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,916
I BET THEY'RE THE ONLY
FRIENDS YOU HAVE.

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,625
- ( crying )
- SEE, BOOKS CAN'T HELP YOU.

342
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,541
THEY'RE JUST PAPER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER

343
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,208
HOW MANY OF THEM
YOU'VE READ,

344
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,041
'CAUSE YOU'RE STILL
SHAKING IN YOUR SHOES.

345
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,416
BOOKS ARE TOTALLY USELESS.

346
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,000
- REAL POWER DOESN'T COME
FROM WORDS ON A PAGE.

347
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,541
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
BEING AFRAID OF YOU.

348
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,833
- ( gasps )

349
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,291
- THOSE THINGS--
THE POSSESSIONS SHE LOVED MOST.

350
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,333
THEY WERE JUST
DUSTY OLD BOOKS?

351
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,291
( gasps )

352
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,000
- Ryuubi: YOU'RE WRONG.
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

353
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,083
BOOKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

354
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,166
BY READING BOOKS,
YOU CAN EXPAND YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

355
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,500
YOU WON'T NEED
FEAR TO RULE. 

356
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,750
PEOPLE WILL LISTEN
BECAUSE YOU CAN HELP THEM.

357
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,166
THEY'LL RESPECT YOU.

358
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,916
CONTROL THROUGH VIOLENCE
LEADS TO NOTHING.

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,083
FEAR IS NOT POWER.
- ( gasps )

360
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,333
- IT CAN'T BE.
THAT STUPID FOUR-EYES.

361
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,958
SHE IS...

362
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,083
GENTOKU RYUUBI?

363
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,750
- ( gasping )

364
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,041
- IT'S HER.

365
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,166
- THERE YOU ARE.

366
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,750
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

367
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,916
I CAUGHT THE REST OF
THE SCUM THAT RAN AWAY.

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,166
I FINALLY FOUND YOU AS WELL,
GENTOKU.

369
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,791
- WHO ARE YOU?

370
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,291
IS THAT YOU, KAN'U?

371
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,541
- ( screams )

372
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,625
-  ( groaning )
- AW, DAMN IT. 

373
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,458
- THANK YOU FOR SAVING US.

374
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,041
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO THANK ME.

375
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,708
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

376
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,583
WE WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER
BY THE DESTINIES

377
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,958
OF OUR SACRED BEADS.

378
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,708
- I WISH YOU COULD HAVE
HEARD HER, KAN'U.

379
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,958
FOUR-EYES-- I MEAN GENTOKU,

380
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,750
GAVE THE MOST INCREDIBLE SPEECH
JUST BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP.

381
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,416
- WE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
BORN ON THE SAME DAY...

382
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,083
- BUT WE BOND AS SISTERS...

383
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,541
- AND SOLEMNLY VOW
THAT WE WILL DIE TOGETHER.

384
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,750
Ekitoku:
AND THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.

385
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,416
FATE BOUND US,
AND WE MADE OUR VOW.

386
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,833
IMPRESSIVE, RIGHT?

387
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,750
- WHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY.

388
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,250
I WISH THAT COULD
HAPPEN TO ME.

389
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,000
- I MEAN IT'S SO TRUE.

390
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,583
WE THREE ARE BEST FRIENDS.
BEST OF ALL TIME.

391
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,416
- BEST FRIENDS OF ALL TIME?

392
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,041
I THINK THAT'S
AN EXAGGERATION.

393
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,458
- AND TO THINK,

394
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,500
IT ALL HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOU,
MISS CHOUHI.

395
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
YOU'RE THE GLUE.
IT'S YOU WHO'S HOLDING

396
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,083
THE FRIENDSHIP TOGETHER.

397
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,166
YOUR STRENGTH MAKES ME REALIZE
I STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.

398
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,250
- ( chuckles )
YOU'RE YOUNG, 

399
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,250
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
SOME THINGS ALREADY.

400
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,458
THAT SETTLES IT.

401
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,000
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY
HERE WITH US FOR AWHILE.

402
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,458
AND I WILL PERSONALLY 
OVERSEE YOUR TRAINING.

403
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,875
- I CAN REALLY STAY?!
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

404
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,333
- Ryuubi: UH, EKITOKU?
SHOULDN'T WE DISCUSS THIS?

405
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,208
- Kan'u: THE TIGER GENERAL
BACHOU HAS APPEARED.

406
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,291
- ( laughing )
- Kan'u: IS THIS A SIGN

407
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,958
THAT A NEW BATTLE
IS IMMINENT?

408
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,458
GENTOKU'S DRAGON MUST
NEVER AWAKEN AGAIN.

409
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,666
I HAVE TO PREVENT IT.

410
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,958
- ( sighs )
- HUH?

411
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,708
KOUMEI, WAKE UP.

412
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,458
YOU'RE SLEEPING IN 
THE LIBRARY AGAIN.

413
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,375
- GENTOKU,

414
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,041
LET'S TAKE A BATH TOGETHER.

415
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,208
- Ryuubi: WHERE DID THIS
SUDDENLY COME FROM?

416
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,291
- LET'S BATHE.
- THE SUN IS STILL UP.

417
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,041
IT'S TOO EARLY.
- LET'S BATHE.

418
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,500
- HMM.

419
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,250
BUT KOUMEI, YOU FOOL
AROUND SO MUCH

420
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
EVERY TIME WE TAKE A BATH.

421
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,125
YOU TICKLE ME AND I LAUGH,

422
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,958
AND THEN I CAN'T
WASH YOU PROPERLY.

423
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,750
- I WILL WASH YOU.
LET'S TAKE A BATH.

424
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,333
LET'S TAKE A BATH.
- HMM.

425
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,750
- ( giggles )

426
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,708
- UNTIE ME!

427
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,833
HURRY UP AND UNTIE ME
RIGHT NOW.

428
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,250
- JUST GREAT.

429
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,583
THAT SNEAKY LITTLE BRAT
ABDUCTED OUR LEADER.

430
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

431
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,250
- I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT GENTOKU.

432
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,750
I'M GOING AFTER
BOTH OF THEM.

433
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,250
- Koumei: UNTIE ME. 
I'M YOUR STRATEGIST.

434
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,500
- EKITOKU, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

435
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,125
- UH, DO SOMETHING
ABOUT WHAT, KAN'U? 

436
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,416
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT 
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING.

437
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,541
I BET KAN'U AND THE OTHERS
ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT ME.

438
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,291
( gasps )
- HEY.

439
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,541
IS IT TO TERRIBLE
TO HANG OUT WITH ME?

440
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,125
- UM, NO.  I'M FINE.

441
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,500
I MEAN, WE'RE HAVING FUN.
I LIKE YOU.

442
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,791
- Bachou:
GREAT.

443
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,125
THEN LET'S SPEND THE REST
OF THE DAY TOGETHER.

444
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,416
WE'LL GO ALL OUT.

445
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,708
- HEY. LOOK OVER THERE.

446
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,541
- IT'S GENTOKU RYUUBI,
LEADER OF SEITO ACADEMY.

447
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,125
I DON'T SEE HER GUARDS 
CHOUHI AND KAN'U AROUND.

448
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,916
- WHAT A LUCKY BREAK.
LET'S GET EVERYONE DOWN HERE.

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,166
- SAY, MISS BACHOU?
- MY EARS HURT.

450
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,458
I WON'T LISTEN TO YOU IF
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO FORMAL.

451
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,125
YOU HAVE TO CALL ME
SOMETHING ELSE.

452
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,708
- WHAT IF I CALLED YOU MOUKI?

453
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,291
- MM-MM.

454
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,375
- BACHOU?
- MM-MM. 

455
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,875
- WELL THEN...

456
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,208
THE FIRST KANJI IN YOUR NAME

457
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,791
SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE HORSE,
SO...

458
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,000
MA-CHAN?
- ( gasps )

459
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,541
MM-HMM!

460
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,875
I KNOW A SHORTCUT!
COME ON!  IT'S THIS WAY.

461
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,375
- WAIT A SECOND, MA-CHAN.

462
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,291
I DON'T KNOW.

463
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,500
THIS ALLEY SEEMS
KIND OF DANGEROUS.

464
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,166
- FEAR NOT.  MA-CHAN IS HERE
TO PROTECT HER LEADER.

465
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,500
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE SO CARELESS.

466
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,583
FIRST YOU WAGE A WAR
THAT LEFT HALF THE FIGHTERS

467
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,250
WITHOUT SCHOOLS TO
GO BACK TO,

468
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,958
AND NOW YOU'VE GONE AND
WANDERED INTO A TRAP.

469
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,875
- WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

470
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,291
- WE'RE RONIN FIGHTERS.
WE HAVE NO SCHOOL.

471
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,000
WE DO NOT SERVE A LEADER.

472
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,750
BUT IF WE CAPTURE RYUUBI 
AND PRESENT HER AS A GIFT

473
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,416
TO ONE OF HER ENEMIES,

474
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,833
WE MIGHT JUST GET REWARDED
WITH A SCHOOL OF OUR OWN. 

475
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,666
- HMPH.
- MA-CHAN, BE CAREFUL.

476
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,083
- YOU WON'T BE GETTING ANYTHING,
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS!

477
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,458
- ( grunts )
YOU KNOW, NOWADAYS

478
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,833
THEY HAVE THIS INVENTION
TO PROTECT OUR JUNK...

479
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,375
CALLED A CUP!

480
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,958
- ( grunts )
- MA-CHAN!

481
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,291
- ( all chuckling )

482
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,375
- Kansui: LISTEN UP, SIS.
FROM NOW ON, REMEMBER TO COUNT

483
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,875
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

484
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,458
UP AGAINST BEFORE
YOU PICK A FIGHT.

485
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,958
- Bachou:
GREAT ADVICE, BRO.

486
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,666
BUT IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE.

487
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,541
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

488
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,125
I WILL DEFEND RYUUBI
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

489
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,500
- Hakufu: HEY, LONG TIME NO SEE,
RYUU-CHAN.

490
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,083
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

491
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,208
- MISS SONSAKU.
- THE SHOU HAOU...

492
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,041
HAKUFU SONSAKU?
THAT'S HER?

493
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,666
- THIS IS BAD.
REALLY BAD.

494
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,500
- I WAS OUT SHOPPING
WITH KOUKIN,

495
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,666
BUT THE TWO OF US
GOT SEPARATED.

496
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,916
HUH?  WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND
WITH THE BANGS

497
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,250
WHO SAYS "MY GREEN
DRAGON BLADE WEEPS"?

498
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,875
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
ALWAYS WITH YOU? 

499
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,583
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO? 
- THERE'S SEVEN OF US

500
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,833
AND ONLY ONE OF HER.
- RIGHT.

501
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,583
WE'RE NOT SCARED!
YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED, NANYO GIRL!

502
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,333
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!
- ( gasps )

503
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,666
- ( shouting )

504
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,000
( men grunting )

505
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,416
- AH, THAT FELT GOOD.

506
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,083
- Bachou: EVERY GUY SHE HIT
FLEW INTO THE AIR

507
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,666
AT LEAST 20 FEET.

508
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,583
SHE'S AMAZING.

509
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,416
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN
SO MUCH CAKE EARLIER.

510
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,208
BUT THE BEST METHOD
FOR LOSING WEIGHT

511
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,875
IS TO GET LOTS OF EXERCISE.
HMM?

512
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
WHO'S THIS?

513
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,333
- OH, THAT'S MA-CHAN.

514
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,208
- MASTER!

515
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,791
PLEASE LET ME BE
YOUR DISCIPLE?

516
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,875
- WHAT?
- HUH?

517
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,291
- ( sighs )

518
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,708
THEY DIDN'T NEED ME AT ALL.
( chuckles )

519
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,708
- ( theme music playing )

520
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

521
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,375
- Kan'u: HONESTLY,
SNEAKING OFF WITH GENTOKU

522
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,000
WHILE MY BACK WAS TURNED.

523
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,875
THIS IS THE WORST THING
SHE POSSIBLY COULD HAVE DONE.

524
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,166
- Ekitoku: I CAN THINK
OF A FEW THINGS

525
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,541
SHE COULD HAVE DONE
WITH GENTOKU

526
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,166
THAT YOU WOULD
HAVE HATED A LOT MORE.

527
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,250
- Kan'u: WHAT?
- Ekitoku: COME ON, KAN'U.

528
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,083
CUT BACHOU SOME SLACK.
- Kan'u: AND NOW SHE'S ASKING

529
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,625
HOW TO GET TO NANYO ACADEMY.

530
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,833
- Ekitoku: REALLY?
AFTER ATTACKING KYOSHO,

531
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,666
SHE'S GOT HER SIGHTS
SET ON NANYO?

532
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,208
WE'VE REALLY GOT A TIGER
BY THE TAIL, DON'T WE?

533
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,000
- Kan'u: NEXT TIME ON
"IKKI TOUSEN XTREME XECUTOR,"

534
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,166
"A TRAINED LION."
