1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,750
- Ryomou:
THAT LIGHT.

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,041
WHY?

5
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,875
DID THE GHOST FROM THE PAST
TAKE OVER EVERYTHING?

6
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,291
IS THERE NOTHING ELSE LEFT?

7
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,125
SO, THAT'S IT?

8
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,000
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
TO FIGHTERS WITH SACRED BEADS.

9
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,958
IS THAT WHAT WE ALL WILL
EVENTUALLY BECOME?

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,125
- Ryofu:
RYOMOU.

11
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,208
- RYOFU?

12
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,041
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

13
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,000
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.

14
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,375
YOU HAVE A LIFE AND A SCHOOL
TO GO HOME TO.

15
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,958
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WAITING FOR YOU.

16
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,625
- BUT YOU'RE--

17
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,291
- YOU KNOW, RYOMOU,

18
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,125
IF WE HAD MET
FOR THE FIRST TIME

19
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,958
A LITTLE EARLIER
THAN WE DID,

20
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,291
AND MAYBE UNDER SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES,

21
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,083
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
MY BEST FRIEND.

22
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,375
THOUGH I DOUBT YOU BELIEVE THAT.

23
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,000
YOU MEANT MORE TO ME
THAN YOU KNEW.

24
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,750
I LOVED YOU, RYOMOU.

25
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,083
I USED TO BOAST
I WOULD CHANGE MY FATE,

26
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,541
NO MATTER WHAT IT COST ME.

27
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:41,958
BUT IN THE END, I WAS AFRAID.

28
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:47,375
I DIDN'T WANT TO DIE, RYOMOU.

29
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,958
- THAT SAME FATE
THAT I CARRIED WITH ME, RYOFU.

30
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:56,916
FOR ALL I KNOW, IT MAY HAVE
BEEN THE VERY SAME AS YOURS.

31
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,208
- ( gasps )

32
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,125
- Ryomou:
KAN'U!

33
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,750
WAIT, THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.

34
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,666
SHIRYUU CHOU'UN?

35
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,083
- DAMN IT ALL.
CURSED SHIRYUU.

36
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,833
- Chou'un KANU, OUR LEADER'S
LIFE IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

37
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,916
WE NEED TO SAVE HER
AT ANY COST.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,916
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU
TO TRY AND LISTEN TO ME.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,833
WHY I NEED TO GET YOU
BACK TO SEITO

40
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,750
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

41
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:46,166
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE IN
NO POSITION TO HEED MY WORDS.

42
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,916
YOUR FIGHTING SPIRIT IS FILLED

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,041
WITH A FRIGHTENING AMOUNT
OF EVIL.

44
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,166
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

45
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,208
KNOW THAT IF YOU TRY
TO STOP ME, YOU WILL REGRET IT.

46
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,458
I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL SHOW NO MERCY.

47
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,541
- WELL THEN, KAN'U, IT SEEMS
THAT TAKING YOU BACK

48
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,916
TO YOUR LEADER WILL TAKE
LONGER THAN I HOPED.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,125
I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO DO THIS
THE HARD WAY.

50
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
- OH, VERY INTERESTING.

51
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,791
I'D BE LYING TO YOU
IF I SAID

52
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,250
I NEVER WANTED AN EXCUSE
TO TAKE YOU ON.

53
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,750
- KAN'U ISN'T EVEN IN CONTROL
OF HER OWN MIND.

54
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,791
THESE TWO ARE THE TOP FIGHTERS
OF SEITO ACADEMY.

55
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,750
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
WHEN THEY CLASH?

56
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,708
- LET'S BEGIN.

57
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,625
- Ekitoku:
TOO BAD, BITCH!

58
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,125
YOU'VE USED UP YOUR DISKS,
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

59
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,625
YOU'VE ALREADY LOST, SO GIVE UP
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

60
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,916
- ( screams )

61
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
- Moukaku: DON'T ACT
LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY WON!

62
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,291
DON'T GO DOWN YET.

63
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,625
I'M NOT THROUGH WITH YOU.

64
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,916
- HA, IF YOU WANT THE PRIVILEGE
OF BEING A FIGHTER

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,291
SAVE YOUR BOASTING UNTIL
AFTER YOU'VE WON, FUCKWIT!

66
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,625
- Ekitoku:
KAN'U, NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

67
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,583
YOU NEVER LET GO
OF YOUR GREEN DRAGON BLADE,

68
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,166
DO YOU?

69
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,458
THE UNCHO KAN'U
OF 1800 YEARS AGO

70
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,083
PROBABLY DID
THE EXACT SAME THING.

71
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,583
- HE VERY WELL MIGHT HAVE.

72
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,958
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

73
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,833
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

74
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,583
EKITOKU CHOUHI HAD A WEAPON
AS WELL, DIDN'T HE?

75
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,500
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
HE DID.

76
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,500
IT WAS A LONG SPEAR
WITH A CRAZY SHARP BLADE

77
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,041
THAT RIPPLED LIKE A SERPENT.

78
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,791
- YOU KNOW, EVEN IF YOU
DON'T HAVE THAT LANCE

79
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,333
RIGHT NOW IN THIS LIFE,

80
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,125
YOUR BODY IS STILL ENDOWED
WITH AN INNATE SENSE

81
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,666
AND ABILITY
TO WIELD THAT WEAPON.

82
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,958
TO WIELD EKITOKU CHOUHI'S
SERPENT SPEAR.

83
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,208
- I'M NOT...

84
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,833
GIVING UP YET!

85
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,125
- YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT!

86
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,291
HANDLE THIS, BITCH!

87
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,791
- Hakufu:
ALRIGHT, SO YOU TWO MAKE...

88
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,500
97 AND 98.

89
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,458
- 99!

90
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,250
- 100!

91
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,958
- AND INCLUDING THIS GUY,

92
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,458
103!

93
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,375
NOW THEN...

94
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,666
THAT JUST ABOUT DOES IT.

95
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,166
WHOA, STILL FIGHTING, ARE WE?

96
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,666
- MASTER, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE ALL FINALLY DONE HERE.

97
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,416
BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT,

98
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,333
SO YOU SHOULD HURRY ON AHEAD
AND GET TO KAN'U.

99
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,708
- Hakufu:
RIGHT, THANK YOU.

100
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,375
TRY TO BE CAREFUL, BACHIN!

101
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,166
- WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING
STANDING THERE?

102
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,208
AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT MASTER?

103
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,458
YOU'RE HER BOYFRIEND
AND ALL,

104
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,958
ACT LIKE IT AND PROTECT HER!

105
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,083
- BOYFRIEND?!

106
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,791
WAIT, HANG ON.

107
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,208
I THINK YOU GOT IT WRONG.

108
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,250
- HURRY UP AND GET GOING,
GOLDFISH POOP.

109
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,416
- I UNDERSTAND, THANKS BACHOU.

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,916
- Soujin: TRY AND GRAB
MY ASS WILL YOU...

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,416
- GOOD GRIEF, WHAT A HANDFUL
THAT BOYFRIEND OF HERS IS.

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,083
- HUH, WERE YOU
SAYING SOMETHING?

113
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,750
- Koukin:
HAKUFU!

114
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,500
- KOUKIN!

115
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,791
- WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?

116
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,208
- THIS CAN'T HAPPEN!

117
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,333
MASTER!

118
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,500
MASTER!

119
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,208
ARE YOU ALRIGHT DOWN THERE?

120
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,083
YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING!

121
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,166
- Ten'i:
FORGET ABOUT HER.

122
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,833
- IT IS THE END
FOR ALL OF YOU.

123
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,875
WHILE I STILL BREATHE,
I WON'T ALLOW ANYONE

124
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,750
TO DEFY MOTHER MARY.

125
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,208
- Soujin:
HEY, YOU!

126
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,666
YOU'RE TEN'I,

127
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,375
ONE OF OUR
MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS, AREN'T YOU?

128
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,875
JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING WAY OUT HERE?

129
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,583
- ONLY THROUGH
THE MERCIFUL GRACE

130
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,333
OF MOTHER MARY
HAVE I BEEN LED HERE.

131
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,958
AND AS SUCH, ONLY ON BEHALF
OF MOTHER MARY DO I FIGHT.

132
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,083
- WHO'S THIS MOTHER MARY
SHE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT?

133
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,125
- DAMN, YOU!

134
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,041
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A DAMN
WHO MOTHER MARY IS

135
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,666
OR EVEN WHO YOU ARE.

136
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,208
BUT SHE'S NOT GOING TO STOP ME

137
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,500
FROM KICKING YOUR ASS!

138
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,041
- THAT FREAKING IDIOT.

139
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,583
JUST HOW RECKLESS
CAN THAT GIRL GET?

140
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,625
- SOUJIN, COME GIVE ME A HAND.

141
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,666
WE HAVE TO TRY
AND PULL HER OUT.

142
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,875
- RIGHT, I'M ON IT!

143
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,958
- Kentei:
I WILL MAKE YOU PAY.

144
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,083
YOU USURPED ME.
SEIZED FROM ME MY IMPERIAL RANK.

145
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,333
AND TOOK THE NAME EMPEROR WEI.

146
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,708
YOU, MOUTOKU SOUSOU.

147
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,958
- Shibai: AND THEN THERE'S
KOUMEI SHOKATSURYO.

148
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,583
THE DESPICABLE ONE WHO STOOD
IN MY WAY NUMEROUS TIMES.

149
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,500
- REGARDLESS OF HOW GREAT
THE PASSAGE OF TIME MAY BE,

150
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,875
- I REFUSE TO ALLOW
YOU TO COMPLETE

151
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,875
YOUR AMBITIONS IN THIS WORLD.

152
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,208
I WILL SEE THAT YOU FAIL.

153
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,583
- ( both )
THE SOULS OF WARRIORS

154
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,583
WHO SERVED GREAT EMPERORS
AND CLANS

155
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,083
WILL RISE AGAIN SOON

156
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,916
TO DESTROY EVERY LAST FIGHTER
IN THIS WORLD.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,708
LOYAL FOLLOWERS SHALL RETURN

158
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,708
AND WILL JOIN ME
IN MY TRIUMPHANT REIGN OF POWER.

159
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,000
WE WILL PROCEED TO UNLEASH

160
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,041
NEVER-ENDING PAIN AND DESPAIR
TO EVERY ONE OF YOU

161
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,041
WHO STOOD AGAINST ME.

162
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,625
- Bashoku: THE BAMBOO
TUBES WE SCATTERED AROUND

163
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,083
ARE LOADED
WITH POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES.

164
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
WHEN LIT, THEY WILL CAUSE
AN INFERNO

165
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,291
THAT WILL BURN AWAY
THE GIANT TREE.

166
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,500
IT LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING'S READY TO GO.

167
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,708
ALL WE HAVE TO DO AT THIS POINT,
IS LIGHT IT.

168
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,750
- GOOD.  SADLY, THESE LIVES
WE ARE ABOUT TO TAKE

169
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,333
CAN NEVER BE REBORN.

170
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,583
BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO DESTROY THEM.

171
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,416
- Rikuson
STRATEGIST KOUMEI,

172
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,125
WHILE YOU'RE HERE, WE'RE
GOING TO SEARCH

173
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,958
FOR THE FIGHTERS WHO ARE
BEING HELD PRISONER.

174
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,583
- Koumei PLEASE KEEP
IN MIND THAT THIS PLACE

175
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,708
IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF A FORCE
THAT TRANSCENDS TIME.

176
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,500
SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

177
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,708
- I DON'T CARE HOW POWERFUL
OR HOW RUTHLESS

178
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,041
KENTEI TRULY IS.

179
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,458
I'LL TELL YOU THIS RIGHT NOW,

180
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,875
HE WON'T TURN NANBAN
INTO A DEN OF MONSTERS.

181
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,166
- Koumei:
VERY SOON THIS PLACE

182
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,333
WILL TURN INTO A SEA OF FLAMES.
YOU MUST HURRY.

183
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,583
- Student 1: WHAT'S GOING ON?
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS!

184
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,625
- Student 2: THAT'S REALLY
SCARY, WHAT IS THAT THING?

185
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,958
- THE DRAGON'S CHI ISN'T
DIMINISHING AT ALL.

186
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,708
IN FACT, IT'S GROWING
MORE POWERFUL!

187
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,041
BE PREPARED, BECAUSE WHEN
GENTOKU'S SPIRIT

188
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,708
IS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONTROL
THE FORCE OF THE DRAGON,

189
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:45,708
THE TWO OF US WILL HAVE
TO STEP IN AND STOP HER RAMPAGE.

190
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,791
EVEN AT THE COST
OF OUR OWN LIVES.

191
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,791
KAN'U, CHOUHI, CHOU'UN--

192
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,500
YOU ARE CONNECTED
TO THE THREE OF THEM

193
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,125
BY THE UNBREAKABLE BONDS
OF DESTINY.

194
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,541
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE
THEIR BLOODSHED

195
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,458
AND HEAR THEIR CRIES.

196
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,375
GENTOKU RYUUBI'S LIFE
ON THIS EARTH

197
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,166
HAS NOT YET
REACHED ITS END.

198
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,750
PLEASE, HANG IN THERE.

199
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,708
- DAMN.

200
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,916
LOOKS LIKE I'M GETTING
MY BUTT KICKED AGAIN.

201
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,666
WHY?  WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH ME?

202
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,166
I'M AM EMBARRASSMENT.

203
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,583
A SHAME TO THE NAME
OF EKITOKU CHOUHI.

204
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,833
I DON'T DESERVE THE NAME.

205
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:42,208
NO, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE NAME.

206
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,083
IT HAS TO DO WITH ME!

207
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,333
I'VE GOT TO FIGHT HER
WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE.

208
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,166
I CAN'T LET MYSELF HOLD BACK.

209
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,583
THIS IS MY POWER.

210
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,875
THIS IS MY ART.

211
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,000
WATCH ME, EKITOKU CHOUHI!

212
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,666
HERE, TASTE MY SERPENT SPEAR!

213
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,458
SERPENT SPEAR
LINKED THUNDER STRIKE!

214
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,750
- THIS CAN'T BE.

215
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,416
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE,

216
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,833
FUCKWIT.

217
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,083
- SHIRYUU, DON'T YOU DARE
HOLD BACK ON ME!

218
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,666
- TELL ME WHY.

219
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,291
WHY DO WE HAVE TO KEEP ON
FIGHTING LIKE THIS?

220
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,833
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

221
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,166
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT A FIGHTER IS ANYMORE.

222
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,125
ARE WE ALL JUST DESTINED
TO KEEP ON FIGHTING EACH OTHER?

223
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,500
FIGHT UNTIL WE SUCCUMB
TO OUR FATE, OR PERISH?

224
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,666
STOP THIS ALREADY!

225
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,333
WHAT ON EARTH CAN
POSSIBLY BE GAINED

226
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,083
BY CAUSING ANY MORE
NEEDLESS BLOODSHED?

227
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,708
- LISTEN, RYOMOU.

228
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,541
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT MAY ALL BE TRUE.

229
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,666
BUT EVEN IF WE ARE DESTINED

230
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,083
TO FIGHT UNTIL WE
DESTROY EACH OTHER,

231
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,875
YOU MUST NOT BE AFRAID TO KEEP
ON FIGHTING FOR OUR FUTURE.

232
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,875
ALL OF US FIGHTING
RIGHT HERE AND NOW,

233
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,916
THIS IS WHAT WILL BUILD
OUR FUTURE.

234
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,458
FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE IN US.

235
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,875
FOR ALL THE LIVES
WE HOLD MOST DEAR.

236
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,250
WE MUST FIGHT
TO DEFEAT OUR DESTINY.

237
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,666
- ( screams )

238
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,625
- Chou'un
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

239
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,000
MAYBE ALL OF US ARE NOTHING
BUT PAWNS OF THE SACRED BEADS.

240
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,958
AS SAD AS IT IS,

241
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,166
PERHAPS US KILLING EACH OTHER
IS INEVITABLE.

242
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,750
YET THROUGH IT ALL,

243
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,875
I STILL WANT TO BELIEVE IN US.

244
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,791
THAT WE ALL GREW
TO LOVE EACH OTHER

245
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,041
OF OUR OWN FREE WILL.

246
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,333
TRY TO REMEMBER, KAN'U.

247
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,666
TRY TO REMEMBER YOUR FEELINGS
FOR OUR LEADER.

248
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,041
JUST ONCE MORE!

249
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,416
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER HER, KAN'U!
PLEASE!

250
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,000
- A FORCE FIELD!

251
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,541
IS THAT FROM THEIR CHI?

252
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,041
THEIR INCREDIBLE CHI
CREATED A FORCE FIELD!

253
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,041
IT'S UNREAL!

254
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,041
- Soujin:
OH, YOU'VE FINALLY COME TO.

255
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,708
SHE WAS BURIED UNDER THE RUBBLE.
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

256
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,125
- Kyocho: I TRIED CALLING
OUT TO HER MANY TIMES.

257
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,583
BUT SHE STILL
REMAINED UNCONSCIOUS.

258
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,166
- Koukin:
HAKUFU.

259
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,416
- Koukin: IT CHANGES COLOR
THE MORE FIGHTERS YOU DEFEAT.

260
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,791
- Hakufu: DOES THAT MEAN THAT
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN I AM,

261
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:17,916
KOUKIN?

262
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,208
- Hakufu:
HOW DARE YOU?

263
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,791
HOW DARE YOU
DO THIS TO KOUKIN?

264
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,375
YOU BASTARD!

265
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,458
SOUSOU, GET READY TO LOSE!

266
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,541
WOW, THOSE PEOPLE
WERE REALLY UNLUCKY.

267
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,250
THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

268
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,875
KOUKIN AND I HAVE KNOWN
EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

269
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,958
AND NOW WE BOTH LIVE TOGETHER
IN THE SAME HOUSE.

270
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,625
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,
HE USED TO GET PICKED ON.

271
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,000
HE WOULD CRY

272
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,583
AND THEN I WOULD HAVE
TO RESCUE HIM.

273
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,791
SURE, BACHIN FOR BACHOU.

274
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,208
WHAT SHOULD BE MY FIRST ORDER...

275
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,375
AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH
FOR A TOOTH, A HEAD FOR A HEAD.

276
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,583
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE!

277
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,833
SO MUCH FUN BEING MASTER
AND SLAVE.

278
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,208
GOING UP AGAINST A REALLY STRONG
OPPONENT MAKES YOU BETTER.

279
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,916
YOU GAIN EXPERIENCE
AND GROW STRONGER.

280
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,125
- ( laughing )

281
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,916
LET'S DO THIS!

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,125
YOU GOT ME ALL FIRED UP.

283
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,416
- Bachou:
YOU'RE HER BOYFRIEND AND ALL.

284
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,083
ACT LIKE IT AND PROTECT HER.

285
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,125
- Hakufu:
KOUKIN!

286
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,166
- WHAT ARE YOU--

287
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,541
- YOU NEED TO HOLD HER.

288
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,541
SO THAT SHE KNOWS YOU'RE HERE.

289
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,500
- Kyocho:
MR. MOU, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

290
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,708
- I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL NOW.

291
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,333
I WAS HOLDING IT ALL THIS TIME.

292
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,708
- Ryomou:
YES.

293
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,291
I ACTED LIKE I DIDN'T CARE.

294
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,250
BUT I WAS AFRAID.

295
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,291
JUST AS RYOFU WAS.

296
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:05,250
I WAS AFRAID OF MY DESTINY
AS A FIGHTER.

297
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,291
AND OF MY OWN FUTURE.

298
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,416
BUT RYOFU AND SAJI
FOUGHT THEIR FATE.

299
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,291
AND CHOSE THEIR OWN DESTINIES.

300
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,958
WHAT THEY DID WAS LIVE
THEIR LIVES AS FIGHTERS

301
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,541
TO THE FULLEST!

302
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,666
UNCHO KAN'U
OF 1800 YEARS AGO,

303
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,166
IF THE DRAGON 
IN MY LEFT EYE

304
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,000
IS YOUR BITTER GRUDGE
AGAINST ME AS A FIGHTER,

305
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:35,416
I WILL RETURN IT
AND YOUR DESPICABLE CURSE.

306
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,458
HERE AND NOW!

307
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:42,083
SAJI, RYOFU, PLEASE HELP ME!

308
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,250
HELP ME TO DESTROY
THE DESTINY OF THE SACRED BEAD!

309
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,125
HEAVEN AND EARTH,

310
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,083
WHITE WAVE SHOCK!

311
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,833
- ( theme music playing )

312
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

313
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,166
- Rikuson: WHEN YOUR LEADER'S
SUCH A SCATTERBRAIN,

314
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,166
THERE'S NO END
TO A TACTICIAN'S PROBLEMS.

315
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,083
- Koumei: YOU CAN'T JUDGE
A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

316
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,166
GENTOKU IS
USUALLY VERY GENTLE.

317
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,583
BUT WHEN
SHE LOSES IT,

318
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,083
SHE'S
UNCONTROLLABLE.

319
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,208
- Rikuson: PLEASE TELL ME
THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE

320
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,375
THERE'S A
CONSUMMATE LEADER

321
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:46,250
WHO'S STRONG, GENTLE,
SMART, AND PROPER.

322
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,416
- Koumei:
NO.

323
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,541
NEXT TIME ON "IKKI
TOUSEN XTREME XECUTOR,"

324
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,833
"FIERY CASTLE."

325
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,791
- Rikuson:
GUESS IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK.
