1
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,083
- ( theme music plays )


2
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,541
- ( singing in Japanese )


3
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:56,333
- Kentei: I HEAR IT.
I CAN HEAR IT--

4
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,333
THE HATEFUL GRUDGES OF CARCASSES
STREWN ABOUT THE BADLANDS,

5
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,916
BLOODY, WOUNDED,
AND DEFEATED.

6
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,416
LISTEN, HEAR ME,
YOU LOST SOULS. 

7
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,458
THIS IS THE GATEWAY TO HELL,

8
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,458
THE THRESHOLD TO DEATH.

9
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,666
AND WHAT IS MORE?
THE GRAVEYARD FOR FIGHTERS.

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,333
COME AND CONSUME
THEIR FLESH.

11
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,666
DRINK THEIR BLOOD

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,500
AND THEN RISE
ONCE AGAIN.

13
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,833
JOIN ME AND FIGHT BY MY SIDE
ON THE BATTLE FIELD.

14
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,333
- WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU PEOPLE?!

15
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,375
- YOU GUYS BETTER STAY BACK

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,583
UNLESS YOU LIKE PAIN.

17
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,625
- ( screams )

18
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,958
- WOW, THEY'RE SO COOL,

19
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,625
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.

20
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,416
( yelps )

21
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,666
AHH!
( thuds )

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,625
- DAMN THEM! DAMN THOSE
FREAKING NANBAN SCUMBAGS.

23
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,833
- HEY!

24
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,541
- COME ON!

25
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,416
LET'S PUT AN END 
TO THIS BULLSHIT.

26
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,833
- TO ALL OF THOSE
WHO ARE SERVANTS OF GOD

27
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,041
AND TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE
FEARFUL OF GOD...

28
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,083
- ( screams )

29
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,250
- I'VE HEARD THOSE WORDS.
I KNOW THEM.

30
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,708
- ( cackles )

31
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,250
- ( men grunt, scream )

32
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,625
- LOOK UP, YOU SCUM,
AND PRAISE GOD WITH ME.

33
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,625
- Yougai: STOP IT, PLEASE.

34
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,708
- ENOUGH!

35
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,500
THIS IS NO HONOR
TO BE HAD IN KILLING A MAN

36
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,041
WHO HAS LOST
ALL WILL TO FIGHT.

37
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,541
- KAN'U, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
- HUH?

38
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,416
- ( strains, grunts )

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
LET GO OF ME,
YOU STUPID, BALD FREAK!

40
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,750
- MAN, YOU SUCK.  FIGURES
YOU'D GET CAUGHT FIRST.

41
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,583
- HMM, THIS NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

42
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,708
IF I DIDN'T TRIP AND FALL
IN THE FIRST-- ( whimpers )

43
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,666
- GREAT, NOW THEY'VE
GOT THE UPPER HAND. 

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,125
- KEEP STILL.

45
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,125
- SO WHAT'S
THE PLAN HERE, KAN'U?

46
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,833
THINK WE SHOULD GIVE IT UP
FOR NOW?

47
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,125
- ( chuckles )

48
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,125
- Kan'u: LISTEN TO ME,
MOUKI BACHOU.

49
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,375
SHOW SOME PRIDE.

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,666
IF YOU'RE INDEED A FIGHTER

51
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,083
WHO IS DESTINED
TO JOIN US IN BATTLE,

52
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,791
THEN PROVE IT TO US.

53
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,500
PROVE THAT YOU ARE WORTHY
BY GETTING OUT ALIVE

54
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,083
BY YOURSELF!
- KAN'U.

55
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,958
- OUR MISSION TO PROTECT
IS ONLY RESERVED

56
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,291
FOR THOSE WHO TRULY NEED
TO BE PROTECTED.

57
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,291
ARE YOU ONE WHO TRULY
NEEDS OUR PROTECTION?

58
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,791
LET'S JUST SEE!
THIS IS MY TEST FOR YOU!

59
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,250
- SHOW SOME PRIDE.

60
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,875
SHE'S RIGHT.
I CAN'T BE WEAK.

61
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,541
I CAME ON BOARD THIS SHIP
TO GET STRONGER.

62
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,208
AND I WILL BECOME STRONGER.

63
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,083
THEN I'LL AVENGE MY BROTHER

64
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,416
FOR THE SAKE OF MY PRIDE
AS A FIGHTER!

65
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,250
- ALL RIGHT, SHE DID IT.

66
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,125
WAY TO GO!
GOOD GOING, BACHOU!

67
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,041
- UH, HEY, KAN'U?

68
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,000
I...
- HMM.

69
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,875
- ( giggles )
- ( gasps )

70
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,916
- ( gasps )

71
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,083
- ( ragged breathing )

72
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,250
- ( panting )

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,666
KAN'U!

74
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,958
- CHOUHI!

75
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,458
HUH?

76
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,125
- TAKE A LOOK AROUND, KYOCHO.
THIS IS MESSED UP.

77
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,500
WHAT SORT OF FREAK SHOW

78
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,083
DID WE GET OURSELVES
INTO THIS TIME?

79
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,083
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED.

80
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,125
- IT'S ALMOST AS IF
WE JUST WANDERED

81
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,791
INTO THE ERA OF
THE THREE KINGDOMS.

82
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,708
- NO WAY.

83
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,166
KAN'U.

84
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,500
AND CHOUHI TOO.

85
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,125
- WHAT IS THIS?

86
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,333
- Ryomou: IT LOOKS LIKE THE
RUINS OF AN ANCIENT TEMPLE.

87
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,708
- MAN, WHAT IS
THIS CREEPY PLACE?

88
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,500
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
ON THE SET OF "LOST."

89
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,458
HEY, WEIRDOES!

90
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,041
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

91
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,791
YOU'RE DEAD MEAT!

92
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,541
I'M A THIRD-YEAR
A-RANKED FIGHTER

93
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,416
FROM KYOSHO ACADEMY,
YOU HEAR ME?!

94
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
- YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
JUST WASTING YOUR BREATH.

95
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,708
- SHIT.

96
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,875
DON'T TALK TO ME.

97
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,625
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT
THAT WE'RE IN THIS MESS.

98
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,458
TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY, HUH?

99
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,500
- ( growls )

100
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,500
- OH, COME ON.
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

101
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,958
DON'T TELL ME
YOU CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.

102
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,666
- GIVE ME BACK 
MY GUMMY CHEWS.

103
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,208
- TOO BAD FOR YOU
I ALREADY ATE THEM ALL.

104
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,583
- TAKING SOMEONE ELSE'S CANDY,
YOU'RE SO UNBELIEVABLE.

105
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,208
- YOU STILL HAVE SOME?
I COULD GO FOR MORE.

106
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,541
- GIVE ME A BREAK.
WHY DON'T YOU

107
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,333
BRING YOUR OWN SNACKS
FOR ONCE, HUH?

108
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,666
- YOU'RE A REAL CHEAPSKATE.
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING!

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,833
- CHEAP CHEAP!
- STUPID PIG!

110
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,500
- Kyocho:
THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU TWO.

111
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,333
THERE ARE OTHER
PRESSING MATTERS.

112
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
- Both: RIGHT.

113
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,083
- Shuhou: WHAT HAPPENED
TO KOUTEI AND THE OTHERS?

114
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,791
ARE THEY STILL
ON THE SHIP?

115
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
- WHO KNOWS?
HONESTLY,

116
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,875
I'D BE MORE WORRIED
ABOUT YOURSELF

117
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,541
THAN WHATEVER THEY'RE
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

118
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
DAMN, YOU KNOW,
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY,

119
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,083
I JUST CAN'T GET A READ
ON THESE GUYS.

120
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,958
- THAT GIRL WHO ATTACKED US

121
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,791
FROM THE DECK
OF THE SHIP EARLIER...

122
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,416
I'VE SEEN HER.

123
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,458
I'M POSITIVE THAT'S
THE GIRL WHO ATTACKED ME

124
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,166
WHEN I VISITED
RYOFU'S GRAVE.

125
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,541
- HALLELUJAH.
SALVATION, GLORY, AND POWER

126
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,125
BELONG TO THE ONE AND ONLY
ALMIGHTY GOD.

127
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,666
OUR JUDGMENT IS BOTH
TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS. 

128
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,041
- Ryomou: SHE'S A KILLING
MACHINE TRAINED TO ELIMINATE

129
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,958
ENEMIES WITH
DEADLY CERTAINTY.

130
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,375
TEN'I FROM KYOSHO ACADEMY.

131
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,291
- TO ALL OF THOSE WHO
ARE SERVANTS OF GOD,

132
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,833
LOOK UP, YOU FOUL SCUM,
AND PRAISE GOD WITH ME.

133
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,791
- THOSE ARE THE SAME
WORDS SHE USED BEFORE.

134
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,666
- FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,

135
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,333
THIS CONTEST WAS A FAKE
TO BEGIN WITH.

136
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,875
AT ANY RATE,
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE

137
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,541
WHO THIS KENTEI REALLY IS,

138
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,250
WE BETTER KEEP OUR EYES PEELED
AND OUR MOUTH SHUT.

139
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,250
- THIS KENTEI,
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

140
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,958
TO MEETING HIM
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

141
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,458
- SHIRYUU CHOU'UN...

142
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,041
THE WAY YOU FOUGHT
TO PROTECT YOUR LEADER

143
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,833
WAS A COMMENDABLE
FEAT INDEED.

144
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,458
THOUGH YOU ARE MY ENEMY,
I ADMIRE YOU.

145
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,750
- Kentei: I PUT A CURSE

146
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,708
ON THE SACRED BEADS 
HELD BY THE FIGHTERS

147
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,208
IN ORDER TO LURE
THEM HERE.

148
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,666
I GUARANTEE THAT
IT WILL WORK WITHOUT FAIL.

149
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,333
AND NOW THE SOULS THAT
HAVE REMAINED DORMANT IN THEM

150
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,166
WILL BE RELEASED.

151
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,458
AND THE FIGHTERS WILL BE DRAWN
TO THEIR BLOODY DESTINY,

152
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,541
A DESTINY OF 1800 YEARS PAST.

153
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,208
HERE, IN THIS ARENA,
THEY WILL DO BATTLE 

154
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,583
UNTIL THEIR BODIES
GIVE OUT AND EXPIRE.

155
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,375
- YOU CAN COUNT
ON ME FOR THIS.

156
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,125
NO ONE WILL BE GETTING AWAY
WITH ME AROUND.

157
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,875
- Kentei: IN THE COMMOTION,

158
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,916
I WILL TAKE THE HEAD
OF SEITO'S LEADER.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,541
GENTOKU RYUUBI.
- HMM.

160
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,500
- RYUUBI'S DRAGON
IS THE POWER OF LIGHTNING.

161
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:46,250
HOWEVER, AT PRESENT, SHE IS
STILL UNABLE TO CONTROL IT.

162
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,083
ITS TRUE POWER CAN
ONLY BE DISPLAYED 

163
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,750
WHEN HAKUFU SONSAKU'S
WATER DRAGON IS NEARBY.

164
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,958
- HAKUFU'S SONSAKU'S
WATER DRAGON?

165
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,333
- FIRST, WE NEED
TO KILL RYUUBI

166
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,416
BEFORE THE DRAGON
SHOWS ITS POWER. 

167
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,750
THEN WE NEED
TO CAPTURE SONSAKU.

168
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,916
ONCE WE'VE DEFEATED
SEITO AND NANYO,

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,458
CONQUERING THE KANTO REGION
WILL BE EASY.

170
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,666
- WHAT ABOUT SOUSOU
OF KYOSHO ACADEMY? 

171
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,750
- Kentei: SOUSOU
WON'T TAKE ACTION.

172
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,916
HE KNOWS HIS POWERS
WILL ONLY BRING ABOUT

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,958
HIS OWN DESTRUCTION.
AND HIS FEAR CONTROLS HIM.

174
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,583
- AND WHO THE HELL ARE YOU 
TO TELL US WHAT DO TO, HUH?

175
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,416
DON'T TELL ME YOU BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY

176
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,750
THE REINCARNATED KENTEI?

177
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,625
- BUT I AM.

178
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,791
AND DON'T THINK
I AM SO INSIGNIFICANT

179
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,958
TO MERELY HAVE POWER
THROUGH SUCCESSION.

180
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,375
I ASSURE YOU,

181
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,541
I AM THE TRUE EMPEROR
OF THIS WORLD.

182
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,291
AND AS SUCH,
I HAVE USED MY POWERS

183
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,416
TO TRANSCEND TIME.

184
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,083
- ( laughs )
EMPEROR OR NOT,

185
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,416
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
US TO TRUST YOU 

186
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,708
UNLESS YOU SHOW US
WHAT'S HIDDEN

187
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,916
UNDER THAT MASK OF YOURS.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,083
- I HAVE NO FACE.

189
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,208
ONLY AN UNFATHOMABLE DARKNESS
LIES BENEATH THIS MASK.

190
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,833
IF YOU WISH TO SEE IT,

191
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
YOU MUST BE PREPARED
AND WILLING

192
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,708
TO ENTER THIS
DARKNESS YOURSELF.

193
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,583
- REGARDLESS OF WHO
KENTEI REALLY IS,

194
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,833
I WON'T FAIL IN TAKING
RYUUBI'S HEAD AGAIN.

195
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,000
- BE AWARE.
SEITO'S TACTICIAN

196
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,208
SHOULD ALREADY BE PLANNING

197
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,000
THEIR NEXT ATTACK.

198
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,583
THEREFORE,
HERE IS WHERE YOU COME IN.

199
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,791
- ( growls )

200
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,791
- Chou'un: NOW THAT IT'S CLEAR
THAT THE ENEMY IS NANBAN HIGH,

201
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,458
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
THEY PLAN TO MAKE A MOVE

202
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,500
TO CONQUER ALL OF
THE KANTO REGION.

203
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,375
- YES, BUT I ONLY WISH
WE HAD A CLUE

204
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,708
AS TO WHO THIS
KENTEI REALLY IS.

205
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,041
THE NEXT TIME THAT FIGHTER
ATTACKS GENTOKU,

206
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,375
WE CAN'T LET HER GET AWAY.

207
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,000
THE COST WOULD
BE TOO GREAT. 

208
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,250
- AND NO MATTER WHAT,
WE MUSTN'T UNDERESTIMATE

209
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,000
THE FIGHTER CALLED MOUYUU.

210
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,416
I SENSE THAT SHE IS
THE DANGEROUS TYPE 

211
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,708
WHO ONLY BECOMES
MORE FIERCE AND DEADLY

212
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,791
AS THE BATTLE RAGES ON.

213
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,458
- IF THAT IS INDEED TRUE,

214
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,083
THEN THAT'S ALL
THE MORE REASON

215
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,333
TO AVOID A DIRECT
CONFRONTATION WITH THEM.

216
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,041
WITHOUT HAVING KAN'U AND CHOUHI
HERE AT HOME WITH US,

217
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,125
WE CANNOT HOPE TO COMPETE
ON THE MERITS

218
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,916
OF OUR STRENGTH ALONE.

219
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,000
- ( girl panting )

220
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,958
KAN'U, YOU WITH ME?

221
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,791
( continues panting )

222
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,791
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

223
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,583
WE'RE NOT DEAD YET.

224
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,000
- Ekitoku: KAN'U! KAN'U!

225
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,041
HEY, ARE YOU AWAKE YET?

226
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,958
- ( gasps )

227
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,416
- HEARTLESS BASTARDS!

228
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,875
YOU GUYS LIKE TO
PLAY DIRTY, DON'T YOU?!

229
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,500
- DIRTY OR NOT, SWEETHEART,
IF IT HELPS ME WIN,

230
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,250
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
WHAT YOU THINK.

231
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,333
- TOO BAD.
LOOKS LIKE RAKUYO'S KAYUU

232
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,958
IS GOING TO CRUSH THOSE TWO.
- WHAT IN THE WORLD

233
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,416
IS SEITO THINKING ONLY
SENDING THOSE TWO AS BACKUP?

234
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,958
- YUP, KAYUU'S DEFINITELY
GONNA KILL THOSE TWO FOR SURE.

235
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,250
- ( chains clink )
- ( groans )

236
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,208
- Both: HI'YAH!

237
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,000
- ( grunts, groaning )

238
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:12,958
- EKITOKU!

239
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,583
IS THIS...
- KAN'U, TRY TO STAY BACK.

240
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,000
I'M OKAY.  THESE GUYS
ARE NO PROBLEM.

241
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,541
MY OPPONENT IS STILL
MY OPPONENT UNTIL I FALL.

242
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,875
AM I RIGHT?
- EKITOKU! 

243
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,375
- WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
FOR MUCH LONGER,

244
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,083
YOU CRAZY BITCH!

245
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,083
- ( screams )

246
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,791
- Kayuu: "UNTIL SHE FALLS."
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

247
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,125
SHE'S DONE.

248
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,541
- NICE JOB, BOSS.
( laughs )

249
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,291
- KAN'U, I'M NOT DONE.
I CAN STILL FIGHT.

250
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,125
I PROMISE.

251
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,958
AFTER ALL, I AM UNCHO KAN'U'S
YOUNGER SISTER, RIGHT?

252
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,833
I REALLY CAN'T AFFORD
TO EMBARRASS YOU, YOU KNOW?

253
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,083
- YOU NEVER...
- ( strains )

254
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,166
WELL THEN, COME ON, 
YOU STUPID BASTARDS!

255
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,083
EVEN IF I SPILL MY GUTS,

256
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,750
EKITOKU CHOUHI 
WON'T BE LOSING

257
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,125
TO THE LIKES
OF SCUM LIKE YOU!

258
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,291
- WELL, IF YOU'RE 
READY AND WILLING,

259
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,166
WHY DON'T I JUST SPILL 'EM
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW?

260
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,750
- ( grunts )

261
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,458
- ( screams )

262
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,458
- ( gasps )

263
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,375
- ( boys gasping )

264
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,000
- ( grunts )
DAMN IT.

265
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,833
- KAYUU, YOU'RE NOT
HURT TOO BAD, ARE YOU?

266
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,083
- All: ( gasping )

267
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,833
- UNFORGIVEABLE.

268
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,875
HOW DARE YOU
HURT MY SISTER.

269
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,208
HOW DARE YOU
MOCK MY SISTER.

270
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,416
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY
WITH YOUR LIFE!

271
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- ( whimpering )

272
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,708
- Kan'u: TAKE THIS GIFT FROM ME
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

273
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,791
THE NAME OF THE GOD OF DEATH 
WHO WILL BE YOUR DESTRUCTION.

274
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,125
MY NAME IS--

275
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,083
MY NAME IS...

276
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,041
- OH.

277
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,083
KAN'U.  OH, GOOD,
YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE.

278
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,666
- IS THAT YOU, EKITOKU?
- WELL, YEAH.

279
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,791
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?
OH, WAIT A SECOND.

280
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,291
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU, ISN'T THERE? 

281
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,125
- I CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE.

282
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,875
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

283
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,458
- WELL, I'M RIGHT HERE.

284
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,166
I PROMISE I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

285
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,750
- AWW, GEEZ!

286
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,083
( squeaking )

287
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,125
- HEY, WHAT NOW?
- UH...

288
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,916
I CAN'T HOLD IT ANYMORE!
- HUH?

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,958
- AWW! HURRY! HURRY! HURRY!
I'M GONNA BURST!

290
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,791
HURRY UP! HURRY UP!

291
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,625
YES!

292
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,791
HUH?

293
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,791
( pants )

294
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,333
OKAY, YOU CAN LOOK AWAY NOW,
YOU PERVS.

295
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,500
( sighs )
( urinating )

296
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,875
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

297
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,500
- ( trilling )
- HMM?

298
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,416
- ( trilling )

299
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,125
- ( Bachou screams )
- Both: HUH?

300
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,875
- SHE'S AT IT AGAIN.

301
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:06,875
- SO WHAT IS IT
THIS TIME?

302
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,166
- GO! GET AWAY FROM ME!

303
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,875
( whimpering )

304
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,333
( screaming )

305
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,500
HUH? OH!

306
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,416
WHOA! WHAT THE--

307
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,416
ARE YOU KIDNAPPING ME?!

308
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,750
- HUH? HEY!

309
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,875
YOU FORGOT TO
TAKE ME WITH YOU!

310
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,083
- ( boys sigh )

311
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,125
- Bachou: SO ITCHY!

312
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,958
THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA
LEAVE A SCAR TOO.

313
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,666
BUG BITES ALL OVER THE PLACE

314
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,500
AND A SNAKE WHEN
I'M TRYING TO PEE,

315
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,333
THIS REALLY ISN'T MY DAY.
( whines )

316
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,291
AND YOU.

317
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,958
SAY SOMETHING ALREADY.

318
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
WHY DON'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING LIKE

319
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,208
"THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT"
OR "YOU IDIOT"?

320
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,166
- YOU IDIOT.
- ( gasps ) 

321
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,250
( growls )

322
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,625
( screams )

323
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,000
OKAY, FINE,
I GOT BEAT DURING THE RAID

324
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,541
AND I GOT TAKEN HOSTAGE
WHILE ON THE SHIP

325
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,541
BACK THERE TOO,
BUT MASTER'S SPECIAL TRAINING

326
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,208
HAS TURNED ME INTO 
A WHOLE NEW PERSON.

327
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,500
AND IF I FELT LIKE IT,

328
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,000
I BET I COULD EASILY
TAKE YOU ON

329
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,458
IN A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHT!
- OH, REALLY?

330
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,250
- ( huffs )

331
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,166
SO THEN WHY DID YOU
DECIDE TO SAVE ME? 

332
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,666
- BECAUSE IF I HADN'T,
YOU WOULD'VE DIED.

333
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,041
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I'M A WEAKLING?

334
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,375
- WELL, NO. 
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

335
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,041
- AND YOU DID
THE SAME EXACT THING

336
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,791
BACK WHEN WE FOUGHT
AT KYOSHO, DIDN'T YOU?

337
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,375
PUT 'EM UP!

338
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,250
WE'LL PICK BACK UP WHERE
WE LEFT OFF LAST TIME.

339
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,250
WELL, PUT 'EM UP!
I WON'T BE SATISFIED

340
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,958
UNTIL WE FIGHT
IT ALL OUT.

341
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,250
- I'M SORRY,

342
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,250
BUT THERE'S NO POINT.
- HUH?

343
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,000
D-- DON'T MOCK ME!

344
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,000
HI'YAH!

345
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,625
HEY, COME ON.

346
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,041
WHY DO YOU KEEP
RUNNING AWAY FROM ME?

347
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,625
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT I'M NOT EVEN

348
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,333
WORTH THE EFFORT, HUH?!
- ( gasps )

349
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,125
- ( laughs )

350
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,583
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

351
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,458
WHEN YOU KEEP TRYING
TO RUN AWAY FROM ME.

352
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,625
SO DO YOU GIVE UP NOW?

353
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,083
THAT'S RIGHT.

354
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,625
YOU CAN STRUGGLE ALL YOU WANT,

355
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,083
BUT IT'LL JUST MAKE YOU
SINK DEEPER AND DEEPER.

356
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,791
UH, ( nervous laugh )
HEY, STOP PRETENDING.

357
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,000
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
REALLY SCARED. 

358
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,291
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?!

359
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,458
UH...

360
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,958
OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
TAKE MY HAND.

361
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,833
- YOU GO.
ESCAPE ON YOUR OWN.

362
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,250
- HUH?
- IF YOU TRY TO HELP ME,

363
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,333
YOU'LL END UP
SINKING DOWN HERE AS WELL.

364
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,625
- WHAT THE--
YOU DO REALIZE


365
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,750
YOUR LIFE IS IN
REAL DANGER, DON'T YOU?


366
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,958
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?


367
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,083
- OH, NEVER MIND WHY!
HURRY, GRAB MY HAND.

368
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,625
UH, I WON'T TELL YOU
TO FIGHT ME ANYMORE!

369
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,083
HERE.

370
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,500
NOW HOLD ON TIGHT, OKAY?

371
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,666
( strains )
COME ON!

372
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,333
( grunts )

373
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,583
( pants, sighs )

374
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,916
WELL, I THINK WE CAN SAY
WE'RE EVEN NOW.

375
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,958
I OWE YOU NOTHING.

376
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,333
HUH?

377
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,166
- THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

378
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,166
- THANK YOU TOO,
I GUESS.

379
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,916
- SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

380
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,541
- AFTER YOU FELL
INTO THE OCEAN, 

381
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,416
I JUMPED IN
RIGHT AFTER YOU,

382
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,625
BUT THE CURRENT
WAS TOO POWERFUL.

383
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,833
AND THAT'S HOW THE TWO OF US
MANAGED TO WASH UP ON SHORE.

384
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,333
EVEN THOUGH THOUGH
WE'RE LOST ON SOME ISLAND,

385
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,500
WE'RE SURE LUCKY.

386
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,916
- THIS ISN'T FAIR.

387
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,250
YOU'RE ALWAYS
SAVING MY LIFE.

388
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,125
- DON'T BE LIKE THAT.
AFTER ALL,

389
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,208
YOU AND I ARE SWORN SISTERS,
AREN'T WE?

390
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,458
WE LIVE TOGETHER
AND WE DIE TOGETHER.

391
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,750
- ( chuckles )
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

392
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,166
- ( metal whirs )
- WHAT THE--

393
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,500
- ( metal clinks )
- EKITOKU!

394
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,375
- ( metal whirs )

395
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,458
( clinks )

396
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,166
- WHO'S OUT THERE?!
( grunts )

397
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,250
DAMN.  KAN'U, MAKE SURE
YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

398
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,000
- WAIT, DON'T GO OUT THERE!

399
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,166
- ( screams )

400
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,375
( screaming echoes )

401
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,625
- Moukaku: HOW SAD.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR PARTNER'S

402
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,041
ABOUT TO BITE THE DUST.

403
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,583
IF SHE MEANS
ANYTHING TO YOU,

404
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,458
THEN GIVE YOURSELF UP
WITH OUT A STRUGGLE. 

405
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,541
- EKITOKU, CAN YOU
STILL HEAR ME?

406
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,000
- OOH, THAT'S A DANGEROUS
LITTLE STICK

407
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,208
YOU'VE GOT THERE,

408
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,291
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN LOOK

409
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,041
LIKE YOU CAN STAND
ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET.

410
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,708
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN FIGHT?

411
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,125
- Ekitoku: KAN'U!
DON'T FIGHT.

412
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,583
I CAN STILL--

413
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,041
( gasping )

414
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,416
I CAN STILL FIGHT HER.

415
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,375
- NO, NOT AGAIN.

416
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,875
YOU CAN'T FIGHT.

417
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,750
- Moukaku: WHAT'S WRONG?

418
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,375
YOU GONNA LET THIS
HALF-DEAD ONE FIGHT,

419
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,708
YOU FUCKING IDIOT?

420
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,291
- I WON'T FIGHT.
I SURRENDER.

421
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,041
I'LL DO AS YOU SAY.

422
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,583
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TO MY PRIDE,

423
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,250
I CAN'T LET EKITOKU DIE.

424
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,500
- HUH? SO YOU GAVE UP
BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE

425
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,208
MEANS MORE THAN YOUR PRIDE.

426
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,958
- THIS ONE IS MY OPPONENT.

427
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,458
IT'S MY OPPONENT UNTIL I FALL
AND I WON'T FALL.

428
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,875
- Kan'u: EKITOKU CHOUHI,

429
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,500
YOU ARE
MY GREATEST PRIDE,

430
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,375
MY PRECIOUS SISTER,

431
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,750
FOR ALL ETERNITY,

432
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,958
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

433
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,916
- ( theme music plays )


434
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,041
- ( singing in Japanese )


435
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,041
- Koukin:
RYOMOU, NANBAN HIGH IS LIKE

436
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,166
SOME KINGDOM
DEEP IN THE JUNGLE.

437
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,333
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE WEIRD?
- YES, IT IS.

438
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,333
BUT YOU CAN THINK OF IT
AS TAKING OUR SCHOOL TRIP

439
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,541
A BIT EARLY THIS YEAR.

440
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,291
- HOW ARE YOU TAKING THIS
SO WELL?

441
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,750
WE DON'T EVEN GET
CELL PHONE RECEPTION HERE.

442
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,291
- WHAT?! YOU MEAN I CAN'T
EVEN SEND TEXT MESSAGES?!

443
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,291
WE SHOULD GO HOME!
RIGHT NOW!

444
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,291
- UM, IN CASE YOU FORGOT,

445
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,916
WE'RE BEING HELD CAPTIVE.

446
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,125
NEXT TIME ON "IKKI TOUSEN,
XTREME XECUTOR,"

447
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,625
"SWARMING FANGS."
