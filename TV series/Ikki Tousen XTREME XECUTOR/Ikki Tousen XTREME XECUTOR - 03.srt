1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,958
- ( vocalizing )

3
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:38,666
( singing in Japanese )

4
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,500
- I HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

5
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,791
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME?

6
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,500
WHERE HAVE YOU GONE?

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,916
MOTHER MARY,

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,541
I PRAY TO YOU THIS NIGHT

9
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,125
IN EARNEST ON MY KNEES.

10
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,583
WHEREVER YOU ARE,
PLEASE HEAR ME.

11
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,041
PLEASE HEAR MY VOICE.

12
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,541
( gasps )

13
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,750
MY PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED.
YOU'VE RETURNED.

14
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,333
THANK YOU, GOD.

15
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,375
MY MOTHER MARY.

16
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,625
- HOW LONG ARE WE PLANNING
TO LINGER HERE?

17
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,083
- I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.

18
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,833
WE'VE CUT TIES.
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

19
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,041
WHY SHOULD WE FIGHT?
NOT OUR PROBLEM ANYMORE.

20
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,541
- WE'RE JUST GOING TO LEAVE
THOSE GUYS FROM NANBAN?

21
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,750
- NO ONE WOULD FOLLOW US.
WE'RE OUTCASTS.

22
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,041
WE'VE LEFT THE FEDERATION.

23
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,083
SO MUCH FOR OUR DREAM
OF CONQUERING ALL KANTO.

24
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:02,125
WHEN PUSH CAME TO SHOVE,
YOUGAI, KENNEI, KOTEI AND ESSUI

25
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,750
DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS
TO GET THE JOB DONE. 

26
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,666
FUCKWITS.

27
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,208
THE SCHOOLS IN KANTO WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ALL THAT DIFFICULT.

28
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,833
ALL YOU NEED TO DO TO KILL
THE SNAKE IS CUT OFF ITS HEAD.

29
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,500
- ( people whimpering )

30
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,458
( screaming )

31
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,166
- IT WAS A MISTAKE
TO ALLY WITH THOSE COWARDS.

32
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,833
- OF COURSE IT WAS.

33
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,250
THAT'S WHY I TAUGHT THEM
A LESSON.

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,458
THEY NEEDED TO TOUGHEN UP.

35
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,291
AND ALL I GOT FOR
MY TROUBLES WAS BANISHMENT.

36
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,750
( laughs )

37
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,083
SHOW YOURSELF!

38
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,750
- IF IT ISN'T MOUKAKU,
HEAD OF NANBAN HIGH SCHOOL,

39
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,750
AND HER SISTER MOUYUU.

40
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,708
THE BOTH OF YOU
HAVE PREDILECTIONS

41
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,333
TOWARDS EXTREME VIOLENCE.

42
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,750
AND AS A RESULT,

43
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,833
HAVE BEEN EXILED FROM THE
SOUTHERN KANTO FEDERATION.

44
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,250
- FUCK OFF!

45
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,208
( gasps )

46
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,166
- BECAUSE YOU WERE
BANISHED WHEN KYOSHO,

47
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,916
SEITO, AND NANYO ACADEMIES

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,916
HELD THEIR LITTLE
BATTLE OF RED CLIFFS,

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,916
YOU TWO DIDN'T GET TO PLAY.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,625
- HE KNOWS HIS STUFF.

51
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,375
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE JUST SITTING AROUND

52
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,916
ON OUR ASSES,
TWIDDLING OUR THUMBS ALL DAY.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,958
WE STILL HAVE PLANS.

54
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,458
- REALLY?

55
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,416
DO YOU STILL WANT TO 
CONQUER ALL OF KANTO?

56
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,833
I AM KENTEI.

57
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,041
- ( gasps )

58
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,416
- IF YOU WANT TO RESURRECT
YOUR DREAM FROM THE ASHES

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,291
AND MAKE IT COME
TRUE, FOLLOW ME.

60
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:03,000
- OH, MAN, I DIDN'T HAVE
TIME TO STUDY LAST NIGHT...

61
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,416
- ( students chattering )

62
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,375
- I DIDN'T REALLY WANNA
COME TO SCHOOL TODAY...

63
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,666
- IF I'M GOING TO HAVE
ANY CHANCE OF AVENGING KANSUI,

64
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,083
I HAVE TO GET STRONGER.
I HAVE TO.

65
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,791
- HAKUFU, YOU CAN'T
JUST DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT.

66
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,250
- SORRY, IT JUST HAPPENED.

67
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,041
- THERE WAS
A BUILDING COLLAPSE NEARBY.

68
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,333
I WAS REALLY WORRIED.

69
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,750
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HEARD
SEVERAL PEOPLE

70
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,750
JUST STANDING NEAR IT
HAD BEEN INJURED.

71
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,166
- WOW. THOSE PEOPLE WERE REALLY
UNLUCKY. THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

72
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,125
- HEY, DOWN THERE!
GOOD MORNING!

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,208
- WHAT THE HECK?!
- OH, IT'S YOU!

74
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,291
- YES, IT'S ME!
- WHO ARE YOU? 

75
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,666
- I WAS SUPER IMPRESSED
BY YOUR AWESOME FIGHTING SKILLS

76
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,708
THE OTHER DAY, MASTER.

77
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,333
I WANT SO BADLY TO BECOME

78
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
A STRONG FIGHTER LIKE YOU.

79
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,458
- BACHOU WAS A FIERCE GENERAL.

80
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,666
1800 YEARS AGO,
HE SERVED UNDER GENTOKU RYUUBI.

81
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,500
- OH!  THAT MEANS
SHE'S RYUU-CHAN'S FRIEND.

82
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,041
- I'M HONORED YOU KNOW ME.

83
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,500
- BUT IF YOU'RE
RYUU-CHAN'S FRIEND,

84
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,250
I CAME HERE TODAY TO SEE YOU
OF COURSE, MASTER SONSAKU.

86
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,000
- ME?  YOU CAME HERE
JUST TO SEE ME?

87
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,625
- YES!

88
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,291
- GOOD FOR YOU! YOU'VE
SEEN ME. SEE YOU LATER.

89
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,375
- HUH?

90
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,416
- DEFINITELY. CATCH YOU
SOME OTHER TIME.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,166
WAIT.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

92
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,791
MASTER SONSAKU,
I BEG YOU,

93
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,916
PLEASE TAKE ME ON
AS YOUR DISCIPLE.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,583
- HUH?

95
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,000
MMM, THIS IS SO GOOD!

96
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,416
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

97
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,833
IT'S A BRAND-NEW FLAVOR
THEY'RE MAKING.

98
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,000
IT'S ONLY BEEN ON SALE
FOR A MONTH.

99
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,541
I CAN BRING SOME EVERY DAY

100
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,625
IF YOU TRAIN ME.
PLEASE SAY THAT YOU WILL.

101
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,750
PLEASE, MASTER.

102
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,958
- UM, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

103
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,541
- EXPLAIN TO ME--

104
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,916
WHY DO YOU WANT SO MUCH TO
BE A DISCIPLE OF HAKUFU'S?

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,416
- WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT
OF YOURS?!

106
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,291
WHAT'S MASTER TO YOU?
- UM, WELL...

107
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,041
YOU SEE, IT'S KINDA HARD
TO EXPLAIN.

108
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,583
- KOUKIN AND I HAVE KNOWN
EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

109
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,791
AND NOW WE BOTH LIVE TOGETHER
IN THE SAME HOUSE.

110
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,958
- HE'S WITH YOU?
ALL THE TIME?

111
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,458
- YEAH, WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,
HE USED TO GET PICKED ON.

112
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,083
HE WOULD CRY, AND THEN
I WOULD HAVE TO RESCUE HIM.

113
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,125
- HEY, SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW ALL THAT!

114
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,416
- HMM.

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,583
I GET IT.
YOU'RE A HANGER-ON.

116
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,833
YOU CLING TO MASTER

117
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,500
LIKE POOP THAT HANGS OFF
THE END OF A GOLDFISH.

118
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,291
- WHAT? LIKE GOLDFISH POOP?

119
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,916
- I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT YOU,
GOLDFISH POOP.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,583
I WANNA BE HER DISCIPLE!

121
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,416
- IF YOU REALLY WANT TO--

122
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,916
HMM...

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,958
THAT'S IT!
I'LL GIVE YOU A TEST.

124
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,166
IF YOU CAN BEAT
THAT GIANT GUY OVER THERE--

125
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,875
THE ONE THE SIZE
OF A GORILLA--

126
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,791
THEN I'LL LET YOU BE
MY DISCIPLE.

127
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,208
- YOU WANT ME TO BEAT UP
THAT BIG GUY?

128
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,250
- UH-HUH.
CAN YOU DO IT?

129
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,041
- IF I CAN BEAT
THIS WALKING CONTINENT,

130
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,666
YOU'LL TAKE ME?
- MM-HMM.

131
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,708
- GREAT!

132
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,291
- YOU WANT THEM TO FIGHT?

133
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,875
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

134
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,291
- IT'LL BE FINE.
SHE CAN'T HURT GAKU-CHAN.

135
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,750
IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT
TO BREAK HIM.

136
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,166
- OBVIOUSLY.

137
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,375
SHE'S THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

138
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,833
- YO, BIG GUY!
- HUH?

139
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,500
WHAT IS IT?
- MASTER SAYS I MUST FIGHT YOU.

140
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,125
AND I MUST WIN
IF I WANNA BECOME HER DISCIPLE.

141
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,000
- MASTER?
- FORGIVE ME.

142
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,541
BUT I'M NOT GONNA HOLD BACK!

143
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,875
AH!

144
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,833
- HMM?

145
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,916
- ( chuckles )

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,416
- OH.

147
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,458
( groaning )

148
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,041
- I DID IT!
HURRAY, I BEAT HIM!

149
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,166
AH!  I DID IT, MASTER!

150
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,125
YES!  I BEAT HIM!
I BESTED HIM WITH A SINGLE BLOW.

151
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,458
DID I PASS?

152
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,125
- OKAY THEN,
YOU CAN BE MY DISCIPLE.

153
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,125
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- HUH?

154
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,333
- INSTRUCT HER WELL, SONSAKU.

155
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,625
BYE.

156
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,625
- WOW, THAT GAKU-CHAN GUY
REALLY IS TOUGH.

157
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,916
- NOW, BACHIN.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,625
- YOU SAID BACHIN?

159
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,875
- SURE, BACHIN FROM BACHOU.

160
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,208
WHAT SHOULD BE MY FIRST ORDER?

161
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,291
- I KNOW. GET ME A
SANDWICH AND ORANGE JUICE.

162
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,166
- BUT, UH,
BACHIN MEANS PIPSQUEAK.

163
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,291
I'D PREFER MA-CHAN?

164
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,333
- NO, YOU ARE BACHIN.

165
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,500
AND IF YOU DON'T GET GOING,
YOU'LL BE BAKA-CHIN.

166
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,875
- YES, MASTER!

167
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,458
- ( giggles )

168
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,875
THIS DISCIPLE THING IS FUN.

169
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,041
I SHOULD HAVE TRIED IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

170
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,375
- DISCIPLE?
DON'T YOU MEAN MASTER AND SLAVE?

171
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,416
- HERE IT IS, MASTER!

172
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,708
- MMM, YUM!

173
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,250
- CLEAN!

174
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,375
WATCH IT!

175
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,375
SCRUB, SCRUB, SCRUB...

176
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,000
SCRUB!

177
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,958
- KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL.

178
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,416
- ( groans )
STRIKE!

179
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,708
- LOUDER!

180
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,708
- STRIKE!

181
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,875
( groaning )

182
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,291
- READY?

183
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,583
GO!
- ( groans )

184
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,583
- ALL RIGHT!

185
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,666
- ( grunts )

186
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,416
NEXT!

187
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,750
( panting )
- CHOP-CHOP, BACHIN.

188
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,083
YOU HAVE TO DO AS I SAY.

189
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,083
SO MUCH FUN BEING MASTER
AND SLAVE.

190
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,250
- SAY, HAKUFU?

191
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,833
MOUKI BACHOU ISN'T A BAD KID.

192
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,875
YOU SHOULD STOP
RUNNING HER AROUND LIKE THIS.

193
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,250
SHE REALLY WANTS YOU
TO TEACH HER.

194
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,666
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT
IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO.

195
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,541
- GRANDMASTER, TEACH ME
HOW I SHOULD FIGHT.

196
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,416
I AM YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED.

197
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,041
- WHEN FACING AN OPPONENT,

198
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,291
DO NOT THINK ABOUT
HOW TO BEAT HIM.

199
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,541
YOU MUST FEEL IT.

200
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
- I SEE.
THANK YOU, MASTER.

201
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,458
- WHAT?  HOW DOES HE SEE IT?

202
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,375
I DON'T SEE IT AT ALL.

203
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,791
- HAKUFU, ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

204
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,500
COME UP WITH A PLAN
AND START TEACHING BACHOU

205
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,916
LIKE SHE WANTS.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
- ( grunting )

207
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,708
- Grandmaster:
DON'T THINK, JUST FEEL.

208
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,416
- KOUKIN, WHEN YOU FIGHT,
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

209
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,125
YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT.

210
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,416
- ( sighs )

211
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,875
- MASTER,
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

212
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
- ( in deep voice )
YES.

213
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,083
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,
DISCIPLE.

214
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,250
- MASTER, YOU HAVE FACIAL HAIR?

215
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,666
- MM-HMM.

216
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
YOUNG BACHIN,

217
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,458
YOU HAVE TRAINED HARD
THESE LAST FEW DAYS. 

218
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,458
I AM PLEASED.

219
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,000
- SURE.

220
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,541
- BUT YOU HAVE A LONG WAY
TO GO IF YOU WANT TO BE

221
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,750
A TOP-RANKED FIGHTER.

222
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,250
DO YOU WISH TO GET STRONGER?

223
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,750
- YES, MASTER!
I WISH IT!

224
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,458
I WANNA BE
STRONGER THAN I AM.

225
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,291
- EXCELLENT. ARE YOU READY
TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY?

226
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,708
- YES, MASTER.
- GOOD.

227
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,166
NOW PREPARE,
BECAUSE FROM HERE ON OUT,

228
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,625
IT'S GOING TO BE HELL.

229
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,416
- ( gulps )

230
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,625
- ( normal voice )
MEET YOUR TRAINING PARTNER!

231
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,250
- ( gasps )

232
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,291
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING?!

233
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,666
AAH!

234
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,041
- ISN'T IT GREAT?

235
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,583
IT'S A SPARRING DUMMY
TO PRACTICE ON.

236
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,958
IN ANCIENT CHINA,

237
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,583
THE SHAOLIN USED TO
TRAIN WITH THESE.

238
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,833
SO I MADE ONE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

239
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,750
- SO HOW AM I, DOCTOR?

240
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,083
- THIS IS STRANGE.

241
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,083
THE SHAPE OF YOUR PUPIL
HAS CHANGED.

242
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,958
IT'S DIFFERENT
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

243
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,166
AND YOUR DRAGON ISN'T
SHOWING UP ON X-RAY ANYMORE.

244
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,041
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING ELSE IS
BLOCKING IT.

245
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,791
- ARE YOU SURE?

246
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,166
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING 
THAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THIS?

247
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,083
- ( both grunting )
- ( grunts )

248
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,333
- PROMISE YOU WILL LIVE
AS YOUR OWN HEART DESIRES.

249
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,125
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE.

250
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,041
SEE YA.

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,458
- MAYBE RYOFU DIDN'T VANISH
AFTER ALL.

252
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,166
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
SHE'S NOW A PART OF ME?

253
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,375
- HMM.

254
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,541
AND YOU STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW A DRAGON CAME TO BE 

255
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,333
IN YOUR LEFT EYE
TO BEGIN WITH?

256
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,166
IF I KNEW THAT,
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

257
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,708
WHAT'S CHANGED.

258
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,250
- I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH.

259
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,666
FALLEN FIGHTERS WERE
ON THE GROUND EVERYWHERE.

260
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,708
AND THEN THERE WAS
A HUGE BURST OF LIGHT.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,625
- OH, BY THE WAY,
HOW IS HE DOING LATELY?

262
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,833
I'VE HEARD HE STILL
HASN'T FULLY RECOVERED YET.

263
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,583
- HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.
BUT HE'S AT HOME NOW.

264
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,500
- SOME FIGHTERS FOLLOW
THEIR DESTINIES,

265
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,750
OTHERS FIGHT AGAINST
THEIR FATE.

266
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,583
OUR CURRENT SHISHI OUIN FOUGHT
HARD BY USING GENPOU SAJI.

267
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,166
HE GAVE HER NEARLY
EVERYTHING HE HAD.

268
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,583
THE GUY IS TOUGH.

269
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,500
- I'M PLANTING TO
 VISIT HIM TODAY.

270
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,708
- DON'T YOU MEAN
"AGAIN" TODAY?

271
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,666
- ( slightly gasps )

272
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,458
- AAH!
( grunts )

273
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,166
- COME ON, BACHIN!
KEEP UP!

274
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,208
AN EYE FOR AN EYE,
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH,

275
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,416
A HEAD FOR A HEAD.
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.

276
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,833
- A HEAD FOR A HEAD?

277
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,333
AAH!

278
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,541
( groans )

279
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,875
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  HUH?
- I'M FINE.

280
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,166
I CAN HANDLE IT.

281
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,583
- WHOA, WHAT THE HECK IS
THAT THING?

282
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,416
- COME ON!  HIT ME!

283
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,083
- ( shouts )

284
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,750
UH!  OH!

285
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,625
HOW DID SHE-- OH-HO-HO!

286
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,500
- HA-HA!

287
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,125
YOU MESSED UP, BACHIN.

288
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,166
WHEN YOU CUT THE FLESH,

289
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,583
YOU MUST ALSO CUT BONE.

290
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,958
- THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

291
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,416
- SON-STUPID-KU,
ARE YOU OUT HERE?

292
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,541
UH?

293
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,458
WHAT IS THAT?

294
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,083
- NO IDEA.  I WAS TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT MYSELF.

295
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,458
- DON'T BURN BRIDGES.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET HOME!

296
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,833
- RIGHT!
DON'T BURN BRIDGES!

297
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,625
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET HOME!

298
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
- IF YOU STRIKE AN IRON
WHEN IT'S HOT, IT'LL BURN YOU!

299
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,208
- IF I STRIKE AN IRON
WHILE IT'S HOT, IT'LL BURN ME!

300
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,625
- AND A STONE THAT'S ROLLING...

301
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,916
- GETS OUT OF MY WAY!

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,333
- IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE
TWO IDIOTS NOW.

303
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,208
- AN IMPERIAL LETTER?

304
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,041
READ IT TO US, RIKUSON.
TELL US WHAT IT SAYS.

305
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,708
- "IT IS HEREBY ANNOUNCED
THAT NANBAN HIGH SCHOOL

306
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,416
WILL BE HOSTING AN UPCOMING
TOURNAMENT FOR FIGHTERS.

307
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,833
THE PARTICIPATION OF
NANYO ACADEMY IS THUS REQUESTED.

308
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,875
THE LEADERS OF
ALL SCHOOLS COMPETING

309
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,875
MAY SELECT ONLY
TWO INDIVIDUAL FIGHTERS

310
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,083
TO REPRESENT THEIR SCHOOL
AT THE EVENT.

311
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,833
WE URGE THE CHOOSING
OF FEARSOME AND SKILLED WARRIORS

312
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,541
WORTHY OF THIS
IMPORTANT CONTEST."

313
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,958
- WHO ORGANIZED THIS EVENT?

314
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,833
- I'M NOT SURE.
IT SAYS KENTEI.

315
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,708
- Gakushu: BACK WHEN TOTAKU OF 
RAKUYO HIGH SCHOOL RULED KANTO,

316
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,125
HE CALLED HIMSELF EMPEROR,
BUT IT WASN'T SO.

317
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,833
THE TRUE IDENTITY OF KENTEI
REMAINS A MYSTERY.

318
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,250
- Koukin: MAYBE SOMEONE WAS
CALLING HIMSELF KENTEI

319
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,041
IN ORDER TO
GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION.

320
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,375
- IN THE PAST,

321
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,625
IT WAS FORBIDDEN FOR THOSE
WITHOUT IMPERIAL LINEAGE

322
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,666
TO USE THE TITLE "EMPEROR."

323
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,250
BUT THE TIME HAS COME
FOR US TO CHANGE HISTORY.

324
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,166
THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTERS,

325
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,291
THOSE WHO HAVE INHERITED THE
DESTINIES OF THE SACRED BEADS,

326
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,875
THERE IS BUT ONE
WHO CAN UNITE THEM.

327
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,166
AND I AM THE ONE.

328
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,041
- KENTEI DOES NOT EXIST.

329
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,041
LIKELY THIS IS JUST
A VERY AMBITIOUS CHARLATAN

330
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,833
WHO IS USING THE NAME
TO GET NOTICED.

331
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,291
- Kan'u: KENTEI WAS THE LAST
EMPEROR OF THE GOKAN DYNASTY.

332
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,125
- DURING THE ERA OF
THE THREE KINGDOMS,

333
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,541
SOSO ATTACKED KAN,
AND THEN HE KIDNAPPED KENTEI.

334
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,750
SOSO TRIED TO RULE THE WORLD
BY BECOMING KING OF WEI.

335
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,750
IT WAS THE PINNACLE,
THE HEIGHT OF SOSO'S REIGN,

336
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,708
AFTER WHICH HE FELL.

337
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,833
- WELL, WHOEVER THIS
PRETENDER REALLY IS...

338
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,625
I HAVE AN UNEASY FEELING
ABOUT THIS TOURNAMENT.

339
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,625
THIS MAY BE THE SPARK
THAT IGNITES

340
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,916
GREAT FIRES OF CHANGE
FOR ALL OF KANTO.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,541
- I FEEL VERY APPREHENSIVE
ABOUT THIS.

342
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,583
AS IF SOMEHOW IT WILL ALL
AFFECT MY DESTINY.

343
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,791
- Koumei:
AS YOUR STRATEGIST,

344
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,541
I AM GIVING YOU
AN OFFICIAL ORDER.

345
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,250
YOU WILL PARTICIPATE
IN THIS TOURNAMENT,

346
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,416
AND WHILE THERE,
GATHER DETAILS AND INFORMATION

347
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,875
ON ITS ORGANIZERS.

348
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,500
- Suikyo: BE CAREFUL.
TIME IS PRECIOUS.

349
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,500
AND IN YOUR CASE, IT WILL NOT
ALWAYS BE ON YOUR SIDE.

350
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,416
- Kan'u: I UNDERSTAND.

351
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,000
- AWESOME AWESOME!

352
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,583
THIS IS AWESOME!

353
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,833
- YOU SURE SEEM EXCITED,
MISS SOUJIN.

354
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,416
- WHY SHOULDN'T I BE EXCITED?

355
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,666
THERE HASN'T BEEN A TOURNAMENT
IN A LONG TIME.

356
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,666
- YEAH, BUT KYOSHO'S FORCES ARE
REALLY DEPLETED RIGHT NOW.

357
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,875
- RAKUSHIN, CHOUKOU AND JOKOU

358
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,625
ARE OFF MEDITATING
ON A MOUNTAIN SOMEWHERE.

359
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,458
KAKOUEN RETURNED TO HER HOME.

360
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,375
AND KAKOUTON IS INJURED.

361
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,791
WITHOUT HIS BEST FRIEND,

362
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,791
LORD SOUSOU PROBABLY ISN'T
GONNA PARTICIPATE EITHER.

363
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,958
- YOU IDIOT!

364
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,375
NUMBERS DON'T DECIDE A BATTLE.

365
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,958
WHAT REALLY COUNTS...

366
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,000
IS ABILITY.

367
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,791
- SHE SAYS IT'S ABILITY.

368
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,875
- ( scoffs )
- HOW MUCH HAS SHE GOT?

369
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,458
- ( groans )
- DUDE, SHUT UP!

370
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,833
- JACKASS!
HOW MANY LANDMINES

371
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,291
DO YOU INTEND TO STEP ON?!
- CALM DOWN!

372
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,958
PLEASE DON'T THROW THINGS!
- SHUT UP!

373
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,958
- SO, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
ABOUT THIS TOURNAMENT?

374
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,958
- I DON'T KNOW WHO
THESE GUYS REALLY ARE,

375
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,958
BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE JUST ANOTHER TEDIOUS GAME.

376
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,791
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

377
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,583
- I KNOW YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN,

378
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,041
BUT THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.
DON'T WASTE IT.

379
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,958
ISN'T IT TIME
WE SHOWED ALL OF KANTO

380
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,375
JUST HOW STRONG
KYOSHO REALLY IS?

381
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,708
HOW STRONG YOU ARE?

382
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,916
ALL OF KYOSHO'S HOPES
AND DREAMS

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,625
ARE PINNED SQUARELY
ON YOUR BACK.

384
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,583
WE KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
RULE IT ALL SOMEDAY.

385
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:36,000
IF YOU HAVE US FORFEIT,
EVERYONE WILL FEEL LET DOWN.

386
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,875
- DON'T BE DUMB-- KYOSHO'S
GOING TO THE TOURNAMENT.

387
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,416
BUT NOT YOU.
YOU'RE HURT.

388
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,125
- WOW, NO SHIT?!

389
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,333
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE GONNA GO?

390
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,750
- I WAS, BUT NOW I'M SLEEPY,
SO I FORFEIT.

391
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,375
- AW, FUCK YOU!

392
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,000
THIS IS NO TIME TO MAKE JOKES.
- ( laughs ) ALL RIGHT.

393
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,625
IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT, I
GUESS SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO GO.

394
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,625
- HEY HEY HEY,
LITTLE DISCIPLE!

395
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,625
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

396
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,291
- MASTER, PLEASE LET ME STOP!
I CAN'T DO IT!

397
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,625
- NOT A CHANCE.  IF YOU DON'T
ENTER THE TIGER'S DEN,

398
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,791
YOU CAN'T GET HIS SKIN
AND EARN YOUR STRIPES.

399
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,375
- ISN'T THAT QUOTE, "IF YOU
DON'T ENTER THE TIGER'S DEN,

400
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,833
THEN HOW CAN YOU
CATCH THE CUB?" 

401
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
- YOU'RE THINKING TOO MUCH!

402
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,541
DON'T THINK TOO MUCH!
UM, LET ME SEE...

403
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416
DON'T THINK,
BUT STILL THINK!

404
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,375
- YAH!

405
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,958
I GET IT!

406
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,875
( groans )

407
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,583
( weakly ) DON'T THINK,
BUT STILL THINK.

408
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,666
THAT'S DEEP.

409
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,500
- Rikuson: THAT'S WRONG.
THE SAYING IS:

410
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,375
"DON'T THINK, JUST FEEL."

411
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,208
- OH, IS THAT WHAT IT
REALLY IS?

412
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,416
I GUESS I MESSED UP.
- MASTER!

413
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,958
- ( giggles bashfully )
- ( growls )

414
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,000
- BY THE WAY,
WHAT'S EVERYONE DOING HERE?

415
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,375
WHAT?!

416
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,375
ME, I VOLUNTEER!

417
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,625
I'LL GO!  I'LL GO!

418
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,958
- I FIGURED AS MUCH.

419
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,583
WHO SHOULD OUR SECOND ONE BE?

420
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,333
- PERHAPS TO BE SAFE,
WE SHOULD ALL GO.

421
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,166
- Rikuson:
I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST THAT.

422
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,125
WE'D BE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

423
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,958
- Gakushu: YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT WE SHOULD STILL SEND

424
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,708
THE TWO BEST FIGHTERS WE HAVE.

425
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,500
- SAY, MASTER,
CAN YOU TELL ME IF

426
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,666
KYOSHO'S SOUSOU WILL BE
AT THE TOURNAMENT?

427
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,666
- OF COURSE!
IF I KNOW SOUSOU...

428
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,291
BUT I DON'T.
- ( all groan )

429
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,791
- I HOPE HE DOES COME.

430
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,208
GOING UP AGAINST A REALLY STRONG
OPPONENT MAKES YOU BETTER.

431
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,750
YOU GAIN EXPERIENCE
AND GROW STRONGER. 

432
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,166
- GAIN EXPERIENCE 
AND GROW STRONGER.

433
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,541
- Rikuson: LEADER SONSAKU,
PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL.

434
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,666
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS TOURNAMENT.

435
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,083
IT MAY NOT BE WHAT IT SEEMS.
- Koukin: SHE'S RIGHT.

436
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,875
AND YOUR BEING SUCH
A SCATTERBRAIN DOESN'T HELP.

437
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,083
- WHAT'S THE POINT IN
OVER THINKING AND WORRYING

438
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,291
BEFORE I GET THERE?
I AM, THEREFORE I DON'T THINK.

439
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,500
- Rikuson:
THAT QUOTE IS ALSO INCORRECT.

440
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,250
- Gakushu: SO WE HAVE SONSAKU.
WHO ELSE?

441
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,916
- IMPERIAL INVITATION TO
 A FIGHTERS' TOURNAMENT?

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,541
I SEE.
ALL RIGHT, THEN...

443
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,833
UM, NO.
IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD TIME.

444
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,666
ASK SOMEONE ELSE.
FINE, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

445
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,833
BYE.
- YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

446
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,833
- I HAVE A BAD FEELING.
- ABOUT WHAT?

447
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,708
- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DON'T
FEEL LIKE GOING THERE.

448
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,333
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?
- EVEN LOST IN THE DEEPEST,

449
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,166
DARKEST PART OF A MAZE,

450
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,208
A FIGHTER ALWAYS HAS AN ESCAPE

451
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,916
TO FIGHT THEIR WAY OUT.

452
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
- SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME
THAT BEFORE.

453
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,333
TEIFU DID.

454
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,541
- I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS.

455
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,083
DON'T READ INTO IT.
JUST KEEP IT FOR GOOD LUCK.

456
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,875
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

457
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,500
- HOPEFULLY I'LL BE
WELL ENOUGH TO COMPETE

458
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,291
IN THE NEXT BIG TOURNAMENT.

459
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,916
MAYBE WE COULD ENTER AS A DUO.

460
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,625
- THAT'S STUPID.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

461
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,500
I WILL GO AND I WILL WIN
THAT TOURNAMENT.

462
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,333
FOR YOUR SAKE.

463
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,708
- FOR MY SAKE,

464
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,083
PLEASE, MOU-CHAN,
JUST COME BACK ALIVE.

465
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,250
- ( seagulls squawking,
waves crashing )

466
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,875
- ( sighs )

467
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,875
- NO LUCK.
WE COULDN'T FIND HER.

468
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,416
- I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

469
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,208
HAKUFU LEFT BEFORE I DID.

470
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,666
WHERE COULD SHE POSSIBLY BE?

471
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,125
- FORGET ABOUT HER.
I CAN GO ALONE.

472
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,375
- ( vehicle approaching )

473
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,916
- HEY, SHUYUU.

474
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,333
WHY DON'T YOU GO
IN SONSAKU'S PLACE?

475
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,833
- WHAT?  ME?

476
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,958
ARE YOU SURE?

477
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,166
- ( train signal ringing )

478
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,958
- Announcer: KANDA! NOW
ARRIVING IN KANDA STATION.

479
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,958
- ALL RIGHT.
WAY TO GO, MOU-CHAN.

480
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,541
HIT HIM!
HIT HIM HARD!

481
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,375
ONE MORE KNOCKOUT
AND WE WIN!

482
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,875
( giggles )

483
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,250
MM.

484
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,583
- ( end theme playing )

485
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

486
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,916
- Hakufu:
AW, MAN, I REALLY MESSED UP.

487
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,416
I FELL ASLEEP
AND MISSED THE BOAT

488
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,625
TO THE BIG
FIGHTERS' TOURNAMENT.

489
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,250
THAT SUCKS!

490
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,041
WHAT I AM GONNA DO
STUCK BACK HERE?

491
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,333
I COULD HANG OUT WITH GAKU-CHAN,
BUT THAT'S BORING.

492
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,000
I KNOW!  I'LL GO VISIT CHUUBO!
THAT'LL BE FUN!

493
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,041
ALL THE OTHER FIGHTERS
AT THE TOURNAMENT

494
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,666
ARE GONNA BE SO DISAPPOINTED.

495
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,083
A BIG TOURNEY WITHOUT ME

496
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,916
IS LIKE A HAMBURGER
WITHOUT THE MEAT.

497
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,583
YEAH, YOU CAN STILL EAT IT,
BUT THE BEST PART IS MISSING.

498
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,416
NEXT TIME ON
"IKKI TOUSEN: XTREME XECUTOR,"

499
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,041
"THE DEVIL BECKONS."

500
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,500
NAH-NAH, NAH NAH NAH!
