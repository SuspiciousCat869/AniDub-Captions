1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,375
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:51,541
- ( Kan'u sighs )
SUCH FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP...

4
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,416
STOP IT! YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO STARE AT WEAPONRY.

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,541
( book closing )

6
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,708
- A PARTY FOR HER
NOW THAT SHE'S WELL?

7
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,166
I THINK GENTOKU
WILL LOVE IT!

8
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,916
- GLAD YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,875
I WANTED TO PERHAPS
GET HER A PRESENT TOO.

10
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,333
WHAT... DO YOU
THINK SHE'D LIKE?

11
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,500
- BOOKS!
THEY'RE A SAFE BET.

12
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,000
BUT NOT THOSE THICK ONES...

13
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,708
LIKE THE ONES WE HAVE
TO READ FOR CLASS.

14
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,750
WHY NOT GET HER SOMETHING FUN,
LIKE A NOVEL OR MANGA?

15
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,708
- BOOK, HUH?

16
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,291
SUCH A CUTE LITTLE BOOK.
I HOPE GENTOKU WILL LIKE IT.

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,458
- OH WOW!

18
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,791
I LOVE IT, KAN'U!
IT'S PERFECT!

19
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,125
THANKS SO MUCH! I COULDN'T
HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER GIFT.

20
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,791
I'M SO INCREDIBLY HAPPY!
- ( nervous chuckle )

21
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,125
- OH!

22
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,291
- GENTOKU...

23
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,208
- Woman: LOOK AT THAT GIRL!
- ( chuckling )

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
- DO YOU THINK
SHE'S ON DRUGS?

25
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,083
- Ekitoku: WOW, THAT
LOOKS EXPENSIVE. 

26
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,083
I CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT!
- GENTOKU, SORRY I'M LATE.

27
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,833
- Ekitoku: THIS ONE'S COOL.
CHECK IT OUT!

28
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,625
- OH HI, KAN'U!

29
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,083
LOOK AT ALL OF THIS!
EVERYONE GAVE ME SO MANY FLOWERS

30
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,000
AND PRESENTS IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY AGAIN!

31
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,000
WANNA SEE WHAT SHIRYUU GAVE ME?
IT'S A GIANT TEDDY BEAR!

32
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,500
- I WANTED TO GET YOU
SOMETHING BIG... AND CUTE!

33
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:21,208
- AND KOUCHUU GAVE ME A T-SHIRT
HE MADE HIMSELF.  IT'S ME!

34
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,333
- THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT.
IT'S CUTE.

35
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:29,416
- HOW SWEET. THAT WILL LOOK
GREAT ON YOU. THERE'S ONE MORE--

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,083
- Gentoku: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
IT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED!

37
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:32,958
- HUH?

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,958
- THANK YOU, KOUMEI.

39
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,291
I LOVE BIG THICK
ACADEMIC BOOKS.

40
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,875
I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM.
I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT!

41
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,791
- I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE THE PERFECT GIFT.

42
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,333
I KNOW WHAT GENTOKU LIKES.

43
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,250
- DON'T FORGET TO THANK KAN'U.
TODAY'S PARTY WAS HER IDEA.

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,000
SHE PLANNED IT ALL.
YOU GOT HER A GIFT TOO.

45
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,416
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU TOLD ME?

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,208
- I DID?

47
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,250
WELL, I MEANT TO GET SOMETHING,
BUT I RAN OUT OF TIME.

48
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,291
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO GET ME A GIFT, KAN'U.

49
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE SO MUCH.

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,750
I'M HAPPY JUST TO BE
FEELING BETTER

51
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,041
AND HAVE ALL OF MY FRIENDS
WITH ME TO CELEBRATE!

52
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,416
- IF YOU'RE HAPPY,
THEN SO AM I.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,375
- SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE BARBELL SET

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,791
I GAVE YOU FOR WEIGHTLIFTING?
PRETTY COOL, RIGHT?

55
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,000
- UH... IT'S GREAT.
IT WILL ALWAYS REMIND ME OF YOU!

56
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,208
- BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING
YOU WOULD ENJOY,

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,333
NOT THAT GENTOKU WOULD LIKE.
- WHAT THE-- ?

58
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,250
IT'S AN AWESOME GIFT!
IT'S USEFUL!

59
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,000
GENTOKU CAN BUILD UP MUSCLE
STRENGTH AND BE TONED AND FIT

60
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,166
LIKE A LEADER SHOULD BE!

61
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,833
- Chou'un: IT'S AN
EXCELLENT GIFT, CHOUHI.

62
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,750
OUR LEADER'S HEALTH
AND FITNESS ARE IMPORTANT.

63
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,166
- Kouchuu: I AGREE. YOU CAN DO
IT, LEADER! TONE THOSE LATS!

64
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,666
- THAT LAST DAY...
KENTEI SAID

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,500
HE WOULD BE REINCARNATED
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

66
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,041
UNTIL EVERY LAST FIGHTER

67
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,250
HAD BEEN WIPED FROM
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

68
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,750
- KAN'U, CHOUHI!

69
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,333
MASTER!
- BACHIN!

70
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,708
- Bachou: I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU!

71
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,625
- Koukin: HAKUFU!
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE OKAY!

72
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,708
- Hakufu: KOUKIN, I'M SORRY
FOR MAKING YOU WORRY.

73
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,791
- ( whimpering )

74
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,250
- LIGHTNING DRAGON THAT
LIVES WITHIN GENTOKU,

75
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,625
BE STILL
AND SLEEP ONCE MORE.

76
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,666
RELEASE YOUR ANGER!
GO BACK TO THE REALM OF SHADOWS

77
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,583
AND STAY HIDDEN THERE
FOREVER!

78
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,958
( screams )

79
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,875
- KAN'U!
( giggles )

80
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,458
- GENTOKU?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

81
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,666
- ( sighs )
NOTHING'S WRONG.

82
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,291
I JUST NOTICED THE
WEATHER WAS NICE,

83
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,708
SO I THOUGHT I'D READ OUTSIDE.

84
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,708
IT'S SO PEACEFUL. BY THE WAY,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

85
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,291
AFTER THE PARTY I FOUND A GIFT
THAT DIDN'T HAVE A NAME ON IT--

86
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,791
A CUTE LITTLE MANGA NOVEL.

87
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,750
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO
MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT?

88
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,208
- I-I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S
FROM ONE OF THE FRESHMEN.

89
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,541
- ARE YOU SURE?  'CAUSE
THAT ISN'T WHO I WOULD GUESS.

90
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,458
- IN THAT CASE,
I HAVE NO CLUE WHO IT'S FROM.

91
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,583
IS IT REALLY THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU?

92
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,458
- NO WORRIES.  I THINK I KNOW
WHO THE BOOK IS FROM ANYWAY. 

93
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,875
 AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT I'M RIGHT.

94
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,333
- I SEE.  MYSTERY SOLVED.

95
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,041
GOOD FOR YOU, GENTOKU.

96
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,791
- ( giggles )

97
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,041
THANK YOU FOR THE BOOK, KAN'U.
- ( gasps )

98
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,916
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT IT CAME FROM ME?!

99
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,541
- WE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BORN
ON THE SAME DAY...

100
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,166
- BUT WE BOND AS SISTERS...

101
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,416
- AND SOLEMNLY VOW THAT
WE WILL DIE TOGETHER.

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,041
- Gentoku: EVEN THOUGH
I WAS UNCONSCIOUS

103
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,833
I FELT LIKE I COULD
STILL HEAR YOU.

104
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,583
IT WAS AS IF YOU WERE
CALLING OUT TO ME

105
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,750
FROM FAR AWAY.
YOU KEPT SAYING...

106
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,875
"HOLD ON, MY FRIEND!"

107
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,416
I'M SORRY FOR ALL
THE TROUBLE I GET INTO

108
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,208
THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO SAVE ME FROM.

109
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,208
- I REALLY DON'T MIND.

110
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,458
YOU'RE MY FRIEND
AND THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

111
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,875
OH!

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
- YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR ME.

113
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,375
THANK YOU, KAN'U.
- MMM.

114
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,666
- THERE YOU ARE.
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO HAPPY?

115
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,583
WERE YOU GOSSIPING
ABOUT SOMETHING?

116
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,958
- Gentoku: HI, EKITOKU!
- I WAS THINKING WE COULD

117
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,833
KEEP THE PARTY GOING
AND HEAD INTO TOWN.

118
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,458
WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU UP FOR IT?
- SURE!  I'D LIKE THAT.

119
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,375
COME ON, KAN'U! THERE'S A NEW
BAKERY I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TRY.

120
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,750
I HEAR THEIR CUPCAKES
ARE DELICIOUS!

121
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,500
- THAT SOUNDS NICE.
WHY DON'T WE GO?

122
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,458
- HERE.
- HUH?

123
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,583
- A FAREWELL PRESENT.

124
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,666
- GUMMY SNACKS!

125
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,291
- I BOUGHT OUT EVERY SINGLE
STORE IN THIS ENTIRE AREA. 

126
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,083
- MASTER?!
( whimpers )

127
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
THIS IS THE BEST GIFT
I'VE EVER GOT!

128
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,625
- IF YOU EVER WANT
MORE TRAINING,

129
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,083
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME BACK AGAIN.

130
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,791
- I CAN HELP TEACH YOU
HOW TO WIN FIGHTS

131
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,500
WITH OPPONENTS WHO ARE
MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU. 

132
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,791
- AWESOME, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

133
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,125
THANK YOU FOR
OFFERING TO TEACH ME.

134
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,541
MASTER, CAN I ASK A
REQUEST OF YOU?

135
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,791
- HUH?

136
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,041
- I'M GOING TO STUDY 
AND TRAIN REALLY HARD

137
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,375
SO THAT ONE DAY
I CAN COME BACK

138
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,750
AND FACE YOU AS AN EQUAL.

139
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,375
WHEN THAT DAY COMES,
WILL YOU PROMISE

140
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,500
TO ACCEPT MY CHALLENGE?

141
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,833
- YEAH, SURE THING.

142
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,458
- WHOA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING?

143
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,541
- DON'T INTERFERE.

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,916
A STUDENT SHOULD AIM
TO SURPASS HER TEACHER.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.
- INDEED.

146
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,291
THAT IS THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.

147
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,791
SINCE SONSAKU IS A FIGHTER,

148
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,500
SHE CANNOT BACK DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE.

149
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,458
- THEN LET US MAKE 
THIS PACT TOGETHER.

150
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,083
ONE DAY, WE WILL FIGHT.

151
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,916
- I'M AFRAID HE'S STILL
RECOVERING FROM HIS ILLNESS.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,291
- I SEE.

153
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,541
THEN I'LL COME BACK
ON ANOTHER DAY.

154
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,166
- WHEN HE FIRST 
RETURNED HOME...

155
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,458
- UH...

156
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,333
- HE GAVE ME
A MESSAGE TO PASS ON.

157
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,625
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

158
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,541
- Shisonzui:
THE FUTURE ON NANYO

159
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,958
DEPENDS ON YOU,
SHIMEI RYOMOU. 

160
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,125
WORK WITH SONSAKU
TO BRING FORTH BRIGHTER DAYS.

161
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,875
- SAJI, NO MATTER WHAT
TRIALS MAY LIE AHEAD, 

162
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,500
I DON'T INTEND
TO LOSE ANYTHING,

163
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,083
NOT MYSELF OR ANYONE
I CARE ABOUT.

164
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,458
SO KEEP ON FIGHTING, SAJI.

165
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,458
I WON'T LET YOU GIVE UP.

166
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,000
- ( man running, grunting )

167
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,708
HEY, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!

168
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,416
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME
ALL THIS TIME.

169
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,083
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

170
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,583
- ( man screaming )

171
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,458
- ( footsteps )

172
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,083
- HEY, YOU.
ARE YOU THE BASTARD

173
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,041
WHO'S BEEN KILLING OFF
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS?!

174
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,416
- SAY SOMETHING!
WHAT'S WITH THAT WEIRD MASK?

175
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,541
- ( blasting )

176
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,125
- STOP, WHAT IS
YOUR PURPOSE HERE?

177
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,250
WHY ARE YOU
TARGETING KYOSHO?

178
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,583
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

179
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,583
I WILL FIGHT YOU
IF I MUST.

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,541
SPEAK.

181
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,416
SHE'S GONE.

182
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,583
- Koukin: ANOTHER
ATTACK ON KYOSHO?

183
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,250
- Rikuson:
EARLY REPORTS ARE SAYING

184
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,791
THEY'VE SUFFERED 
HEAVY CASUALTIES.

185
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,375
- Koukin:
NEITHER NANYO NOR SEITO

186
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,000
WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

187
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,875
SO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE?

188
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,125
- Rikuson: FACE IT, SHUUYU.
WE BOTH KNOW

189
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,708
WHO THE MOST
LIKELY SUSPECT IS.

190
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,583
- Koukin: WHO?
- Rikuson: MOUKI BACHOU!

191
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,125
SHE'S SWORN REVENGE
AGAINST SOUSOU.

192
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,750
SHE CLAIMS HE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER.

193
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,000
- Koukin: I WAS AWARE
OF HER PRIOR ATTACK, 

194
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,583
BUT I DON'T
THINK IT'S HER.

195
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,875
- BACHOU ISN'T THE ONE
WHO ATTACKED KYOSHO.

196
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,041
- ( both gasps )

197
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,583
- IT'S SOMEONE UNKNOWN.

198
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,416
WHOEVER IT IS,
HE'S THREATENING NANYO AS WELL.

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,208
- Koukin:
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

200
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,375
- Gakushu: WE FOUND IT LIKE THIS
JUST THIS MORNING.

201
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,625
THE PERSON WHO DID THIS

202
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,083
IS FRIGHTENINGLY SKILLED.

203
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,916
- THIS IS BAD.
WE MIGHT BE IN REAL DANGER.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,250
- ( leaves rustle )
- WHO'S THERE?!

205
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,708
- ( meows )

206
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,541
- AH, CHIBI!
( giggles ) 

207
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,041
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE.
- ( meows )

208
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE ALONE?

209
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,916
BE CAREFUL.
THE BOOGEYMAN'LL GET YOU.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,750
SCARY, SCARY.

211
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,333
- ( meows )

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,833
- ( distant chatter )

213
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,208
- SORRY I COULDN'T
KILL SOUSOU

214
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,041
AND AVENGE YOUR DEATH,
BIG BRO'.

215
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,000
I HOPE YOU WON'T
HOLD IT AGAINST ME.

216
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
- Man #1: THAT PUNK
WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!

217
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,333
- HUH?

218
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,125
- Man #2: DAMN RIGHT! I'M GONNA
BEAT HIS ASS INTO THE GROUND.

219
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,375
- LET'S TAKE HIM OUT!
- Both: YEAH!

220
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,583
- WHAT'S UP WITH THOSE GUYS?

221
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,750
THEY'RE ALL RILED UP
ABOUT SOMETHING.

222
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,583
COULD IT BE
ANOTHER BATTLE?!

223
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,666
COUNT ME IN!

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,333
( running footsteps )

225
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,875
- Man #2: ( in pain )
WHERE'RE YOU FROM?!

226
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,250
YOU PUT YOU UP TO THIS?!

227
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,416
WHY ARE YOU
TARGETING KYOSHO?

228
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
- ( thudding )
- ( grunting )

229
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,458
- OH, WOW.

230
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,791
IT'S A TOTAL MASSACRE.

231
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,250
- ( groans )
BEHIND YOU.

232
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,291
HEY, WHO ARE YOU?!

233
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,958
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE WEIRD GETUP?!

234
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,208
A FIGHTER WITH TWO SWORDS!

235
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,333
HEY, WAIT A SEC.

236
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,833
DAMN IT!  DON'T RUN AWAY!

237
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,541
- Kan'u: WHAT IS THE REASON
THAT WE FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT?

238
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,833
WE FIGHT BECAUSE WE SHARE
A DREAM FOR THE FUTURE,

239
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,958
TO IMPROVE OUR WORLD.

240
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,708
WITHOUT SUCH PURPOSE,
FIGHTING IS WRONG.

241
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,333
AND YET THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN WE MUST FIGHT AND DIE

242
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,833
FOR THE SAKE
OF THAT DREAM.

243
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,875
BUT THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN WE SHOULD

244
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,291
SHEATH OUR WEAPONS
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

245
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,291
THIS WAY--
THE WAY OF PEACE--

246
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,166
IS THE WILL
OF GENTOKU RYUUBI.

247
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,541
- Koumei: THE TIDE 
OF ANY NATION TENDS

248
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,250
TO FLOW TOWARDS UNITY AFTER
PERIODS OF DEEP DIVISION,

249
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,208
AND TOWARDS DIVISION
WHEN THERE ARE

250
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,166
MOMENTS OF NATIONAL UNITY.

251
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,458
IT IS A NEVER-ENDING CYCLE
OF WARFARE AND PEACE

252
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,583
THAT HISTORY REPEATS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

253
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,791
BUT SHE WOULD
BREAK THE CYCLE.

254
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,041
GENTOKU'S WISH IS THAT 
WE WOULD FIGHT NO MORE.

255
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,500
- IF THE DAY SHOULD COME

256
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,125
WHEN WE ARE
NO LONGER FIGHTERS

257
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,833
AND THE SACRED BEADS
DON'T EXIST,

258
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:41,958
OUR BONDS OF SISTERHOOD
AND FRIENDSHIP WILL REMAIN.

259
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,125
THEY WILL CONNECT US FOREVER.

260
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,541
- Ekitoku: TAKE THAT!
- WHOA! ( grunts )

261
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,625
- WANT TO GIVE UP
AND CALL IT QUITS FOR THE DAY?

262
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,625
- ( strains ) NO!

263
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,625
I WANT TO KEEP GOING.

264
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,791
TODAY I'M GOING
TO KNOCK

265
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,083
YOU TO THE MAT FOR ONCE.

266
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,666
AND WE CAN'T STOP
UNTIL I DO.

267
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,416
- NICE!  THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

268
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,250
OKAY, THEN COME AT ME
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

269
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,583
TOO SLOW!
- OWW!

270
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,791
I WASN'T READY YET.

271
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,791
- THIS ONE
AND THIS ONE TOO.

272
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,666
OH, AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE
I HAVEN'T READ YET.

273
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,750
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER
ON A RAINY DAY

274
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,000
THAN CURLING UP
WITH A GOOD BOOK.

275
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,666
OH, WAIT A SEC.

276
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,333
I WONDER IF I SHOULD
GET ANOTHER BOOK

277
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,416
FOR KAN'U TO READ.

278
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,583
HUH?

279
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,750
( gasps )

280
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,125
- ( grunts )

281
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,041
- MA-CHAN, HOW--

282
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,166
- STAY BACK, MISS GENTOKU.

283
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,375
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT.

284
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,166
- ( both scream )

285
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,791
( groaning )

286
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,416
- OWW, THAT HURTS
MY BOTTOM.

287
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,583
- WHOA, THINK THAT
YOU CAN STAND UP?

288
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,583
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M FINE.

289
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,583
- ( gasping )

290
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,916
( screams )

291
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,500
- NO, RUN, MA-CHAN!

292
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,958
I CAN'T, MISS GENTOKU.
I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU.

293
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,500
HURRY, GO TO KAN'U!

294
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,541
I'VE BEEN TAILING
THIS MASKED FIGHTER

295
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,666
EVER SINCE I SAW HER
AMBUSH A GANG IN TOWN.

296
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,416
HER METHODS ARE
RUTHLESS AND CRUEL.

297
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,958
NO, GO! GET AWAY!
- BUT, MA-CHAN--

298
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,875
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL STOP HER.

299
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,041
SHE WILL NOT
GET PAST ME!

300
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,708
- MA-CHAN...

301
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,333
- Kan'u: GENTOKU,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

302
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,458
- KAN'U, EKITOKU, COME QUICK!

303
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,333
MA-CHAN'S LIFE
IS IN DANGER! 

304
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,500
- Ekitoku: WHAT'S WRONG?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER?

305
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,291
- Kan'u: CALM DOWN.
TELL US WHAT WENT ON.

306
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,083
- SHE JUMPED IN
TO PROTECT ME.

307
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,833
AND NOW SHE'S FIGHTING 
AND I'M SCARED FOR HER.

308
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,083
- ( grunts )

309
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,625
( screams )

310
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,833
( pants )

311
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,708
- I WILL NEVER DIE.
I AM IMMORTAL.

312
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,083
- THAT VOICE!

313
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,791
YOU'RE THAT MONSTER!

314
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,333
UNTIL I HAVE
MY DESIRED VENGEANCE,

315
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,666
I WILL COME BACK
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

316
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,916
- YOUR VENGEANCE?

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,833
- IT SEEMS I HAVE
FOUND A KINDRED SPIRIT.

318
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,000
- ( gasps )

319
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,291
- THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE
BURNS INSIDE YOU.

320
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,958
- WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE!
- BUT WE ARE.

321
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,166
I CAN PEER DEEP 
INSIDE YOUR SOUL

322
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,333
TO WHERE IT SEETHES
WITH DESIRE

323
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,250
TO AVENGE YOUR
OLDER BROTHER'S DEATH.

324
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,416
IT STILL BURNS IN YOU.

325
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,458
- THAT'S A LIE.
YOU CAN'T READ MY SOUL.

326
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,041
- DOES THAT MEAN THAT
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN HIM?

327
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,791
THAT HE MEANT
SO LITTLE TO YOU

328
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,416
THAT YOU JUST ERASED HIM
FROM YOUR MEMORY?

329
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,083
EVER SINCE YOUR BROTHER
WAS MURDERED,

330
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,250
HIS SPIRIT HAS BEEN
UNABLE TO REST.

331
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,083
HE SUFFERS IN PURGATORY

332
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,875
AND CRIES OUT TO YOU
TO SAVE HIM!

333
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,416
"HELP ME, SISTER,"
HE WAILS.

334
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,666
"AVENGE MY DEATH."
- HE SAID THAT?

335
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,541
- YOU HAVE OFTEN WONDERED
HOW YOUR BROTHER DIED.

336
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,541
SHALL I SHOW YOU?
- ( gasping )

337
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,958
- WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

338
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,000
WHO ARE Y-- WAIT, I KNOW YOU.

340
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,500

00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,125
- KANSUI!  NO!

342
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,875
- GET JUSTICE
FOR YOUR BROTHER.

343
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,458
JOIN WITH ME.

344
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,000
AND I WILL HELP YOU ATTAIN
THE VENGEANCE YOU SEEK.

345
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,666
REVENGE IS POWERFUL.

346
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,333
USE IT WITH ME.

347
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,083
- Sousou: DON'T SUCCUMB
TO THE DARKNESS,

348
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,375

- ( sighs )

351
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,791
IS SOMEONE THERE?

352
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,083
- YOU WERE
AS I WAS IN THE PAST.

353
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,875
RAGE SUMMONS NEGATIVE POWERS.

354
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,125
THE NIGHTMARES
GO ON FOREVER.

355
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,500
- ( strains )
- ALL THAT LIES BEYOND

356
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,125
IS A TRAGEDY THAT
LEADS YOU TO DESTRUCTION.

357
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:42,916
REMEMBER THAT WELL
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN.

358
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,583
- YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE.

359
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,875
THANK GOODNESS.
- HOW DID--

360
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,208

WAS GONE WHEN WE GOT THERE.

361
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,875
WE FOUND YOU PASSED OUT
AND BROUGHT YOU HERE.
