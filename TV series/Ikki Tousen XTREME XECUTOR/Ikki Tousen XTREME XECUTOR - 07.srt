1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,041
- Mouyuu: GENTOKU RYUUBI.

4
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,791
- BE HONEST WITH ME.

5
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,750
THIS IS ALL KENTEI'S DOING,
ISN'T IT?

6
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,000
- WITHOUT A DOUBT.

7
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,708
IT'S HIM.

8
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,875
HE CAN CONTROL ANIMALS
USING HIS MIND.

9
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,708
- Ryuubi:
WHAT HAPPENED, KOUMEI?

10
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,791
I'M CONFUSED.
HOW COME I'M HERE NOW?

11
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,416
- GENTOKU, I'M SORRY,

12
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,541
BUT THERE'S NO TIME
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

13
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,708
WE HAVE TO LEAVE HERE
IMMEDIATELY.

14
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,583
- Shiryu: STRATEGIST.
- HUH?

15
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,541
I WILL REMAIN HERE AND KEEP
THAT PACK OF WOLVES AT BAY.

16
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,625
YOU AND KOUCHUU MUST
ESCAPE WITH OUR LEADER

17
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,291
BY FLEEING INTO
THE FOREST.

18
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,708
- ESCAPE?

19
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,708
ARE THE BATTLES
STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN?

20
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,125
I CAN'T RUN AWAY.

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,916
I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD BE FIGHTING.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
- BUT YOU CANNOT.

23
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,875
I KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP,
BUT YOU MUSTN'T USE YOUR POWERS.

24
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,166
IF YOUR DRAGON AWAKENS,
THEN EVERYBODY WILL SUFFER.

25
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,333
- Ryuubi: BUT YOUR LIVES
ARE ALL IN DANGER.

26
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,416
I CAN'T JUST DO NOTHING.

27
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,208
- Mouyuu: I'LL HELP YOU.

28
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,916
I'LL ACCOMPANY YOU AS YOU 
ESCAPE THROUGH THE FOREST.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,833
IF WE MEET DAIOU BOKUROKU,

30
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,666
I'LL TELL HIM THE ATTACK
HAS BEEN CALLED OFF.

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,083
- WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?

32
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,750
YOU TRIED TO KILL
OUR LEADER.

33
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,166
- YOU SPARED MY LIFE.
I OWE YOU A DEBT.

34
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,708
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO REPAY IT.

35
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,750
AS A LEADER OF NANBAN
AND A FIGHTER,

36
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,125
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

37
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,541
- ( sighs )

38
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,375
OH, THANK YOU FOR HELPING US.

39
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,166
- LEADER,

40
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
PROTECT HER, MOUYUU, 
FOR ALL OF OUR SAKES.

41
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,291
KOUCHUU!
- ( gasps )

42
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,958
- TAKE OUR LEADER
AND RUN FOR IT.

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,791
MOUYUU, I AM TRUSTING YOU,

44
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,416
ONE FIGHTER TO ANOTHER.

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,458
- ( wolves growl )

46
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,125
- ( gasps )

47
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,791
WAIT!  HOLD UP.

48
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,541
- ( gasps )
- THEY'RE GONE.

49
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,625
SOMETHING HIT ME
AND MY GLASSES FELL OFF.

50
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,833
- Kouchuu: LEADER,

51
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,166
DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT
WHERE YOU LOST THEM?

52
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,791
- Ryuubi: UM, SOMEWHERE
BACK IN THE TREES I THINK.

53
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,375
- ( gasps )

54
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,750
( gasps )

55
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,250
- Kentei: WELL DONE, MOUYUU.

56
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,250
- ( all gasp )

57
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,458
- I WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR HAVING
PREVIOUSLY FAILED ME TWICE.

58
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,125
- WHAT IS THAT?
IS IT A GHOST? 

59
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,416
- NO.  I THINK IT'S KENTEI.

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,250
- Kentei:
NOW TAKE RYUUBI'S HEAD.

61
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,458
DO IT.  THEN YOU WILL HAVE
CONQUERED KANTO FOR NANBAN HIGH.

62
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,416
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

63
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
TAKE IT.
BATHE IN THE LIMELIGHT

64
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,875
OF GLORY AND CONQUEST.

65
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,416
- SAY SOMETHING, MOUYUU.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,833
- YOU LIED TO US.

67
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,416
YOU LED US INTO A TRAP.

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,583
- KOUMEI,
SHE GAVE US HER WORD.

69
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,833
SHE SWORE AS A FIGHTER AND AS
A LEADER OF A RIVAL HIGH SCHOOL.

70
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,291
SHE DIDN'T LIE.
I TRUST HER.

71
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,125
- Kentei: HOW NAIVE.
- ( gasps )

72
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,375
- Kentei: IN THE TIME
OF THE THREE KINGDOMS

73
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,291
1800 YEARS AGO,

74
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,875
MANY FORMIDABLE WARRIORS
UNITED TO SERVE UNDER

75
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,458
GENTOKU RYUUBI,

76
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,250
BUT IN THE END
THEY ALL FELL.

77
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,708
ALL OF IT WAS FOR NOTHING.

78
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,875
SURELY YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN

79
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,375
WHO ACTUALLY ENDED UP
WINNING IN THE END?

80
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,208
- IT CAN'T BE.

81
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,291
- WHAT USE IS A HUMAN HEART
TO A FIGHTER?

82
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,958
ALL A FIGHTER NEEDS TO TRUST
IS HIS OWN STRENGTH.

83
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,875
NOW KILL HER.

84
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,625
- LEADER, STAY BEHIND ME.

85
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,458
- GENTOKU RYUUBI,
I CHALLENGE YOU. 

86
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,666
I WISH TO FACE YOU
AND THE CHAMPIONS OF SEITO

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,000
IN A FAIR FIGHT.

88
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,083
IN ORDER TO MEET MY CHALLENGE,

89
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,666
IT IS NECESSARY
FOR YOU TO REMAIN ALIVE.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,750
- ( gasps )

91
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,333
BUT MOUYUU...

92
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,541
- I WILL NOW RETURN TO NANBAN
TO GATHER MY TROOPS.

93
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,916
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NO ONE KILLS HER. 

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,916
- AS I PREDICTED.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,875
FIGHTERS ARE INDEED
FOOLISH CREATURES. 

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,916
- ( all gasp )

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,541
- ( murmurs )
- IT'S HIM.

98
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,250
- ( chuckles )

99
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,625
THESE TINY CUTE SPECS
MAKE EVERYTHING BIGGER.

100
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,541
- ( gasps )
THOSE ARE MY GLASSES.

101
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,916
EXCUSE ME--
BEGGING YOUR PARDON,

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,750
BUT COULD I PLEASE
HAVE THEM BACK?

103
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,958
- ( chuckles )

104
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,375
I THINK I'LL TRY THESE ON

105
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,958
AND SEE HOW THEY FIT.

106
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,083
- ( glasses crack )
- OOPS.

107
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,541
( chuckles )
THEY BROKE.

108
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,833
I GUESS THEY'RE TOO SMALL.

109
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,833
- HOW COULD YOU?

110
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,541
- YOU'VE ALWAYS 
BEEN AN ASSHOLE.

111
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,625
- WHO IS THIS PERSON
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

112
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,125
- HE'S A THIRD YEAR 
STUDENT FROM NANBAN.

113
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,208
DAIOU BOKUROKU.

114
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,541
- ( chuckles )
KEEP OUT OF THIS, MOUYUU.

115
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,958
DON'T TRY TO CONVINCE ME
YOU'VE HAD SOME CHANGE OF HEART

116
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,541
AND BECOME A GOODY TWO-SHOES.

117
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,958
YOU'VE BEEN A BAD GIRL
UP TO THIS POINT.

118
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,958
YOU'RE BAD TO THE CORE.
- ( gasps )

119
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,875
- YOU'RE RIGHT. 
I AM A BAD GIRL.

120
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,333
- HUH?

121
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,208
- BUT FIRST,
I'M A FIGHTER!

122
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,916
- ( grunts )

123
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,208
- ( chuckles )

124
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,291
- ( gasps )

125
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:16,958
( grunts )

126
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,791
- ( growls )

127
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,541
- Bashoku: ARE YOU OKAY?

128
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,583
- Shiryu: BASHOKU.

129
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,750
- SORRY I'M SO LATE.

130
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,541
- ( grunting )

131
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,000
- ( grunts )

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,583
- COME ON, WE SHOULD GO.

133
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,125
- I'LL HOLD HIM OFF.

134
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,791
- BUT-- 
- HURRY!

135
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,375
- BE CAREFUL.

136
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,000
- YOU KEEP SWITCHING SIDES
AND CHANGING TACTICS.

137
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,916
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY YOUR STUPID GAMES.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,041
FIRST I'LL TAKE DOWN
SEITO'S LEADER,

139
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,208
THEN I'LL HEAD TO NANYO
AND CRUSH THEIR SO-CALLED

140
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,458
LITTLE CONQUEROR,
HAKUFU SONSAKU.

141
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,291
ONCE I'VE BEATEN THAT BITCH,
KENTEI WILL MAKE ME THE LEADER

142
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,458
OF NANBAN HIGH,
AND ALL ITS FIGHTERS.

143
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,041
- NANBAN IS A STRONG SCHOOL.

144
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,291
THEY DON'T NEED KENTEI 
TO FIGHT THEIR BATTLES.

145
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,791
CAN'T YOU SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

146
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,458
- ( laughs )

147
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,083
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
NOT SEEING CLEARLY. 

148
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,250
I DON'T CARE IF I LIE,
CHEAT, OR STEAL,

149
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,833
AS LONG AS I GET
WHAT I WANT,

150
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,625
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT COUNTS...

151
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,541
THAT I WIN!
( grunts ) 

152
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,083
- ( shouts )

153
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,958
- ( grunts )

154
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,666
- ( gasps )
- GENTOKU, YOU CAN'T STOP!

155
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,666
- KOUMEI, I CAN'T RUN.

156
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,083
I CAN'T JUST ABANDON THEM.

157
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,833
I'M A LEADER.

158
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,916
HOW CAN I SIT BACK
AND WATCH?

159
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,166
I CAN'T.
WHAT IF THEY DIED FOR ME?

160
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,083
( sighs )

161
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,125
- YOUR COMPASSION
IS ADMIRABLE, GENTOKU.

162
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,375
BUT YOU ARE A LEADER,

163
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,791
AND THAT MEANS YOU ARE
MORE THAN JUST YOURSELF.

164
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,708
- YOU ARE THE BANNER
FLYING IN THE WIND

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,291
OVER A BATTLEFIELD.

166
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,541
FIGHTERS LOOK TO YOU FOR HOPE.

167
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:10,041
KAN'U, CHOUHI,
CHOU'UN,

168
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,375
KOUCHUU, AND MOUKI BACHOU TOO.

169
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,125
THEY WERE ALL 
UNITED BY YOU.

170
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,500
ACROSS TIME AND SPACE,
YOU SHOWED THEM THE WAY.

171
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,541
EVEN THAT FIGHTER
FROM NANBAN.

172
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,291
YOU INSPIRED HER,
GENTOKU.

173
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,458
DID YOU REALIZE THAT?
BECAUSE OF YOU,

174
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,041
SHE FINALLY UNDERSTANDS
THE REASON WHY SHE FIGHTS.

175
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,291
- ( chuckles )
- WELL...

176
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,875
READY TO SURRENDER?

177
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,708
- ( spits )
- ( gasps )

178
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,291
- THEY MAY DIE FOR YOU,

179
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,291
BUT YOU MUST LEARN 
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

180
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,916
BE STRONG. YOUR POWER
PROTECTS AND SERVES EVERYONE.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,583
LET EVERYONE ALSO
PROTECT AND SERVE YOU.

182
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,000
- ( gasps )
UH-HUH.

183
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,000
- ( all gasp )

184
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,750
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BRIDGE? 

185
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,000
- THE ENEMY ANTICIPATED
WE'D COME THIS WAY.

186
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,333
THEY CUT OFF OUR ESCAPE.

187
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,750
- WHAT DO WE DO?

188
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,583
SHOULD WE CLIMB DOWN
INTO THE CANYON?

189
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,500
- AT THE BOTTOM IS
A RIVER WITH RAPIDS.

190
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,083
EVEN IF WE MADE IT DOWN,

191
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
CROSSING WOULD BE
VERY DANGEROUS.

192
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,500
- WE CAN CROSS.
I'LL FIND A PLACE

193
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,458
WHERE THE WATER'S LOW.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,625
- ( all gasp )

195
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,583
- ( wincing )

196
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,000
- Ryuubi: MOUYUU.

197
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,708
YOU SACRIFICED
YOURSELF FOR ME.

198
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,250
- GENTOKU, BACK AWAY.
- BUT SHE'S INJURED. 

199
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,125
- ( all gasp )

200
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,791
- ( chuckles )

201
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,458
IT SEEMS WE MEET AGAIN, 
LEADER OF SEITO ACADEMY.

202
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,333
- YOU'RE A MONSTER.

203
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,791
- YOU LOOK VERY HOT
WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY. 

204
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,458
PITY I WON'T
GET TO ENJOY IT.

205
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,000
YOU'LL BE CRYING
BEFORE LONG.

206
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,208
YOU'LL BE BROKEN
AND BLEEDING

207
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,625
AND BEGGING ME TO KILL YOU
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

208
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,750
- ( gasps )

209
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,791
- MY TURN!
- WHO ARE YOU?

210
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,958
( grunts )

211
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,791
( chuckles )
- ( screams )

212
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,208
- STOP IT!
STOP HURTING HIM.

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,375
- KOUCHUU!

214
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,458
- ( grunts )
- ( Daiou chuckles )

215
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,791
PATHETIC.

216
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,958
- DON'T HURT HIM! I'M
BEGGING YOU. ( gasps )

217
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,416
- MORON.  DON'T BUTT IN.

218
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,208
NOW THEN... 
( chuckles )

219
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,250
- Ryuubi: WHY?

220
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,125
WHY?

221
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,083
- ( chuckles )

222
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,541
- WHY?!

223
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,416
- GENTOKU!

224
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,875
NO, YOU MUSTN'T!

225
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,833
- ( laughing )

226
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,083
- ( screams )

227
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,458
- WHERE DID SHE GO?

228
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,833
I WAS GONNA
RIP HER HEAD OFF.

229
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,833
( gasps, grunts )

230
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,333
- ( gasps )

231
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,750
( gasps )

232
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,166
- DAMN IT.

233
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,208
WHO THE HELL IS
THIS CHICK IN THE WATER?

234
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,666
- YOU RAT BASTARD!

235
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,500
GUYS WHO PICK ON GIRLS
WHO'VE LOST THEIR GLASSES

236
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,708
ARE THE LOWEST SCUM!

237
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,541
I WON'T LET YOU DO THAT.

238
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,916
I'M THE SHOU HAOU OF NANYO!

239
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,333
( giggles )
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT.

240
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,916
- NO WAY.
YOU'RE SONSAKU?

241
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,541
HUH?

242
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,250
- HI THERE.
GUESS YOU DON'T LIKE

243
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,916
PICKING ON SOMEONE
YOUR OWN SIZE.

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO LEARN WHY.

245
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,583
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!

246
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,500
( grunts )

247
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,833
( yells )

248
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,250
( grunts )

249
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,666
- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
MY NAME IS...

250
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,791
GAKUSHU!

251
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,750
- UM, I THINK HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
- HMM?

252
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,833
- RYUU-CHAN.

253
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,958
RYUU-CHAN,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

254
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,250
- ( groans )

255
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,791
- WAKE UP.
IT'S HAKUFU.

256
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,708
OPEN YOUR EYES 
AND LOOK AT ME.

257
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,125
- THAT'S THE ONE?

258
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,625
SHE'S THE LITTLE CONQUEROR?

259
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,208
- ( moans )

260
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,583
( gasps )

261
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,375
- THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE AWAKE.

262
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,375
I'M SO RELIEVED.
YOU REALLY HAD ME GOING THERE.

263
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,708
I ONLY DROPPED BY TO ASK
IF YOU'D HEARD FROM THE FIGHTERS

264
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,625
AT THE TOURNAMENT,
AND SUDDENLY THERE YOU WERE

265
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,708
ABOUT TO FALL INTO A CANYON.
- ( panting )

266
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,958
- Kentei: AWAKEN.

267
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,291
I WILL GRANT YOU
THE ULTIMATE POWER

268
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,125
SO YOU CAN DESTROY THEM.

269
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,791
- ( growls )

270
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,208
( screams )

271
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,791
- ( sighs )
SONSAKU.

272
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,208
- ( giggles )
- ( yelling )

273
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,791
- ( gasps )

274
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,708
- ( shouts )

275
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,208
- ( gasps )

276
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,916
- ( crying )

277
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,375
YOU'RE SAFE NOW,
SONSAKU.

278
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,791
- I AM, RYUU-CHAN.

279
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,791
- I'M SO RELIEVED.

280
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,750
( shouts )

281
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,416
( grunts )

282
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,750
- ( all gasp )

283
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,041
- Hakufu:
WHAT'S WRONG WITH RYUU-CHAN?

284
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,666
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

285
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,750
- IT IS A PARADOX.

286
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,083
THE POWERFUL DRAGON THAT
SLEEPS INSIDE GENTOKU AWAKENED

287
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,750
TO PROTECT HER FRIENDS.

288
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,125
BUT HER KINDLY NATURE WAS 
HORRIFIED BY THE VIOLENCE.

289
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,083
HER PURE HEART ATTEMPTED
TO RESTRAIN THE DRAGON, 

290
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,916
AND THE OPPOSING FORCES
CLASHED INSIDE HER.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,083
THE ENERGY FROM SUCH
AN INTENSE CONFLICT 

292
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,500
RAGING INSIDE HER

293
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,500
HAS FORMED A PARADOX
IN GENTOKU

294
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,708
MAKING HER APPEAR
TO TURN TO STONE.

295
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,500
- Mouyuu: LAYING DOWN
YOUR LIFE FOR YOUR FRIENDS,

296
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,083
OR FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

297
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,375
A BOND OF HONOR
AMONGST FIGHTERS.

298
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,875
VALUES LIKE THIS WERE TOTALLY
FOREIGN TO US AT NANBAN.

299
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,166
- Hakufu: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

300
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,500
WHAT MATTERS IS RYUU-CHAN.
HOW DO WE MAKE HER WELL AGAIN?

301
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,833
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHAT? YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

302
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,125
- I CAN'T KNOW
WHAT I DON'T KNOW.

303
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,541
BUT IF THERE IS
ANYONE AT ALL

304
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,541
WHO COULD POSSIBLY
SAVE GENTOKU--

305
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,250
- TELL ME,
WHO COULD SAVE HER?

306
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,958
- Suikyou:
HER BEST CHANCE WOULD BE--

307
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,166
- IT'S KAN'U, ISN'T IT?

308
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,958
- YES.
KAN'U HELPED ONCE BEFORE

309
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,708
WHEN GENTOKU'S DRAGON
AWAKENED.

310
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,958
SHE AND HER
GREEN DRAGON BLADE FOUGHT IT

311
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,500
AND PUT IT BACK TO SLEEP.

312
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,458
PERHAPS GENTOKU'S DRAGON
CAN ONLY BE QUIETED

313
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,291
BY ONE WHO IS
HER SWORN SISTER.

314
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,875
IT IS POSSIBLE 
THEIR DESTINIES

315
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,375
MEANT FOR THEM
TO TAKE THAT OATH.

316
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,666
- PLEASE, MASTER SUIKYOU,

317
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,125
TELL ME WHAT I MUST DO. I WOULD
LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR OUR LEADER.

318
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,416
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE HASTY, SHIRYU.

319
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,250
- ( gasps )
- I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.

320
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,166
IT IS YOUR JOB
TO FIND KAN'U,

321
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,000
AND BRING HER BACK HERE.

322
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,416
THIS IS SOMETHING ONLY YOU 
WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH.

323
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,416
DON'T FORGET THAT.
AND DON'T FAIL ME.

324
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,250
- I WON'T.

325
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,750
- Mouyuu:
I'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY.

326
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,208
- ( gasps )
- ( door opens )

327
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,541
- I'LL TAKE YOU TO NANBAN.

328
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,791
- ( Bachou grunting )

329
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,500
( sighs )

330
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,833
OF ALL THE RIDICULOUS PLACES

331
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,000
THEY COULD PUT A SCHOOL.

332
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,166
WHOSE CRAZY IDEA WAS IT TO
BUILD IT ON THE TOP OF A CLIFF?

333
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,625
( panting )

334
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,208
( sighs )

335
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,541
STILL SUCH A LONG WAY
TO THE TOP.

336
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,375
WATCH ME, MASTER SONSAKU.

337
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,375
I'M GONNA PUT ALL THAT
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME TO GOOD USE.

338
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,375
I'LL RESCUE EVERYONE
AND MAKE NANBAN PAY THE PRICE

339
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
WHILE I'M AT IT.
( chuckles )

340
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,208
OHH?

341
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,166
- ( grunting )

342
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,208
- ( scoffs )
OH YEAH?

343
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,708
WELL, I'M GONNA 
GET THERE FIRST.

344
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,208
( grunts )

345
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,625
( yelps )

346
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,791
( chuckles nervously )

347
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,166
( screams )
- ( gasps )

348
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,625
- ( grunts )

349
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,000
( cries )

350
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,708
( sighs )

351
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,166
- Kyocho: ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

352
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,666
I DIDN'T FALL THAT FAR.

353
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,333
THOUGH I DID GET
THE SHIT SCARED OUT OF ME,

354
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,750
AND MY LIFE SHORTENED
BY A COUPLE OF YEARS.

355
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,250
( screams )
- ( gasps )

356
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,041
WHAT HAPPENED NOW?

357
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,166
- KYOCHO, COME HERE!

358
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,416
YOU GOTTA COME DOWN
AND SEE THIS PLACE.

359
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,083
THESE STRANGE ROOTS ARE GROWING
EVERYWHERE IN THIS CAVE.

360
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,916
I BET IF WE FOLLOW THEM,
THEY'LL LEAD UP TO THE SCHOOL.

361
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,833
- Kyocho:
WHAT KIND OF PLANTS ARE THESE?

362
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,333
- Bachou:
SUPER GINORMOUS BEAN SPROUTS.

363
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,791
OR MAYBE NOT.

364
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,000
- Ryomou:
THE FIRE IS REACTING

365
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,500
TO A VERY POWERFUL
FIGHTING SPIRIT.

366
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,291
NOT A GOOD SIGN.

367
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,291
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS GOING ON?

368
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,125
- ( clanging )
- ( gasps )

369
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,041
HUH?

370
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,458
LOOKS LIKE HE MEANS ME.

371
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,291
AM I GOING TO AT LAST MEET 
THE SELF-PROCLAIMED KENTEI?

372
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,458
- ( creature growls )

373
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,458
- Ryomou: THAT ROAR.

374
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,125
NOT GOOD INDEED.

375
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,041
WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE?

376
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,291
- Kan'u:
IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?

377
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,708
GO AHEAD, DO YOUR WORST.

378
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,083
I MAY BE BLIND,

379
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,333
BUT YOU'RE STILL NOT GOING
TO GET THE BETTER OF ME.

380
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,333
I AM UNCHO KAN'U!

381
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,500
- WOW.

382
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,375
- HMM.

383
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,916
- THIS BOAT IS AWESOME.

384
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,750
IS THIS THE ONE WE'RE
GONNA USE TO GET THERE?

385
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,750
GAKU-CHAN, HOW'D YOU MANAGE
TO GET US THIS SWEET RIDE? 

386
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,583
DID YOU FORGET TO TELL US THAT
YOUR DAD'S THE PRIME MINISTER?

387
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,875
- ( all sigh )
- SHE REALLY IS THAT DUMB.

388
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,333
- A GOOD SAMARITAN
HEARD ABOUT OUR PREDICAMENT

389
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,916
AND VOLUNTEERED TO HELP.

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,750
- OHH?
WHO OFFERED US HELP?

391
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,791
- SOMEONE'S COMING.
- HUH?

392
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,583
- ( footsteps approach )

393
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,625
- WHO ARE THEY?

394
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,875
( gasps )
- YO.

395
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,708
HOW'S IT HANGING,
SON-STUPID-KU?

396
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,458
- TON-CHAN!

397
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,083
HEY, DID YOU JUST CALL ME
"SON-STUPID-KU"?

398
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,791
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO CALL ME STUPID.

399
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,375
I'M SMARTER THAN YOU.

400
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,041
- LEADER SONSAKU,
KYOSHO ACADEMY GOT US THIS BOAT,

401
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,458
YOU MAY NOT WANT
TO INSULT THEM. 

402
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,041
- OH?  YOU DID THIS FOR US?

403
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,375
- I WISH I WERE GOING,
BUT I HAVE TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.

404
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,875
WHEN YOU GET THERE, KICK SOME
EXTRA BUTT FOR ME, OKAY?

405
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,416
- YOU GOT IT!

406
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,916
- MOUTOKU COULDN'T COME,
BUT HE SENT THIS AS A GIFT.

407
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,583
HE TOLD ME TO PUT IT
IN YOUR HAND MYSELF.

408
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,750
- THIS IS FOR ME?

409
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,250
- THE DRAGON SWORD 
OF A HUNDRED TEARS.

410
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,416
- 1800 YEARS AGO,
SOUSOU HAD THIS SWORD CRAFTED

411
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,916
WHICH TOOK THREE YEARS.

412
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,416
IT'S RUMORED TO BE
THE MOST POWERFUL 

413
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,833
BEJEWELED BLADE EVER.
- OHH.

414
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,000
- Kakouton: WE'LL SET UP
A SECOND FRONT HERE

415
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,583
ON THE OFF CHANCE
YOU DON'T STOP KENTEI.

416
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,250
EVEN IF IT TAKES
EVERY LAST FIGHTER

417
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,083
THAT KYOSHO ACADEMY HAS,
WE'LL NEVER SURRENDER.

418
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,500
WE WON'T LET THAT
BASTARD KENTEI WIN.

419
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,083
WOULDN'T YOU DO 
THE SAME FOR US?

420
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,375
( chuckles )
- TON-CHAN. 

421
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,666
- Kakouton: HAKUFU SONAKU,

422
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,541
YOU ARE THE LEADER
OF NANYO ACADEMY. 

423
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,625
GO TO NANBAN
AND KICK SOME ASS!

424
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,916
THOSE ARE THE BASICS!
YEAH!

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,166
- YEAH!

426
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,125
LET'S GO!

427
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,708
GET READY, KENTEI.
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!

428
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,958
- ( theme music playing )

429
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

430
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,083
- Gakushu: I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOU HELP GETTING THE BOAT.

431
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,666
- Kakouton: DON'T MENTION IT.
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO

432
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,125
SINCE I COULDN'T HELP
WITH THE FIGHT.

433
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,625
SONSAKU'S GOT
A LOT ON HER PLATE.

434
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,833
SEEMS LIKE SHE'S ALWAYS
BUSY WITH SOMETHING.

435
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,208
- Gakushu: YEAH,
SHE DOES TOO MUCH,

436
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,458
TO BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU.

437
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,000
BUT I SUPPOSE
THAT'S THE DESTINY

438
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,958
OF THOSE WHO
POSSESS THE SACRED BEADS.

439
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,375
THEY'RE LIVING THEIR OWN LIVES

440
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,333
AND LIVING OUT THE FATE
OF SOMEONE ELSE.

441
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:50,583
NEXT TIME ON
"IKKI TOUSEN XTREME XECUTOR",

442
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,166
"REUNION OF THE FISTS."

443
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,125
- Kakouton:
THAT'S THE BASICS OF A REUNION.
