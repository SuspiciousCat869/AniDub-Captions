1
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,833
Damn it.

2
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,541
You bastard.

3
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,583
Don't take my life.
Please don't hurt me.

4
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not the only one. Please.

5
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,000
Why did you pick me?

6
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,500
No, don't-

7
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,625
Aw, shit.

8
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,708
Oh my god!

9
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,958
The corpse was identified
as Lavinia Whately, age 24.

10
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,541
She worked as a dancer.

11
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,333
And she's also a Third.

12
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,083
How many robots are there?

13
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,458
Seems you can't swing a
dead cat without hitting one.

14
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,250
Detective Sylibus.
Mars to Sylibus, come in.

15
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,625
Uh, what?

16
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,833
Are you conscious enough

17
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,416
to report on a doll
killer René D'anclaude.

18
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,541
Yes. He's at a
hospital in Shinora.

19
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,166
He was admitted to ICU, where
his condition is still critical.

20
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,625
He's no better than
a vegetable,

21
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,333
but to cover our butts,
he has round-the-clock security.

22
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,541
The police hospital, huh?

23
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,291
Could he have an accomplice?

24
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,666
Well, we can't question him.

25
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,000
She really worked him over good.

26
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,708
You really made her day, huh?

27
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,875
Christ, Eddie, will
you put a lid on it?

28
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
I just wonder
where she's gone to.

29
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,958
Why have all the Thirds
so far been female?

30
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,000
Lowel...

31
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,291
do you have any
new information?

32
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,666
You monster.

33
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,666
Yeah, that's right,
I'm a monster.

34
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,041
I'm the monster society created.

35
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,958
I'm the thing they blame for
recession and social problems.

36
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,541
I'm the scapegoat!

37
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,083
If humans don't want me,
why did they make me?

38
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,458
The first five humanoid cadavers
were illegally manufactured.

39
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,541
Our labs were not
equipped to examine them.

40
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,916
Therefore they've been sent to

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,125
a facility at the Conception
Company to be analyzed.

42
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,041
Since they're the
experts in this field,

43
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,916
we're hoping they can give us
a clue to the Thirds' origins.

44
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,416
But--

45
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,041
But they haven't turned up
any preliminary findings yet?

46
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,708
No, they claim
it's inconclusive

47
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,500
Oh, I think you had better
examine the sixth one yourself.

48
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,291
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,500
Uh, Sylibus, I have something
I want to talk to you about,

50
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,500
so come to my office later.

51
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,958
Yes.

52
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,333
Armitage carries
a Special A Class license.

53
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,583
I know.

54
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,958
But she chose to
become a cop. A good one.

55
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,750
Do you understand
I'm getting at?

56
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,166
Yeah.

57
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,958
If the reason she disappeared
is because of you, Ross.

58
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,083
Well, you can
interrogate me all you want.

59
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,375
I'm used to it.

60
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,291
Ross, that won't be necessary.

61
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,833
If you say you
don't know anything,

62
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,958
that's good enough for me.

63
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,750
Leave it at that.

64
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,416
I'm no Sherlock Holmes,

65
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,708
but I've learned from experience
to follow my instinct.

66
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,625
I have a hunch there's some kind
of connection between Armitage

67
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,416
and the killing
of the Third types.

68
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,458
This could get real fun.

69
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,166
If an officer was
rumored to be a humanoid,

70
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,708
the shit could hit the fan.

71
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,375
So let's keep this between
you, me, and the wall.

72
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,083
Armitage isn't a good cop.
She's a great one.

73
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,708
Always hurts like hell
when the rain comes.

74
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,250
Start message.

75
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,833
Hey, where are you?

76
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,916
You okay? Your
partner's concerned.

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,916
The lieutenant's no dummy.
He suspects you're a Third.

78
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,416
It appears D'anclaude
is working with someone,

79
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,291
because Thirds are
still being murdered.

80
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,666
Don't let bitterness change you.

81
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,625
Come back, Armitage. Please.

82
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,458
It appears D'anclaude
is working with someone,

83
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,375
because Thirds are
still being murdered.

84
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,583
Don't let bitterness change you.

85
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,791
Come back, Armitage. Please.

86
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,416
Good evening, Mademoiselle.

87
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,250
A bit late for such a lovely
wench to be out strolling.

88
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,333
Say, maybe you
could spare ten credits

89
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,708
so a poor soul could
get a beer from Earth?

90
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,750
Now behave. Alright?

91
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,916
Perhaps you gents know
someone who lives near here,

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,291
a novelist.

93
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:32,375
A writer. I myself used to be
a fine writer of on-line porno.

94
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,583
You could say I was
on the cutting edge.

95
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,333
Let's see what you got
in here, Baby.

96
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,458
Get away from me!

97
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,208
What's the hurry, Sport?

98
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,083
Thought you wanted to play.

99
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,250
I'm sorry!

100
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,250
Good.

101
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,333
You don't know how sorry I am.

102
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,666
I just love a man who grovels.

103
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,750
Now then, you will
answer my questions.

104
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,750
I will! Everything, just ask!

105
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,458
Oh, that feels nice.

106
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,166
You're crazy!

107
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,708
Your turn.

108
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,541
You're a monster!

109
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,875
You've got an appointment set
up at the Conception Company.

110
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,875
Ask for Mr. Allen.
He's in charge.

111
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,791
O.K. I'll get
on my way right now.

112
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:05,250
Oh, yeah. Check this out!

113
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,458
I came across a log of
correspondence Armitage

114
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,625
did just before she vamoosed.

115
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,208
What are you
talkin' about, Eddie?

116
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,458
Voila.

117
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,791
Correspondence with who?

118
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,833
I can't tell you yet.
It's in machine language.

119
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,291
I'll have to try reverse
computations first.

120
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,666
It's in code?

121
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,833
My boy, leave everything
up to old Eddie.

122
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,583
I'll decipher it.
You can count on me.

123
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,125
Uh, yeah.

124
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,250
Are you Detective
Sylibus from the MPD?

125
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,541
Thanks for fitting me in today.

126
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,791
I'm Eugene Allen,

127
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,916
Vice President of
public relations.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,125
Please, won't you sit down?

129
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,958
Thanks.

130
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,833
I'm here to discuss
the examination reports

131
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,500
on the Thirds we've
requested from your company.

132
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,333
Uh, yes, we're working on it.

133
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,416
The architecture of
that particular type

134
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,125
is very different
from our designs,

135
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,125
so it's taking some time.

136
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,708
Unforeseen delays.

137
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,166
Even so, we need to...

138
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,708
Uh, is your AL product,
the Artificial Life androids,

139
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,208
those composed of
organic fibers,

140
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,958
a high demand
commodity for you?

141
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,208
Yes, very.

142
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,833
What purpose do we serve
by simulating humans?

143
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,291
Are you familiar with
our motto, Detective?

144
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,708
Yeah, "Home Robotization."

145
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,833
A rather hot political,
legal topic at the moment.

146
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,500
I realize you're trying to pass
new standards to get your cut

147
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,833
of the market.

148
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,833
It's only natural to want
to make a profit, right?

149
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,291
It sounds like you're implying
that we're manufacturing Thirds.

150
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,666
An observation.

151
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,375
Let's see, um,
there was somethin' else.

152
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,916
Asakura was an inventor
who worked on your staff.

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Asakura? Well,
I'm afraid he's not here.

154
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,208
Not here? What do
you mean he's not here?

155
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,458
He quit.

156
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,875
When?

157
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,500
He quit before
I joined the company,

158
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,708
several years ago.

159
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,833
Hmm, I understand.

160
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,708
You're welcome to
check employee files.

161
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,875
Everything can be verified.

162
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,875
So, is she an example
of "Home Robotization"?

163
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,416
Well, one purpose of robots

164
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,083
is to help turn human
fantasies into reality.

165
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,041
They can do almost
anything, can't they?

166
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,166
Except reproduce.

167
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,458
Please, visit us again sometime.

168
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,750
Drive home safely, and be
sure to have a nice day. Bye!

169
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,416
Sorry to take up your time.

170
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,916
It's no problem.

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,458
Please drive safely, and be
sure to wear your seatbelt.

172
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,250
Human fantasy!
She sounds like my mother.

173
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,791

Shut down.

181
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,083
I know Conception
is hiding something.

182
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,041
This makes number seven.

183
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,333
I think I'm gonna puke.

184
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,000
Who the hell's doing this?

185
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,916
I can only think of two people
with the means and motivation.

186
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,333
I'm talking about
René D'anclaude and Armitage.

187
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,500
What's that?

188
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,333
Yeah, I know it's
weird to think about,

189
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,250
but she talked to
me about it once.

190
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,166
She pities the robots
used for crime,

191
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,041
so she kills them quickly.

192
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,916
But I can't believe
she'd actually...

193
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,750
Not on your life.
I'm sure the village is artsy,

194
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,500
but downtown is a pit.

195
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,000
I wouldn't move there
for anything.

196
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,041
Listen, I've gotta
get some writing done.

197
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,750
I'll talk to ya later.

198
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:29,791
Continue writing mode.
Novel in progress, untitled.

199
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,833
Chapter 2, paragraph 5.

200
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,958
"How could she greet the
ones from the deep far away?

201
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,458
"She, who has spent a pleasant
and enchanting afternoon...

202
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,708
"who had never given a
thought about the person

203
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,250
from the Luluie,

204
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,958
the same one who had once picked
her up, now cold and dead."

205
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,458
"A phantom."

206
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,166
"Her battle with
the old gods ended.

207
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,916
"As a spiritual truce
was struck,

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,791
she felt her soul unburdened.

209
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,875
"She smiled. Already the
feeling of harmony was-"

210
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,083
Who's there?

211
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,458
Who are you?

212
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,000
Are you Armitage?

213
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,791
Are you the one
who contacted me?

214
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,250
You fooled me!

215
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,875
You fooled me.
You fooled me...

216
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,791
Do you mean Armitage
is a suspect?

217
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,083
Well, you can't
just deny the evidence.

218
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,250
The woman's last
words said it all.

219
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,666
The whole department is shocked,

220
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,583
but the lieutenant had
suspicions about her all along.

221
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,791
He's already issued a
warrant for her arrest.

222
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,041
And there's
an APB out on her.

223
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,291
That sly old dog.

224
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,166
Access mail.
Log file, Armitage.

225
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,875
Open file.

226
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,750
This is Pluto.

227
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,166
I'm sending this message
by using Armitage's ID.

228
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,166
I'm a Third, just like you...

229
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,583
Hey, Chris. Let's find out
where this mail originated from

230
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,791
You got it.

231
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,333
Shit.

232
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,500
Ha! That's it. That's it.

233
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,875
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

234
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,625
Jackpot!

235
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,541
Here is the complete list
of Thirds from Pluto.

236
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,208
Pluto? The planet?

237
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:11,916
Huh, whoa, so that's
the game. Hot damn.

238
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,166
Lieutenant, come here, quick!

239
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,416
Just hold on. Are you certain?

240
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,875
Yes, sir.

241
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,625
Although to get the results,
I did have to send a piece

242
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,791
of the body to the
Conception Company.

243
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,958
But how? Technically,
can they really...

244
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,833
Why not? They're physically
equipped the same as humans are.

245
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,250
I wasn't talking about that!

246
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,458
Get me Ross!

247
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,958
Yes, sir!

248
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,000
It's Sylibus.

249
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,416
Is it true you put a warrant
out for Armitage's arrest?

250
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,791
I had no choice, but Eddie
figured out the pattern.

251
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,166
As we expected,
it's a list of Thirds.

252
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,916
I'll bet Pluto
ends that list, right?

253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,333
How did you know?

254
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,750
I made an illegal search
and found a message.

255
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,000
Uh, that's just between
you, me, and the wall.

256
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,291
I'll call you later.

257
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,916
There's one more thing.

258
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,541
We finally learned why
all the Thirds are female.

259
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,416
What?

260
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,666
Lavinia Whately was pregnant.

261
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,041
Pregnant?

262
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,375
Androids that can reproduce?

263
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,625
That must be the
purpose of the Thirds.

264
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,666
Hey Kelly, wanna see
a movie Saturday?

265
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,541
Hey guys!

266
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,541
Look!

267
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,291
Whoa.

268
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,708
Geez, what's with
all the weird getup?

269
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,791
Wonder what the heck
she's doing here.

270
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,250
Wow.

271
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,375
Morning Mrs. Brewster.

272
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,583
Good morning.

273
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,541
Now everyone get inside.
Hurry up.

274
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,458
Class will start
in a few minutes.

275
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,291
Armitage.

276
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,583
I used to love the
playground after school.

277
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,833
I was a pretty
clumsy kid, though.

278
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,041
I took a tumble off

279
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,708
the see-saw once and
bawled all the way home.

280
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,000
Listen, did you know that the
MPD has been searching for you?

281
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,375
Bet you're looking
for Pluto, right?

282
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,666
Let's go.

283
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,458
Armitage!

284
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,500
What?

285
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,916
Armitage, I just wanted to...

286
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,875
You and... uh... nevermind.

287
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,500
There! That's him,
I'm sure of it.

288
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,458
Huh? But, he's a boy.

289
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,958
How do you do, Pluto?
It's good to meet you.

290
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,041
There's no need
for such formality.

291
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,750
We are brother and sister.

292
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,458
You've forgotten.

293
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,375
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,583
By the way, shouldn't
you be in class?

295
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,166
No, I'm transferring
my thoughts

296
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,583
to the main memory at
the navigation center.

297
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,958
Hmm?

298
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,291
What for?

299
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,583
To make a backup
of myself, obviously.

300
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,916
I appreciate you
sending the list, Pluto.

301
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,875
Please don't call me
by my handle.

302
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,958
It's embarrassing.

303
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,916
Very well, Julian Moore.

304
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,333
I never imagined
a child Third...

305
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,916
and a boy to boot.

306
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,041
The most sophisticated AL model,
but I'm incapable of maturing.

307
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,541
I'm trapped in this body.

308
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,083
Until I'm destroyed

309
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,541
Do you know that for sure?

310
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,333
I heard that I have
the distinction of being

311
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,833
the last model off
the Thirds test line.

312
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,791
So they made me a child,
and a male no less.

313
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,125
The joke's on me, isn't it?

314
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,250
I don't get it.

315
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,958
Later.

316
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:41,125
She doesn't catch on too
quick. There's no need for her

317
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,750
to be concerned
with it now anyway.

318
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,250
Why, you!

319
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,083
Even though you're a Third
for all intents and purposes,

320
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,625
you're a punk.

321
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,958
Talk to me again like that,
and I'll paddle your cyborg ass!

322
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,416
What's wrong?

323
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,375
Why'd the elevator stop?

324
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,833
I don't know.

325
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,625
Huh?

326
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,125
It won't stop!

327
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,000
We're dropping pretty fast.

328
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,500
At this rate,
we're gonna die for sure.

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,833
Hold on tight to him!

330
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,833
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

331
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,500
Got any ideas?

332
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,000
Ross.

333
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,666
I think my right arm
and some ribs are broken.

334
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,083
Time to meet our assassin.

335
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,708
Damn you!

336
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,958
He's fast.

337
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,625
Come on, we gotta run for it.

338
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,583
Go on. Leave me here.

339
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,250
No, I'll help you. Let's go!

340
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,083
Oh, my god.

341
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,541
Looks like a showdown.

342
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,833
Aim it up!

343
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,291
If Armitage is killed, then
there's gonna be no hope for me.

344
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:48,500
D'anclaude!
Who's in Shinora, then?

345
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,416
Surprise, surprise!

346
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,666
Didja miss me?

347
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,750
You son of a bitch!

348
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,833
I won't let you
die alone, cherie.

349
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,166
The other two will join you.

350
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,250
Fucking bastard!

351
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,083
He's not human!

352
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,166
Nice right hook,

353
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,333
but now I'm going to crush

354
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,666
the three of you,
and get on with my life.

355
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,250
I have places to go,
and people to kill!

356
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,166
Huh?

357
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,916
Huh? What the-

358
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,375
Hi there, René. Bon voyage.

359
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,583
You crazy bitch!
Give me the key!

360
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,166
Please, unlock it!

361
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,166
Bye!

362
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,166
A burial in the sewer.
Poetic justice.

363
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,041
I knew you weren't the killer.

364
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,666
No one suspected it might be
that psycho again.

365
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,333
Security should be
here any minute.

366
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,500
They'll take care of you.

367
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,708
No.

368
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,708
You don't have
to run and hide.

369
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,500
Police don't leave
their injured behind.

370
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,000
You're cold, lady.

371
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,333
I will always be cold.

372
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
Armitage.

373
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,708
Old questions unanswered.

374
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,166
New ones arise.

375
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,041
Why are Thirds
being slaughtered?

376
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,000
For what purpose
are they intended?

377
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,125
Why are they
designed to reproduce?

378
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,708
Where is Asakura?

379
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:18,041
And is it really René D'anclaude
at the hospital in Shinora?

380
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,375
I have no choice but to go.

381
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:24,541
Armitage III, Episode 3,
"Heart Core."
