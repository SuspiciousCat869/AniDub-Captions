1
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,750
Yes, human suffering.

2
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,375
It's such a unique privilege,
isn't it?

3
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,083
Hey, dick cop, don't take
the little chickie away

4
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,083
from the party so soon!

5
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:58,416
Come on. She'd like it more
if she went bye bye with me!

6
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,458
A big brother's protection
extends from womb to tomb,

7
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,958
and therefore-

8
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,041
Today, there is
a new development

9
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,583
in the antirobot movement.

10
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,833
We have received official
confirmation from the MPD

11
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:15,875
of a definite connection

12
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,500
between the
Kelly McCanon incident,

13
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,875
the terrorist puppet bombings,

14
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,375
and the recent massacre
at the hospital in Shinora.

15
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,250
The police are asking
for our viewers' help

16
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,958
in locating these two suspects:

17
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,791
Ross Sylibus and Naomi Armitage.

18
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,125
The MPD confirmed there
is a definite connection.

19
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,375
If you have any information,
please notify the police.

20
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me pick out our next
meeting place, okay?

21
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,291
Tables, with umbrellas.
If that makes you too sick,

22
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,208
I know a vending machine
and a clean bench.

23
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,541
I guess maybe this
is the worst place.

24
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,625
The worst place?
Only if I was in your shoes.

25
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,416
Will you cut the crap!
Did you find anything?

26
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,583
Yeah, your Danich Hill exists,
but not on any map.

27
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,166
Found a good highway going
smack blank into a mountain,

28
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,791
but there's no Asakura
address box inviting any mail

29
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,166
from a rogue cop.

30
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,708
No sati-topographicals?

31
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,583
C'mon! Like I really
got a couple of moons

32
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,416
to power this thing.

33
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,708
Hey, what're you doin'?

34
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,250
A loss, in duty.

35
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,708
Yeah, the dearly departed.

36
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,083
Hey, Ross!

37
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,416
Can you tell those guys...

38
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,250
the Martians, tell
'em Eddie says "What's up?"

39
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,958
I will.

40
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,500
So, what's wrong?

41
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,375
Well, are you gonna tell me?

42
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,916
Are you O.K.?

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,333
No, I'm not.
My CPU's all messed up.

44
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,125
They say the mind's
the first thing to go.

45
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,375
Humans say it.

46
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,208
Come on, machines
don't go senile.

47
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,875
They also say life
is pretty short.

48
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,500
It's like an
expiration date, you know?

49
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,541
Hey, how come?

50
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,875
What?

51
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,416
What's the reason
you're doing all this for me?

52
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,625
How come you're still
hanging around with me?

53
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,041
And driving me
all the way out here?

54
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,750
Why change from
a good cop to a criminal?

55
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,166
How come-

56
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,041
Stop it! You're asking stupid
questions like some little kid.

57
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:39,500
Why? How come?
There's no answer.

58
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,375
Huh?

59
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,458
That's it, isn't it?

60
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,833
Coordinates.

61
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,916
Virgin? Yeah,
maybe if you just landed.

62
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,625
Hey, it wastes fuel
to keep the motor running.

63
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,625
Yo, anybody here?

64
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,625
We're looking for
a guy called Asakura.

65
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,750
Is anyone here?
You got visitors!

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,333
Huh?

67
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,125
What happened?

68
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,958
Alright, take it easy.
Move away from it nice and slow.

69
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,583
Don't shoot!

70
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,208
It's only a robot.

71
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,333
Yeah, a big one.

72
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,125
It's somehow just like me.
I think it's a bioroid type.

73
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,541
What is it, some
kind of a prototype?

74
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,000
May I help you?

75
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,500
Huh?

76
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,000
Talk about your family trees.

77
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,708
It's just another robot.

78
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,583
Just like the giant.

79
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,458
I heard someone calling
for Dr. Asakura.

80
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,333
Uh, I did.

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,458
Appointment?

82
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,416
No, I suppose not.

83
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,416
Would you follow me, please?

84
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,333
Dr. Asakura, visitors! A Mr...

85
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,583
Sylibus.

86
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,250
Papa!

87
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:54,541
The new man from Conception!
It's been so many years,

88
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,875
and you even brought one
of the models along.

89
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,541
Mr. Sylibus.

90
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,791
Uh, but I'm not-

91
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,416
Papa!

92
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,375
Oh, but she's only a Third.

93
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,208
She's so inferior.

94
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,291
The poor little thing,
but you needn't be so kind.

95
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,625
It's outdated.

96
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,916
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here, take a look at this.

97
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,083
A fourth type that
Conception can be proud of.

98
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:27,208
There's no longer any need to
copy humans or plants anymore.

99
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,541
They live. They're ALIVEs!

100
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,875
Oh, no, we should
call them "phobians."

101
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,291
What? Yes, a new life, my
Marforteans, but you won't.

102
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,583
You'll just be calling
them anything you want

103
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,583
when you market them.

104
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,291
The stupid company you work
for is just going to call them

105
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,375
the Fourths aren't they?

106
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,125
They're ALIVEs!
A grand conception!

107
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,958
Then it all goes wrong.

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,250
The doctor's mind was
unfortunately altered.

109
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,458
Reduplication of his
thoughts is very difficult.

110
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,083
Please, be patient.

111
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,083
His memory, was it erased?

112
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,458
Who are you?

113
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:09,583
I am Wilbur D'anclaude
and Dr. Asakura's aide.

114
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,625
Oh, well yeah he might look
to you like he's one of those

115
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,958
damn assassinroids,

116
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,041
but I fixed up his crazy head,

117
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,833
just as you can see.

118
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,000
Indeed he did.

119
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,291
The violent tendencies I had are
now gone, due to the upgrade.

120
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,416
What's the reason?

121
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,750
Pardon?

122
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,083
Dr. Asakura. His mind,
just what's wrong with it?

123
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,583
Forget it, Ross.

124
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,041
That's enough.

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,750
Are you still cold?

126
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,541
It's affecting
my nervous system.

127
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,708
I'm sorry I lost my temper,

128
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,333
I was just hoping that the
doctor could help you somehow.

129
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,833
Never count on hope.
You'll lose.

130
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,708
When wishes are gone,
hope gives nothing.

131
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,375
And then you hope that
your father might know.

132
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,541
And hopes are really fragile.

133
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,625
They get all ruined,

134
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,916
every time you believe
that some one else

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,833
is gonna help your
hopes come true.

136
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:27,166
A hope is a feeling.
Maybe you'll be okay.

137
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,625
If I was a Second, then
I wouldn't even be able

138
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,166
to think of all
this stupid crap.

139
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,000
But I'm programmed
to be a human,

140
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,125
and I don't know what it means.

141
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,458
Hope is a human feeling,
isn't it?

142
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,666
Come on, tell me more-

143
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,458
Hey, I met one. He's a human,

144
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:52,541
and he's less real than all of
the things you're talking about.

145
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,208
Know what he said?

146
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,666
Don't give up.

147
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,333
Ross.

148
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,458
Are you sure?

149
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,208
Oh, Armitage.

150
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,541
I think it's the only thing I've
been sure of since I got here.

151
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,791
How 'bout you?

152
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:23,666
Well, at least something
is normal here on Mars.

153
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,166
But I'm not normal.
I'm a robot.

154
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,083
I'm half robot, too.

155
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,875
But I know a true heart
when I've met one.

156
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,583
We interrupt this broadcast
for the following announcement:

157
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,083
Good evening,

158
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,500
we've just received word that
as of 11:00 PM, UTN time,

159
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,875
the economic agreement
has been signed at last.

160
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,208
Mars and Earth have
finally signed the treaty.

161
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,458
Officials from both powers
are quoted as saying,

162
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,458
"This is a first step toward
one world, one nation."

163
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,291
Follow me, there's something
I'd like to show you.

164
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,291
Where's the doc?

165
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,625
This morning,
he's with his ALIVEs.

166
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,625
He's concentrating on
further hybridization.

167
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,833
He intends to continue

168
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,333
and complete the initial
terraforming plans.

169
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,125
That isn't possible.

170
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,291
Yes, rational
thought would agree.

171
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:41,458
Don't worry. The unborn
sister poses no threat.

172
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,166
Dr. Asakura gave up
weapon production.

173
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,166
He left this new model
unfinished. But why?

174
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,083
A difference of opinion with his
partner Professor D'anclaude?

175
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,458
I... that's enough.

176
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,583
Let's go.

177
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,000
Is there something else?

178
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,583
I brought you here, because I
felt you had previous knowledge

179
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,666
of the Thirds being
created as assassinroids.

180
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,833
Nice, upgrade. Go on.

181
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,833
It's the unfinished work.

182
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,208
Professor D'anclaude began
work on female assassinroids,

183
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:14,041
which would some way compliment
the multitude of my brothers.

184
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,166
Along with myself and Armitage,

185
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,875
we were the pinnacle
of robotic creation.

186
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,083
Although our strength and
abilities far surpassed humans,

187
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,208
it was quite simple
to assimilate ourselves

188
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,875
into their society.

189
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,875
Then, Dr. Asakura used us as
a base of synthetic organisms

190
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,500
in developing the Thirds.

191
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,916
Programming creativity and
life instead of the directive

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,333
to destroy.

193
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,625
Unfortunately, all the
prototypes had an imperfection.

194
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,958
There were many instabilities
within the logic boards

195
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,208
of the Third CPU.

196
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,375
Of course, Dr. Asakura's present
state of mind prevented him

197
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,375
from ever quite perfecting
the female models.

198
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm nothing.

199
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,625
He couldn't finish. I'm useless!
He doesn't even care!

200
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,291
No, wait!

201
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,250
So, why create a Third type?

202
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,083
I mean, the Seconds were
good enough, even on Earth.

203
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,750
Perhaps being from Earth, you
do not have the knowledge of

204
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,958
the difficulties there are
with low Martian birthrates.

205
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,250
No. I've heard.

206
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,708
What's it mean?

207
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
Any colony desiring
independence,

208
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,041
requires a populace.

209
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,750
Otherwise, they can't
develop a new identity.

210
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,208
And Mars will continue to be
weak, as long as it remains

211
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,041
dependent on the Earth
for its immigration.

212
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,916
So what about Conception?

213
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,625
There's gotta be more to it than
just the money that's involved.

214
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,708
Indeed, manufacturers of
Thirds, which can give birth,

215
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,416
gain strength
through numbers.

216
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,916
The more people they represent,

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,791
the stronger their
position grows.

218
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:47,375
Logical. But then the
assassinations make no sense.

219
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,958
They do. If you're the
government and hope to sign

220
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,083
a treaty with the
Earth Federation.

221
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,625
Nah, they couldn't.

222
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,958
Do you think they've
really done it?

223
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,833
Mars has no other recourse.

224
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,875
The Earth Federation
is now strongly feminist.

225
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,666
A robot who can conceive,
contradicts the basis of

226
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,458
the Terran Party's position
of basic humanity.

227
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,958
For Mars to agree, Mars
must eliminate the Thirds.

228
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,791
They are now an obstruction.

229
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,208
Is that what you think?

230
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,125
That I'm just old Martian
garbage to be thrown out?

231
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,250
You're wrong.

232
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm gonna stay alive
for as long I can-

233
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,916
Exactly, your programming
for self-preservation

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,208
is exactly equal to ours
for eliminating your kind.

235
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,333
But I am now refined.

236
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,458
Unlike my brothers, I respect
your wish for continued life.

237
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey Eddie.

238
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,916
He's on suspension for aiding
a fugitive, section 10.

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,583
No, not if I forced him into it.

240
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,458
Perhaps he'll be pardoned.

241
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,833
I'll submit it.

242
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,875
This Danich Hill Dome

243
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,333
has become a military
attack point.

244
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,416
The government has made their
own connections between you two

245
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,041
and the second puppet bombings.

246
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,541
This is an official notice.

247
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,166
You're a threat
to the government,

248
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,875
the MPD officially renounces
all of your activities.

249
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,625
So Eddie freakin' squealed.

250
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,958
He didn't. How could an officer
who I put on suspension

251
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,666
say anything at all?

252
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,916
Thanks a lot?

253
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,750
Sorry.

254
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,916
Sorries aren't good enough!

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,666
Just what the hell
are we gonna do now?

256
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,708
Survival!

257
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,875
It's basic training.

258
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,291
Lieutenant Randolph
and friends, signing off.

259
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,208
Great.

260
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,500
You're in charge. What now?

261
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,791
We gotta get my father out.

262
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,166
Good morning! And this morning
is our day of new hope.

263
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,583
Our planet,

264
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,458
often beleaguered with
nightmarish social confusion,

265
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,500
has been finally
pieced together again,

266
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,750
with the help from
our true home world.

267
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,083
Federation Chairwoman Everheart
has taken two planets

268
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,125
and given us one
world, one nation.

269
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,916
Today we are reborn
as a unified humanity.

270
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,083
Listen to me, they're going
to blow all of us up!

271
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,541
Straight to hell!

272
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,791
My ALIVEs are not yet
ready to leave.

273
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,791
They're gonna be your tinder
logs in a few seconds.

274
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,375
Papa!

275
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,958
Wilbur, get the important work
into the old storage backups.

276
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,916
Don't worry about me,
I'll be safe.

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,333
It's you I'm-

278
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,625
Maybe you are a nut,
but I'm your damn daughter,

279
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,000
and you know it.

280
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,375
This is a police order.

281
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,125
Evacuate.

282
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,166
You're still a little fireball,
aren't you, my Naomi?

283
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,333
Papa!

284
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,041
Armitage!

285
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,458
She's alright. You must think
I'm a great coward, Mr. Sylibus.

286
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,708
But if the ALIVEs
and myself are to die,

287
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,916
I must at least save one thing.

288
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,333
You poor child.

289
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,833
Daddy will fix it.
Daddy will fix his little girl.

290
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:32,041
There, it's finished,
Naomi. Now you are real.

291
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,958
Last night's slogan of
"one world, one nation"

292
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,750
has this morning blossomed into
a new Martian thought toward

293
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,208
"two worlds, one humanity."

294
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,458
Hey listen, I think Eddie
knows a guy that can hide us

295
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,541
as cargo on an Earth shuttle.

296
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,791
I still got friends there
who can get you a new I.D.

297
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,291
I don't want that.

298
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,750
I'm going back.
Back to St. Lowel.

299
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't want to see you die.

300
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,291
You won't have to.

301
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,791
We'll say goodbye here.

302
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,583
That's a good idea, right?

303
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,916
It's a pretty place,

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,333
if you just ignore the
smell from all the bombs.

305
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,541
You know I hate when you
talk like shit that way!

306
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,166
So what?

307
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,750
This whole planet
hates your kind,

308
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,500
without any damn reason at all.

309
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,041
Just like I did.

310
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,750
I know they do, but if...

311
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,583
there's someone else.

312
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,458
Oh, Ross, I love
you so very much!

313
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,958
Hey, go wherever you want,

314
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,666
but you're never
gonna lose me now.

315
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,416
Thank you for coming, sir.

316
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,791
This is an MFN
special news break.

317
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,833
Chairwoman Everheart's car
has just turned onto

318
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,375
the main thoroughfare
in downtown St. Lowel.

319
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,583
Her bright smile of success
is met with the cheers

320
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,750
of literally thousands of
admirers lining the streets.

321
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,500
The humanity of Mars
is now whole again.

322
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,583
One world, one nation.

323
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,708
One world, one nation.

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,291
Two thousand. 

325
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,416
Look, I'm finished.

326
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a little too
angelic for my taste,

327
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,791
but now I've
got some real power.

328
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,500
We'll need it.

329
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:24,875
Let's show 'em.

330
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,791
A new era in Martian history,

331
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,833
among the brightest
stipulations of the new treaty

332
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,791
is the definition of
the idea of humanity itse-

333
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,791
It's a loading zone only, sir!

334
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,041
You look skinnier.

335
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,958
Is it me, or is it you?

336
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:11,541
Or no, maybe I'm getting
a lot bigger somehow.

337
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,458
Hmm? What's that?

338
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,208
It's a human I.D. card.
It's the one I promised to you,

339
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,291
before the battle
we had up on Danich Hill.

340
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,666
Ross! Hey, that was
several months ago.

341
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,291
Huh? Who in the hell
is Annalisa Bradford?

342
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,791
Maybe if I had a bunch
of these to begin with,

343
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,000
all the other Thirds could
have gotten away to Earth,

344
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,041
instead of being killed.

345
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,041
You can go wherever
you want with that.

346
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,500
Hey! What are you doing?

347
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,500
Are you nuts? Or just stupid?

348
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,875
I don't know. Maybe both.

349
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,416
I just rather be me now.

350
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,166
Your message mentioned
something about Julian.

351
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,458
Uh, do you wanna go visit him?

352
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,416
No, not yet.

353
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,750
I forgot to tell him
he's gonna be an uncle.

354
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,916
Well, now who's being stupid.

355
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,083
Get it?

356
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,208
The only damage was
in the logic board.

357
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,291
The rest of me was
working just fine.

358
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,166
Ah, what do ya know! 

359
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,625
I'm a dad!

360
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:29,625
You sure are, and I don't wanna
call him Ross Jr. Bradford.
