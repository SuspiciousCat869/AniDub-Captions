1
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,583
MFN--Martian First Network.

2
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,208
Good evening.
Tonight in headline news

3
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,208
is the continued
terrorist bombings.

4
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,791
Hi, and I am reporting it!

5
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,041
Right.

6
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,875
Just last month,
three bombings occurred.

7
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,208
The last one happened
last night in Well City.

8
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,250
Oh, and wait 'til you hear
how they did it!

9
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:08,541
Attention to all passengers,
due to a magnetic storm,

10
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,708
all departures are delayed.

11
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,166
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

12
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,583
This has been MAA
information service.

13
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,083
Have a nice day.

14
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,375
Police have determined that
these so-called "puppet bombs"

15
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,875
are the work of
the same terrorist

16
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,458
responsible for
previous explosions.

17
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,875
The pattern was established
after the last incident,

18
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,125
which took place
at Mars airport.

19
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,583
Gee Janet, I hope I won't have
to worry about you blowing up!

20
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,125
Well if I do, I'll
give you an exclusive.

21
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,333
Touché.

22
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,458
I can't believe that I'm
capable of giving birth.

23
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,166
Quite a revelation, isn't it?

24
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,291
That's the whole purpose
of the Third types

25
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,625
You can step beyond the bounds
of conventional robots,

26
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,541
just by getting pregnant,

27
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,458
Mommy Armitage.

28
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,500
Not funny.

29
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,541
It's too weird.

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,500
But you, what's your role?

31
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm still trying
to figure that out?

32
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,666
What's the point in
creating a male kid?

33
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,708
The CPU showed my serial number
as the last Third made.

34
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,750
The final model off the line.

35
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,791
Not quite.

36
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,333
We can breed now.

37
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,458
Now I understand why the Thirds
were made to seem so human,

38
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,166
not just in appearance,
but emotionally.

39
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,333
Like the murdered singer
and that novelist.

40
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,750
They weren't just machines.
They had souls.

41
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,916
It takes more than the
right plumbing to procreate.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,250
Yes, sir. The perfect
receptacle for human babies.

43
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,625
What the hell
is so funny, huh?

44
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,000
What's the matter?

45
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,708
Have I touched a nerve?

46
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,208
Maternal clock ticking?

47
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,666
Maybe you'd like Detective
Ross to set your alarm.

48
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,333
Shut up.

49
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,458
I was just kidding.

50
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,375
Julian, do you know
why they made us?

51
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,333
I don't.

52
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,541
But I'll bet Asakura does.

53
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,208
Or...D'anclaude.

54
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,500
He must have a part in this.

55
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,541
Christ, another bombing.
That makes 5 this month.

56
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,916
Uh-huh.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,250
So, I guess we'll get stuck
with the investigation.

58
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,625
Uh-huh.

59
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,458
I think it's a pretty crappy
deal if you ask me.

60
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,416
After busting ass
on this Thirds case,

61
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,541
we gotta drop it all
and shift gears.

62
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,750
Uh-huh.

63
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,625
Huh, come in! Chris!

64
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,041
How are you feeling, Ross?

65
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,666
Have you made a full recovery?

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,041
Yeah, I'm fine.

67
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,500
Just takes some getting
used to the new body parts.

68
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,708
Ironic, isn't it?

69
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,916
What?

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,166
Little by little,

71
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,625
you're becoming like the
robots you hate so much.

72
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,916
Let's get down to business,
shall we? Why the new orders?

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,125
The bombings don't need
a full-time investigation.

74
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,375
Maybe they do.

75
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,250
Some people would
think it's justified.

76
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,875
It's politics, isn't it?

77
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,166
I'll tell you what it is!

78
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,125
It's a goddamned order
that you're gonna follow!

79
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,875
I don't need to
explain anything to you.

80
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,250
Just do what you're told to!

81
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,750
Am I supposed to smile,

82
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,041
say "Yes, sir," and
forget what they did?

83
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't think so.

84
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,000
D'anclaude's under full guard.

85
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,333
Yeah right.

86
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,291
in a government hospital
where we can't touch him.

87
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,916
I can't accept the contradictory
report that you filed.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
But, Sir--

89
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,916
I assure you that D'anclaude
is very much alive.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,333
If you don't trust me,
go and see for yourself.

91
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,500
Ironic, isn't it?

92
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,875
Little by little,

93
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,791
you're becoming like the
robots you hate so much.

94
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,666
Do you mean the extortionist?

95
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,666
He's already released.

96
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,125
No, no, René D'anclaude.

97
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,583
Oh yes, the terrorist.

98
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,875
He's still in ICU, I'm afraid.
You can't see him yet.

99
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,208
So what's his condition like?

100
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,208
We have been
sending you updates.

101
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,416
Yes, but I'd like to know more.

102
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,833
Detective,

103
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,458
we've given your department
as much help as we can.

104
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,625
We go through
proper channels here.

105
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,791
That's how

106
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,750
a government-controlled
hospital operates.

107
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,791
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have someone waiting for me.

108
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,333
You've got an impressive
security system here.

109
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,750
It's the best form of
protection from terrorists.

110
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,041
Security guards
are old news, pal.

111
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,416
Huh?

112
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,625
Hey, that's Allen.

113
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,583
What's that Conception
PR jerk doing here?

114
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,958
That's where all my memory
was backed up and stored.

115
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,708
I'm saved for posterity.

116
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,458
And if we're all murdered,
you know-

117
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,208
Will you give it a rest!

118
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,125
Bingo!

119
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,000
Warning.

120
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,333
Only authorized personnel

121
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,416
are permitted within
the memory bank I/O room.

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,291
Please vacate
this area at once!

123
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
We're lost.

124
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,916
Which way is magnetic north?

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,708
There is no department
by that name.

126
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,333
You must vacate
within 10 seconds, or-

127
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,125
Asakura was quite a designer.

128
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,708
He created the ultimate
woman who could kick ass

129
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,958
and raise children!

130
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,750
He designed you, too.

131
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,500
Yeah, but I can't get pregnant.

132
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,000
That's it.

133
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,833
Here goes! I hate that
this is the easiest way.

134
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,250
Hey, hurry up!

135
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,708
Hey, I'm doing this for you,
it hurts like Hell, so shut up!

136
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,666
I need to know about myself.

137
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,625
Who am I and why.

138
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,625
I'll look.

139
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,875
I'm searching
for Asakura's file.

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,958
Armitage...

141
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,416
Help me out!

142
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,916
My virtual monitor.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,958
Yeah?

144
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,041
Open it from my
navigational system.

145
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,541
Good, I've located
the still image file.

146
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,416
Hold on, just another second.

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,541
D'anclaude.

148
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,541
I don't believe it.

149
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,000
Sylibus here.

150
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,708
Where have you been?
The lieutenant's pissed.

151
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,041
Snoopin' for information.

152
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,041
Isn't that what detectives do?

153
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,500
On the old case?

154
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,583
The reception's
breakin' up. Call ya later.

155
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,708
See ya!

156
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,416
Wait! I've got some
hot news for you.

157
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,958
Well, the board from
a puppet bomb that carried

158
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,708
the self-explosion program,

159
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,041
looked identical
to a Third-type board.

160
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,041
Why?

161
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,625
Why is my daddy standing
there with D'anclaude?

162
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,458
Julian!

163
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,583
Damn it! I think
someone's discovered me.

164
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,083
We're logging out now!

165
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,791
Hey!

166
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,958
Oh, god! Something's in me!

167
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,166
Please help me!

168
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,750
Little Naomi Armitage.

169
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,833
Went looking for knowledge
and only found trouble.

170
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,833
You can't stop the Third types
from being killed, my dear.

171
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,500
Shoot me. I don't mind.

172
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:50,500
Shit! Asshole, get out!

173
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,000
Quite a setup you got here.

174
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,541
With female robots, is this
your "Home Robotization" plan?

175
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,875
Looks like illegal application.

176
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,958
Who the hell do you
think you are?

177
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,916
I don't deal with cop trash--

178
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:11,500
Well, dickhead, I left my badge
at home, so I'm off duty.

179
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,000
Now you say so.

180
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:17,208
So tell me, who the
hell's in ICU, huh?

181
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,125
D'anclaude.

182
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,708
Don't fuck with me, asshole!

183
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,500
That crazy bastard's out there.

184
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,375
No! It's really him.
He's Dr. René D'anclaude,

185
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,541
originator of the assassinroid.

186
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,791
No way!

187
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,875
Then it was a robot
who attacked us?

188
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,875
Of course, he's a robot.

189
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,666
His design was based
on character data

190
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,291
of Dr. D'anclaude.

191
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,541
Pull the trigger. I dare you.

192
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,625
So, you're not a man.

193
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,208
Are you a Third type?

194
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,541
Please. You won't find
my name in the membership

195
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,541
of that club for failures.

196
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,041
What do you mean?

197
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,666
You make me retch.

198
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,000
Cheap imitations
pretending to be human.

199
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,208
There's no comparison
to our superiority.

200
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,416
I couldn't agree with
humans more on one thing:

201
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,583
all Thirds should
be annihilated.

202
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,250
I'll kill you!

203
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,291
Julian!

204
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,166
That bastard's
not the original.

205
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,750
Oh my god!

206
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,833
What's wrong?

207
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,500
Don't touch me.
This thing might infect you!

208
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,083
Get back!

209
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,208
Talk, you little shithead.

210
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,708
Tell me about the
assassinroids, now!

211
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,875
Armitage...

212
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,875
Goodbye.

213
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,416
Oh, no, Julian, no!

214
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,666
Sylibus here.

215
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,750
Hello?

216
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,291
Damn thing.

217
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,458
Ross. If you can hear me,
I need your help.

218
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,250
Armitage...

219
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,875
So, one of my men got
a little carried away, well...

220
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,791
I'm Judicial
Vice Minister, Jusup,

221
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,583
and I'm visiting as
a representative of

222
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,916
the Legal Affairs Bureau.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,375
I need an accurate picture
of the MPD's operations.

224
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm just a bit confused.

225
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,833
Help me to understand why

226
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,500
an inspector from
Earth's government

227
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,541
has come here.

228
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,166
Oh, don't mind me, Lieutenant.

229
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,750
I'm simply an observer
for Mr. Jusup.

230
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,708
Think of me merely as
a fly on the wall.

231
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,708
Hmm.

232
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,166
Well, since you're observing,
I'm sure you have noticed

233
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,708
that the robots here on Mars

234
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,833
don't quite reflect
a feminist society.

235
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:41,291
Very well. You understand us,
uh, Mr. uh...

236
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,708
Randolph.

237
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,041
Let's call it
a day and have lunch.

238
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sick of the
whole damn system.

239
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,916
Armitage...

240
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,083
Didn't Julian say that

241
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,875
he had his memory backup
stored somewhere?

242
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,500
The backup?

243
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,708
That's right.

244
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,625
If we can somehow
access his data,

245
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,458
we could still bring him back.

246
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,666
Get it?

247
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,666
His body's gone,
but his mind's alive.

248
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,041
Funny, I didn't think
I would miss him so much.

249
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,916
Maybe his information will help
us and avenge his death as well.

250
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,583
Ross...

251
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,750
come with me.

252
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,458
Looks like the
lieutenant was right.

253
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,250
Humans don't go where
I'm going. Only robots.

254
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,541
Ross.

255
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,916
Where are we?

256
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,708
Whoa.

257
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,833
We're inside the program.

258
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,541
Well, you sure took
your own sweet time.

259
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,916
Julian!

260
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,208
Huh? What?

261
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,708
I'm glad you're here.

262
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,375
Everyone is here.

263
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,625
Other Thirds.
The murdered ones.

264
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:29,291
So many of us are here,
we don't suffer from loneliness.

265
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,583
A kindred reunion

266
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,833
All of them are my sisters.

267
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,958
It's too bad they lack
the sufficient data,

268
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,791
which would enable them to talk.

269
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,583
I'm sorry. I feel so helpless.

270
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,958
Hey, it's not so bad.

271
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,958
I'm actually having fun.
You can learn a lot in here.

272
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,708
For instance, I've got the
lowdown on D'anclaude now.

273
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,541
Do you mean the original one?

274
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:55,125
Yes. He and Asakura
developed all the Third types.

275
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,666
Then, do you know
where they are now?

276
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,083
Well, Asakura's files
have been completely erased.

277
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,208
But I know where D'anclaude is.

278
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,708
Shinora?

279
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,333
Right where he's
been all this time.

280
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,958
You should go now.

281
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,333
If you stay too long,

282
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,875
you might not get back.

283
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,291
I'll return. I promise.

284
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,125
K. I'll be waiting.

285
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,041
What's up?

286
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,000
The internal troops are active.

287
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,000
Are we at war?

288
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,500
No. They're guarding.

289
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,541
What, the President?

290
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,166
No, Shinora Hospital.

291
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,625
Shinora?

292
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,208
Jesus H. Christ, would
you look at that arsenal!

293
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,000
What the hell are
they doin' there?

294
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Hold on a minute.

295
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,708
I'm picking up something.

296
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,125
What is it?

297
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,750
Aw, it's just a car.

298
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,250
Holy shit!

299
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,416
They've lost it.

300
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,791
Fire!

301
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,083
Here.

302
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,458
It's him.

303
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,125
Finally, the real D'anclaude.

304
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,583
Or I should say
Dr. René D'anclaude.

305
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,500
You must be...

306
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,208
Asakura's daughter,

307
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,750
the failure.

308
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,166
We gotta hurry! Come on!

309
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,541
Let's go, while we still can.

310
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,458
What's the matter?

311
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,708
Ross,

312
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,125
something's coming.

313
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,416
What is it?

314
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,083
Not again.

315
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,416
D'anclaude! But it can't be.

316
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,125
Hey, let's rumba!

317
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,875
Over here!

318
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,291
This way, hurry!

319
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,208
Wait, don't run off!

320
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,541
I wanna play with you.

321
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,750
Come on! Wait!

322
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,916
There's no way that damn
gargoyle is a Third type!

323
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,666
Hmm. My, look who's talking.

324
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,041
Don't tell me you have no
clue who your brother was.

325
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,791
You have more in common
with that prototype gargoyle

326
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,750
than you might realize.

327
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,916
Did you truly believe
you were a Third?

328
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,083
Liar!

329
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,041
You could always ask Asakura,

330
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,791
but he's tucked safely away
in a dome on Danich Hill.

331
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,583
Armitage, don't stop.

332
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,166
No!

333
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,208
Oh no, I can always tell when
you're gonna do something crazy.

334
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,916
Hi kids.

335
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,416
Oh, does she want a showdown?

336
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,041
We're both gonna bite it.
That'll make everyone happy,

337
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,833
cause you know, nobody
on Mars wants us here.

338
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,083
Wrong! I'll have the last laugh.

339
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,500
Don't!

340
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,166
No, Armitage!

341
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,583
We can no longer
return to the city.

342
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:37,958
First, they denied us life. Then
they tried to erase our past.

343
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,458
But I'm not going to run.

344
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,458
I'm staying right here.

345
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:45,916
Armitage III, episode 4,
"Bit of Love."

346
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,375
Ross, we're not gonna
die this time, are we?
