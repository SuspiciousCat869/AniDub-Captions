1
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,041
Attention ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,958
we are now on final approach
to our destination port

3
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,541
of St. Lowel,
the largest city on Mars.

4
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,666
We hope you had
a pleasant flight.

5
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,333
Today's temperature is a
cool eleven degrees Celsius.

6
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,458
The oxygen percentage
rating is seven percent.

7
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,208
Reports have come in of slight
unrest throughout the city

8
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,375
due to public demonstrations.

9
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,500
As a precaution,
we recommend using

10
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,291
the airport shuttle
service for your safety.

11
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,250
We hope you have an enjoyable
time during your stay on Mars.

12
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,791
Aw, c'mon Kelly.

13
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,208
Babe, we've got
a schedule to keep.

14
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,500
You can't break the rules
like you did on Earth.

15
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,041
I'm sick and tired of working,

16
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,625
and I just want
some time on my own.

17
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,083
Why are you being so selfish?

18
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,083
I hope my guitar's alright.

19
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,416
Well, we paid enough.

20
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,833
Cargo room costs bucks.

21
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,166
Don't worry, Babe.

22
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,000
Your guitar is treated
like a national treasure.

23
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,125
Please remain seated and
keep your seatbelts fastened

24
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,375
until we've come to a full stop.

25
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,041
We wish to thank our passengers
for their patronage,

26
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,458
and we look forward to
servicing you in the future.

27
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,041
Have a nice day.

28
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,833
Hmm?

29
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,708
It's the cargo room.

30
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,541
Huh?

31
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,541
I'm sure McCanon would
love to give an autograph!

32
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,416
Home on the range.

33
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,625
Hey, watch out!

34
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,250
Freeze, get your hands up!

35
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,791
I said, "Get your
hands up!" Now!

36
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,416
What's up?

37
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,875
Detective, you'd
better stay back.

38
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,125
Handle it.

39
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,666
Get back!

40
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,833
Tell me you're
packin' a gun, Sheriff.

41
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,916
How 'bout you?

42
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,458
Shit. Cowboys out the ass,
and not one of 'em's got a gun.

43
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,875
Stop, now!

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,416
Lemme down! Lemme down!

45
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,125
Look, the bastard's
getting away!

46
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,500
What the hell?

47
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,833
Stay out of it, Detective.

48
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,000
This is the MPD,
Detective Sylibus.

49
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,208
Did you have a nice trip?

50
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,791
There's a body in there! Oh no!

51
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,000
It's McCanon

52
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,250
He killed her!

53
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,375
Haha!

54
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,416
Dammit.

55
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,083
Hey, wait! What the
hell are ya doin'?

56
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,750
Stop!

57
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,875
This is insane.

58
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,083
Her name was Kelly McCanon,

59
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,416
famous country singer.

60
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,041
In fact, the only country singer
in the universe.

61
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,750
I guess this means
they're extinct.

62
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,208
And the suspect?

63
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,583
Tell me, is that
crazy getup you're wearing

64
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,250
standard issue MPD uniform?

65
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,166
Of course not.

66
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,750
What's your name?

67
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,791
The name's Armitage.

68
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,916
Ooh, what a sexy back.

69
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I just love broad shoulders.

70
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:12,916
Huh?

71
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,291
What's that for?
I was just being nice!

72
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:20,000
Hey, is this somebody's
idea of a sick joke?

73
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,750
Annie Oakley here
isn't even human.

74
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,041
It's a damn robot.

75
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,583
What's wrong?

76
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
What's goin' on?

77
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,541
Airport police.
This is their jurisdiction.

78
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,458
Look, they're here.

79
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,375
Great, now we get some answers.

80
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,666
Over here!

81
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,333
Sir, sir, are you with the MPD?

82
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,750
I'm with Mars Broadcasting.

83
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,916
We've heard rumor that
the murdered Kelly McCanon

84
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,250
was actually a robot.

85
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,500
Uh, is this true? There
are conflicting reports.

86
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,083
Can you shed any
light on this at all?

87
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,416
No comment.

88
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,083
I'm reporting from the front of
the Martian Police Department.

89
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,916
An officer from the
scene where country singer

90
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,916
Kelly McCanon's body
was discovered is here now.

91
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,125
He has not, however,
given any information,

92
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,958
and only replies "No
comment," to our questions.

93
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,375
Back to you.

94
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,708
The million dollar question is,
"What do we have here,

95
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,208
a woman or a robot?"

96
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:44,083
The results from my preliminary
findings are, well, uh...

97
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,541
ambivalent.

98
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,333
The, uh, victim,
shall we call her,

99
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,791
is neither human nor cyborg.

100
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,166
After initially
examining the body,

101
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,541
I concluded she was a robot.

102
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,375
Her body tissue was
clearly of organic origin,

103
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,000
but she functioned through
artificial intelligence.

104
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,208
While no one is capable of
creating a human brain, yet,

105
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,541
her computer brain
was very sophisticated,

106
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,875
and as I mentioned,

107
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,583
her physical construction
was created organically,

108
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,166
but it was done using

109
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,208
a technology much more advanced
than the second series models.

110
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,541
I believe the victim
was a prototype,

111
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
built outside of regulations.

112
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:24,208
It could also, um, mean there
are other illegal models,

113
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,083
like her,

114
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,125
running around under our noses.

115
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,708
Yes, thank you.

116
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,041
Now Detective Sylibus will give
us his report about the scene.

117
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,416
Uh, I'm Officer Ross Sylibus,
from Chicago.

118
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:49,083
The suspect appeared, I mean,
he seemed like he wanted

119
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,916
to transport the body
without anyone noticing.

120
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,916
Hmm, probably to finish his
work somewhere else in private.

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,875
Officer Armitage, there,
had been trailing the suspects,

122
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,416
and all hell broke loose.

123
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,125
Armitage, can you fill us in.

124
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:07,791
Well, I trailed the suspects
and saw they were equipped.

125
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,875
I didn't think they were
carrying a dead robot.

126
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,583
So what the hell does that mean?

127
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,291
That it was McCanon's
imposter riding the shuttle?

128
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,958
Shut up, Eddie.

129
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,083
What did her manager
have to say?

130
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,125
Well, sir, according
to him, he didn't see

131
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,541
any difference between
the woman he sat with and

132
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,833
the real country-western singer.

133
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,791
And nobody saw her come out
of the arriving terminal.

134
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,750
The only suspicious passenger
he saw was Detective Sylibus.

135
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,750
Well, it seems that the real
trick for us is to find out

136
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,500
where the real McCanon is.

137
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,000
You know, maybe she's
feeling her wild oats.

138
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,458
Might've found herself
some kinda wild lover.

139
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,208
Christ, Eddie, will you zip it?

140
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,375
How was she acting
inside the shuttle?

141
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,958
She acted fine. She was
holding a normal conversation,

142
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,500
nothing seemed unusual
about it to me.

143
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,916
Hell, I wouldn'ta been able
to tell her apart from a human.

144
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,500
Uh-huh. Uh...

145
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,916
Are you tellin' us that this
robot was really McCanon?

146
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,708
You think that prima donna was
a machine from the beginning?

147
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,166
No, I'm saying you can't
distinguish it from a human.

148
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,291
Oh, hey Armitage,

149
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,250
when you realized the corpse
was a robot, you were shocked,

150
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
even upset.

151
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:24,041
Did you think something
was wrong? Well, did ya?

152
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,708
No, sir.

153
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,458
Whoa.

154
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,041
The sky is beautiful.

155
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,833
Fourth floor.

156
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,125
Hmm.

157
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,583
Eew, smells stale. Hey,
is that all your luggage?

158
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,000
Well, you know,

159
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,250
with all the excitement
at the baggage claim today...

160
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,000
Just as well, probably stuff
I wouldn't have needed anyway.

161
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,583
There's enough trash
from Earth here already.

162
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,541
Hmm, you do have a point.

163
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,750
Oh, look at this.

164
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,166
This is a tape, sent by
the suspect of yesterday's

165
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,250
St. Lowel spaceport shooting.

166

♪ Here where we belong. ♪

167
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,958
What is this? Some kind
of memorial program?

168
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:54,500

I'll go take care
of the baggage maid.

We have with us,
in the studio today,

183
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,333
famous activist for
the Neo-humanist cause,

184
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,833
Julia Blanshin,

185
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,125
who will offer commentary
on this extraordinary footage.

186
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,875
Welcome, Miss Blanshin.

187
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,250
Contrary to what your
viewers might be expecting,

188
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,416
I'm not here to condemn the
actions of the man we just saw.

189
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,208
Our goal is to eliminate
all robots from every level

190
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,083
of industry and society
and reclaim our humanity.

191
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,875
The same goal as
the suspect may have had?

192
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, perhaps, but we
don't believe the problem

193
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,958
can be solved by
street-level violence.

194
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,458
We advocate
proper social changes.

195
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,833
Jennifer!

196
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,000
Hold on! You'll be alright.

197
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,791
You pile of shit!

198
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,958
Come on, you fucker!

199
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,958
Come on! Come on!

200
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,750
Amazing, they're
everywhere ya look.

201
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,083
You'd think they
could build something else.

202
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,875
You're here pretty early,
Detective.

203
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,583
Hmm?

204
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,958
She's gone already,

205
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,916
the badge-toting
terror in hot-pants.

206
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,166
Hey, want some free advice?

207
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,166
Don't kill your
partner this time.

208
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:08,416
Here's one more thing, when she
puts on her visor, watch out.

209
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,916
Oh, before I forget, here.

210
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,250
She's clean, gassed,
and waitin' downstairs.

211
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,666
And welcome to your new home.

212
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,625
Check it out, it's a Ferrari!

213
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,708
Oh wow, this is too cool!

214
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,000
Hey, has it got
four on the floor?

215
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,458
Nope, it's a fully
guided automatic.

216
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,333
But I drive it myself.

217
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,375
Whoa.

218
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,416
Hey.

219
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,833
Actually, I don't
trust machines.

220
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,250
Listen to that sweet engine.

221
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,375
You know something,

222
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,583
the lieutenant just
bought a new car.

223
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,916
It's a stick-shift.

224
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
Before he got rid of the
old car, he realized that

225
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,541
he'd never driven it
by himself before.

226
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,250
I tried to stop him, well,
before he took it out,

227
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,166
cause you know, it's dangerous,
don't you think?

228
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,916
I mean, a person
that never dro-

229
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,833
Robots, get out!

230
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,833
Robots, get out!

231
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,916
Get out right now!

232
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,250
Get out right now!

233
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,833
Get out right now!

234
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,625
Give us back our jobs!

235
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,250
Give us back our jobs!

236
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,791
I'm sorry to
break you in so soon,

237
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,125
but we may as well get started.

238
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,708
Ah, but Lieutenant,

239
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,041
is our section supposed
to handle this matter?

240
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:56,916
Hmm?

241
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,583
What do you mean by that, Ross?

242
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,916
Well, you see, the victim
was definitely a robot,

243
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,750
so I don't see why MPD should
get stuck dealing with it.

244
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,583
Shouldn't we let some government
agency take it off our hands?

245
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,958
I wish it was that easy,

246
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,625
but it's the robot's origins
that we're interested

247
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,041
in finding out about.

248
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,916
As you may not be aware,
Sylibus, people here consider

249
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,750
illegal robotic technology
and replication to be

250
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,916
a criminal offense!

251
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,750
Yes, sir, I guess so.

252
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,166
Are you going to tell me why
you wanted to transfer to Mars?

253
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,416
Well, no sir.

254
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
As you like,
but let me warn you,

255
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,875
if you have misguided
compassion for robots,

256
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,500
you won't make it here.

257
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,583
Robots, get out!

258
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,333
Robots, get out!

259
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,083
Robots, get out!

260
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,416
Get out right now!

261
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,500
Huh?

262
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,375
Hi!

263
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,666
Hmm, coulda sworn it was
winter outside. That's weird.

264
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,875
Have you been
watchin' the news?

265
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,666
This is a photo of the corpse.

266
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,666
It's being called
a third-series robot.

267
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,958
Know anything about it?

268
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,291
Ah, I see you've
done your research.

269
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,166
Yes, she was
a clever little model,

270
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,041
certainly not mass-produced.

271
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,250
No, it's my guess
she was handmade.

272
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,250
Does your company manufacture
any robots like this?

273
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,583
This is not the type of
robot Hu-Gite manufactures.

274
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,791
That's how we surpassed

275
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,291
the Conception company
and became the best.

276
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,083
We're very proud
of our philosophy,

277
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,458
are you familiar with it?

278
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,125
Ah.

279
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:45,625
Home Robotization. Making
the robot a part of the family

280
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,333
by making it more functional.

281
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,083
A humanoid robot
simply doesn't work.

282
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,833
There has to be a reason and
purpose for a robot's existence.

283
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,166
When they've achieved that,

284
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,250
humans and robots
will live in harmony,

285
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,750
and that's the belief upon
which our company is founded.

286
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,416
Have you noticed how
many different brands

287
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,500
there are running
around here on Mars?

288
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,500
When Mars terraforming began,

289
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,333
history shows
that robots were used

290
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,208
for environmental
testing and labor.

291
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, I'm amazed
we've come this far.

292
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,250
Me, too.

293
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,500
In spite of our progress,
people are afraid.

294
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,500
They misunderstand
the potential of robots.

295
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:30,458
Our hope, our dream,
isn't shared by everyone yet.

296
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,583
Do you hear us?
We want our jobs!

297
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,875
We want our-

298
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,458
Wow, what a place.

299
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,250
Uh, excuse me, Miss.

300
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,791
Why not!?

301
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,708
I'm very sorry,
but I've explained to you

302
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,000
that I cannot
allow you to see him!

303
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:13,208
He doesn't remember
the name Armitage at all?!

304
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,625
Mr. Asakura said
he's never heard of you.

305
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,458
Listen, don't mess with me,
you little bitch.

306
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,041
You'd better get out of here,

307
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,958
or I'll call
the security gadget.

308
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:27,708
Yeah, I guess it's useless
talking to a robot like you.

309
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,666
Hey, whoa!

310
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,250
Uh, just cancel
that appointment.

311
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,208
Robots, get out!

312
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,416
Let me go!

313
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,041
How dare you?
I have business here.

314
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,916
Stop it!

315
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,083
I can't believe this!

316
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,041
Put me down right now!

317
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,708
We want our jobs back!

318
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,916
We want our jobs back!

319
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,416
Just what are you trying
to accomplish back in there?

320
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,041
Robots get out now!

321
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,083
You know if you park here,
your car might get trashed.

322
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,791
Yeah!

323
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,375
Idiots.

324
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,583
So, now what's next?

325
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:06,791
Hmm, immigration
seems a likely place.

326
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,958
Oh Ross, I already went there,

327
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,958
and I couldn't find
our guy on the list.

328
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,833
Hmm.

329
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,458
Oh, I doubt we'll
find any record of him,

330
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:20,708
because 37% of the population
isn't registered here.

331
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,125
So, just who the hell
were you trying to see

332
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,000
at the Conception company?

333
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,166
That is private.

334
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,166
By the way, I've already
done some legwork.

335
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,625
Conception was the company

336
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,500
that set the standards
for the Seconds,

337
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,291
so there you go.

338
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,208
But you know,
I still pity them.

339
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,916
The other manufacturer,
Hu-Gite, passed 'em up,

340
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and it killed their aspirations.

341
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:47,083
Say, does this fancy machine
have reclining seats?

342
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,208
Partner?

343
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:55,000
If you're looking for
a partner, stop flying solo.

344
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,250
Hey, Ross, as your partner,
can I make a suggestion?

345
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,166
What?

346
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,333
Let's eat. I'm starving.

347
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,708
All right.

348
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,500
Ice cream.

349
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,750
Junk food?

350
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,041
I thought we were gonna
get something to eat?

351
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,958
Oh well, whatever.

352
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,083
This is some town.

353
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,291
Things are just
gonna get worse

354
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,625
with all these
remodeled Seconds.

355
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,583
There's no way humans and robots
are gonna get along together.

356
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,333
Besides, you can't trust robots.

357
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,708
You're no different.

358
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,125
You and that guy
are both the same.

359
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,125
What do you mean,
that nutcase?

360
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:31,583
It just seems that both of you
have something against robots.

361
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,750
I'm sick of all these cyborgs
and humanoids and machines

362
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,000
that only seem to copy us.

363
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,583
Since I'm allowed
to make a choice,

364
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,416
I choose not to like something
that pretends to be human.

365
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:41,833
Uh!

366
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,000
Hmm?

367
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,458
Hmph.

368
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,541
You're investigating
her identity.

369
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,583
Is that right, Detective?

370
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:44,833
Yes, it's my job.

371
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:49,208
I wonder... Kelly's fans,
what they must be thinking now.

372
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:53,333
She was the most
human girl I knew.

373
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,291
She was so sensitive
and in touch.

374
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,166
She didn't listen
to her manager, though.

375
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,333
Nope, cause she
always did things her way.

376
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,875
Tell me, how could
she be a robot? Hah!

377
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,500
It's too funny, isn't it?

378
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,083
I don't believe it.

379
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,583
She was a real woman.

380
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,583
I know what you
must be going through,

381
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,708
but did you recall
anything unusual or

382
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:23,458
out of the ordinary with her?

383
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,875
Excuse me.

384
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,958
Please, tell me
she's still alive.

385
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,541
Won't you, huh, huh?

386
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:35,458
Come on, no robot can make a
guitar weep the way Kelly did.

387
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,166
You understand, don't you?

388
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,333
Or sing with the same passion...

389
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,583
Armitage!

390
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,500
Your client is history, buddy.

391
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,416
Just learn to live with it.

392
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,958
Hey!

393
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,458
Hey, wait up! Armitage!

394
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,375
I want to go!

395
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,500
Your conduct was
hardly professional.

396
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,500
Sorry, but that
whiner was an asshole.

397
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:08,000
Maybe you sympathize
with him, but I don't.

398
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,208
The jerk can't figure out how

399
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:16,416
a robot could possibly be as
good as his precious human star.

400
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,916
All of McCanon's
talents, personality,

401
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,958
and dreams were
inside that machine.

402
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,041
Oh my god.

403
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,208
What is it?

404
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,666
I didn't realize.

405
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,500
Sylibus here.

406
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,750
Uh, it's Chris.

407
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,958
I'm receiving a weird
voicemail transmission.

408
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,250
Is Armitage with you?

409
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:50,625
Uh, no. I'm afraid
I don't see her right now.

410
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,458
Okay, listen. It's coming
to us in real time.

411
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,458
So I'll transmit it
to your mailbox.

412
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,458
Log it and show it
to Armitage right away.

413
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,958
I told you! An officer
named Armitage!

414
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,750
Okay, okay, lady. We're
looking for her right now.

415
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,583
Please! You've got to help me!

416
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,041
I'm a Third!

417
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,791
Right, what's your name again?

418
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,500
Wait a second,
alright, go ahead.

419
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:15,416
Manning. It's Jessica Manning.

420
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,375
I'm keeping a list of all
the Thirds from Pluto.

421
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,791
We need protection.

422
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,583
I can't go outside,
because of the protests.

423
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:24,375
And the man on TV
who killed that singer

424
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,250
has been sending me mail!

425
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,583
I know he's nearby.

426
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,916
I know he's watching me!
Something's gonna happen,

427
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,708
unless you help me!

428
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,125
Who are you?

429
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,916
Bye, see you tomorrow!

430
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,791
TV piracy is a felony, pal.

431
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,250
You could get eight years
of hard labor in prison.

432
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,208
Who the hell are you?

433
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,791
I'm René D'anclaude.

434
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,916
Huh?

435
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,750
It's my name.

436
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,958
So just who do you
think you are, mister?

437
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:37,291
There are other things to
concern yourselves with.

438
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,791
Let me show you.

439
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,916
Robots are disguising
themselves as humans.

440
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,666
Am I wrong?

441
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,541
It's my duty
to do something about this.

442
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:55,708
You must be rid of those
so-called Thirds.

443
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:58,250
First contestant:

444
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,583
This is Jessica Manning,

445
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,416
Shit.

446
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,250
a snobbish, bourgeois artist

447
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,875
who lives and works
right here among you.

448
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:08,833
She had you all fooled.

449
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,333
What should we do about her?

450
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,625
Are you okay, miss,
or you need help?

451
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,375
Jessica! Save her please! Why?

452
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,166
It's all right, just wait here.

453
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,666
Lemme through. Police!

454
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,958
Hey!

455
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,958
Huh?

456
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,708
It's them. The list of Thirds.

457
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,416
Yes. And then?

458
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,625
No, wait!

459
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,083
Oh, Jessica.

460
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,541
Huh?

461
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,958
Who-hooooo!

462
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,666
Stop!

463
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,625
Upsy daisy!

464
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,541
If you've come to confess your
sins, it's too late, my son.

465
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:31,958
There's no room for
religion on Mars anymore.

466
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,583
If you like,
I'll listen to you.

467
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,625
What's that?

468
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,875
You say a cyborg
killed your partner?

469
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,166
Then you should join me.

470
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,041
You know, the more
human a robot looks,

471
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:46,458
the more excitement I feel
killing the damn thing.

472
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,250
I wish you'd reconsider, Ross.

473
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:04,333
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

474
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,416
Aww.

475
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,458
I'm just exterminating
vermin, a pestilence.

476
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,583
I'm performing a service.

477
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,875
Why am I made out to be
the bad guy, Ross?

478
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:42,125
Maybe you and I can sit down
over coffee and talk about it.

479
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,583
Oh shit, not again.

480
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,291
Ross, Ross, you're such
a pesky little shit.

481
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,375
Now then, there are lots
of Thirds I have to destroy.

482
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,791
I just can't
have you underfoot.

483
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,750
Hey, sailor. What's this?

484
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:27,833
You've gotta be kidding!
A fake leg?

485
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:31,583
Surely the ironic humor
of this hasn't escaped you.

486
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,458
You're almost a stinking
cyborg yourself, you freak.

487
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,541
What's that?

488
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,333
Huh?

489
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:07,458
It's Armitage.

490
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,791
A bell to mourn the dead.

491
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,791
Don't you think you should
tell your friend there

492
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,583
isn't a god on Mars anymore?

493
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:29,250
D'anclaude, let me tell you why
your crimes won't be forgiven.

494
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:32,333
Why am I here to avenge the
murders of innocent robots?

495
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:35,541
How can I justify the
existence of the Third?

496
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:36,958
I'll tell you!

497
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:40,041
It's in my blood.

498
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,666
It's my destiny.

499
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,083
She's nuts.

500
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,375
Now you'll learn.

501
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,875
The truth is, René,
I'm also a Third.

502
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,166
No you're not.

503
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,083
That's your last mistake.

504
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,333
How can you be a Third?

505
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,458
Your name wasn't
even on my list.

506
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,000
Don't let the name fool you.

507
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,916
I'm hardly third rate.

508
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,375
Let me show you!

509
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,125
Here, bitch!

510
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,541
You like it hot?

511
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,625
You monster.

512
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,916
Huh.

513
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,583
Yeah, that's right,
I'm a monster.

514
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,041
I'm the monster society created.

515
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,916
I'm the thing they blame for
recession and social problems.

516
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,541
I'm the scapegoat!

517
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:37,041
If humans don't want me,
why did they make me?

518
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,125
Don't do it!

519
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,125
Just cuff him.

520
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,625
You're a police
officer first, Armitage.

521
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,875
You know what your duty is.

522
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,291
Robots aren't the
enemy of humans.

523
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:59,541
I learned this from my partner.

524
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:19,083
No, don't look at me.

525
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,166
I don't know what
I'm supposed to be.

526
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,000
I feel like some
kind of hideous puppet.

527
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:43,625
I can walk and talk. And I
can... laugh and I- I can cry.

528
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,125
But I'm still just a doll.

529
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,000
Armitage!

530
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,791
No!

531
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,791
Armitage!

532
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,625
C'mon, kid.
Don't short out on me.

533
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,958
C'mon! C'mon! Get up! Get up!

534
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,458
Hey, Armitage.

535
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,208
Come on, kid,
open up your eyes.

536
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,208
You've gotta wake up now.

537
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,875
Oh thank God.

538
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,458
Thank God? For what?

539
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:49,708
God is human. God made me
in his image. Ha, right!

540
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,250
Do you know what
it's like to be me?

541
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,291
You couldn't possibly
imagine what it's like.

542
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,958
Hey, where you goin'?

543
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,125
Goodbye, Ross.

544
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:55,916
My name is Armitage,
and I am a Third.

545
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,125
Feelings? Yes I have them.

546
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,583
Memories, too.

547
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,208
But where are the other Thirds?

548
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,416
I've got to find them!

549
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,791
Armitage III, Episode 2,
"Flesh &amp; Stone."

550
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,333
Ross, don't follow me.
