00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:14.889 position:50% align:center
Yui, May!

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
I need both of you to attack it!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
[MAY yells]

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
[YUI yells]

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yes, perfect! Hydra!

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
We nailed it!

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
[MAY] This new magic circle
appeared because

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
it's your second time
clearing a dungeon, right?

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yep!

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
This one takes you
back to the city.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
And this one takes you
back to the entrance.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
All right! Are you ladies
ready to do it again?

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.442 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Wait, a time trial?

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50% align:center
Who really wants to do
the same thing

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
over and over again?
That's pretty boring.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
So, I was thinking it would
be a lot more fun

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
to see how fast we can finish.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.535 position:50% align:center
The faster we get through it,

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.120 position:50% align:center
the faster we'll
be able to level up,

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
but I'm still kinda skeptical.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
Same here, sis, I don't
know that we'll do well

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.335 position:50% align:center
since we all have
zero agility.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
I've got a great idea!
Drink this!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
A poison resist potion?

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
You see what I mean? Having zero
agility isn't a problem at all!

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.351 position:50% align:center
I guess not, but still!

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
[MAY]
My eyes are spinning!

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
[GROUP yelling]

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
Okay, you two, do your best!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
[YUI, MAY]
Uh, sure!

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
[MAY yells]

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
Maple, please use Hydra already!

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
Not this time!
I've got a new plan!

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that was fast.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
Quick! Through the magic circle!

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
We went two seconds over?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
So close!

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.685 position:50% align:center
We almost got out of there
in under three minutes.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, Maple?

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
I used my Devour skill.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
We beat the boss in
record time because of it.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Ah.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
Thing is I can only use it
ten times in one day.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
We've got nine more left.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
I'm confident we can get
out in under three minutes.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
All right, if you say so.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best not
to get too dizzy.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
In that case... Let's go!

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yay!

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] As of today, May and Yui
have officially reached

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
level 20!

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
You guys have worked so hard!

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you sure did
a lot in a single day.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I guess you're right!

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
But there's more to it
than just that.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
Really, did something
else happen?

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Our last run came in under
two minutes and 30 seconds.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
We've acquired these skills.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
You got both Conqueror
and Destroyer?

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Conqueror gives the user
double their normal strength!

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.104 position:50% align:center
To get it, you have
to beat the boss

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
a certain number of times
within a set time frame.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[MAY] Destroyer allows
you to take weapons

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
that are normally
two-handed and equip them

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
with only one hand!

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
You can only get it
when you clear a dungeon

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
in under a certain
amount of time.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
So lemme get this straight.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
You two now have double the
strength that you had before?

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
And you can wield
two-handed weapons

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
in one hand?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that was a thing!

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
It's really perfect skills
for both of them,

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
'cause they've maxed
out their attack!

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.968 position:50% align:center
Uh... What's with
the blank stares?

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean,
I figured being with you,

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
they would come back
with some weird new skills,

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
but this is on another level!

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
Blew my expectations
out of the water.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
I suppose May and Yui
have some legit firepower now,

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
don't they?

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
Firepower, huh?

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
Wow, do you mean it?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
[IZ] Sounds to me like some
new weapons are in order!

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
I know just the thing.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
It's the best weapon
I've got on hand.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
Here! Crystal Hammers!

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
[MAY gasps]
So cool!

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Are you sure we can have these?

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
Oh, of course!

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
I'd be delighted if you
used them!

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
[MAY]
Wow, thank you so much!

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
I promise,
we won't let you down!

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hey, guys! Good morning!

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Oh, where's everybody else?

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
They're already gone
for the day.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Kanade's at the library.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
Apparently there's
some quest over there

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
that has to be done today.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
I asked Kasumi to do me
a favor and collect

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
some materials that
I've been needing.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Sally's out with May and Yui
hunting monsters and the like.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
She told me that she
wanted to teach them

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
a few things about dodging
attacks despite having

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
low agility.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
Wow, everyone's working
really hard!

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
I was just about to head out.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
Unless I learn some
new skills or something,

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
I'm worried that I might not
stack up against the others.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
Oh! In that case...

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] I gotta say, I never
thought I'd see the day

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
when she'd lend me
her little partner.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
But let's be real,
I think your master's

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
a little bit too trusting.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
If I felt like it,

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
I could easily ditch the guild
and have you all to myself.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
[SYRUP gasps]

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, I'm not like that.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
I was just making a point.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
[SYRUP sighs]

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] Still, there are
a lot of bad guys out there.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
And since I'm a game
veteran, it's my job

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
to look out for my friends.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
But to be honest, I just
want everyone to enjoy

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.659 position:50% align:center
playing the game, that's all.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
[SYRUP gasps]

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
A hidden dungeon?

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Activate size boost!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelling]

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
Awesome.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
In one hit!

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
We really can carry two!

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[MONSTER 7A growls]

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Nice work! But we've got
to work on your evasion.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER 7A growls]

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
Sally! You rock!

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Too close for comfort though!

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
Even with low agility,
if you see attacks coming,

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
you can still dodge them.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'll teach
you everything I know.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Great!

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[KANADE] And now,
time for the final piece.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
Wait, is it just another
new staff?

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
It's the exact same type
as the one I've got.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
They merged into one--
that's so cool!

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
Let's try this out.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
Spell Stash!

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
Wow!
That is pretty incredible!

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
I wonder if this means
I can store spells that use MP

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
in the Spell Stash and
use them whenever I want!

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
Let's try one, shall we?

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
Store Fireball in
the Spell Stash!

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take 30
minutes just to store it?

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
No choice but to wait, then.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
It takes twice as much
MP as normal.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
Summon Fireball!

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
Didn't use MP that time,
and it's instant cast too.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
So, if you want to
use a skill instantly,

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
you can do it this way by
paying with MP in advance.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
Which means,
if I use Akashic Records,

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
I can store any skill
I get along the way

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
as long as it takes MP!

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
I am such a lucky duck,
aren't I?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] If I botch this attack,
it'll get away.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
Skill Shear!

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
Success.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
That said... I only got one.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
Looks like she's nearby.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Maple? Is that you?

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Thank goodness
you were in the area!

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
What is going on here?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I was thinking I would
collect materials to help out.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
Get this, when I was playing
around with some sheep,

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
I kinda learned a new skill!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
Uh... I get the picture.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Shear!

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Thanks for the help.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
So, um, what skill
did you get, exactly?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
You see...
It's called "Wooly"!

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
Watch this.
I'll show you how I do it.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
Wooly!

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
Now we can have as much
sheep wool as we want!

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
Oh, and check this out, Kasumi.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
If I combine it
with poison magic,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
enemies can't get close!

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
Isn't it awesome?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
I guess, but now I can't get
close to you, either.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wha--?

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
Help me! I can't get
out of this on my own!

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
Somebody's gotta clip
all this wool off of me!

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
I'd love to help,
but my hands are tied

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
till the poison wears off.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.123 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Kasumi!

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
My goodness.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I could watch
this scene all day.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
Shield Attack!

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] So this dungeon's
called "Grave of the Dead," huh?

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
In order to enter,
you have to have died

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
and been revived
four times minimum.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Hmm... hmm.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
I hate to brag, but I'm
pretty much king of dying.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Although, to be fair,
mastering this big 'ol shield

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
was no easy feat.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] Hmm? Hold on.
Did you learn something new?

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
Oh? Those skills
seem powerful, too.

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
I should get something
for clearing it myself,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
Unique Series.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
I would say it's perfect,
but it looks like

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
it might put a curse on me.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS growling]

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU yells]

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] I think it's about
time for me to start getting

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
a little crazy.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
[SYRUP cheers]

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited the guild
is leveling up!

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
I wonder what I should
do in the meantime. Huh.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I went out on my own,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
so I think today's all about
exploring new territory!

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
[DAUGHTER coughing]

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
What's that?

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
[DAUGHTER coughing]

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Poor baby.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that I can't
do anything for you.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
I see.
An NPC in trouble.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
Bet there's a quest here.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Pardon!

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Would you happen to
be a knight, Miss?

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
Not sure how to answer that.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
Miss Knight!
I'm begging you!

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
Please, you must
help my daughter!

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
We have no way to repay you,
but we're desperate!

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
She's very ill. Please!

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I knew it.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
I'd feel awful if
I didn't, so, okay.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Thank you so much!

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
My daughter needs
special medicine,

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
but I don't think I can
retrieve it by myself!

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
I can guide you to it, though,
so take me with you!

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
That's no problem!

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
I can be your escort!

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
So, to complete this quest,

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
the mother has to make it
to the destination

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
without dying.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
Then, I guess we should
start by heading outside

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
the city, right?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Yes! The Spring of Purification
is to the northwest of town!

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
If you take me there,
I'll get the medicine.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] This forest is full
of dreadful monsters.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
Please be very careful,
brave Miss Knight!

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling it won't
matter much, though,

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
since we're flying.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Thank you so much for your help!

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
Now I'll be able
to save my daughter!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
Let's head back!

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER coughs]

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you protecting
me back there!

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
If it hadn't been for you, I
would have perished for sure!

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
Without the protection
of a skilled knight,

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center
I would've been no match
for those terrible monsters

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
in the forest!

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
How can I ever repay you?

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Uh...

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
Escaping the forest was
supposed to be kinda difficult,

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center
wasn't it?

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
That's why her
dialogue seems odd;

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
the quest is usually harder.

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
A true hero, risking life
and limb for strangers

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
like us!

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
It's incredibly selfless of you.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Jeez. I feel like
I should apologize.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
[DAUGHTER coughs]

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
I feel a little better.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, your cough
still sounds awful.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
Dear me, what to do?

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
This must be one
of those quest chains

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
I've heard people talk about.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
Miss Knight!

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
Are you willing
to help out us again?

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
I can't just give up now!

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
So, what do we need
to do this time?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
I've heard talk of a ring
that heals the body.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
I think it can be found
in a distant land,

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
near a large city.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
If you could just
find that for me...

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
A large city, huh?

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
Could she mean the
city on the First Level?

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
In that case,
the ring might be...

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
Miss Knight!
I can't believe you found it!

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
--So fast!
--[MOTHER] Oh!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
How could I ever
thank you enough?

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
Huh? That's all it is? Really?

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine all the
trouble you went through

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
to retrieve this
magic ring for us!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
I will be forever in
your debt Miss Knight!

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
Uh... I really
didn't do anything.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
Now, then, let's put
this on your finger.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
[DAUGHTER yells]

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?

00:15:56.664 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
[DAUGHTER screaming]

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
Gah! What happened to her?

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Go figure.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Miss Knight!

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed you're going
to lend us your help again!

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
Well, I've come this far,
so of course!

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center
I just need your help
with the next few steps.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER] I believe she went
to the Temple of Darkness.

[MONSTERS growling]

Hydra!

[MOTHER gasps]

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
So now what?

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
I can't use my Venom Capsule
and protect the mother 

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
at the same time!

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
And there's too many to Devour!

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
Huh? They're gone?

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
I suppose the holy water
that she used earlier

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
must have just taken effect!

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] You mean the
water from that spring?

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Yes!

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
It seems my daughter
wasn't sick--

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
she was possessed by a demon!

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Okay, let's figure this out.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
It seems like you might
get the second quest

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
whether you complete
the first quest or not,

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
but I'm not quite sure.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Since I finished it
with no problem,

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
the girl was able to drink the
holy water at the perfect time,

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
so the ghosts all got
wiped out really fast.

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
There is no way I could ever
thank you enough for this.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
But... now my daughter
won't open her eyes!

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
I've no idea what to do,
Miss Knight!

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
Please help me!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
Right, so in other words,

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
another quest dialog box
is about to pop up.

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
So it's an extra quest?

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
Loving Sacrifice, huh?

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
A church in ruins?

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
There is an old church
in the south forest.

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
I think this message might
be referring to that one!

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.538 position:50% align:center
All right! Wait here!

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
Miss Knight, what is that?

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
I don't know, but I'd
like to try it out!

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
Miss Knight! What's happening?

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
Many thanks.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
I was protecting this
child from monsters

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
when my powers were
stolen by a great darkness.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
I was unable to leave the poor
darling until this moment.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
[GODDESS A] It very nearly cost
this poor little soul her life.

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
As thanks, I shall bestow a
portion of my power to you now.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, hi, Mom.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER]
My love!

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Seems like a weird way
to end things if you ask me,

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
but I guess it means
this case is closed.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 2A]
Acquired skill Loving Sacrifice.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hey, Iz!

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
Do you maybe have
it in you to make me

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
a brand-new full set of gear?

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
You know it!

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Ta-da!

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
Ah!

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
That's the new stuff
Iz made for you?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
The color is phenomenal!

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's like a whole
new version of you!

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
You look lovely, Maple!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
Pretty!

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
But, like... There's more
to it than looks, right?

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
If not, you could've just
showed off your new gear

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
at the guild house, am I right?

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
You know me so well! Actually...

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
I brought you all here
'cause wanted to show you

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
a new skill of mine!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
Oh, then, this should be good.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
Loving Sacrifice!

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
I had the same reaction
when I saw it.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
Here they come!

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS growl]

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
What's going on?

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
[IZ]
This is her new skill.

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
Every party member within
range of Loving Sacrifice

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
is being protected
by Cover right now.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
So that means as long
as we're standing

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
in this circle of light,
then essentially,

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
we'll all have the same
defenses as Maple?

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
I do take a sizable hit
of HP initially though!

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
Man, this is way overpowered.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
So as long as Maple's alive,

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
the rest of us benefit and
are practically invincible.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
That's right,
and we all know that taking

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
Maple down is pretty
much an impossible feat.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
As long as we stay
by Maple's side...

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
...then this skill makes
us kind of immortal?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
By the way,
what's your vitality at?

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Um... I'm not quite sure.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
I do know I went over
one thousand, though.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
[IZ] Maple is truly
our guardian angel!

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center
[PAYNE] Now then,
regarding the guild competition.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
Besides the "Flame Emperors,"
there's another guild

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
that concerns me.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
"Maple Tree."

00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
[FREDERICA]
Maple's guild, obviously.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, when I first
met that lost newbie,

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
I had no clue
she'd be this strong.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
[FREDERICA] And on top of that,
isn't that blue-armored girl

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
from the second event
a member of Maple Tree?

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
She seems pretty dangerous.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
It all depends
what the event is.

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
But we can crush them
with our resources.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
Worst-case scenario,
Payne can do something.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
[DRAG] Every member
of our guild is powerful

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
in their own right.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't have any issues
if we can get poison resist.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
[PAYNE]
Ah. Yes.

00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
What scares me most
is the unknown.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
So we need to
research the enemy.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
You're always such a worrywart.

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
[PAYNE]
There's a third event scheduled,

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
and it's before the
guild competition.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.369 position:50% align:center
That gives us the perfect
opportunity to keep an eye

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
on Maple and her Maple Tree.

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:11.456 position:50% align:center
Let's see how they
fare, shall we?
