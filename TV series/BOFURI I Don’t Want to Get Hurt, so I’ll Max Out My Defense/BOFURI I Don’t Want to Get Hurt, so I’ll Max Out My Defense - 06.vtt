Oh, good morning, Risa!

It's weird, but it feels
like it's been forever

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
since we went to school.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.484 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
But the truth is,
it's only been one night.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
On that note, you should
probably be careful today.

it spent a whole week

[RISA]
Well...

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
There's a new insect

that only appears
in select zones.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
And if you catch one,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
you'll get the exclusive right
to buy a guild house!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I'm not sure what that means.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center

there's a bunch of buildings

those Bright Bug thingies

Jeez, I had no idea
house hunting would be

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
such hard work.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
Yeah, all of the good ones
are either super expensive

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
or already taken.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
'Cause the guilds have been
expanding like crazy lately.

Well, you see...

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
Take the "Flame Emperors"
we saw at the last event.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Their guild master, Mii,
has tons of charisma,

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
and she's been recruiting new
members like nobody's business.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
Her guild is absolutely
massive now.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
And some of the winners
from the first event

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
got together and formed the
"Order of the Holy Sword."

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
Payne's the guild master.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
And Dread and Drag
also joined up.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
I think that Frederica girl
Drag told us about

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
is also in it.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
Oh, and get this!

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center

Payne's already level 60!

You gotta be kidding me!

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I'm over here
struggling to get past level 30.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
If I think about it,

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
Payne is probably the
number-one player in the game.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
Sounds like he's really strong.

This might be the one, Sally!

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
Kinda reminds me
of a secret hideout.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
It's bigger than I thought!

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
So, you think we should buy it?

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. It's perfect!

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center

this house is officially ours!

Thank goodness.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
It seems to have Syrup
and Oboro's approval.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Yeah, but don't you think
it's a little big for just us?

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center
According to this, we can
recruit up to 50 people

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
for our guild.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center

Kasumi and Kanade!

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center

For sure, I really
appreciate the invite.

If I'd known you two
were making a guild,

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
I would have asked to join
it back when the last event

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center

We met at the medal hunt.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
Yep! And Kasumi
and Kanade just agreed

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
to be our newest members.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
Oh. I know!

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
If you guys are
looking for a guild,

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
you're welcome to join ours!

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center

Uh...

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as you two
are the ones running it.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
Then okay, you can count me in.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
Same here.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
But only if everyone's
cool with it.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
So? What do you guys say?

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
Sure. Don't see why not.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
That's great!

Do you mind if they join, Sally?

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
Course not! On to the next step.

[IZ]
Agreed! It's so cozy and cute!

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] We're making Maple
the guild master, right?

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
What? But why me?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
You're the one who decided
which house to get,

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
and you picked our members.

Time for your introduction.

Uh... What? Speech?

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
Well... My name's Maple and
I guess I'm the guild master?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
My strengths are
poison and vitality.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best to lead you!

[GROUP clapping]

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
I think the only thing left
is picking a guild name.

a ton of cool things.

I can't guarantee that
I'll get the same skill

First, we'll start with Kuromu.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
He has a suggestion for us.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
Right, as you guys
may have heard,

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
the admins made an announcement.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
It was about the third
and fourth events.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
Plus a few things
about the third level

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
that's about to open up.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
Sounds quite extensive.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
With the influx of new players,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that the admins
think the updates

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
are worthwhile.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
The third event is in one week.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
There's gonna be a
special monster to fight,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
and players will have
the chance to collect

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
what it drops.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty
straightforward concept.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
The fourth event presents
a bigger problem.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Isn't it a guild competition?

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
Yep.
And from what I've heard,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
time's gonna be sped up
like the second event.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
There's no telling
how many of our members

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
will be busy and
unable to log in.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
Maple Tree doesn't
have many members.

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
With that in mind,

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
if someone's out, it'll hurt
our chances at placing.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
Exactly. Not good.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
So my suggestion is that
we should try to recruit

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
more members.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
I see.
That might be a wise idea.

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with having
a few more friends.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
As the guild's crafter,
I'm on board.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
More members means
more work for me.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
In that case, let's go ahead
with his suggestion!

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I know we gotta
find more members,

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
but what kind of people should
we be trying to recruit?

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
That's a good question,

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
but that's for the
guild master to decide.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
Man. So much responsibility!

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
Look, there's a bulletin board.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
Players can use it to recruit
for guilds and parties.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll give you some leads.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Looks like DPS
is in popular demand.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
That's good to know.

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Yeah, but I don't see
anyone that would work for us.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
Recruiting on the second
level might be kind of tough.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
So, let's go down to one.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center

any strong players

still chilling on
the first level, though.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
It's okay if they're not strong.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
I just wanna have fun.

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Well then, let's go.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
I bet we'll have
better luck down there.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
Whoa, it feels like
it's been forever!

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
We haven't had a reason
to come back here.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Sure feels nostalgic,
doesn't it?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm gonna
go check around.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
I don't get it; why don't
other parties want us?

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think
maxing out was a bad idea.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center

to level up

maxed out like this.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.227 position:50% align:center
True.

like a ton of time

in the game, though.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center

to start over.

new players I'm scouting!

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Oh, them?

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
If that's who you want,
then it's totally fine by me.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
So... You guys in?

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
What should we do, Yui?

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
Why don't we all
go talk about it?

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
Oh. There's that awesome
café down here, 'member?

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah! True! Let's go there.

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Well?

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
We could get to know
each other over some tea

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
or something.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
What do you think, sis?

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
Delicious!

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
This is a really nice café.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
I know!
Everything is our treat, okay?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
So help yourselves!

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
My name is Sally.

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
And this girl is Maple.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
What are your names?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
My name is Yui.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
This is my twin sister.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'm May.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
I heard you say you
maxed something out?

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
Yes. Both my sister and I
decided to max our attack.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
But that means we
have zero agility,

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
so we walk super slow.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
Boy, do I feel that!

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
Plus having zero agility is
like the worst thing ever

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
in a battle.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
It's not just in the game.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
we're pretty small in real life.

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
We're not even remotely strong.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
You guys kind of
remind me of Maple.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
You make your own playstyle,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
and don't worry about
the game's mechanics.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]
Yeah, guilty.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean you're
maxed out too, Maple?

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
Yep, sure am.
I'm vitality all the way!

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
She's famous up
on the second level.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
Nah. Jeez, stop exaggerating
so much, Sally.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
Awesome! Maxing out your stats
can actually be successful?

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
I'm not really sure
you wanna use Maple

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
as an example,
but yeah, I guess.

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
Well, Sally?

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
Is it cool to add
them to the guild?

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. Go for it!

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
Besides, most of the flaws
with maxing out your strength

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
will vanish once you
add Maple into the mix.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
If anything, we just need
to level you up a bit

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
before the next event.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] But it really
comes down to you guys

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
and whatever you wanna do.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
We would love to join you.

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
Sorry if this is kind
of a surprise.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
But it's a faster way to travel.

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
[MAY]
Huh?

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
It's not that surprising.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center
I've actually heard
rumors about a player

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
who travels around
on a flying turtle.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
I know it's weird,

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
but you'll have to get
used to this kind of stuff.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
With Maple, you never
know what kind of

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
wacky ideas she'll come up with.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
This place takes me back!

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
Though I don't remember much
since I got knocked out

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
last time.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
We need you to come with us
to the second level.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
So we'll form a group with you,
and then take down the boss!

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
Uh, right.

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
You sure about this?

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
Like we said earlier,
the two of us

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
aren't very good fighters.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
Apologies in advance
in case we die or something.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
Hey. You two have
nothing to worry about.

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you guys hang back here
and I'll handle the boss.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
Sally's beaten it before, so she
knows how to deal with it.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
But can you really beat
that monster by yourself?

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.210 position:50% align:center
It is a boss, after all.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Trust us,
everything'll be fine, okay?

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
Oboro!

00:18:58.596 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
[OBORO squeaks]

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
Oboro. Shadow Clone!

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
[OBORO squeaks]

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
Awesome! I had no idea
Oboro could do those things!

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Sally is super amazing!

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
How does she dodge like that?

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
She's even cloned herself!

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
And why is she glowing?

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Pretty cool, right?

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
It's called Sword Dance.

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Whoa!

Crap! It managed to recover!

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
So annoying!

00:19:58.448 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
Hey. Heads up!

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:02.369 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI yell]

00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
I've got this.

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
Fireball!

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
Wind Cutter!

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
Now Double Slash!

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
There! Done and done.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Wow. You really took
that thing on solo!

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
And Maple protected us!

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
Save some of your
excitement for the guild.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
We have so many
amazing people there.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
You're gonna love it!

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
But... You sure you
want us to join you?

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
You're all so strong,
and we're still so weak.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
I said it's cool.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
With our help you two will be
strong in no time!

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.298 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
And there you have it!

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
Please welcome our
newest guild members.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
Say hello to May and Yui.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for having us.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd
meet someone else

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
who maxed out their stats.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
That's Maple for you.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
She sure knows how to pick
out the unique players.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, the guild
competition is still a ways off.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
So starting tomorrow, we're
gonna pile the levels on you.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
Please let me know if
there's anything I can do

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
to help, okay?

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Thank you all so much!

I'm sorry!

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
Forgive us!
It was an accident, I swear!

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's fine.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
What's a little broken
table among friends?

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
We're good!

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
So that's what happens when
you max out your strength.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
Talk about real
forces of nature!

[GROUP chattering]

When I look at May and Yui,

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
it's weird, but they really
do remind me of Maple.

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
What if they level up and end up
becoming just like her?

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:00.945 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong, Sally?

Huh? Nah. It's nothing.

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:07.577 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking about
our new guild a bit,

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.371 position:50% align:center
and how much fun it'll be!

Yeah, for real! It's great!
