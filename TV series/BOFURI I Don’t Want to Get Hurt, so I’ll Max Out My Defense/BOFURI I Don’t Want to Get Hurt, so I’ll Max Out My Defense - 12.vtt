And what was that crazy
monster Maple turned into?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
She must have got it
by cheating somehow,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
it's so not fair!

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
She didn't cheat.

I'm sure it came
from some event.

to nerf Maple again

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A] So we're taking a
hands-off approach?

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
[ADMIN A]
Correct!

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
After all, Maple's a very
charming player

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
when you're not too busy
nerfing her to notice.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A]
Let's have some fun with this!

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
Who wants to take
a guess at what kind of

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
craziness she's up to right now?

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
[ADMIN B]
I bet she's relaxing at base!

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Probably playing board games
with her guild mates!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
[ADMIN C] Practicing flying
with Machine God!

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A] Or sitting inside
her giant turtle's mouth!

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
[ADMIN A] Perhaps she's
munching on a weapon

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
to see if it teaches
her a new skill?

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
[ADMIN B]
Maybe she's eating the turtle!

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
[ADMIN C]
All right, here it comes!

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
The answer is...

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Do it! Do it!

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
[ADMINS groan]

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Whew, it's all over!

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
Our guild came in third place!

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
And it looks like we went
way over our goal!

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
Woohoo!

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we placed higher
than I thought we would.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
Problem is, we're gonna
be a pretty big target

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
whenever the next event happens.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about next time;
everything'll work out!

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Risa,
I'm really thankful

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
that you introduced
me to this game.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
It turned my entire
life upside-down!

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
In a good way, I mean.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
Make sure to keep up
with your grades, though.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
If you get grounded
from video games,

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
we'll be stuck without
our guild master.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
Oh, shoot! That reminds me,
I have English class tomorrow!

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
I better study!

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Without further ado.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
It's time for us to
kick off the big party

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
to celebrate the
fourth in-game event!

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
Maple Tree did an awesome
job and got third place!

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
Which means,
five silver medals apiece!

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
Not just that,
but everyone in the guild

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
will be rewarded with
a sweet 5% bonus

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
to all of their stats!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's great news
and all, but...

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
...what are all these
people doing here?

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I'd like to
know the same thing.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
We were about to go
on a hunting trip

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
like usual when Maple
saw us in town

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
and insisted we stop by.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
So really, there was no escape.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
She was kind enough
to invite us here.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
It would've been
rude to tell her no.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
It was the same for us.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
Plus, we were curious
to see what kind of place

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
Maple Tree is.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
I've never been inside
an enemy guild before,

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
so I'm a little bit nervous.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
There are no sides
when the event is over.

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Plus, we've already added
them as friends, anyway.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's what our
guild master wants,

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
then I guess it's okay with us.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
Attention, everyone!

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
Let's toast to all
of our success!

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
Ready?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
[DORAZOU]
Rawr!

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
Now then.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
It's time to check out some
of the most interesting

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
moments from the fourth event!

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
Let's begin with Volume One:
"Maple Tree's Fierce Battle!"

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
This is the night
I botched everything!

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
Self-Destruct was a real waste.

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
I thought it'd be good
for some payback.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
You picked on the wrong person.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
Maple, what's your
vitality at now?

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
I think it broke five digits?

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
Okay, that explains a lot.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we never stood a chance.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
We'll win next time.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier now that
we know what Maple's

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
capable of.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
She'll probably be
stronger by then.

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.318 position:50% align:center
Knowing her,
she'll discover more skills

00:21:58.401 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
that are even weirder.

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
Good point, you never
can tell with that one.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
Take your eyes off her
and she turns into

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.410 position:50% align:center
some huge monster.

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone, guys. I'm just
playing the game normally,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.708 position:50% align:center
the same as you.

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah, right!

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
Huh?!
