[KAEDE laughs]

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
Wow, this is so cool!

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. It's pretty enough
to give me chills.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center
We're gonna get to spend
a whole week together!

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
Two girls out on their own,
adventuring in the wild!

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
I mean, it may be
a week in the game,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
but it's really only two hours.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
True, you've got a good point.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's try and get
20 medals between us!

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
We won't try; we will!

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yeah!

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Remember when
we were all excited?

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.599 position:50% align:center
[RISA] And then we found nothing
but an endless field of grass?

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
I'd pay money
for a hint right now.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.478 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
Typically, you receive
items from boss drops,

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
or you can find hidden
treasures in, like,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.109 position:50% align:center
mazes or whatever.

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
Think that's the case?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
Whoa. What? Where'd you go?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hey! Sally!

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.785 position:50% align:center
Uh... Wait.
Where the heck are you at?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Here! Down in the hole!

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Hole? Is this a trap?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
How weird.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You found me! Yay!

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
It looks like a pretty big drop.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
Like how's your HP?

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.720 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm totally fine!

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.305 position:50% align:center
My HP's full!

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yeah, of course it is.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.224 position:50% align:center
Hey. Get this.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
There's a secret tunnel
thing down here!

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
A tunnel? Clear a spot!

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
Incoming swashbuckler!

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.402 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
You think it's a dungeon?

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
Let's move.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.328 position:50% align:center
Whoa. That's a huge door.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
You ready for this?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
Here goes.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
Yep. I'm ready!

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50% align:center
Uh, is it empty?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
Dunno.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
But stay on guard.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
[MONSTER A growls]

[KAEDE grunts]

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
A knockback?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Maple?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
Zero damage times
anything is still zero!

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
Now it's my turn.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
Super speed!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center

[KAEDE]
Hooray!

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Wow, that was a quick fight.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
For real.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
Hey. What was that
weird move of yours?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you mean Cover Move?

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool, right?

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
You take on double
damage if you use it,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
but now I can keep up with you!

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet you're the
first person to ever use it

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
as a movement skill.

Cool! They're medals!

Looks like there's
two of 'em! Go us!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center
Just think, if you hadn't
been so clumsy

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
and fallen into that hole,
we never would've gotten them!

Hey, come on!

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
It looked like grass;
how could I have known?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
[RISA chuckles]
Anyway.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
I'd say we're off to
a pretty good start!

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Mm-hmm.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I bet that circle will
teleport us out of here.

Sounds good!

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Okay, then.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
What's our next step?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna keep
pushing forward?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
Who knows, maybe we'll
find a couple more

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
hidden dungeons on our
way to the mountain.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
I'm down!

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
Let's do it.

[KAEDE groans]

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
We're here!

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
This is so weird.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
There's snow everywhere, but it
doesn't feel cold or anything.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
Yeah.
Hooray for in-game mechanics.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Maple! Come see--

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
It's Kuromu!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
Oh, what's up, Maple?

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
And your name was Sally.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Her friend?

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
Whoa, we're not here for
a fight, are we, guys?

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're cool.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
We don't wanna start anything.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
That's good,
'cause I don't wanna fight

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
against people I know either.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
Okay then, I'm cool with
it as long as you are.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center
But if you try anything,

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
I'll crush you.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. I don't doubt it.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
It's good to be careful though.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
Some players in this
event are really into

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
snagging medals in a PvP fight.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Hold on, have you
been having trouble?

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
Well... Honestly, our first day
was a total bust.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
We were gonna go harder today,
but we're still behind.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
I doubt more than one
party can enter at a time.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
And it's just our luck that
we got here right after

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
you guys did.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.236 position:50% align:center
Listen. If you don't mind,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
do you think we could let
Kuromu's group have this one?

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Doesn't matter to me.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
If that's what you want.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
Besides, we got a couple
medals yesterday.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
And I still owe Kuromu a favor.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
He helped me out
a lot when I started.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.713 position:50% align:center
All right.
I'm game as long as you are.

Have at it, guys.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
Go get yourselves some medals!

[KUROMU]
Are you sure?

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
Usually, it's first come,
first served.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yeah, it's fine.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna hear you
complain when we're swimming

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
in medals.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
No promises there.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
I can't resist a good offer.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center

--[KAEDE laughs]
--Do-gooder.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
Still. Doesn't that gate give
off a sort of boss fight vibe?

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
Yeah, a little.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50% align:center
So, what do you wanna do?

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50% align:center
Climb down the mountain
and look somewhere else?

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
I think it just reopened.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
I thought only one party
could go inside at a time.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Two possibilities.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
First being that all
the gear and medals

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
were sitting right
by the entrance,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
so his party has already
collected them and moved on.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
They also could have
been wiped out

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
by whatever monster is in there.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

All right.

what's in there.

Stay sharp.
Be prepared to use Devour.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center

Right.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center

I can tell this will be
a tough fight.

But... I won't lose.

Don't worry,
it's all non-piercing!

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to waste
the Devour skill this early

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
in the battle, either!

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
It's changing attacks!

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center

How's that?

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
It's barely hurt at all!

Only five!

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center

I won't waste it!

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
That's my Mirage skill.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty handy
trick in battle.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
Go, Hydra!

Oh. Uh, rewind.

What the heck
happened back there?

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
I thought for sure
you were a goner!

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
It's a new skill!

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
I acquired it right before
the battle ended!

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center

Sounds cool.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it does.

be goners without that?

And are these eggs?

Yep. But I don't think
they're from the bird boss.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
The colors and
patterns don't match up.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
Are we allowed to take them?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
I think so. You pick first.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
Well, I've always
liked the color green.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.
I guess I'll take this one.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
It's a Monster Egg.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] It says they'll hatch
when they're warmed up.

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
Not a lot of info.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
Hey, wouldn't it be cool
if we could tame them?

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
I wonder if they're
like in-game pets!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
For real? Awesome!

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center

good care of you!

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
We should teleport
out of here first.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
We've got three places
to choose from.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Then I vote we pick
somewhere we don't have

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
to fight.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center

I second that vote.

[M ADMIN A]
No!

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
Silverwing was beaten!

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A]
Seriously?

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
I thought Silverwing was
supposed to be impossible

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
for players to defeat!

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN B] We packed that
monster with so many

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
lethal skills that we're
basically just trolling players

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
at this point!

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center

Who? Which player beat it?

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A]
Maple? Are you kidding?

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Come on, Silverwing
should've been impossible

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
no matter who tried!

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN B] I can't believe
this; her mobility

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
is nonexistent!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
And the eggs!

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
Does that mean she ran off
with them after the battle?

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN C]
What's inside?

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN B]
The fox and the turtle.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.811 position:50% align:center
Though I suppose it could
have been worse.

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A]
It's still frustrating.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
I can't believe Maple took them.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN A] Okay, I want
everyone checking the skills

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
that Maple can get using medals!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
The last thing we need
right now is for her

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
to combine those
skills in a weird way!

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
[ADMINS]
Roger that!

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN A] This means
a lot more work for us.

[M PLAYER B yells]

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
[M PLAYER A]
Sweet! Another medal for me.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot PVP
was an option, too.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
[RISA chuckles]

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
PVP!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
A true test of one's skill is
battle against other players!

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
Bring it on!

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Uh...
Think we're doing this right?

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
Oh! Here's an idea.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
Maybe if we warm
the egg with more

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
of our body,
they'll hatch faster!

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Whoa!

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Cool. I'll go check out
what's down there.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
You wait here, okay?

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yeah. Sounds good.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
I'll shoot Maple a message.

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
"Hey there, I just
reached the bottom.

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Sorry about the wait."

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
Send.

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
[RISA] "Look out below?
You might want to move over?"

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE yelling]

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
Uh, what?

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Wow, okay, I'm like super dizzy.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.029 position:50% align:center
What did you do?

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
It's called "Venom Capsule."

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
It traps the target in
a poison container

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
they can't escape from.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
I thought it might hold up
since it can keep things

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
safely inside, kind of like
one of those giant

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
hamster ball things.

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
But it will eat away your HP
if you don't have

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
the Poison Immunity skill,
so be careful

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
if you ever decide to try it.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I'll pass, thanks!

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
Hey, Maple. Look next to you.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
Cool, it's a medal!

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
It must have been hidden
on the side of the cliff

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
or something.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Awesome!

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
You wanna see it
up close, Sally?

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
No, get away!

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
They're so cute!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
It's a ring.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
It's called "Bridge of Bonds."

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
It looks like equipping
this ring will allow

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
certain monsters to fight
alongside us when we're

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
in battle.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
That's cool.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.345 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I'm all about it!

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
Cut it out, that tickles!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
Hey. Since we've
equipped the rings,

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
we should be able
to see their stats.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
Huh, looks like we gotta
give them a name first.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
On it!

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
I've got the most perfect
name: "Syrup"!

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
And together we shall be
known as Maple Syrup.

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I think I'll name you
"Oboro." That okay?

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
[RISA laughs]

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet 'cha, Oboro.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Fifteen speed? So slow!

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Still faster than you, though.

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS squeak]

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
Go, Syrup! Use bite!

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
Now. Fire Tail!

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
Yay! Looks like they leveled up!

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
Only three levels
after all this work?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
That's strange, I think Oboro
just acquired a new skill.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
Hibernate and Awaken?

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Oh, Syrup has it, too!

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
It looks like Hibernate
lets them recover

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
inside the ring and then
to call them back out,

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
we just have to use Awaken.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
Makes sense to me!

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
Now we can always be together!

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] The desert is no
place for cute lil' Syrup.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
Don't want Oboro
to get covered in sand.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
Hey. We can take
a break over there!

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
Yeah, as long as it's not
a mirage, you know?

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Maple, the girl
who placed third.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Uh, that's me, but...
who are you?

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Sixth place isn't worth
remembering, huh?

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:03.573 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.286 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
You have one, right?

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.579 position:50% align:center
A golden medal.
