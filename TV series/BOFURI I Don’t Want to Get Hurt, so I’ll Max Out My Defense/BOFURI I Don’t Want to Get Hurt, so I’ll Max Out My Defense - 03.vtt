00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
[RISA] It looks like the only
things that affect us

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
are some of the skill fixes.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
Like they've limited
the number of times

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.108 position:50% align:center
you can use Devour.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's just ten times
a day now, right?

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
Yep. No big surprise.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
A shield that can eat
everything while giving

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
you magic is just way too OP.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.411 position:50% align:center
True. What about
the other thing though?

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
The defense-piercing
stuff or whatever?

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Well, they've fixed
it so even you can

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
take damage now.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
I guarantee the developers
did it as a countermeasure

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
to the walking tank
known as Maple.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
This stuff is
par for the course.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
The AI improvements are there
to limit any future Maples.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.429 position:50% align:center
They're worried about balance.

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center
The game would be
seriously off if everyone got

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
Total Defense like you.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Cheer up!

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.813 position:50% align:center
Sure, you're totally capable
of taking damage.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
But in a way that
makes you cooler!

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
Just imagine all
the damage effects

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.569 position:50% align:center
coming out and how it
will make you feel

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
even more invincible!

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hmph!

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.497 position:50% align:center
[WIZARDS]
Take this!

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.541 position:50% align:center
[WIZARDS yell]

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
[WIZARD 3B]
Man! It's crazy!

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
Our best attacks
barely even scratch her!

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
Monster!

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center
Now it's my turn!

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.093 position:50% align:center
Hydra!

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center
[WIZARDS yell]

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.351 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.312 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Well?

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm in!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
I've already reached my limit.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
Well, what now?

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
Beat the dungeon so we
can get to Level Two?

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we could do that.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.918 position:50% align:center
Although, we've only
ever gone to the lake,

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
so I haven't seen much
of Level One yet.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
It'd be nice to see a bit
more of it before we move on.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
Now that I'm looking...

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
There're actually a few places
I haven't been to, either.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
Then why not use today
for some exploring?

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.309 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll find some new
gear in one of the shops!

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yeah!

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
Cool!

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
I think I'll buy this skill.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
It's called "Cover Move"?

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
If you're ever in a pinch,
I can shield you!

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Even if you're far away.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Thank you!

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
Where to next?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Look, a weapon store!

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
Hey. Listen.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
Don't you think we should
buy good weapons

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
to start out with?

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
But if we aren't careful
with our money now,

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
we won't be able
to buy potions later.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
They're so cute!

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
They kinda remind me of
back when I was a newbie!

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
Whaddya mean "was"?
We're still newbies, Maple.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]
Fair point.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Let's buy weapons,
come on, please?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
[MAY]
Uh, I dunno, sis.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
[YUI groans]

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
Can't you just make
a decision already?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
Maple? You got any money left?

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I just paid
Iz for the shield.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
But I still have a little bit
of gold to spare.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Wanna get some food?

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
Hi and welcome!

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
Please have a seat!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Ooh, I get to eat
with a celebrity.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
Huh? A celebrity?

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Never mind.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
Awesome!
There are so many choices!

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
For real!

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Hey, it says
this one's seasonal.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
Think I'll try it.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Cool, then I'll pick this.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
[NPC MAID A]
Here's your order.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Whoa.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Looks just like the real deal!

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
[NPC MAID A]
Enjoy your food!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much!

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Time to chow down!

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
It's delicious!

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center
I bet a dessert like this
would be super expensive

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
in real life!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
And the best part about
in-game food

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
is there're no calories!

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
Lucky!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I wonder when they're
gonna have the next event.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
I have no idea,
but wouldn't it be great

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
if we could pair up together?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
So, one problem.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
Last time was a
free for all, right?

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
True.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
Which means we would have
to fight each other, huh?

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
[DREAD] They actually announced
the new event recently.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
You're that Maple girl, right?

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
You got third place last time.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was me.
But who are you?

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
[DREAD] I can't believe
you don't know my name!

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.294 position:50% align:center
I'm Dread, and I came in second.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
As for me, I came in fifth.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
I actually saw you talking
to Frederica once.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Name's Drag.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
Very nice to meet you.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, who's Frederica?

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
You don't remember?

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
She told you where to go
find some monsters.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
That girl?

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Oh.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
[DRAG]
You really surprised her.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
She never imagined the
newbie she gave advice to

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
would end up landing
third place in the first event.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. Yeah. I just got
super lucky, is all.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
Hey. They're right!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
Check it out, Maple.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
The second event will
be held next weekend.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
It looks like we
can team up!

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
Now we can fight together.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
[DREAD] Well, if we cross paths,
go easy on us, 'kay?

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
But you guys just said
you got second

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
and fifth place last time.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
That must mean you're
both pretty good.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
[DREAD]
You know it!

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
But even if the two of us teamed
up and fought together,

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50% align:center
we'd still be no match
for Payne.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Who's Payne?

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
[DREAD]
Are you serious?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
He's the guy who got first
place by a giant landslide.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
[DRAG] And he reached the second
level faster than anyone else.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
The guy's a legend!

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
Whoa. He sounds like
super amazing!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
This game is full
of cool players.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
[DREAD]
On that note,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
we're off to go do
some level grinding.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
[DRAG]
How 'bout you?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
There're a lot of places
we haven't seen

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
on Level One.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
So we're gonna go explore a bit.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
But we haven't figured out
a particular place yet.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
Do you guys know any good
spots you would suggest?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
Places to explore?

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
[DREAD] If you have time for it,
how about the north forest?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
Wait until after nightfall
if you can.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
I hear there's a quest
you can accept to get

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
the Super Speed skill.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
But...

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
It might be a pretty difficult
quest for girl players

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
such as yourselves.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
We're down!

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I wonder what he
meant by "it's a difficult quest

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
for girl players."

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
No clue, but whenever someone
issues a challenge

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center

Hold on, I'm a girl and
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

Or maybe it's a special

[IZ]
Maple!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Oh, hi, Iz!

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
Guess you made it to
the second level, huh?

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
Yep! I just opened up
a new shop.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
Is this one of your friends?

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
Yes. This is Sally.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
Hi there! It's nice to meet you.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
Maple says you're great.

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, too, I'm Iz.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
A crafter. Which reminds me!

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
I just finished up the shield
you ordered, Maple.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Are you serious?

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
It's perfect, thank you!

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
It's beautiful! Great work!

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm pretty
proud of it, myself.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
So, do you have a name in mind?

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
Sure do!

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
I'll name it Snow White.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
[IZ]
That's a lovely name.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
Oh, I maxed out its vitality
as much as I could.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
I wanted it to match
your particular playstyle.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
[RISA] And hey, you got it just
in time for the second event.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
I think this calls for
a celebration.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] So this is the place
you were talking about

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
the other day!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
I guess we have to sit down
to activate anything.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Okay, let's do it
at the same time!

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Right!

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Here goes!

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
That's so cool!

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
"A Small Piece of Sky"?

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
It says,
"Please enjoy your meal."

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Well, how is it?

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] It's like eating
strawberries, oranges,

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
and apples all at once!

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
Bottoms up.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
No way! Your hair's glowing!

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
[RISA] What? Hey, your
eyes changed colors!

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
Man, I hope it goes
back to normal.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
It will. Just give it some time.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
It's only been one month,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
but I feel like I've
come a long way

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
from when I first
started playing.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Remember how
reluctant you were at first?

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]
Well, that was the old Maple!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
Promise me something.

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best
in the next event.

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
I'm a little nervous,
seeing as this is my first event

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
in the game.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
There's just as many
people as the last time.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
I guess almost everybody
participates in these events.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kuromu!

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
Oh? Hey! Long time.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
I see you got a new shield.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
Yep. I'm trying to save
my Devour skill

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
for when I really need it today.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
So, is this your rumored friend?

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
Yeah. This is Sally.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
Wait. What "rumored friend"?

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
Uh, nothing,
just forget about it!

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
[FLAME EMPERORS yelling]

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.151 position:50% align:center
Listen! With today's event,

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
we'll bolster the reputation
of the Flame Emperors!

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
I promise each and
every one of you,

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
as long as you're with me,

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
you will taste only victory
on the battlefield!

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
So stand proud!

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center
You are Flame Emperors!

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
Know that together we'll
reach beyond the Earth

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
and the skies!

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center
Join up with me,

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
and our fierce flames
will scorch anything

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
that blocks our way!

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
[FLAME EMPERORS yell]

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
Wow. They're excited.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a group known
as the Flame Emperors.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
It's the Kingdom of
the Flame Emperors.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
Their leader is a
powerful Fire Wizard.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
Her name's Mii.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
She came in fourth last time,
but believe me,

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
she's a force to be
reckoned with.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Awesome, she's great!

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
Her name's cute but
she looks super strong!

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
[DORAZOU]
Rawr!

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
Okie dokie, the countdown
for the second event

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
will begin momentarily!

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
This time, the event
is a treasure hunt!

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
And the treasures you're looking
for are 300 silver medals

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
scattered around the map!

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
Collect ten of these to trade
in for a gold medal!

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
Then those gold medals
can be exchanged for skills

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
and cool gear after
the event is over!

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's just like the one
I got last time.

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
The top ten players
from our last event

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
already have one of
these nifty gold medals

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.976 position:50% align:center
in their inventory!

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
Killing players for
medals is A-OK!

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
Or you can always
search for medals

00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
if PVP isn't your thing!

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
Man, I guess it wasn't a
commemorative medal after all.

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
I was ninth place,
so I got a medal, too.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:04.032 position:50% align:center
Don't let anyone
take yours, okay?

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Right!

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
[DORAZOU]
Let's start the countdown!

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:09.662 position:50% align:center
Five! Four! Three!

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
--Good luck!
--Two! One!
