00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
We need to retreat!

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
[MARKUS] There's no way
we can beat that beast!

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
[MISERY]
I agree with Markus.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
We at least know the full
extent of her power now.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
We can call that a win.

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
Flare Accel!

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
So be it. We've lost. But...

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
[MARKUS]
To Shin?

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it.
That's a brilliant plan!

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You won't get away!

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Target acquired!

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
Markus. Misery.

Flame!

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
I'm all out of MP?

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
If you wanna take me down,

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
then I'll make you pay
the ultimate price!

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
[MII]
Self-destruct!

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You're offing yourself?

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
[MII] Damn right, and I'm
taking you with me!

[KAEDE yells]

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Wow, didn't see that coming!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
So much for being able
to keep Machine God

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
a secret from the other guilds.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Talk about a real bummer.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Maple!

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Huh?

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
[MAY] You're okay!
That explosion had us worried!

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
But we knew if anyone
could survive it,

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
it would be you!

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
Aww, thank you girls.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go get that orb!

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Right!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
[MAY]
Their orb... is gone?

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] It can't be.
Did they run off with it?

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
Is that even allowed?

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
Well yeah, I guess.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center
Still though, they won't
gain any points

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
if it's away from their base.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
Man.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
We could always
chase after them.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
You want to?

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
[YUI, MAY]
Hmm...

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
We could, but we actually
had a different plan.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
Which is?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
[YUI] According to the
map that Sally made,

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
there's a ton of other guild
bases in this area.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
And thanks to all your help,

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
we're still in perfect
fighting condition.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
So then...

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
Why don't we attack
the other guilds

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
and take their orbs instead?

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Great idea!

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
In that case, are you guys
ready to go swipe us

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
a few orbs?

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
[MAY, YUI]
Yeah!

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
[MII cries]

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
Maple beat me!

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
That dumb fight was so unfair!

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
Good. Looks like
Mii revived as well.

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
That girl was a real beast,
wasn't she?

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
True. But at least I--

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
She even survived your
crazy self-destruct skill.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
[MII]
Huh?

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
Shin told us about it
in his report.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
Seems Maple escaped unscathed.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
But the good news is
Shin and his team

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
secured our orb.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
[MII crying]

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
[MISERY]
Mii, wait!

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
[MII] I swear! Next time
I will defeat that monster!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
Sounds like Maple.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] And she's
obviously going all out.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's almost time
for us to meet up.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
We can go there together.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.033 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I'm so sorry, Sally!

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
We searched all over the place,

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
but no matter how
hard we looked,

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.414 position:50% align:center
we still couldn't
find their orb.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
It's fine.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
You did plenty.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your efforts,
the Flame Emperors

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
will have to go on the move.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
Although, our pace has
slowed down quite a bit.

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
Keeping up with their
numbers has proven

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
to be difficult.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we just can't
compare to the larger guilds.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] We've been fighting
the hard fight,

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
but it's no good.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
We're barely holding on
to tenth place.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
[RISA] To be honest, we're in
a pretty risky position here.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
It's only a matter of time
before the lower-ranked

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
guilds decide to come after us.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
There's not many small
guilds left anymore.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
So here's the plan.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
Iz and Kanade guard the base,

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
and the rest of us will
go on the attack.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
It's only day two and things
are already tense.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
I think Maple and Kasumi
should go with Kuromu.

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
May and Yui:
You two are with me.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
See ya guys! Good luck!

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
Aftershock!

[yells]

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I need to move even faster!

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
We have to get more orbs!

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
Use Illusion!

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
It's a fake attack!

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
See? Didn't hurt us--

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
[GUILD N B]
Wait. What the hell is that?

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
Disintegrate!

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
They're counting on us
to hold down the fort.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
[KANADE] Then we won't
let anyone get past us!

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
Are we seriously doing this?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
It seems so. They'll never
expect an air attack.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
Right! Let's go!

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Loving Sacrifice!

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't you think this
idea is a little crazy?

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
Totally, I'd never
do it in real life,

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
but this is just a game,
so it won't hurt a bit!

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
Doesn't make it any less crazy!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTMAS ROSE]
Well... Guess I'm dead!

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
[PLAYER A laughs]
Welcome to the afterlife.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
Now you can watch the event
with the rest of us.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
At this rate it looks like
most of the guilds

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
are gonna get wiped out.

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Yeah, possibly.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.387 position:50% align:center
In fact, a lot of the smaller
ones are crumbling already.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm not so sure about
Maple Tree, though.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
[PLAYER B]
I've gotta admit it.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
They're really hanging in there.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center
[PLAYER C] Flame Emperors is
in a pretty tough spot, too.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
I guess even the big guilds
are starting to struggle a bit.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
Except Holy Sword, which
is dominating right now.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTMAS ROSE] Huh. Is there
anyone besides me who hopes

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.574 position:50% align:center
Maple Tree wins
the whole shebang?

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
[PLAYER A]
Yeah.

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and tired of the big
guilds hogging all the glory.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
[PLAYER B] You really think that
ragtag group can win this thing?

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
[PLAYER C]
Possibly. It is Maple.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
So, how did the orb hunt go?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
Uh, not that great.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
Most of the guilds we
found didn't have one.

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
Well, that's unfortunate.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
Same for us; all that work,
and we only managed to find two.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
things are progressing

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
faster than I thought.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
It's not even just
the small guilds now,

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
the medium ones
are disappearing, too.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
It's probably time we moved
on to the next stage.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
[PAYNE]
It's chaos out there.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
Everyone is getting desperate.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
Even... Maple Tree Guild.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
Maple Tree, huh?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
They've got a stockpile of orbs.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
[DREAD]
Well then.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
Why don't we take 'em
off their hands?

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center

I do have one worry though.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
Holy Sword.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's fair.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
That man did say he'd be back.

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
Yep. And they'll want
to settle the score.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
[PAYNE] I don't want this
event to end until

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
we've paid them back.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
It would be nice to fight
under ideal conditions,

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
but what can you do?

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
But then on the other hand,

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
seeing how both sides
are exhausted,

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
and Maple's Devour is used up.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
There's a good chance
that Holy Sword

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
could attack us tonight.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
Maple Tree has little reason
to meet us in battle.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
In which case...

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
We need to take
our orb and leave.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
Before they get here.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
A big guild like that
can't move very fast.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
So with that in mind,

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
it should take a while
for them to reach us.

Are we ready?

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously wanna
fight those guys?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
The thought actually excites me.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
And if I know you all
like I think I do,

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
you want to fight them, as well.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
Just four of them?

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
It's a small party of
their top players.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
They can move a lot faster
than a whole army.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
But why throw away their
biggest advantage?

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
Why not overrun us
with sheer numbers?

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
Because I figured we'd
be more than enough.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
An easy win.

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
