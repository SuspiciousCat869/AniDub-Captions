Hard to believe you
beat all those players.

Hey, Drag.

Yeah, well, I was pretty
busy at the time.

You get a lot?

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
I didn't bother
keeping count, though.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
Looks like about 20 or so.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. At this point,
you could take down

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.709 position:50% align:center
every guild single-handedly.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
Possibly.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
At least the majority of them.

There is one that might be hard.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center

No way!

I can't believe we managed
to get ten orbs.

We are rocking this competition!

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
It's only the first day
of the event,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
but we're really on a roll.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
Hey. Some of them disappeared!

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
They probably went back
to their owners since it's been

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
three hours.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] Which means
we just scored some points.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
It's still too early
to celebrate.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
We're aiming for the top ten.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
The thing is, we're
only in 17th place.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Well then.
Guess I'll go back out.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Huh? Already?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
Ambushes will be much more
difficult once it's light out.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
Hold down the fort.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center

Take care, Sally!

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center

Good luck!

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Be careful!

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Will she really be okay?

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
I wish she would have
rested for a little longer.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
I get it, she wants to snag
as many orbs as possible

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
early on.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
More than likely,
all of the small guilds

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
will be the ones
who are wiped out first.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
But if their orbs vanish
because they lost,

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
then we can't score
any points off them.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
Basically, Sally is trying
to raise our rank

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
as much as she can
while the small guilds

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
are still around to attack.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
If we don't score
major points now,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
then we won't stand a chance
against the bigger guilds later.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
Makes sense.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
I'm just worried she's
pushing herself too hard.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Well, it is Sally.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she has a reason
for her actions.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
I feel restless.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
I'm off to go gather some orbs.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
What? Seems kind of sudden.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
Well to be fair,
I've been stuck in here

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
since the event started.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
I wanna go sightsee.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so you say.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
But I get the feeling that
you really just wanna

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
lighten the load for Sally.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center

something happens. Bye!

[KASUMI]
With all the orbs we have now,

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
isn't it likely that their
guilds will attack us

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
to reclaim them?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center

have to sit pretty and wait.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
Well now.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
you had me fooled.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe you
managed to fake a skill

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
like that.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center

How did'd you get here so quick?

Not good.

Man, I can't believe I just
lost to you again.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
But this is only the
first time I've died,

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
so I'll be back.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
I'll see you again before
the event is over!

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Maple made it in time.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
Everyone! You're here!

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
Maple.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
Did you take damage for Syrup
in that fight with Dread?

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah. It's hard to explain.

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
But piercing attacks
can break through.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
And anyone inside has their
damage passed on to me.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] At least we managed
to keep the orbs safe.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
[KANADE] Sorry. I didn't make
it back fast enough.

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's fine,
we only died once!

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
We're just glad we
got to be useful!

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
For what it's worth,
Maple had to help me out, too.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, my earlier bluff
came in handy out there.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
See? I got us a ton of orbs!

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
Same here.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
Though not as many as Sally.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
We've stolen 22 altogether.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
If we can protect these
for three hours,

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
our guild's rank
should be pretty high.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] We wiped out anyone
brave enough to come

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
for their orb so far.

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
If the other players get wind
of how dangerous we are,

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
it should deter
any future attacks.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I know it's still a bit early,

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
but I think it's time for
our guild to proceed

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
with Plan B.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
Check it.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Whoa!

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
So this is why you were
outside for so long.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yep, I mapped everything.

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
All the terrain and the location
of pretty much every guild.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
It's just what we need
to execute Plan B.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
Plan B, AKA "Maple's Reveal."

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yep.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
Instead of Maple staying here
and defending the base,

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
she'll go out and take
other people's orbs.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
We can't use third-level
flying machines

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
for this event,
but lucky for us,

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
Maple can already fly.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
The twins will go with her.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
We're gonna go stir up
the big guilds

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
and initiate a few battles.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
I made an attack plan.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
It'll give us a fighting chance.

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
The rest is up to you.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
And I'll take a quick nap.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
[IZ]
Sally?

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Poor girl's completely
worn herself out.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
We should let her rest a bit.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
Let's do this!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[GUILD L A] Enemy attack!
It's just one person!

Did you hear, Misery?

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
Apparently that Maple Tree guild

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
has been attacking people's
bases left and right.

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
One of them took
out Shin earlier.

Given that, I really don't want
to butt heads with them.

What if it's Maple herself?

doesn't come here.

There's a turtle

Yes. And she said she'll
be back here soon.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
In that case,
we just have to buy her

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
a little bit of time.

of my traps will actually

work on her.

super cool AoE defense

So, about those traps,
how many of them

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
will actually work on her?

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
Um, three.

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
But at the rate she's going,
she'll break through

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
all of them!
