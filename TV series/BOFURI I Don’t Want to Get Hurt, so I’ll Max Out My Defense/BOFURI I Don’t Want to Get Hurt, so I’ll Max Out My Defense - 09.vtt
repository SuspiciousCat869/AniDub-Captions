00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.681 align:middle
[RISA] So, what did she
want to show us?

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.058 align:middle
Oh, no. I bet it's
something weird.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:19.019 align:middle
Considering this is Maple
we're talking about,

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.228 align:middle
I wouldn't doubt it.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.521 align:middle
[KUROMU]
Me either.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:22.647 align:middle
So exciting!

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:23.732 align:middle
You said it, Sis!

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.817 align:middle
[IZ chuckles]

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.027 align:middle
'Kay.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.486 align:middle
I don't wanna attract
too much attention.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.155 align:middle
I'll hold back.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.657 align:middle
Deploy! Left arm!

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle
Here goes!

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.917 align:middle
[yells]

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle
No way. So cool!

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.428 align:middle
Yay, Maple! Amazing!

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.846 align:middle
Okay, cool.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.765 align:middle
That really just happened, huh?

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.476 align:middle
[KASUMI] I see she has
another new appendage.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.102 align:middle
[KUROMU]
And it shoots lasers.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.356 align:middle
She's on our side, so it's okay.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.066 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.317 align:middle
How was it?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.737 align:middle
Great! You're our secret weapon!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.238 align:middle
Yeah?

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.531 align:middle
That hurt.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.042 align:middle
[BEAR A growls]

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.213 align:middle
[DREAD]
Man, you're killing it today.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.631 align:middle
[PAYNE]
Yes.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.134 align:middle
The guild competition will
be here before we know it.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.719 align:middle
It's good to prepare,
not that we really

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.305 align:middle
need to level up much more.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.057 align:middle
Hey, where's Frederica?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.351 align:middle
[PAYNE]
She's out scouting Maple Tree.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle
Why not the Flame Emperors?

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.229 align:middle
[PAYNE]
I already told you.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.649 align:middle
Maple Tree has too many
unknown variables.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.611 align:middle
[DREAD] Well personally,
I think you worry too much.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.123 align:middle
[RISA]
Behold my splash attack!

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:29.501 align:middle
Counterattack!

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.961 align:middle
[GIRLS laughing]

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.506 align:middle
Hey, we wanna play! Splash!

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.508 align:middle
[KAEDE, RISA yell]

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.182 align:middle
We're so sorry.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.559 align:middle
Oh. Don't apologize!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.811 align:middle
[RISA gasps]

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.063 align:middle
[GROUP laughs]

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.275 align:middle
[MAY] I just love these
swimsuits Iz made us.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle
They're wonderful!

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.987 align:middle
Not to mention they boost
our swimming stats,

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.282 align:middle
which totally rocks hardcore.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.701 align:middle
So, the guild event.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.079 align:middle
What kind of competition
do you think it'll be?

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.165 align:middle
[KASUMI]
The event may be far off,

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle
but now is a good chance
to refresh our skills.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.131 align:middle
[KUROMU] There's nothing wrong
with a little level-grinding.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.465 align:middle
Am I right?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.219 align:middle
[KANADE]
Preparations are complete.

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.722 align:middle
I think I'm just about set. Yep.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.934 align:middle
[IZ yells]

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.529 align:middle
All right!

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.449 align:middle
This makes life much easier.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.117 align:middle
Thank you!

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.997 align:middle
Got 'em!

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.208 align:middle
And hopefully these will
be enough for what I need.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.376 align:middle
Whoa.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.675 align:middle
[IZ laughs]

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.926 align:middle
I love it!

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.303 align:middle
Looks like the whole
thing comes with

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.096 align:middle
the Unbreakable skill, too!

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle
Wow! This lets me
make items anywhere?

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.188 align:middle
Talk about perfect!

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:19.152 align:middle
[KAEDE] Man. That was,
like, super relaxing!

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.196 align:middle
Is something the matter?

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.572 align:middle
It's fine.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.824 align:middle
Hey! You over there!

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.284 align:middle
Why don't you go ahead
and come out?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.288 align:middle
[FREDERICA chuckles]

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.915 align:middle
Caught me!

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle
Well, you've been
staring forever.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.001 align:middle
So, yeah.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.754 align:middle
Uh, hold on, what do you
mean by "staring forever"?

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.798 align:middle
It's nothing weird, I promise.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle
[KAEDE] I know you.
Aren't you Frederica?

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.552 align:middle
Yep, though I guess
it's been a while, huh?

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.054 align:middle
What are you doing out here?

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.056 align:middle
Oh! Did you come to play?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle
Ooh, sounds fun.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.478 align:middle
Cut to the chase.
You came to spy on us, right?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle
Gathering information
for the guild event?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.194 align:middle
Well. In that case,
I have a proposition.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.904 align:middle
Go on.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:06.533 align:middle
You and I have a little duel.
Sound good?

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:10.412 align:middle
Oh? And why exactly should
I agree to such a thing?

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.205 align:middle
Because whoever loses
has to give up

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.207 align:middle
some guild information.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.334 align:middle
I need the scoop
on the Flame Emperors.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.211 align:middle
And the Order of the Holy Sword.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.464 align:middle
Plus, I caught you spying.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.842 align:middle
So I can't just let
you walk away.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.593 align:middle
You can either fight
all four of us,

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.053 align:middle
or me alone.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.223 align:middle
Okay, fine. You're on.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.766 align:middle
But if I end up losing,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.352 align:middle
I'll only tell you about
the Flame Emperors.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.562 align:middle
Got it?

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle
Sounds fair.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.566 align:middle
There. Request sent.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.737 align:middle
Bye! Back in a flash!

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.491 align:middle
Hold up, did they just teleport?

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.201 align:middle
I mean, yeah, naturally.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:53.288 align:middle
It's a duel and that's kinda
how the system works here.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.666 align:middle
Right, and Sally will return
here once they're done.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.043 align:middle
Oh, that's cool!

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.587 align:middle
Then let's go fish
until she gets back!

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.755 align:middle
[MAY, YUI]
'Kay!

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.468 align:middle
Firebolt!

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.389 align:middle
[FREDERICA]
She won't be easy to hit.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.725 align:middle
But that doesn't mean
it's impossible, either.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:17.062 align:middle
I'll learn as much as I can.
Then take her down.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.229 align:middle
Firebolt!

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.401 align:middle
[FREDERICA]
Nice dodge! Firebolt!

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.278 align:middle
[RISA]
Super Speed!

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.906 align:middle
[FREDERICA]
She's charging me?

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.407 align:middle
Multi-Barrier!

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle
[RISA yells]

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.829 align:middle
Multi-Firebolt!

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.122 align:middle
[RISA]
Yah!

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.667 align:middle
Here's my Coax Attack!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.834 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.131 align:middle
She made me use it.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.675 align:middle
[FREDERICA]
What's Coax Attack?

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.176 align:middle
I've never heard of it.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.427 align:middle
Fine, then.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.887 align:middle
Multi-Waterbolt!

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.141 align:middle
[FREDERICA] I bet Coax
Attack has a cooldown.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.603 align:middle
Evading all attacks is an
insanely powerful skill.

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.606 align:middle
There's no way she can
use it back to back!

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.233 align:middle
Multi-Stonebolt!

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.237 align:middle
Now I've got her.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle
I'll use Cascade!

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.121 align:middle
[FREDERICA]
I see how it is.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.163 align:middle
That was close.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle
I wanted to keep
Cascade a secret.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.127 align:middle
[FREDERICA]
Stop!

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.672 align:middle
I've decided that
I'd like to surrender.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:26.881 align:middle
[RISA]
Wait...

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle
You're giving up?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle
And per our arrangement,
let's chat about Flame Emperors.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:39.561 align:middle
[RISA] Markus the Trapper,
Misery the Cleric,

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.813 align:middle
and Shin the Split-Sword?

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.648 align:middle
Mii isn't the only strong one.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.442 align:middle
Flame Emperors is
jam packed with other

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.693 align:middle
talented players.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.281 align:middle
Well that's all, bye-bye!

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.497 align:middle
[FREDERICA sighs] I really
shouldn't've let her make me

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.166 align:middle
use Multi-Barrier.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.418 align:middle
Still. If we'd fought any
longer then I would've

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:07.255 align:middle
revealed way too much
info about my battle tactics.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.424 align:middle
But hey, I got to see
her skills, too,

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:10.759 align:middle
so it's all good.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.678 align:middle
And I spilled the tea
about the Flame Emperors.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.639 align:middle
With any luck, the two
will just crush each other.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.434 align:middle
It's like they say,
those who control information

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.894 align:middle
control the battle!

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.023 align:middle
[YUI]
You used Fake skills?

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.567 align:middle
[RISA] Yep! For example,
I pretended Coax Attack

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.319 align:middle
lets you manipulate
your enemy's attacks

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.528 align:middle
however you want.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle
And Cascade gives you
the ability to evade

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle
all their moves for a while.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:35.492 align:middle
Quite impressive.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.702 align:middle
You really make it sound
like such a simple feat,

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.662 align:middle
but it's actually
difficult to pull off.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.207 align:middle
Why would you need
to use fake skills?

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.042 align:middle
'Cause having false
information will hurt them

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.211 align:middle
more than having no information.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.672 align:middle
[KUROMU] Frederica is
a top-ranking player.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.632 align:middle
I can't believe you managed
to pull off a bluff

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle
of that magnitude.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.886 align:middle
Well, it's a lot easier to
pretend you're the underdog

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.639 align:middle
when in reality you're
a pretty skilled player.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.016 align:middle
[KASUMI]
Oh. Time for the announcement.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.142 align:middle
Rawr!

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle
Thanks for your patience, guys!

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.771 align:middle
It's time to explain the
rules for the upcoming

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:08.316 align:middle
guild competition,
so listen up! Here it goes!

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:14.322 align:middle
As I mentioned previously,
in-game time will be sped up.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.491 align:middle
You will be unable to
log in or take breaks

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.118 align:middle
after the event has started.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.663 align:middle
This time, the event will
last five in-game days!

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.832 align:middle
So it's shorter than
the last event.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.418 align:middle
[DORAZOU] Participating guilds
will be classified as large,

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:27.711 align:middle
medium, or small.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.879 align:middle
Depending on the size,
each group earns points

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.423 align:middle
a bit differently.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.884 align:middle
[RISA] According to this, we're
classified as a small guild.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle
[DORAZOU] Each guild will
be given their own base

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.763 align:middle
and must protect a special
orb that's placed

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:39.848 align:middle
inside of it.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.474 align:middle
If you manage to bring
an enemy orb

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.892 align:middle
back to your own base,

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.228 align:middle
then you can earn
some extra points.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.939 align:middle
For every six hours you
hold onto your own orb,

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.566 align:middle
you will get a single point.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.651 align:middle
But small guilds
will get two points.

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.486 align:middle
Taking an enemy orb
from its base

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.613 align:middle
and defending it for
three hours earns you

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.157 align:middle
two extra points.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.493 align:middle
The guild you took it from
will then lose one point.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.163 align:middle
It's like capture the flag,
but with orbs.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.748 align:middle
[KUROMU]
Let me get this straight,

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.499 align:middle
you get one point
to hold your own orb

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.876 align:middle
for six hours.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.045 align:middle
But two points if
you're a small guild.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle
And if you keep a stolen
orb for three hours,

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.465 align:middle
you get two points.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.842 align:middle
The other guild then
loses a point, right?

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.135 align:middle
That's the gist!

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.678 align:middle
Whoever defends
the best and can snag

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.722 align:middle
the most orbs wins the match.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:21.931 align:middle
[DORAZOU]
One more thing.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.975 align:middle
An orb that's stolen
will return to its base

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.643 align:middle
once any points
have been earned.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.645 align:middle
But that all changes if
the orb's stolen back

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle
within three hours.

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.149 align:middle
Because then there's
no loss or gain of points.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.734 align:middle
It's all good!

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:36.154 align:middle
Oh. So if your orb gets stolen,
it will come back automatically.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.448 align:middle
It looks like you can
also track your orb.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.533 align:middle
Its location will be on the map.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.243 align:middle
Which means if you
do steal an orb,

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.496 align:middle
you'd better be careful
and watch your back.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.664 align:middle
[KUROMU]
Oh. It's all about defense.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.917 align:middle
[DORAZOU] There's also
a penalty for dying.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.918 align:middle
[RISA]
I see.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.003 align:middle
So five deaths and you're out?

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.588 align:middle
[KASUMI] Which is tough
when you have a small guild

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:54.798 align:middle
like ours.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.257 align:middle
The event will only
become more difficult

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.759 align:middle
with each loss.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.511 align:middle
And that's everything!

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.138 align:middle
Whew. All that talking
wore me out.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.473 align:middle
If you have any more questions,

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.684 align:middle
you can always pull up
the menu, okay?

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.018 align:middle
Bye-bye, guys!

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.937 align:middle
Best of luck! Rawr!

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.523 align:middle
It sounds like we
need to keep most

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.358 align:middle
of our guild on defense.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.735 align:middle
But that's gonna
be tough for us.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.612 align:middle
Um, what's so tough about it?

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:21.783 align:middle
We lack enough people for
a good offense or defense.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.576 align:middle
The problem for
small guilds like us

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.578 align:middle
is that we get no rest.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle
Enemies can attack
at any given point,

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle
including at nighttime.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle
I see.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.461 align:middle
I suppose that does
make it more complicated.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.006 align:middle
As the event progresses,
they'll learn about our skills.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.424 align:middle
What's more,

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:38.883 align:middle
we're gonna be in big trouble
if they ever find out

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.719 align:middle
about your skill's usage limits.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.846 align:middle
Yeah. That is true.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.598 align:middle
It's gonna come down to how
long we can preserve Maple.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:46.808 align:middle
'Kay?

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.519 align:middle
On defense, let's have
Maple, Yui, and May.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.021 align:middle
Right!

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.397 align:middle
[RISA]
You too, Kanade.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.149 align:middle
Sure, whatever you need.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:58.153 align:middle
Thanks. Our attackers will be
me, Kasumi, and Kuromu.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.071 align:middle
Iz, I think it's best if
you stay at the base

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.573 align:middle
and act as a backup.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.575 align:middle
[KAEDE]
Yeah! Sounds like a plan!

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.909 align:middle
[RISA]
We've got time before the event,

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.328 align:middle
so let's do some
level grinding!

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.413 align:middle
[GROUP]
Right!

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle
You ready? Let's do this!

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.918 align:middle
We aim for the top--
the top ten!

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.628 align:middle
[GROUP]
Go Maple Tree!

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.879 align:middle
[DORAZOU]
Okay!

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.215 align:middle
It's time for the guild
competition to begin!

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.716 align:middle
Go!

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:05.887 align:middle
Whoa, it's so cool!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.391 align:middle
I guess this is our base, huh?

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.434 align:middle
[RISA] We're gonna head out
and get some orbs.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.812 align:middle
[KUROMU]
Right. Just like we planned.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.146 align:middle
Good luck, guys!

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle
[GUILD A MEMBER grunts]

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.573 align:middle
Hey, what the hell?

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:26.741 align:middle
How dare--

[CHRISTMAS ROSE whimpers]

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.499 align:middle
[CHRISTMAS ROSE]
No way!

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.922 align:middle
[CHRISTMAS ROSE]
Terrible news!

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.257 align:middle
[GREAT AXER]
What's wrong?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.884 align:middle
There's... There's...!
[grunts]

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle
[RISA]
Thanks for showing us your base.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.972 align:middle
Come on! Get her!

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.143 align:middle
[KUROMU]
Bring it!

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle
My, she's as agile as ever.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.232 align:middle
Wish I could do that.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.316 align:middle
Die!

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.195 align:middle
[KUROMU] The girls in our
guild are scary as hell.

[GUILD A MEMBERS grunt]

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.743 align:middle
I just don't get it,
everything's happening so fast.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.042 align:middle
[RISA]
That's one orb for us.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.878 align:middle
Kasumi. Can you please take
this back to our base?

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle
My pleasure.

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.049 align:middle
[RISA] I'm gonna go scout
out the rest of the area.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.216 align:middle

Be careful.

[KUROMU]
Maple's obviously a given,

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.472 align:middle
but Sally's a whole
different sort of monster.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:31.639 align:middle
Yes.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.767 align:middle

on the same side.

You dare to call us thieves?

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.948 align:middle
When you're the cretins
who attacked us

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.741 align:middle

Faster. I can't waste
a single minute.

think one of the bigger guilds

is gonna win.

Oh, really?

By bigger guild, you mean
Order of the Holy Sword

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.391 align:middle
or the Flame Emperors, right?

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle
They're both awesome.

[DREAD]
Eh, let's call it an instinct.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.429 align:middle
--[DREAD] Super Speed!
--[RISA] Super Speed!

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.019 align:middle
[RISA grunts]

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle
[DREAD laughs]
You've got Super Speed, too.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:26.856 align:middle
Nice!

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.949 align:middle
[RISA]
He backed off?

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.743 align:middle
[DREAD] If I start doubting
myself, I'm done for.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.078 align:middle
Godspeed!

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:50.755 align:middle
[RISA]
Cascade!

00:18:58.555 --> 00:18:59.848 align:middle
[RISA]
He's gone.

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:02.058 align:middle
I wonder what that was about.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.186 align:middle
Well, I showed him Cascade,
so it's all good.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.523 align:middle
[MARKUS]
Will we be okay?

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:11.443 align:middle
Do you think they'll get
past the traps I set?

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.862 align:middle
I'm sure everything
will be fine, Markus.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:16.239 align:middle
Besides, even if they do,
don't forget we have

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle
our trusty guildmates
to back us up.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.285 align:middle
I'm worried.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:23.371 align:middle
She's gonna be real mad
at us if we lose the orb.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.583 align:middle
See? More attackers just
fell for your traps

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.585 align:middle
and got blown
to smithereens.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.755 align:middle
Exactly what I've come
to expect from you.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.214 align:middle
Yeah, so?

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:36.009 align:middle
All I've done is set a few
measly traps, nothing else.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.385 align:middle
That's all you need to do.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.012 align:middle
Just have faith in Mii,
she's out there

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.348 align:middle
snatching enough orbs
for the both of us.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:43.516 align:middle
[MII]
Flame!

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.726 align:middle
[KNIGHTS yell]

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:45.977 align:middle
Eruption!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.814 align:middle
Inferno!

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:57.989 align:middle
[FLAME EMPEROR MEMBER A]
MP Potion, ma'am?

00:19:58.073 --> 00:20:00.658 align:middle
Yes, thank you.
Fetch the orb, quickly.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:01.993 align:middle
[FLAME EMPEROR MEMBER A]
Right.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.621 align:middle
[FLAME EMPEROR MEMBER A yells]

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.375 align:middle
[MII]
She belongs to me.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:09.959 align:middle
Go back to the base right now.

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.169 align:middle
Take the orbs.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle
[MII]
Flare Accel!

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:19.886 align:middle
[RISA]
Vanish.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.264 align:middle
[MII]
Go, Flame!

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.891 align:middle
Flame! Flame!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.227 align:middle
Fire Lance! Fire Lance!
Fire Lance!

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.436 align:middle
Flame!

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.525 align:middle
She got away...

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.527 align:middle
I let everyone down...

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.279 align:middle
[crying]

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:41.366 align:middle
I'm so not cut out for
this dumb leader stuff.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:44.285 align:middle
This really sucks! Ugh!

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:47.414 align:middle
The next time we meet,
you won't get away so easily!

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.085 align:middle
[TRIO C] Are you sure
this is that girl's base?

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.086 align:middle
[TRIO B]
It has to be!

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.129 align:middle
This is where my...

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.339 align:middle
Uh, this is where our orb is!

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.425 align:middle
[TRIO A]
C'mon, men! Let's go!

00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.718 align:middle
I just realized.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.302 align:middle
This is the first time
that all eight of us

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.721 align:middle
have fought together.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.973 align:middle
Now that you mention it,
you're right.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle
[KUROMU]
Maple? Wanna do the honors?

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:08.601 align:middle
[KAEDE]
I'm on it!

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.228 align:middle
[TRIO B]
Get our orb!

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.272 align:middle
[TRIO C]
For our pride and our guild!

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:13.606 align:middle
Let's go!

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.609 align:middle
Take that!

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:19.154 align:middle
[CHRISTMAS ROSE]
What is that?!

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.159 align:middle
Don't just stand there, cowards!

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.911 align:middle
--Take that! Here's another!
--There! Take that!

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:29.372 align:middle
[TRIO A]
Little brats!

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.582 align:middle
Hey!

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:33.543 align:middle
Why the heck didn't it
do any damage, huh?

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.171 align:middle
Uh, on second thought,
tactical retreat, men!

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:38.631 align:middle
Paralyze Laser!

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.593 align:middle
[WIZARDS yell]

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.554 align:middle
--[TRIO C] Cowards!
--[RISA] Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.473 align:middle
Fine, I'll take you
down with me!

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.352 align:middle
No way. It didn't work?

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.355 align:middle
Is that Maple?

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.482 align:middle
[yells]

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.609 align:middle
Yeah! Keep up the
great work, guys!
