[KAEDE] Are you guys
ready to have some fun?

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50% align:center
It's the third event,
the "cowvent"!

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Wait. The cow what?

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
You know, it's all
about defeating cows

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
and collecting
their bells, right?

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
So it's a "cowvent"!

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
I heard that if we collect
a lot of bells,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
then we'll get a good reward.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
In that case, it sounds like
a pretty typical event.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
Okay. Listen up!

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the loads of
wool everyone gathered,

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.411 position:50% align:center
I'm finally done with my
most recent project.

And that's not all!

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
Wearing clothes and armor
with a lot of wool

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
will give you a bonus
drop on event items!

In my opinion, they're too cute.

Um... It's just the design.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
I kind of wish it was a bit
more functional, you know?

Well, too bad so sad!

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center

a pain trying to search 

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center

to a pretty good start. Hm?

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
Sally sent me a message.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.156 position:50% align:center

little concerned about Maple."

"Yeah.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,
Maple's a beast,

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center

suited for this event."

a lot of competition.

be tough to collect,

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center

and do your best!

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center

all the people in the fields,

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center

difficult with such a large

[MARKUS] No wonder people
agree to follow her so readily.

She's got a silver tongue.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
Yes.

Ugh! You mean Maple?

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center

keep a close eye on that one.

[F ADMIN A] She's got her wacky
turtle blimp, her Wooly,

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
she ate Hydra, became an angel,
and now she's a demon, too?

at the end of her stride.

defying the game's logic!

Right. What more could she do?

Exactly!

they're at the top.

just open up?

about that is it gives

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
she has some
monstrous new skill?

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU]
The answer's super obvious.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
She's basically just
a monster herself.

the cow event.

you just go back to normal.

being a human, then?

We should split up.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
That way we can check out what
kind of zones are around.

Are you sure?

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
[KUROMU] We don't know much
since we just got to this area.

more ground this way.

[OLD MAN A]
Yes.

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,
this city was filled to the brim

nothing about machines,

the First Generation
filled us with hope

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
and a sense of wonder.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center

very strange happened

before erupted from the city.

Wow.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
Do you think that means
the Second Generation

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
did something awful
to the First Generation?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
that's the end of my story.

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
Except for me, nobody remembers
the First Generation anymore.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
I get it, he can't say anything
else about the quest.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.656 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your time.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
It was a wonderful story.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Sounds like a super
rare quest or something.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
I should probably run it by
Sally and the others to be sure.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

[M RIDER A]
What the heck?!

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
Hey, watch where
you're flying that turtle!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
Ya crazy--
Wait, a turtle?

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I'm sorry!

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
We should head to a
less-crowded area, Syrup.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Look at all this fog!

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
So thick.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
Um... Where are we?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
Watch out!

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
Atrocity!

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
Thought I was a goner!

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
Where am I, anyway?

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
The Graveyard of Dreams?

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank goodness!

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GEN A] I am the king
of machines of great wisdom

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
and faraway hopes and dreams.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Oops.
I think I started a cutscene!

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GEN A]
I am king.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
A once upon king.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
He who was weeded out.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
So what happened to you?

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GEN]
I am the king of junk.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
He who sleeps among scrap.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
Turning dreams and
miracles into rubbish.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
I'll turn you into rubbish, too.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
Are you broken?

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
Then I'll knock some
sense into you!

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
Now, Syrup! Mother Nature!

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
This glowing part
is the problem!

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
Seeping Chaos!

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GEN] For this brief
moment my thoughts are my own.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
So I will bestow you this,
brave soul.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE gasps]

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center

Using my power, defeat him.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
The one I once was.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Huh?

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
[FIRST GEN]
Put me to sleep.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second, what the heck
did you just give me?

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
[SECOND GEN]
It is futile.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
It is?

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
[SECOND GEN roars]

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center

What in the world is that thing?

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
Machine God?

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center

Okay.

Machine God!

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
Deploy Armaments!

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
Let's go!
