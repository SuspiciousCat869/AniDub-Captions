Oh, next up is
starting equipment?

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
A one-handed sword.
A mace and a staff.

Well... I've never been that
great when it comes to

And besides,
I don't wanna get hurt,

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
so I should avoid
getting hit, right?

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:29.125 position:50% align:center
Uh... Maybe I should just pick
the staff and be a wizard.

The Great Shield
is terrible for offense,

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
but number-one in defense?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
Wait. Does that mean if I raise
my defense enough,

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
I won't take damage?

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
Well, might as well
put everything 

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
straight into defense!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
There! That should do it.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
Huh? Vitality was
defense, right?

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
So then strength is power,
and agility must be speed.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
I guess I could always
log out and redo it

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
since Risa's not here.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
Oh, well!
I already made the character.

Time to fight monsters

keep the monsters.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Well, I was hoping to
maybe fight some monsters,

is stand around,

bring the fight to you.

all I have to do
is outlast them.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
And bonus, a treasure chest!

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
If it gets broken,
it gets stronger

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
and goes back to normal!

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
Wow, it's one of a kind!

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
Which would mean
I'm the only person

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
in game who has this?

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
Oh em gee, I am like
the luckiest player ever!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
This is beyond awesome.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna keep playing and
specialize in defense stats!

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
Don't wanna get hurt, right?

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I know!
Didn't I tell you it was cool?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yeah!

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
But I'm not that good since
it's only my second day!

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
When are you gonna be able to
come play with me, Risa?

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
It should be fairly soon.

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
Once our proficiency
tests are over,

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to log in!

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
Oh, but make sure that you
study for your test too!

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna end up
like me and get banned

00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
from gaming, right?

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.854 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah, that's true.

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Trust me, it sucks.

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:55.648 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I'll take your word for it!

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
As you should!

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
[RISA sighs]

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:05.200 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. I'm kind of jealous.
