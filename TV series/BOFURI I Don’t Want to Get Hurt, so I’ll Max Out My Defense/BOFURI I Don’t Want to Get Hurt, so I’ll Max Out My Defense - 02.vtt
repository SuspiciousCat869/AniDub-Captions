00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
Tell me.
What level are you again?

00:09:58.598 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Only level 20.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
And you placed third? Oh, man.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
What kind of character
did you make again?

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
I'm a great shielder
that's focused on defense.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
But the thing is--

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Get this, it's gonna blow
your mind, Risa!

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
Ah! You've created
a monster, haven't you?

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
Jeez, only you could
make a boss character

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
without even trying.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
Uh... Huh? I'm a boss?

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
Ugh, that's what I said!

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
Aww. Now I'm gonna have
to work, like, extra hard

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
to pass you.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
Uh, if you want, you can
just copy what I did.

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
Bzzt! You play your way
and I'll play my way.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] So what kind of
character will you make?

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
If you're going the tank route,

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll roll a wizard
with long-range attacks.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
Except that if we party up,
then it's kind of predictable

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
and boring.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
All right. I've decided!

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be a swashbuckler!

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
Swashbuckler? What's that?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
Oh! They're super great at
evading enemy attacks and stuff.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50% align:center
Think of a really
fast swordsman!

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Sounds awesome!

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
Hold on. But I'm already
a shield class.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
So what's the point of us
both playing as defenders?

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
Because no matter what happens,

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
we won't take on
damage in a fight!

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
Yep! An untouchable duo!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
Well? Sounds cool, right?

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yeah! I'm sold!

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
I think it'll make for
a pretty interesting party,

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
so a swashbuckler, I'll be!

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
Sounds amazing!
And I'll raise defense!

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Good, but be careful
not to get caught up in that

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
too much.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
No point if you end
up losing, y'know?

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
If things get bad,

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
it's better to cast down
your shield and live to see

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
another day.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. Okay! Hold on.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
Did you ever get permission
from your mom to play?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
[RISA chuckles]

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited we finally
get to game together!

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
Wow! So this is what it's like!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Isn't it awesome?

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
I was pretty shocked
the first time I logged in.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Okay, Kaede... Oh, crap!

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
Hey. Something wrong?

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Sort of.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
It's bad form to use real names.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
So don't forget to
call me Sally, okay?

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
That's what I decided
to call this character.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
Sally? That's so cute!

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
Right, you got it.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Now then. First things first!

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Wow. It's cool how
you divided your points

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
into different stats!

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
That's normal, silly!
Still, though.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
I didn't put any points
into vitality, MP, or HP,

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
at least that's what I'm
gonna do for the time being.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
[RISA] For one thing, if I can
evade taking any damage,

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
then I don't really
need HP or defense.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
And I don't know if
I'm using magic yet,

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
so for right now it's
best to keep my MP low.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
You can always use special
weapons to compensate

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
for a lack of strength.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
But since I want
to be uber fast,

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
I put most of my available
points into the agility slot.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Wow, you put
a lot of thought into this.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.580 position:50% align:center
Yeah well, we can't
all be walking tanks,

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
so I have a lot more
to consider. So yeah.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
I hope I can get some
specialized gear soon.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
Maybe something cool
like your shield.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:18.631 position:50% align:center
It's awesome.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
Do you mean this one?

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Uh-huh!

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the
"Replica of the Dark Night"?

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
The one that can eat up
all its enemies' attacks?

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
If you're guarding all the time,
you won't get skills

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
that you can only
acquire when you get hit.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I know.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
And I actually asked somebody
about commissioning

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
a new shield.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
She's a really cool crafter
I met the other day named Iz.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
But here's the thing.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
A shield?

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center
I guess if you brought me
all the materials.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
I could make you one for
around a million gold or so.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
Well, my Replica of
the Dark Night is black,

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
but I've always thought
it would be kinda cool

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
to have a white shield,
you know?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
[IZ]
Okay.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
What you want to do is head
to the underground lake

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
south of the city.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
Collect the scales
from the white fish

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
that swim in the lake.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
Those are the
materials I'll need.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
So, yeah.

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
Well, then!

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
Sounds like we need to go and
check out this underground lake!

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You sure?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
But first we'll need
some equipment.

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
Like fishing rods.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Hey, that's too fast,
wait for me!

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
Whoa, sorry!

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
That was too fast for her?
Hmm. In that case...

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
Wow! 60 agility is so fast, huh?

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so hold on tight!

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
'Cause if we run into monsters,
it's gonna be all you!

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Speaking of which,
I spy some wolves ahead!

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
Paralyzing Shout!

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Devour!

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Way to go, third-place champ!

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
You're so fast, it's nuts!

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
You may worship me.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
I bow! Mistress Sally!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
I finally caught a third one.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yay! Another one for me!

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
I've only caught three
fish this whole time,

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
and meanwhile you're over
there on your twelfth.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
[RISA] What'd you expect
with zero dexterity?

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
But hey, on the plus side,
since I just started playing,

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
skinning all these fish
is helping me level up

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
like crazy.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
What level are you?

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
Level 6.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
[GAME VOICE A]
Notice: Acquired skill: Fishing.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
Aw, my first skill is fishing?

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
And here I thought you were
the weird one in our party.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Don't you have
a bunch of new stat points?

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
How come you're not using them?

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I probably will once
I get some more skills.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
those can end up determining

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
your fighting style.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
You sound so cool! Like a gamer!

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
Ah, well to be fair,
I've played a lot more games

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
than you have.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center
Sweet! I think I've caught
a big one this time!

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, it's a real fighter!

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Looks like there's 25.

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
Still, though.
Is that enough for you?

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Uh, think you can
go for another hour?

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
For sure!

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
But I would like to try
something out if you don't mind.

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
I wanna try
free diving for a bit.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm a pretty
strong swimmer IRL.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Does that matter in this game?

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yep!

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
If you're a strong
swimmer in real life,

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
or good at climbing
trees and stuff,

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
or even just have good reflexes,
it makes a difference in-game.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
It's all part of player skill.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
All right, BRB!

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
Okay, good luck!

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she's okay.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
I mean, she's been down
there for like ten minutes.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
[RISA gasps]

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
You're alive! How was it?

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
It was great! Check out my haul!

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
You're gonna give me
all of those?

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
Sure, I don't need 'em.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
Besides, you can always
return the favor sometime

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
in the future.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
You got it! Whatever you need.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Hey, get this.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
I found a sealed cave.

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
I saw it down at
the bottom of the lake.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
What? Seriously?

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
That's cool. I wonder if
I can get down there.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
Well, you probably can't
swim with zero agility.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
I might have to tackle
this one by myself.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
Like right now?

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
It'd be smart to raise
my level and swimming skill

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
up a bit more.

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Which is why...

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Say no more!

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
We'll come here every day
so you can level up!

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
That's how I'll repay the favor!

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I just knew you'd say that!

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
You're the best, Maple!

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]
Don't forget it!

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
So, how long was I under for?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
It was a while! 40 minutes!

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
That's great!
I mapped out the area.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
So I think I might be ready!

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
The good news is that I've
advanced my swimming

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
and diving skills to level 10.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
That's probably the
highest I can get them

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
for right now.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
But things could get ugly
if I don't beat the boss

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
within 20 minutes.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea,
what if I message you

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
using the friend function
after 20 minutes is up?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
That way you can know the time.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Hey, that's an awesome idea!

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
You don't mind?

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
Nope, just leave it to me!

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Thanks, pal!

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[RISA gasps]

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
There's air! Good news for me!

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho! Now that's a big catch!

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
Bring it on!

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
Slash!

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center

Water Ball!

Power Attack!

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
There goes the air!

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
Will I make it?

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
She's not answering.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
I hope Sally's okay.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Calm down and focus!

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
Come on. You can do this!

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Wind Cutter!

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
Have another one! Last one!

[RISA panting]

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.701 position:50% align:center
I beat him!

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
I had to pull out
my toughest moves!

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.790 position:50% align:center
Still though.
Playing so hard is exhausting.

00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
I had to resort
to my serious mode!

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:19.381 position:50% align:center
But I owned that guy!

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:22.884 position:50% align:center
Now. Let's crack open
that treasure chest!

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
Open... says me!

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.350 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You look totally awesome!

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:31.935 position:50% align:center
[RISA chuckles]

00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:33.019 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:34.938 position:50% align:center
You had me really worried there!

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.690 position:50% align:center
I thought you became
fish food and got sent back

00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:38.149 position:50% align:center
to the starting zone!

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:39.359 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I'm sorry!

00:22:39.442 --> 00:22:41.361 position:50% align:center
But hey, now that I've
got some new skills,

00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:42.654 position:50% align:center
the next time there's
a cool event,

00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:44.781 position:50% align:center
you and I can party up together!

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.741 position:50% align:center
For real? Yay, I'm so excited!

the second level of content!

In order to reach it, you must
clear an exclusive dungeon!

by second level?

currently on is level one.

to open up another world

No way!

incredible monsters out there?

the hardest class to play.

challenge I live for!
