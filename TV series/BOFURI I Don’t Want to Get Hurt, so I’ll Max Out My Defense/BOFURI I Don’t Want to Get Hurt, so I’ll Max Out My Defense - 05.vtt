00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
You have one, right?

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
A golden medal.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
Wait, huh?

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
I'm not a big fan of these odds.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
I'll let you escape

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
after picking a fight?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Super Speed!

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Super Speed!

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.718 position:50% align:center
Uh... ?

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
Hey! You guys!

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
Wait, I'm coming, too!

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
You have Super Speed?

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.911 position:50% align:center
Guess we're both
full of surprises.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely
why I withdrew.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
First of Sword... Heat Haze!

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I did warn you
I was full of surprises.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
Help, I can't stop!

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Is that Maple?

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.831 position:50% align:center
--Oh, crap!
--Not good!

[KAEDE yelling]

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
Maple!

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelling]

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
Looks like a dungeon.

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE grunts]

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.033 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Binding Chains.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
It says that if anyone dies
while bound by the chains,

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
then everyone does.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
They're also unbreakable.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yeah, course they are.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Hey, don't worry,
I'll protect you no matter what!

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'm the
third wheel, aren't I?

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
How about a temporary truce?

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
Great idea!

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
I think we should all
try to work together.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
That way we can get out of here.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
Well then, I'm Sally.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
My name's Kasumi. A pleasure.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
And my name's Maple!

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
I'm not positive, but I assume
we'll have to clear

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
the dungeon in order
to break the chains.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Yeesh, depending on the
boss, that could be a real pain.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE grunts]

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
My apologies.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Yeah, sorry, are you okay?

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
Yep, I'm fine.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
Hey, a medal!

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Talk about lucky.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Um...

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
Since you're
the one who found it,

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
you should be
the one to keep it.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
But we're all together.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
You're a very thoughtful girl.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
But let's go with the
"finders, keepers" rule.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
I agree.
It makes the most sense.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
Well... Okay, then.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] You know, that hidden
medal makes me suspect

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
this might be an
exploration-type dungeon.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Man, that's kinda lame.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I prefer the
dungeons where you just

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
beat a boss and that's
all there is to it, y'know?

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
For real! Same here.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Yes, fighting is
more of my forte, as well.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
As long as it's nothing like
that giant ice chicken.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
What ice chicken?

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
It's a cool story.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
Two days ago,
we fought this boss

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
with an insanely high HP bar;
it was so epic.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
Which direction do you
think we should go now?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
[RISA gasps]

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Something wrong?

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Shh!

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
Guys. I don't think
it's a monster.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why not?

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Well, I tried to check
its HP bar,

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
but nothing was available.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
Meaning it's an
unkillable object.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
I bet it's a dungeon mechanic
we have to stay away from.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
That's not good.

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
We'll be trapped!

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
Super Speed!

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hold on!

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE yelling]

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE yelling]

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Uh... Why do you
look so concerned?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
There's nowhere left to run.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE yells]

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
Hey, look up there!

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
No way we can reach that.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
What should we do?

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Sally, use your Leap skill!

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
I can't jump that high.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
Just please trust me, hurry!

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
Okay, Leap!

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
I knew I wouldn't make it!

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Third of Sword, Lonely Moon!

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad that worked.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:41.920 position:50% align:center
Great job, Kasumi.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have reached it
with my Leap skill alone.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Well. I wouldn't have
made it, either.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
Not by myself,
I needed your help.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Now then.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
Hey! See that? It's a door.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
I guess that means
we cleared the dungeon.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
And bonus, none of us died!

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50% align:center
True.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
Okay, guys. You ready?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Here goes!

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Whoa! What now?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't really
need a shield.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
You should take it, Maple.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
Okay, then you should
take the spear and staff

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
since we probably
won't use them.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Those are all yours.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Thank you.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
And the skill scrolls
are all the same thing.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
Which means we can at least
split those three evenly.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.188 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Which leaves...

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey. Do you mind?

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
No, not at all!

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
Thanks, pal.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
Here you go, this one's yours!

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course,
I already picked one up

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
in the dungeon.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
And this way we all
get a new medal!

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Wow, I can't believe
it's already nighttime outside.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I knew we were
underground for a while,

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
but I guess day four
is already over.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
I'm so sorry. Maple. Sally.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hm?

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
For challenging you
the way I did earlier.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
To make amends.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
Please, do as you see fit.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
There's no need for that!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's not like PvP
is against the rules!

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
If she's not holding
a grudge, neither am I.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't
feel like fighting.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Still, though.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Oh! I've got it.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
We could add each
other as friends

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
since we all know one another.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
[RISA chuckles]

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.
And may we meet again.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Bye, good luck!

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
I hope you find a lot of medals.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.047 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Yes. You as well!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
We have three days
to get nine more medals.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
Think it's possible?

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but we might have
to target other players

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
to get them.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
Well, we can just put it on
the back burner for now.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
We'll keeping searching
in the meantime.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
And to be honest...

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal to me
if we don't collect enough.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
[RISA sighs]

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Huh?
What's Maple been doing?

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
No! Anything but that!

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
[KANADE laughs]

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
There. Another perfect game.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I lost again...

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, there you are.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah. Who is this?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
My name's Kanade.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Maple and I just finished making
a cool sandcastle together.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
It was super fun.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Is this a good idea?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Hm?
I mean, I don't see why not.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
[KANADE]
It's fine.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm only level five.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
It sucks, but I'm
still pretty weak.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.011 position:50% align:center
This event's not really my jam.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
It isn't?

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
But I've got this cool thing,
so I'm happy.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
What is it?

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
[KANADE] It's some loot I got
after finishing a puzzle

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
in an old library.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
It took me four whole days.

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Ooh.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:14.150 position:50% align:center
This staff has a pretty
sweet skill, too.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Wait. That's a staff?

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!
What's the skill?

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's something called
Akashic Records.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
Check it, when I use it...

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
It's a secret!

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
You tease!

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course it is.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
[KANADE chuckles]

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
We should play together again
when the event's over.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay if I
added you as a friend?

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Sure.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
[KANADE] Then, as a token
of our friendship...

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
--[RISA] What is it?
--[KANADE] A book I found.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
I think it might contain a hint
dealing with this event.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
"The heart of ancient days.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
To a gushing well,
ye shall converge,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
but in the dimming light,
it shan't emerge.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
If hero conquers, foe decays.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
Into tranquil waters
ye submerge."

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
I wonder what it means.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
Have you figured it out already?

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
[KANADE]
Yep, immediately.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
Ooh, tell us!

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
You gotta figure this one
out on your own.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
Besides, solving a puzzle
is the best part.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.710 position:50% align:center
[RISA] Well, at least Kanade
told us these ruins

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
have something to do
with the riddle.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
"The heart of ancient days.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
To a gushing well ye
shall converge." Hmm.

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Gushing well.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Gushing well.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] What if we filled
the fountain with water?

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
Using your skill.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Will that even work, though?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
At the most, I think
Torrent will only be able

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
to fill up one fountain.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Torrent isn't the only
skill we have to make water.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
Now what are you planning?

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
Torrent!

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hydra!

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
I guess it counts as long
as it's liquid, huh?

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
Uh, did it actually work?

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
So bright!

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
Wow, It's like we're in
the middle of the ocean!

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I don't see a boss yet,
but I'd bet anything

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
there is one.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
It's here.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Right.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Maple!

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I've got this!

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Something's off!

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
Your attack didn't
do any damage!

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
What? Why not?

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
We probably have to hit
its main body.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
That stinks.

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
Especially since
I can't swim or dive.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
I can't attack that thing
even if I wanted to!

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Oh. I know!

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hydra!

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
Hydra!

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
Hydra! Hydra!

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
We'll turn this sea of beauty
into a sea of poison-y death!

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
And it actually worked?

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Huh.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess we won,
so whatever.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
Aw, crap, we're in the water?

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
No! Help!
I'm going to drown!

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
Wait... What?

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
I can breathe fine?

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
It's so pretty!

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
[RISA] I wonder if this must
be the "tranquil waters."

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.598 position:50% align:center
Like in the poem.

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Makes sense; it's so
peaceful and calming here.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, two more medals!

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN C]
Guys?

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A]
Man, Mii from the Flame Emperors

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
is something else!

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
She's got style and charisma,

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
and her group's out there
collecting medals

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
like nobody's business!

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN C]
Guys!

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN A] Yeah, but look
at the solo players.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
Payne's got it going on!

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
He's so good
at fighting that PvP

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
is practically a
cake walk for the guy!

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN C]
Would you guys listen?!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
This is important!
It's about Maple!

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN A]
Stop! I don't wanna hear it!

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
[F ADMIN A]
She beat Sea King this time?

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
That girl is way out of control.

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
[M ADMIN C] Yeah, she's
becoming more of a final boss

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
than the final boss itself!

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
[RISA] One day left;
how many do we have?

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] We need two more
medals to reach our goal;

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
think we can make it?

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Hmm, it's not much time.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
We might have to target
other players after all.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
I guess we don't have a choice.

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
Uh... Listen. Maple.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Let me do this one alone.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows your face
since you placed

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
so high in the last event.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
They'll be less cautious
if I'm by myself.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yeah, but...

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Stay here.

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
I need you to
protect our medals.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
That way we don't
lose any if I die.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
I shall protect them!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
I'll leave Oboro with you
as an added precaution.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Thanks!

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
Be careful out there.

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Yep. No problem.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
'Kay, good luck!

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
[OBORO, SYRUP squeak]

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I've been able to let loose.

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Look, fresh victims.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
Be on your guard.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
Right. You got it, sis!

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
Squall Strike! 

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Double Slash!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
[SPEAR GIRL A]
Why, you little--!

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.222 position:50% align:center
How dare you!

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
Crap!

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
What the heck? What are you?

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Farewell.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
[RISA groans]

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
Not a single medal.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
Well then, onto the next one.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Come on! You've got this!

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
Almost there! Bite 'em, guys!

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
You guys are awesome!

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
You'll be big and strong
in no time, yes you will.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
I hope Sally's doing okay.

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
[PLAYERS gasp]

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
[yell]

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
Only two, huh?

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
I guess not that many
players have 'em.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
We must've just
had really good luck.

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
All right. Time to head back!

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
That means we have 20 medals!

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
[RISA] If you want, we can
spend the rest of the day

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
just hiding out here.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
Okay! Oh. So, uh...

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
While you were gone,
I raised the pets' levels

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
by having them fight
the cave monsters.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's great!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
[RISA]
Kasumi?

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
I thought I heard voices
coming from inside.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] What brings you
to this lovely cave?

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
Well, being the
last day and all,

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
there's widespread PvP.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
I thought it wise
to hide out for a while.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to hang out
with us if you want.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Our cave is your cave!

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Um... Thanks.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
Hydra!

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
See? Now no one
will step foot in here.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
Or leave.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
Ew. What the heck is this?

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
Dude, it's a poison cave.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
No way we're exploring in there.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
But there's probably
a crap ton of medals

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
and treasure just ripe
for the taking!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
[M PLAYER D]
We'll never survive it.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
We'd die instantly.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
[M PLAYER C] Bet that cave
has a crazy strong boss in it.

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yippee!

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
Yet another win for me!

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
Seriously?
How are you so good at this?

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
Let me play, I'll defeat her!

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE chuckles]
A bold assumption!

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
[DORAZOU]
Rawr, rawr!

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, everyone!

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
That marks the end
of the second event!

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
Players with more
than ten medals

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
will be given a choice
to pick a skill!

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
It's over.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
At long last.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda relieved, y'know?

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
Very impressive!

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Thanks!

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have done it
without Sally.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
This event was fun.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
'Cause we saw
all sorts of places.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
And met all sorts of people!

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
We fought scary bosses,
and even solved a puzzle!

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
Like... you guys!

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
We had such a jam-packed week!

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
I feel like we all just went on
the most amazing adventure ever!

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
You saying you had fun?

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
No, I had a blast, Sally!

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Check out
the new Megamorph skill

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
that sweet Syrup learned!

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
I really hope my idea works.

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
Psychokinesis!

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Oh, wow!
It's just like I imagined!

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Wait.

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
So, is this the skill that
you chose after earning

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
all those medals from
the second event?

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yep! It's "Psychokinesis."

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
I wanted to fly through
the sky with Syrup!

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hold on a sec,
I have an idea!

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
Summon Acid Rain!

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
[MONSTERS squeal]

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:11.289 position:50% align:center
Whoa.
