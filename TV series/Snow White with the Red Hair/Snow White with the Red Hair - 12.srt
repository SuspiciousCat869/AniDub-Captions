it a great deal, in fact.

About our future.

163
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,291
[SHIRAYUKI] Sometimes, when I
see Zen around the castle,

164
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,541
we get to have little moments
together like earlier.

165
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,333
And then when we part.

166
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,166
I still feel like he's
right there with me.

167
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
But the truth is,

168
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:55,125
in this castle, I'll always
be far away from him.

169
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,458
Even so, he's worth it.

[MITSUHIDE] Nicely done.
What's on the agenda now?

No, of course I'm
not, your highness!

This is a place of celebration.

You're just looking for a reward

so you can make yourself
some pretty new costumes!

Don't be stupid! I'm an

What?!

223
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,125
I must determine whether
the prince is truly suitable

for my sweet princess.

A test, if you will.

who serves the princess.

The eve before the wedding,

he will test the prince's
worthiness of her.

And they will have a duel to
see which one is stronger.

The princess will
make her appearance

she only has one line to say.

Right. I think I can do it.

Good point. Best not
to startle anyone.

00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Why did Zen go on stage?

320
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,833
Ah.

321
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,333
Well, it is the
real prince's duty

322
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,416
to protect his princess, right?

323
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,208
[OBI] Your hair. The kiss on
your hand from someone else.

324
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,125
Our sweet prince was jealous.

325
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

326
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,916
Poor master. That look on his
face gave everything away.

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,958
I can read that
guy like a book.

328
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,125
He's a page turner.

329
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,041
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen has always
been honest with me.

330
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,541
About his feelings, and
especially his passion.

331
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,333
[SHIRAYUKI] I'll always know
how important they are.

332
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,958
After all, he inspires
them in me, too.

333
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,416
[AUDIENCE cheers]

334
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's so funny.

335
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,833
I never imagined we'd wind
up on a stage together!

336
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,416
[ZEN]
Seriously.

337
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,833
I'd like to watch the same play

338
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,833
as part of the
audience next time.

339
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Me, too.

340
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,833
[ZEN] It felt strange to play a
knight dueling with a prince.

341
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,958
I really enjoyed it, though.
I even got to keep this mask.

342
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,958
If I may, Sir Knight,
you wear it well.

343
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,583
Uh. What is that?

344
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,625
Oh, Obi gave it to me earlier.

345
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,833
It's the prize he got
for winning the match.

346
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,708
[ZEN]
That scoundrel.

347
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,041
It's like he's trying
to irritate me...

348
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

349
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,500
But I admit, it looks good.

350
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,041
Uh. Mm... Thank you.

351
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,875
I guess I won't
take it off, then.

352
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,583
[ZEN] Did you have to
keep your hair covered

353
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,250
when you were living
in Tanbarun?

354
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
[SHIRAYUKI] No, it was
always out in the open.

355
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,208
Even after I first moved to
Clarines, I let everyone see it.

356
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,208
[ZEN] That's true.
I saw it when we met.

357
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,541
If it's okay to ask you, there's
something I've been wondering.

358
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,708
Has it... ever caused
you problems?

359
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,708
Other than Raj, I mean.

360
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,000
At times, for sure.

361
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,000
But I figured out
how to deal with it.

362
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,375
My grandparents helped me
get through it all, too.

363
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,416
[ZEN]
Your grandparents?

364
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,666
Yes.

365
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,375
I learned so much about
how to live your life

366
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,958
from the two of them. They
were always planning ahead

367
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,375
to when I'd eventually
have to fend for myself.

368
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,208
They told me there'd be
times when it seemed

369
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,083
like I couldn't count on
anyone else in this world.

370
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,875
That's when I'd have
to take care of myself

371
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,583
and be my own strongest ally.

372
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,791
And... they were so right.

373
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,500
I understand.

374
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,750
Since the day I met
you, I noticed that.

375
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,000
How independent you are,

376
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,291
and how you don't like
asking people for help.

377
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,791
I guess they were the ones
who instilled that in you.

378
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,500
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

379
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,875
Though, as of late, I--

380
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,708
No. I rely on you, too.

381
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,208
[ZEN]
Uh?

382
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,666
I know I may not always show it,
but at this moment, I do.

383
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,625
I have for a while, now.

384
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,291
I think you bring out
the best in me!

385
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,875
[ZEN]
Really?

386
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Mm-hm. I'm glad I
trusted myself and stayed here.

387
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,625
Zen. Will give me
your hand, again?

388
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,250
[ZEN]
Mm?! Sure.

389
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:32,375
This is exactly where
I want to be. With you.

390
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Um. Uh!

391
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,166
I'm not very good
at stuff like this.

392
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,750
Sorry if it got weird.

393
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,166
No, it's fine!

394
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,541
Yeah.

395
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,458
[CROWD cheers]

396
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,500
[SHIRAYUKI, ZEN]
Uh?

397
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
What are those?

398
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,041
[ZEN] 
It's how this day ends.

399
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,583
The Open Castle finale.

400
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,416
We wish on the lights, and
release them into the sky.

401
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,583
Would you like to go
take a closer look?

402
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm!

403
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,166
[ZEN]
Oh, Shirayuki!

404
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,333
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

405
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,791
[ZEN]
Just until we get outside.

406
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,750
[MITSUHIDE growls]
Zen.

407
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

408
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,416
I'm right here, calm yourself.

409
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,583
[MITSUHIDE]
Too late!

410
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,875
Did I or did I not warn
you to be careful

411
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,166
what you did in public?!

412
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,875
Apparently, Mitsuhide
saw the play.

413
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,833
Oh, I see.

414
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,208
[CROWD cheers]

415
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,416
Wow, so pretty!

416
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,041
[ZEN grunts]
Oh, shut up.

417
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,291
It's really kinda sweet.

418
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,541
You fuss over the Master

419
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,416
almost like you're
his father, Mitsuhide.

420
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,166
It's my job, and I'm
rather fond of him.

421
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,666
Remember that time
you two argued

422
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,125
and he wouldn't talk
to you for a while.

423
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,583
So you went on
that hunger strike

424
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,708
until he spoke to you again?

425
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,541
Come on, it was
only for one day!

426
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
It would've been two, but I
couldn't last any longer.

427
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,333
Two days?

428
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,583
Impressive, who knew
you were that immature?

429
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,875
[ZEN]
Ok, That's enough, you guys.

430
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,833
Listen. Shirayuki
already knows this,

431
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,416
but whatever the
future may hold.

432
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,208
I can't envision it without
each and every one of you.

433
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen, look, it's beautiful!

434
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,333
Is it just me, or has somethin'
changed with him recently?

435
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,625
He's just asserting himself.

436
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,958
[MITSUHIDE] You might have
to work harder. For once.

437
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,583
[SHIRAYUKI] We all chose
to travel the same path.

438
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,791
And while this moment
is truly wonderful,

439
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,375
there might be difficult
times ahead.

440
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm not too worried, though.

441
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,291
Because I know there
will be happiness.

442
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,041
[SHIRAYUKI] As long as
we continue forward,

443
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,250
joy is guaranteed.

444
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
We'll walk this path together.
