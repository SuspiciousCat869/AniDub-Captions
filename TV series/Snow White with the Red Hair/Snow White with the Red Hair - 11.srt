1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,166
[SHIRAYUKI] True human
value can't be measured

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,458
by social status.

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,583
It's measured by one's
depth of character.

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:16,041
Meanwhile, you've shown you
have no character at all!

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,458
[SHIKITO] The viscount tried
to sabotage the test,

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,916
so I had to arrest him.
He is out of the picture.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,958
Unfortunately, the
assistant was injured.

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,958
[ZEN]
Show me where you're hurt.

9
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,666
It's not like I was ever
gonna try to hide this.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,708
I know how mad you'd be at me.

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,375
[ZEN]
Idiot.

12
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,916
[gasping]

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,250
[ZEN] I-I don't know
what just came over me!

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,083
I'm sorry. Please forgive me!

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,250
[ZEN] Shirayuki.

16
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,583
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

17
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,708
Next time...

18
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,833
I'll ask to kiss you, first.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,250
Please tell me how
you feel, then.

20
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,000
If you don't want this,

21
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,833
I promise to respect
your boundaries.

22
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,875
Shirayuki. Did you hear me?

23
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,958
[ZEN]
Well, we should head back.

24
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,791
It's about to get dark, so
we should probably hurry.

25
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,666
[BRECKER]
This is all absurd.

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,208
A girl without any social
status whatsoever has no place

27
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,916
in the court of a prince.
It's treachery.

28
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,333
[MITSUHIDE]
Kiki. What now?

29
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm thinking a trip
to the island.

30
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,541
[KIKI]
Mm.

31
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,500
[ZEN]
Ready? Let's move out.

32
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,791
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,541
[OBI]
Uh!

34
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,083
[OBI]
Her hands. They're hot.

35
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,708
[SHIRAYUKI] I had heard Zen
say my name so many times.

36
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,500
But now there was a
warmth in his voice,

37
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,750
a flame in a color I'd
never seen before.

38
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,750
[OBI yawns]

39
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,833
[KIHAL] Shirayuki,
I don't know what to do!

40
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,708
I can't believe
the prince himself

41
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,333
is escorting me back
to the island!

42
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,750
I don't understand what
you're so nervous about.

43
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,000
Uh, we're talking about
His Royal Highness!

44
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,750
[ZEN]
Kihal! Sorry to make you wait!

45
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,958
Are you ready to go home?

46
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,625
Yes, I am, Your Highness!

47
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,250
The fastest route
to Yuris Island

48
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,708
is to follow this mountain pass.

49
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,333
We'll emerge right at the coast.

50
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,458
And from there, it's a
short journey by sea.

51
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Be calm.
Just keep breathing.

52
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,166
No one's gonna notice
anything's weird.

53
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,791
[KIHAL] Right. We should get
there in no time at all.

54
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,958
[gasps]

55
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,375
Shirayuki. Did you
come to see Kihal off?

56
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh! Uh-huh. Yes.

57
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,125
I did, yes.

58
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,666
[ZEN]
How's your arm doing?

59
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,291
[SHIRAYUKI] Oh, better, thanks.
Ryu's keeping an eye on it.

60
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,166
[ZEN]
I'm glad to hear that.

61
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,666
You know what's wrong with her?

62
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,958
Shirayuki's been acting weird

63
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,041
ever since we finished
the bird test.

64
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,541
Yeah, you're right.

65
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,416
And Zen seems normal,
which is even stranger.

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,250
I thought that was
kinda weird, too!

67
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,875
No doubt it's because something
happened between them.

68
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,416
[BOTH]
What?! What do you mean?

69
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,750
Take a guess...

70
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,708
[ZEN] Hey, what are you
all waiting for? Let's go.

71
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,583
Uh! Right!

72
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,791
[OBI]
Too bad.

73
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,625
It would've been nice if I
could've gone with them.

74
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,166
But I guess somebody's
gotta watch over you.

75
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,458
Tell me something.

76
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,333
When you and the prince
were alone together

77
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,833
that day in the watchtower...

78
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,833
Did he give you a hard time?

79
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Hm? No,
of course he didn't!

80
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,625
[OBI]
Hm. My mistake.

81
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,208
I'm gonna figure out
what happened, though.

82
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, I'm running late,

83
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,875
so I'd better head
over to work, now!

84
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,375
Uh. Wait. Hey!

85
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,750
She'll never tell me anything.

86
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:03,833
[SHIRAYUKI pants]

87
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,875
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

88
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,958
It's been three days
since we kissed,

89
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,666
so why am I still such a mess?

90
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,458
Every time he comes near me I
get flustered all over again.

91
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,708
[ZEN] Please tell me
how you feel, then.

92
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Nothing like this

93
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,166
has ever happened
between us before.

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,666
It's new.

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,708
How can I tell him
how I feel when

96
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,541
I can't even figure
it out for myself?

97
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,291
[GRANDFATHER]
You want to use the birds

98
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,833
as a means of communication?

99
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:46,833
[MITSUHIDE
Yes.

100
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,291
Kihal helped us
to test the idea,

101
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,333
and the results were
highly successful.

102
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,250
We believe this system
could be implemented

103
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,375
throughout the entire kingdom.

104
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,291
That said, it's important
to protect the birds,

105
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,416
so we will need
your cooperation.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,625
We'd like to bring a few of
your people to the castle

107
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,375
to help train the soldiers to
handle the animals properly.

108
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,375
That way none would be harmed.

109
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,458
[ISLANDER A]
Is he serious?

110
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,916
[MALE ISLANDER B]
I think so.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
[MITSUHIDE] We understand
there has been some conflict

112
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,750
with poachers,
but this proposition

113
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,833
could quite possibly put
an end to that permanently.

114
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,250
[GRANDFATHER] In order to trust
that your motives are sincere,

115
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,708
I have two requests.

116
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,208
We want a formal apology
from Lord Brecker,

117
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,250
and a consolation payment.

118
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,708
I think ten million dil
would be appropriate.

119
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,083
Ten million?!

120
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,083
[MITSUHIDE] Paying you
isn't the best way to prove

121
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,791
that we're sincere
in our requests.

122
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,708
[ZEN] Hm. I'll do my very
best to get a formal apology

123
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,208
from the Viscount,

124
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,250
but the money's a different
matter. Your thoughts, Kiki?

125
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,916
Let me consider. Ten million
dil is a lot of money.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,125
What if we offered you
twenty million instead?

127
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,458
Would you agree to
the terms then?

128
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,958
[gasps]

129
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,291
If we used money and power to
bribe you into acceptance,

130
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,958
we'd be as bad Brecker.

131
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,666
Paying you isn't the
best way to prove

132
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,208
that we are sincere
in our requests.

133
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,750
[ISLANDERS gasp]

134
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,333
[GRANDFATHER] Forgive me
for speaking disrespectfully,

135
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,500
Your Highness. We would
be honored to cooperate.

136
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,916
Great. I look forward
to working with you.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,416
[BOYS cheer]

138
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,833
[BOY A] Um, Prince Zen?
Are you real royalty?

139
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,291
Hey! Leave him alone!

140
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,708
Yep! I sure am.

141
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,750
[BOYS sigh]

142
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,791
Oh, wow! A true blue
prince, no way!

143
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,500
So, Prince! What's it like
to live in a castle?

144
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,708
Do you wanna try some
of our food maybe?

145
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,000
[BOYS chattering]

146
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,416
All right, kids.

147
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,333
You can have an audience
with the prince one at a time.

148
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,333
[BOYS]
Wow!

149
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,250
[BOYS chattering, laughing]

150
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,875
It's like they forgot I exist.

151
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,291
[GRANDFATHER] That young man
saw through me immediately,

152
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,666
didn't he? I couldn't
believe my ears.

153
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,625
I assumed a prince must
be as bad as the viscount.

154
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,041
And I suppose I was wrong

155
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,000
to make such a blind
assumption about him.

156
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,666
[MITSUHIDE] Getting some
fresh air, Highness?

157
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Will you permit me to join you?

158
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,041
[ZEN] Only if you
stop talking like that.

159
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,625
Thank goodness.

160
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,500
[ZEN]
Where's Kiki?

161
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,250
[MITSUHIDE] She thought I
should be the one to do this.

162
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,958
The one to do what?

163
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,166
[MITSUHIDE]
To find out what happened

164
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,625
between you and Shirayuki.

165
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,708
[gasps]

166
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,291
What's going on?

167
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,458
[ZEN sighs]
I kissed her.

168
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,125
In the watchtower.

169
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Huh.

170
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,583
What?! You've gotta
be kidding me!

171
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,416
Are you sure you didn't
dream it or something?

172
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,833
I know what's real life!

173
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,791
Uh. So, then,
how did she react?

174
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,583
[ZEN]
Uh... It's hard to say.

175
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,375
She got quieter than
I've ever seen her.

176
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Really? Did she say anything?

177
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,083
[ZEN] No, she looked
shocked and turned red.

178
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,291
So she blushed?!

179
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,666
She did! Stop acting
like I'm making this up!

180
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,291
[MITSUHIDE]
I just can't believe it. Heh.

181
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,833
[ZEN] I've felt like this about
Shirayuki for a long time.

182
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,333
Maybe even since
the day we first met.

183
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,583
When I kissed her,
it was undeniable.

184
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,291
It took me over.

185
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,958
Now, I want to tell her how
I feel, but I can't yet.

186
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,750
[MITSUHIDE] Zen, she doesn't
care what you are.

187
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,041
[ZEN]
Hm?

188
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,583
[MITSUHIDE]
Never mind.

189
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,041
[ZEN grunts]
What did you mean by that?

190
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,166
Hell, I don't care
who you are, either.

191
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,958
None of us serve you
because you're a prince.

192
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,000
We couldn't care less.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,125
[ZEN]
I know.

194
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,750
[SHIRAYUKI] I finished
cooking the riko fruit.

195
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,208
[RYU]
Great, grind it up.

196
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,375
I'm almost done weighing
out the rudro leaves.

197
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
Sure!

198
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,250
[OBI] What are the two of
you doing with all that?

199
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,625
Hm?

200
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
We're making a medicinal tea.

201
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
The Chief has pulled a few
all-nighters in a row,

202
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
and she's at her breaking point.

203
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,875
Which means she's
less than agreeable.

204
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,500
[RYU] If we make her
a restorative drink,

205
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,000
she should be nice enough for
us to make it through the day.

206
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,208
[OBI] Does she need medicine?
Why not a pot of regular tea?

207
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,041
[SHIRAYUKI] Because we
sorta wanted to experiment

208
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,541
with herbs on her.

209
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,458
It's done!

210
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,791
This is gross.

211
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,625
What if we added sugar,
and maybe some julia flowers?

212
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,958
It would taste better,
but make it less potent.

213
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,125
What do we have that's more
like the other ingredients?

214
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,541
[OBI]
Roka fruit?

215
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,083
It tastes pretty sweet,
and may add to the effect.

216
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,625
I've never tried boiling
roka in water before.

217
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,625
[ALL slurping]

218
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,000
[laughs]

219
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,333
[GARAK groans]

220
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,666
[GARAK]
I have so much work to do.

221
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,666
Did you get any sleep?

222
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,625
We made this for you.
It's roka tea. Drink up!

223
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,958
You did what?

224
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,250
[sniffs]

225
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,916
Smells good.

226
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,250
Tastes great!

227
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,333
[SHIRAYUKI laughs]

228
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,708
[sighs] You know, this would
be the perfect thing

229
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,791
to add to kids'
medicine for flavor.

230
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,291
The sweet notes
will cut bitterness,

231
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,041
but it won't
decrease the effect!

232
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,541
Uh. Interesting.

233
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,333
I never imagined
children wouldn't like

234
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,750
the taste of medicine.

235
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,875
I'm pretty impressed
that you two had the idea

236
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,458
to make me roka tea.

237
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,041
Oh, Obi should get the credit.

238
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,458
[OBI]
Mm? Uh?!

239
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,791
Really?

240
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,250
Well, you did learn about
roka fruit first hand

241
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,000
that day you helped
us harvest it.

242
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,291
Uh. It was nothing really,
just a little beginner's luck.

243
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,208
I think it was a bit
more than that.

244
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,000
This idea came about when you
put your heads together.

245
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,583
Your different perspectives
seem to spark your creativity.

246
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,083
Sounds like you all
make the perfect team.

247
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,333
That's good to know
for the future.

248
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,458
Shirayuki. After you finish
that you can call it a day.

249
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
What? You don't need me?

250
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,375
[RYU] We're already
way ahead thanks to you.

251
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, but, I don't mind.

252
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,416
I could use something to
keep me busy, so, I can stay.

253
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,666
I want to stay.

254
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,875
[RYU]
What do you mean?

255
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh, well... Uh. It's nothing.

256
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,791
[RYU]
It's something.

257
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,500
And if it worries you,
then try writing about it.

258
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,541
[OBI, GARAK]
Uh?

259
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,000
It might make you feel better.

260
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,291
[bell tolls]

261
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,166
[SHIRAYUKI] Ryu's even
worried about me, now.

262
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,750
He's right, though.

263
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,750
I can't just keep
distracting myself

264
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,041
from thinking about that kiss.

265
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,000
I should take some time
to really figure out

266
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,916
how I feel about Zen.

267
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
The forest.

268
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,541
[OBI]
Uh. You wanna go?

269
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, if that's all right.

270
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,125
[OBI] Unless they're
using it for training,

271
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,750
we should be able
to go in, no problem.

272
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,916
Let's do it.

273
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,791
[OBI] Even though the forest
is on castle grounds,

274
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,041
it's still a bit of a hike.

275
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,875
[OBI]
She's not even talking anymore.

276
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,083
[ZEN]
Shirayuki!

277
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, hello, there, Master!
You're back so early!

278
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,666
[ZEN]
Not true, we're right on time.

279
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,875
Where are you two going?
We had trouble finding you.

280
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,250
Shirayuki?

281
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,541
What's the matter with you?
What are you hiding for?

282
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,916
I... I'm not ready, yet.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,125
I can't face him.

284
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,291
What?

285
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,416
Fine! Run away, now, Miss!

286
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,958
Uh...

287
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,250
What?

288
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,875
Go, run into the forest!
You've got a head start!

289
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

290
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,250
She ran away.

291
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,166
[OBI laughs]
Weird, why would she do that?

292
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,041
Because you told her to!

293
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,625
[OBI] I don't know what you're
talking about. What'd I do?

294
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,916
It's not like I'm the one
she's running from, is it?

295
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,083
[ZEN] Mitsuhide, Kiki, Obi.
I'm going after her.

296
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,000
Wait at the castle.

297
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,958
[BOTH]
Yes, sir. As you wish.

298
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,000
[OBI] Don't worry, Miss.
He's on his way.

299
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,791
[SHIRAYUKI panting]

300
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
What did I run away for?

301
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,416
What if he follows me out here?

302
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,125
I don't think I've ever felt
this stupid in my life.

303
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,833
[ZEN] Shirayuki!
What is the matter with you?

304
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,125
[SHIRAYUKI] Nothing! I just
can't face you right now.

305
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,416
I don't know what to say.

306
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,083
[ZEN]
Will you please stop running?

307
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,458
This is getting a
little ridiculous.

308
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,875
Why are you apologizing?

310
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,791
You have nothing
to feel bad about.

311
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,291
If the tables were turned,
I'd be running, for sure.

312
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh? It's not about the kiss.

313
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was surprised, but
there's more to it.

314
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,541
So, what is it, then?

315
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,000
Was it the part where I asked
you to tell me how you felt?

316
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,041
[gasps]

317
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,083
[ZEN] The first time we met was
in a forest like this, remember?

318
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:38,666
Wanna stay? We can just
talk for a little while.

319
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,208
[ZEN]
Oh, right.

320
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,750
The meeting with the people
of Yuris Island went very well.

321
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Really? That's wonderful.

322
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,333
[ZEN] We're moving forward
with the birds.

323
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,208
The next step is to build
the training squad,

324
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,875
so Kihal will be coming
back to the castle soon.

325
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,458
The wind feels better here than
anywhere else in the kingdom.

326
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,875
[birds chirping]

327
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,208
[SHIRAYUKI] Do you spend a
lot of time in the forest?

328
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,583
[ZEN] Mm... I used to,
just to get away from it all,

329
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,208
but then I started to practice
horseback riding out here.

330
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,333
That's when it stopped being
a relaxing place for me.

331
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,708
It's been a while.

332
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,750
I guess I prefer the forest
outside the grounds now.

333
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,791
I see.

334
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,500
Though having you with me
makes it lovely again.

335
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,833
You do change things.

336
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,083
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

337
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,958
[wind blows]

338
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,250
I love that sound.

339
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Me, too.

340
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,625
[SHIRAYUKI] It was then
I started to realize,

341
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,375
since I met Zen,
things had changed.

342
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,791
The comfort and peace
I felt being around him

343
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,000
was growing into something new.

344
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,125
Something I'd never felt before.

345
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,083
Something I couldn't deny
to myself any longer.

346
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,958
[SHIRAYUKI cries]

347
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,000
[ZEN]
Hm?!

348
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,166
[SHIRAYUKI] Zen. I think
I'm in love with you.

349
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
I've always cared about you

350
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,166
and had so much respect
for the person you are.

351
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,833
I thought I just wanted
to be there for you.

352
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:16,500
But, now, I know it's more
than being your friend...

353
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,541
And...

354
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,000
It scares me.

355
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,333
[SHIRAYUKI] I can't act
like things are the same

356
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,875
as they've been between us.

357
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,041
This is so much bigger than
anything I've ever felt before.

358
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,166
It almost hurts, and I don't
know what to do with it.

359
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,958
[SHIRAYUKI cries]

360
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,916
[ZEN] You're right.
It's different now.

361
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,791
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

362
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,416
My title might not always
be able to protect you.

363
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
In fact, it might make life
harder for us sometimes.

364
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,625
The truth is,
situations will arise

365
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,208
where I'm forced to
choose my duty over you.

366
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,583
It's inevitable,

367
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,416
and I need you to understand
that in the beginning.

368
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,375
I don't care that it
may not be easy, though.

369
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,666
Together, we can
weather the storms.

370
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,500
You give me that faith.

371
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:15,250
I swear I will protect you and
what we have with my life.

372
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,041
It may seem strange, but
I'll need your help, too.

373
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,333
You inspire me like
no one I've met.

374
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,833
You are my strength.

375
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,541
I think you're my destiny.

376
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,083
So tell me.

377
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,833
If I reach out my hand,
Shirayuki, will you take it?

378
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,250
Yes. I'll take your hand, Zen.

379
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,250
[ZEN] There's something that's
plagued me for years now.

380
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,291
[ZEN]
Ever since I realized my title

381
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,625
could get in the way
of normal relationships,

382
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,583
I've been occupied
with a specific fear.

383
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,208
[ZEN]
Hey, Mitsuhide.

384
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,625
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes?

385
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,166
[ZEN]
Tell me honestly.

386
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,958
If I fell in love,

387
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,458
and decided that I wanted
to be with that person.

388
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,000
When they tell me
how they feel,

389
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,000
how will I know if they
love me for who I am?

390
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,208
Can I trust that people
won't love me for my title?

391
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,666
That they're not just
afraid to disobey me?

392
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,916
Will I ever be able
to believe them?

393
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,958
I'm afraid I'll never be
able to accept real love.

394
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,083
That my doubts will
always get in the way.

395
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,208
Will I ever not worry?

396
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,583
Shirayuki. Thank you.

397
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,916
[SHIRAYUKI] That voice
I'd heard so many times

398
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
sounded warm and new.

399
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,041
It lit a fire in my heart.

400
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,916
[ZEN]
Her eyes sparkled so tenderly.

401
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,250
They lit a fire in my heart.

402
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,958
[ZEN]
I will never forget this day.

403
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
When I look back on this moment,

404
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,583
I'll remember the
warmth of our kiss.

405
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,333
[ZEN]
I'll know that I'm loved.

406
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,291
[ZEN, SHIRAYUKI]
And that will give me courage.

407
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Open Castle Day?

408
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,875
[MITSUHIDE]
Zen!

409
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,500
[SHIRAYUKI] I'm... not very
good at stuff like this.

410
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,041
[MITSUHIDE]
That's really great news.

411
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,083
Because we want
that for you, too.

412
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,750
[TROUPE LEADER]
Okay, wait for it.

413
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,083
This is the high
point of the show!
