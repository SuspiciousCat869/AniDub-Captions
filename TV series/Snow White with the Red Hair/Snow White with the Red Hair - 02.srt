A few herbs for the final touch.

00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,125
Yes, please come in!

5
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,250
Good morning, Shirayuki!

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,916
Here, I have your
fresh-baked bread.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,958
That looks great!

00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,291
[WOMAN]
I'll leave it right here.

00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,625
I have something for you, too!

10
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,666
[WOMAN gasps]

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,541
That smells so good.
It looks like a cure-all.

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,583
This stuff will even
make your skin smoother!

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,625
That'd be nice!

[WOMAN laughing]

15
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,083
Do you enjoy living
in Clarines so far?

16
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,458
Yes.

17
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,500
In fact, I thought I'd start
looking for a job today.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,250
Sounds like a smart plan.

19
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,000
After all, if we wanna eat,
we have to work, don't we?

20
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:54,833
Right!

21
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,166
Good luck! Have a great day!

00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,083
Thanks! You, too!

[SHIRAYUKI] Wistal, the capital
city of the kingdom of Clarines,

24
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,666
and right now, my sanctuary.

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,250
Because of my unique hair,

26
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,583
the prince of Tanbarun tried
to force me to be his concubine.

27
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,041
So I fled my home country
to start a new life

28
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,833
in this kingdom.

29
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:21,458
I had planned to go along with
whatever fate decided for me,

30
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,500
but Zen, the Second
Prince of Clarines,

31
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:28,083
helped me to discover that
I still have a choice.

32
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,666
So, here I am.

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,750
In the country I choose.

34
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,791
In the city I choose.

00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,916
On the road I choose.

[SHIRAYUKI]
A gardener. A painter.

37
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,625
A carriage repair worker.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,833
These aren't right,
but this might be.

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,625
You're an herbalist?

40
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Yes, and I would
very much like to work here.

41
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,208
If I can.

00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,500
[PHARMACIST]
Hmm...

43
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,208
Unfortunately, we don't
need anyone, now.

44
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,083
Besides, that hair.

45
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,250
You can't judge someone
just based on her looks, dear.

46
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,166
What would our customers
think if they heard you?

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,708
[PHARMACIST]
Yes, you're right. Very sorry.

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,708
[SHIRAYUKI] They have so
many rare medicinal herbs

49
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,750
that I can't get back home.

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,625
Wow.

51
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,875
Not only that,

52
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,125
but they have varieties
I've never seen before.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,041
[PHARMACIST'S WIFE]
Thank you for waiting.

54
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,416
Is this closer to
what you were wanting?

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,958
That boy. Is he
a regular customer?

56
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,958
Indeed.

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,291
He's still young,

58
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,750
but he's already a very
respected court herbalist.

59
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,958
Oh, really?

60
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,625
Yes, listen closely,
not everyone knows this,

61
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,708
but only the most knowledgeable,
gifted and skillful herbalists

62
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,041
will ever be considered
for a valued position

63
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,416
working in the court.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,791
Clarines is a country
with deep pockets,

65
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,875
and they will assist
talented people.

66
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,000
If they're talented enough
to do the job, that is.

67
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,125
Right.

68
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,500
In medical study,

69
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,166
Clarines is much more
advanced than most kingdoms.

70
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,458
Here's the information on how

71
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,416
you can become a
court herbalist.

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,416
If you can successfully pass
the annual test they offer,

73
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
you'll be eligible to
work in Wistal Castle

Uh. Thank you!
Please come back soon!

then I think you should
try taking the exam.

78
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,791
But, be warned it is
rather difficult.

to see you again.

Where are you?

So, what're you doing here?

Um, yes.

106

You wanted me to be sure
and let you know

whenever I was going
to leave the capitol.

Yes.

117
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,416
That's the mountain
beyond the ocean.

118
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,416
What precisely are you
looking for there?

119
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,333
Many medicinal herbs
are native to the area.

120
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,125
I wanna stock up and
study more about medicine,

of a few promising places,

as especially good.

[SHIRAYUKI] Prince Raj
always orders his servants

to bring the things
he wants to his castle.

He doesn't ever lift a finger.

When they don't bring

00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,958
if you found yourself penniless.

324
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,958
You could wind up filthy,
and shamed, just like me.

325
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,500
No. I refuse to live
like this a moment longer.

326
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,000
I swear. I'm going
to be rich again.

327
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,583
I don't care what I have
to do to make it happen.

328
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,708
That's why I thought you'd
be a good insurance policy

329
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,583
for me, Red.

330
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,916
You're a guarantee.

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,333
That's enough.

332
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,875
I don't wanna hear any more.

333
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,458
You can keep your offensive
metaphors for her to yourself.

334
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:10,166
Shirayuki will not be a pawn.
For you or anyone, got it?

335
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
So your name's Shirayuki.

336
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,375
Do not speak her name!

337
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
Calm down.

338
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,083
Are you her father or something?

339
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,833
You are seriously asking for it.

340
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,291
Shirayuki, quick question.
Was this guy alone?

341
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:32,083
Uh... I don't know.
I didn't see anyone else.

342
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,291
If he's by himself, we can just
take him down the mountain.

343
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,833
We won't have to escort him
all the way to the castle.

344
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,083
We'll hand him over to
officials down at the base.

345
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,541
Castle?

346
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,250
What am I dealing
with? Who are you?

347
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,208
[ZEN]
Zen.

348
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,291
Huh...

349
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,500
Wait... as in Zen, the
Second Prince of Clarines?

350
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,625
As well as Shirayuki's friend.

351
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Excuse me!

352
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,875
Sir, please apply this
balm to his injuries.

353
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,958
You never told me, Red.

354
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,333
Where is that place
you mentioned

355
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,583
you wanted to go earlier? Alone?

356
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,875
[GUARD A]
Let's go!

358
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,666
Start walking, boy!

359
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,000
[SHIRAYUKI] From what
the officials indicated,

360
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,791
Mihaya doesn't seem to be
connected to any bandits.

361
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,083
He's working solo.

362
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,041
[ZEN]
Yes.

363
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
But just in case,

364
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,791
I'll be much more wary of
my surroundings from now on.

365
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,208
Good.

366
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Are... you angry?

367
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,916
[ZEN]
No.

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,333
Fine!

369
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,458
Then will you please make
eye contact? Ten seconds!

370
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,666
Look, you came to rescue me.

371
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,375
I don't have the
right words, but...

372
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,750
Thank you for--

373
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,625
That's all I needed.
Five seconds.

374
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,375
[ZEN]
I'll admit, I was a bit upset.

375
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,291
Not with you, though.

376
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:14,041
It's hard to explain, but
I was really mad at myself.

377
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,541
The truth?

378
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,333
Exploring life outside the
castle, I learned a great deal.

379
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:24,458
But after learning these things,
I realized I'm not doing enough.

380
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,583
Zen.

381
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,500
[ZEN] Shirayuki, what was
the answer to the question

382
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,750
that mountain monkey
asked you earlier?

383
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,000
What is the place you're
planning on going by yourself?

384
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ah. Oh, yes.

385
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,666
There's a reason I've decided
to stay in this country.

386
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,500
I want to know it.

387
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,708
See how the rest of
you live in Clarines.

388
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,458
Find out where I belong.

389
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,458
That's the place
where I'm going.

390
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,791
The place where I'll be at home.

391
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
Well, when you're there,

392
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,000
I hope I'll still be able
to see you anyway.

393
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,416
Shirayuki. Thank you, too.

394
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm happy that you're all right.

395
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
So, here I am.

396
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,791
In the country I choose.

397
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,750
In the city I choose.

398
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,458
On the road I choose.

399
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,458
Even if things get in my way,

400
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,333
at least my path is
within my own power.

401
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:28,208
No matter what, I know I'll
always have the wind at my back.

402
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,166
[SHIRAYUKI] Seeing all of
Clarines would be incredible!

403
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,375
[HARUKA] She'll have
expectations and take advantage.

404
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,583
[SHIRAYUKI] I thought you would
like to know that I'm applying.

405
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,625
[OBI]
Oh, I see.

406
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,208
The redhead is
apparently familiar

407
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,291
with the dear, sweet prince.

408
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,208
Heh.

409
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,791
[HARUKA]
Red is a vulgar color.
