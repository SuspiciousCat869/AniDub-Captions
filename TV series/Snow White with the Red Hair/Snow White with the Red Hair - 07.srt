I was up here?

It sounded a lot like a warning.

I swear he has no mercy.

00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,500
[ZEN] Shirayuki, there's,
uh, there's one more thing

161
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,000
I needed to talk to you about.

162
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Which is?

163
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,916
[ZEN] Raj said something fairly
outrageous at the party.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,041
Oh, no, what did he say?

165
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,083
Well, you won't like it.
He announced that I...

166
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,208
That I was thinking
of you as my fiancée.

167
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,375
[ZEN] I don't know if
anyone took him seriously,

168
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,250
but it might be
uncomfortable from now on.

169
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,291
Everyone around here
will be watching you,

170
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,583
and wondering if there's
any truth to it.

171
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Then, this means...
I can stay in the castle!

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Wait, but what about you
and the Laxdo incident?

173
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,041
Don't be concerned.
Those men will soon recover.

174
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:08,125
Right. You don't have
to worry about me, Zen.

175
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,708
I don't mind what
anyone might say.

176
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,083
[ZEN]
Uh!

177
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:16,041
I mean, it's not like it's
true. Who cares, right?

178
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,833
[gasps] What'd I say?

179
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,416
[ZEN] In that case, it doesn't
matter if everyone's watching.

180
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,750
You should just do as you
please, and be true to yourself.

181
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

182
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,541
[ZEN] I know it's easier
said than done,

183
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,750
and it doesn't apply
to everything.

184
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,291
You may slip up sometimes,
but you know that's okay.

185
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,875
Everyone does.

186
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,750
I'll take my advice, too.

187
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,500
And remember, I'm
always on your side.

188
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,791
[KAI] Shirayuki and
the prince are together?!

189
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,333
All right!

190
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,708
Keep your voice down, Kai.
It doesn't make sense;

191
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,458
they don't seem as though
they're anything more

192
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,666
than just good friends.

193
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,666
Come on, where'd you
hear this juicy tidbit?

194
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,375
You have to tell me, please!

195
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,958
I heard it from the guards who
were working the tea party.

196
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,208
They said that prince

197
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,541
who was visiting from
Tanbarun declared it.

198
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,208
Oh, that guy. I wonder...
How he would know?

199
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,541
[SHILA]
Seems like he knows Shirayuki

200
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,166
and the prince pretty well.

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,916
So, next we'll be taking a
tour of the medical buildings?

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,916
Are you feeling all
right, Prince Raj?

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,125
I'm fine, don't you worry!

204
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,916
Anyway...

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,375
they look just wonderful!

206
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,041
From the very best
buildings are borne

207
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,958
the very best
medicines, naturally!

208
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,541
Tanbarun could learn
from this example!

209
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,625
Right, Sakaki?

210
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,250
Uh! Yes, sir.

211
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,833
I'm so honored by
your kind words.

212
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,125
Well then, please come inside.

213
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,625
[RAJ]
No, that's all right!

214
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,708
We have thoughtlessly taken
enough of your valuable time

215
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,500
already, dear Madame.

216
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,833
Think nothing of it.

217
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,750
Prince Izana
specifically requested

218
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,208
that I show you around the
entire castle grounds.

219
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,375
Then I'm grateful to you
both for that generous

220
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,833
and considerate offer.
Excuse me a moment.

221
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,208
Sakaki, you check it out first!

222
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,666
Yes, but why me?

223
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,041
Use your head, fool!

224
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,791
Didn't you hear them say
that girl was working

225
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,250
as an herbalist in there?

226
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,875
I can't risk running into her!

227
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,250
That's true, and we have caused
her enough problems already.

228
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,833
Right. Anyway.

229
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,458
No good can possibly come of us
meeting again, even by accident.

230
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,416
And I'm positive Shirayuki
feels the same way.

231
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,750
[GARAK]
Pardon, Prince Raj?

232
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,875
Is everything all right?

233
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
Yes. Please excuse me.

234
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,708
[clears throat] Are we clear?

235
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,041
Yes.

236
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,750
All right, let us continue
our fascinating tour!

237
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,708
--[SAKAKI sighs]
--Sakaki! 

238
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,791
Right away, sir.

239
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,791
--[door opens]
--This room is nice.

240
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,083
[RAJ] What a splendid
facility you have!

241
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,291
[GARAK] Um. That's just
the storage area.

242
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,833
[RAJ]
Storage!

243
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,875
[SAKAKI]
This room is nice, too.

244
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,250
[RAJ]
Magical! I've never seen finer!

245
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,208
[GARAK]
Yes, thank you.

246
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,083
[ZEN] Do you think you can
finish by this evening?

247
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,500
Yes.

248
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,125
Excellent, then that will
be the last of the checks.

249
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,916
[SERVANT A]
Thank you very much.

250
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,791
[ZEN sighs]

251
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,125
Boy, Zen.

252
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,250
The days feel a lot longer
than 24 hours lately.

253
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,708
Oh, be quiet.

254
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,791
Kiki, what's up after this?

255
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,166
You get to see
Prince Raj off, finally.

256
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,250
Very good.

257
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,833
I'll see you there
in a bit, then.

258
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,375
[KIKI] 
Have fun, Zen.

259
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,625
[MITSUHIDE] 
Don't be too late.

260
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,708
[OBI] 
Master!

261
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,083
Are you heading over
to see the Miss now?

262
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,625
[ZEN] No, Shirayuki's
working at the moment.

263
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,875
Huh.

264
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh, by the way, have
you seen my brother?

265
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,500
[OBI] No, you have
business with him?

266
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,125
I just wanted to
have a little chat.

267
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:57,625
[RAJ groans] Oh, I'm glad
that's finally over.

268
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,208
I wouldn't get comfortable
just yet, Highness.

269
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,541
We're not leaving the castle
until this evening.

270
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,166
Yes, I know!

271
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,333
[SAKAKI]
Oh, again?

272
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,916
Ow! I'm not faking it!

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,875
I've been so wracked
with worry and stress

274
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,333
it's making my stomach hurt.

275
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,416
You should've mentioned
that to me earlier.

276
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,958
Are you serious?!
It's just a stomachache.

277
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,541
I can't afford to let
anyone here think

278
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,916
I might be vulnerable.

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,166
I understand.

280
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,500
At least let me go fetch
some medicine for you.

281
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,958
Wait, whatever you do,
don't say it's for me.

282
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,375
[SAKAKI]
As you wish.

283
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,833
[groans]

284
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,041
[sighs]

285
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,291
So, all that's left to do

286
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,250
is take this down to the
treatment room, right?

287
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,291
[RYU]
Yeah.

288
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,250
I'll start heading
over there now, then.

289
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,916
[RYU]
Thank you.

290
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,208
[door closes]

291
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,916
[RYU] Something seems
a little off with her.

292
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,041
[GUARD A] Is it the girl
close to Prince Zen?

293
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,583
[GUARD B] Yes, the one who
has the bright red hair.

294
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,916
[GUARD A]
Oh, her.

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,750
I don't think it's been
set in stone yet, though.

296
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,833
It might as well be,
she seems awfully close

297
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,083
to Mitsuhide and Kiki
from what I've seen.

298
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,041
[SHIRAYUKI] This is just
like Zen said it would be.

299
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,791
[ZEN] But it might be
uncomfortable from now on.

300
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
It doesn't matter. Who cares?

301
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,166
Lord Brother.
May I have a word with you?

302
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,958
[ZEN]
Izana?!

303
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,041
[IZANA] Come, Zen. Let's spar
a little, and we can talk.

304
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,958
Do you mean right this minute?

305
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,333
I've been feeling
a bit restless.

306
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,291
Following that little twerp
around makes me tense.

307
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:51,083
Besides, I think you want more
than just to chat, right?

308
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:51,625
[ZEN grunts]

309
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,583
[IZANA grunts]

310
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,833
You have the floor.
Start talking.

311
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,416
[ZEN grunts]
Well, for starters.

312
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,541
Why do you treat Shirayuki
like a nuisance

313
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,625
when you don't know her yet?!

314
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,166
Because I'm too
busy at the moment

315
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,333
to play 'getting to know you'

316
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,750
with a girl who's
clearly a distraction.

317
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,458
[ZEN] Too busy to bother
learning even one thing

318
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,125
before writing her off?

319
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,458
[gasps] Well, look who
finally found his voice!

320
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,333
I never needed my voice before.

321
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,291
[IZANA]
That's my point. I knew it.

322
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,958
It took no time whatsoever
to figure this out.

323
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,750
You've fallen for her
hard, and you know it.

324
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,166
Although, in the end,
it's irrelevant.

325
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,750
We can't always get what
our hearts want, Zen.

326
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,916
There are other girls out
there who have more value

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,250
and political worth.
People will want to see

328
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,625
if she has something to offer
Clarines besides unusual hair.

329
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,416
Once they realize she doesn't,

330
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,166
you'll be the laughingstock
of the entire kingdom.

331
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,541
[ZEN grunts]

332
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,500
[IZANA grunts]

333
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,916
You're rather off your
game today. Pity.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,791
Prepare yourself.
Because Shirayuki has a way

335
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,916
of taking preconceived
notions about her

336
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and proving them wrong.

337
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,958
I'm bored with this, now.
Come on, let's go back.

338
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,250
[ZEN] Lord Brother! You should
know you're wrong about her.

339
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,750
And having that girl in my life

340
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,333
is not going to divert
me from my path.

341
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,083
Then leave her behind.

342
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,333
[ZEN grunts]

343
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,208
[ZEN yells]

344
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,625
[panting]

345
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,375
[ZEN]
Never.

346
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,458
You're supposed to watch Zen,

347
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,708
and yet you allowed him to
bring a red headed diversion

348
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,166
into our lives.

349
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,625
I'm starting to think it's
because I was watching him.

350
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,916
[IZANA] Wonderful, it looks like
we have two impertinent mouths.

351
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,708
[MITSUHIDE] Guessing Zen
finally stood up to him,

352
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,541
and said something
"impertinent."

353
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,625
Our little prince is
starting to grow up.

354
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,875
[RAJ groaning]

355
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,416
What in the world could be
holding Sakaki up so long?

356
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,625
At this rate, my stomach
will rip itself open!

357
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,291
[RAJ gasps]

358
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

359
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,125
It looks like you're
working hard in Clarines.

360
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,041
This seems like
a very nice place.

361
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,750
I am, and yes, it is.

362
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,958
Uh... Well, excuse me.

363
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,208
[groaning]

364
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,541
Do you need some help?

365
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,958
No, no, nothing. I'm fine.

366
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,666
What's this? Is it medicine?

367
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,791
Yes, but it's specific.

368
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,416
[RAJ] You mean, they asked
you to bring it down to me?

369
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,791
Wait. What are you doing?
That's not for you!

370
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,708
[RAJ] Mm? Isn't this the
remedy I asked them for?

371
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,041
I know nothing about
a remedy for you!

372
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,583
Well, I told him not to
say that it was for me!

373
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,708
I'm taking this now!

374
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,750
[gasps]

375
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,000
[RAJ]
Uh...

376
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,166
That contained a
topical treatment!

377
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,333
It's for flesh wounds!

378
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,000
What?! So, it wasn't
a stomach medicine?

379
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,291
I said no!

380
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,041
[RAJ] Uh. Oh, well,
that could've ended badly.

381
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,291
[sighs] Well, I can't
really fault you

382
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,666
for thinking it was yours.

383
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,125
I should have been more
careful carrying it around.

384
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,458
You are royalty, though,

385
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,125
and in the jurisdiction
of another country.

386
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,250
You need to take responsibility
for your own safety.

387
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,291
One would imagine
my status as a prince

388
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,583
would be enough for you to
watch your tongue around me.

389
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,958
You're not supposed
to say stuff like that!

390
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,000
If you want me to respect
you as though I'm proud

391
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,458
of the ruler of my country,
then rule my country

392
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,416
like a prince I can be proud of.

393
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,083
You can't say stuff
like that, either!

394
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
You may very well be right,

395
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,666
but as someone from Tanbarun,

396
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,625
I think it's a
reasonable request.

397
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,041
[gasps] Are you serious?

398
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,416
[RAJ]
Ooh! That was rhetorical.

399
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,625
I don't need any more
insults, thank you!

400
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,041
[SAKAKI]
Your highness!

401
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,333
You shouldn't be wandering
the grounds alone!

402
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,166
You were too slow,
and I got bored!

403
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,875
Now, where's my medicine?

404
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,708
They need to examine you
before prescribing something.

405
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,041
[SHIRAYUKI] If you want, I can
take you to the treatment room.

406
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,541
[RAJ] 
I think not!

407
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,458
[SAKAKI grunts]
Wait for me!

408
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,041
[RAJ] No! I don't have time to
wait around for you anymore!

409
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,375
The chief herbalist isn't
going to like this.

410
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,458
[IZANA]
No, I imagine she won't.

411
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,708
Not after I tell her what I saw.

412
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,416
You have to realize by now

413
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,000
you'd be much better
off with Prince Raj.

414
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:40,166
Life for you here could be
unpleasant with me around.

415
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,208
You know that, right?

416
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,083
Prince Izana.

417
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,000
I have no intention of ever
returning to Tanbarun.

418
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,708
[IZANA]
Is that so?

419
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,208
I'm rather disappointed
to hear it.

420
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,958
You refuse to retreat?

421
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,708
Absolutely.

422
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,458
[IZANA] Direct eye contact,
too? Aren't you something?

423
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,250
So, tell me Princess.
Have you come to dislike it?

424
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,166
No, I never will.

425
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,625
It's the country
where I met Zen.

426
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,875
What strange children you are.

427
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:50,125
You don't think she'll show
up at the sendoff, do you?

428
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,541
[SAKAKI]
Are you worried about something?

429
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,958
[RAJ] Sakaki, please bow once
toward the castle in my stead.

430
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,375
What? Why me?

431
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,916
Just do what I ask you!
I'm trying not to lose face!

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,541
Right...

433
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,250
[bell tolls]

434
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,041
[RAJ gasps]

435
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
This is the path I've chosen.

436
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,208
[SHIRAYUKI] And I found
a beacon to guide me, now.

437
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,291
So I will keep moving forward.

438
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,458
And I won't let go.

439
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
No matter what,

440
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,750
we'll always have the
wind at our backs.

441
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,791
[MITSUHIDE] He was still
so young back then.

442
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,958
Barely more than a child.

443
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,666
[ATRI]
Prince Zen.

444
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,708
[MITSUHIDE]
Yet he bore a burden

445
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,125
which many adults
couldn't carry.
