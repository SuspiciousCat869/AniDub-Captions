You had everything I didn't.

A roof over you. All the
food you could ever eat.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,916
You were born into a life I'd
never know no matter what I did.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,666
It disgusts me that you
did nothing to deserve this.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,416
You took things for granted.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,250
And you'll die for it!

00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,916
No matter what you think of me.

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,333
You were my friend.

00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,583

I'll remember you.

I wonder, Prince, if... if you
hadn't been born into this.

Would things have
turned out better?

[ZEN] At some point
in all of our lives,

17
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,375
we long for a
genuine connection.

18
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,041
But we cannot stray from
the paths we travel.

19
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:14,041
So when we discover a soul
who inspires and moves us,

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,083
who speaks to our heart.

21
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,666
We hold on to that person.

22
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,375
Look at that.

23
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,291
Well, how is she?

[OBI]
Yes, she does.

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,708
I have to go back to the office
and finish up some work,

28
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,666
so if you don't mind, could
you look after her for a bit?

29
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,375
[footsteps]

I can handle that.

How are you feelin',
Miss? Any better?

32
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,083

Hm?

[GARAK]
Yes?

00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,791
Excuse me. Chief herbalist,
is Obi here, by chance?

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,708
You mean he wasn't
with Shirayuki?

37
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,041
I had asked him to keep
a close eye on her.

38
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,166
[KIKI] Keep an eye on her?
Did something happen?

[clears throat]

41
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,708
I offered her an alcoholic
beverage as a good-natured joke,

42
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,333
but then she passed out.

43
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,791
It would seem she can't
quite handle her liquor,

44
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,625
it was clear that she
needed to sleep it off

45
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,416
for a while so she
could sober up.

In the bunk room?

[GARAK]
Mm-hm.

00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,333
Shirayuki wasn't
in there, either.

00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,500
[GARAK]
Hm?

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,541
All I found was this
note written to Zen.

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,041
Wonderful.

52
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,583
She shouldn't be alone.
I hope Obi went with her.

53
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,916
[KIKI]
He must have.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,666
As long as she's with a
prince-approved guardian,

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,500
I think she'll be fine.

look sort of unsteady.

If I had an older brother, I
think he'd be like Mitsuhide.

Okay, so it seems she's
really drunk, still.

Look! There's Lord Haruka!

C'mon, why aren't you looking?

the middle of the night,

he's not there.

Besides, I'm not takin'
my eyes off you.

me all day?

asleep after I got...

"Red. There was contact.

"Red." Means Shirayuki.

108
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,750
Does "there was contact"
actually mean she had

a rendezvous
with Prince Zen?

According to this,

[IZANA]
I must admit.

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,541
That's an unorthodox way
to gather companions.

122
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,458
It's on track to be
extremely difficult,

but you're the ones who
will have to weather it.

More okay than you, Miss.

127
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,708
What's that mean?

128
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,000
Master said this
would happen, right?

129
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,708
That people would come
out of the woodwork

in swarms to investigate you?

131

They shouldn't bother. They
aren't going to learn anything.

Yeah. Well, some folks are far
more persistent than others.

133
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,833
[OBI]
I have a question.

134
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,791
How do you think master's doing?

135
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,958
I mean, with his
princely duties?

136
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,708
From what I can see,
he's trying to be himself.

137
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,333
Uh? That's your answer?

138
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Indeed, it is.

139
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,750
Look, he was noble even
when we'd just met.

140
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,333
He obviously loves his country.
Plus, he has Kiki and Mitsuhide.

141
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,750
Zen can't help it that
he's always been a prince

142
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,791
and that some people will always
try to take advantage of it.

143
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,208
I see no reason to hold
it against you now.

144
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,875
After all, when you left I
thought you might not come back.

145
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,458
But you did.

146
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,583
You've earned my trust.

00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,416
[OBI] Yeah, I get where
you're comin' from,

148
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,916
but I think you being
here is affecting him

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
more than you may realize.

150
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,791
Affecting him how?

Please don't tell me my

Wait, that's not funny.

What do you mean?

155
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,250
Mostly, I keep hearing
that everyone

156
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,000
is making fun of Prince Zen
because I spend so much time

157
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,333
with him. I'm only
making things worse.

158
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:05,416
[OBI] Tell me, Miss! What are
you actually mad about here?

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,625
Well, even though I fully
understand what the problem is,

160
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,083
I'm angry at myself because I
don't know how to fix it yet!

161
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,791
For example, the
Laxdo punishment!

162
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,291
[IZANA]
Oh, I see.

163
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,916
Then why don't
we remove Laxdo

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,375
from your weak jurisdiction
for, let's say, six months?

165
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,750
It still upsets me,

166
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,916
but I'm not certain if it's
worth going back there.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
[OBI] Aha. Then you were
planning to go to Fort Laxdo?

168
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,416
That explains why you were
mumbling about jackets,

169
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,916
and medicine, and a horse.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,041
Zen... Zen said he was fine.

171
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,083
But when he grabbed my hand,

172
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,458
he held it a lot
tighter than usual.

173
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,708
Playing strong, always.

174
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,208
[gasps]

175
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,541
And now we've gone back to
talking about the master.

176
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,375
It seems to me you
have the same need

177
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,625
to pretend everything's fine
most of the time too, Miss.

178
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,458
If you aren't sure what to do,

179
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,791
there's only one
way to find out.

180
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,666
Instead of waiting for
something to happen,

181
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,916
I suggest you get up
and take action.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,916
But, you shouldn't attempt
the venture on your own,

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,291
like you did just now.

184
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,375
There was a suspicious
person around.

185
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,250
[sighs] Yeah, guess
you're right.

186
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,041
[OBI]
If no one's there to stop her,

187
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,208
she'll jump into things
without thinking.

188
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,708
The exact same way Master does.

189
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,541
The ironic part is,

190
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,791
there's no way for her to
know that when she's alone.

191
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,833
[OBI] If you really
want to go to Laxdo,

192
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,583
then I'll take you there myself.

193
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,750
However, you should know,

194
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,291
I already went back
pretty recently.

195
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

196
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,500
Master and his aides
were worried about it,

197
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,791
and everyone at the fort
took exceptional care of me.

198
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,541
So when I got castle leave,
I went to check on 'em.

199
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,166
On that note, here. For you.

200
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,291
My goodness, this
is a sekko plant.

201
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,125
It can only grow under snow!

202
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,208
It must be a pretty
hard herb to find.

203
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,458
That little kid at Laxdo,
Shuka, is that his name?

204
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,083
He's the one who picked it.

205
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,250
Shuka did that?

206
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,541
[SHIRAYUKI] A progress report
of everyone's current condition.

207
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,333
Wow, this is
incredibly detailed!

208
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,916
[OBI]
Will that help you out?

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,833
[SHIRAYUKI] Mm-hm. Yes, it
will. It's like a road map!

210
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh. Guess the trip
wasn't too hard, then.

211
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,833
Well, it's easier when you
know how to ride a horse.

212
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,583
Takes an animal to know one.

213
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
What does that mean?

214
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,541
They gave me messages.

215
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,541
So many, in fact, that
I forgot a few of them.

216
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,458
But they all said
the same thing.

217
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,083
"We'll work hard... together."

218
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,875
That's great.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,666
[SHIRAYUKI] Which means I
need to work just as hard.

220
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,750
Thanks for doing that, Obi!

221
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,583
[OBI]
Me?

222
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,708
All right then, let's go back.

223
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,916
Oh...

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,791
Uh-oh.

225
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,958
Hey! Be careful!

226
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,250
Crap!

227
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,791
You're still three sheets
to the wind. My, my, my.

228
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,041
It's fascinating to watch
the show you all put on.

229
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,250
Even if I am only
a mere spectator.

230
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,291
Up we go!

231
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,416
So Zen can't help it, huh?

232
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,458
Boy, is this a problematic
place to spectate.

233
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,541
[sighs]

234
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,458
I'm finally back. So sorry.

235
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,791
Kiki, you're awfully late.

236
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,458
Zen, look.

237
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,666
What is it?

238
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,208
When I went to check
on them, I found this.

239
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,625
[ZEN]
I'll be back.

240
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,916
[ZEN] Oh, yeah, Kiki.
Did you get it?

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Hey, wait! Zen...

242
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,958
[KIKI] He went to
look for Shirayuki.

243
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,500
Is she missing?
What happened to her?

244
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,125
That note must bear bad news.

245
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,791
Obi's the one who wrote it.

246
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
Apparently, Shirayuki
had been drunk earlier,

247
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,666
and passed out cold.

248
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,708
[laughs]

249
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,250
So that's why he practically
flew outa here. [laughs]

250
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,541
Oh...

251
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,958
But how'd she even
manage to get drunk?

252
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,125
That's not like her.

253
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,291
Obi was with her,
and Zen's on his way,

254
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,083
so I'm sure it'll be fine.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,250
You're right.
I won't worry, then.

256
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,708
I'm glad she came to
join us. She fits well.

257
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

258
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,916
[ZEN] Has it really
been an entire month

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,916
since I've set foot outside?

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,083
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, sir.

261
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,250
And now that your
house arrest is over,

262
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,666
I have something
important for you.

263
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,291
[gasps]

264
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,583
[MITSUHIDE] Since the poor
boy doesn't have a grave,

265
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:58,458
we kept this.
The point of his arrow.

266
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,666
Atri.

267
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,083
[ZEN]
If I'm being honest,

268
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,000
I always knew in the
back of my mind

269
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,208
that his story never added up.

270
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,375
[MITSUHIDE]
I did, as well.

271
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,666
I wanted to believe...

272
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,250
I kept ignoring my doubts.

273
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,125
Prince Zen, know you are
a scion of this kingdom.

274
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,541
Among all who may
cross your path,

275
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,375
there will be people you
can trust eventually.

276
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,125
If you're suspicious
of everyone,

277
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,291
then everyone will
be your nemesis.

278
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,041
You should learn who
your allies are, first,

279
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,875
before assuming you
have nothing but enemies.

280
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,958
Try not to rush into
anything blindly.

281
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,333
[ZEN gasps]

282
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,583
As a prince of the
Clarines kingdom,

283
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,666
you will soon grow to learn
what is most important.

284
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,333
Take your time.
Be kind to yourself.

285
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,708
I am inexperienced, as well.

286
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,833
But I will remain by your side,

287
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,833
and become a man you
can always rely on.

288
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Please, allow me to protect you.

289
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,583
[ZEN]
Mitsuhide!

290
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,250
[MITSUHIDE gasps]
He said my name.

291
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,916
[ZEN]
I will become one, too.

292
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,500
[MITSUHIDE]
What do you mean, sir?

293
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,791
[ZEN]
I mean, I will become a master

294
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,666
his attendants can be proud of.

295
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,458
You've inspired me.
That's all. So, let's go.

296
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,416
'Kay?

297

[MITSUHIDE gasps]

298
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,916
Yes, I'm with you!

299
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,916
I've lightened up, Prince?

300
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,833
[laughs]

301
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,416
Stop it, that laugh is creepy.

302
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,750
Uh! My laugh is not creepy!

303
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,958
I was just remembering the time
Zen was making fun of me,

304
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,250
and he called me Grandpa
because I kept referring to him

305
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,291
by his formal title.

306
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,250
Oh yeah, that was pretty funny.

307
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,583
By the way, besides the note,

308
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,125
what did you toss to
Zen as he was leaving?

309
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,583
Just something he wanted me to
retrieve for him. You'll see.

310
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,333
[ZEN panting]

Obi. You scoundrel!

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,958
I thought you'd be
in the medical wing.

315
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,333
Don't leave your post!
I was looking for you!

00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,666
Is she sleeping?

318
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,291
Yes. She still has some
alcohol left in her system.

319
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,875
I got word from the guards.

320
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
They said you apprehended
someone suspicious?

321
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,750
Right. A man sent
to spy on Shirayuki.

322
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,166
As you said, this kind
of thing would happen.

323
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,250
She did admit to me
that she sensed people

324
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,833
were secretly
watching her of late.

325
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,375
Not long ago,

326
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,416
she'd have tried to do something
about that herself.

327
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,833
[ZEN] She actually wanted
to return to Laxdo?

328
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,458
[OBI]
Yes. But she was drunk,

329
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,208
she can't ride a horse,
and I wouldn't let her go.

330
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,291
[ZEN] I get it.
She was worried about me.

331
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,000
Why don't you two just
go back there together?

332
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,250
When you're busy working, six
months will pass by in a blink.

333
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,708
[ZEN]
Heh.

334
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,750
[OBI] Anyway, I hope you're
not mad, but in her state,

335
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,916
I had to pick her up
and carry her back.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,083
I didn't say anything,
did I?! Drop it, already.

337
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,500
Hey, you looked like you
were about to snap at me.

338
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,041
[ZEN]
No, I didn't!

339
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,250
[ZEN]
It's interesting.

340
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,166
I said she could send
you away if she wanted.

341
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,000
But, she clearly decided not to.

342
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,375
Obi.

343
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,541
You did a great job.

344
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,083
[OBI]
Um, thanks.

345
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,916
It was a close call, though.

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,416
[ZEN]
Oh, was it?

347
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,541
Well, you were up
against Shirayuki.

348
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:55,750
If she had reason to, I'm sure
she'd even send me away.

349
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,333
Here, this is for you.
You've earned it.

350
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,208
A gift for me?

351
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,625
Identification?

352
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,000
I had it specially created.

353
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,833
The Official Messenger for the
Second Prince of Clarines.

354
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,500
That'll be your new title.

355
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,583
You sure about this?

356
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,666
Should getting a formal
title be this easy?

357
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,083
There was nothing
easy about it!

358
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,083
I feel like I'm starting
to understand.

359
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,666
I'm learning what matters
most to me in life.

360
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,666
And I want to try to
be a better prince.

361
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,666
[OBI]
Huh?

362
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,250
[ZEN]
I believe I can do it now.

363
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,791
I have faith in myself.

364
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,583
And in my friends.
Even in you, Obi.

365
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,166
[OBI] Master, I never noticed
how beautiful your eyes are.

366
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,416
[ZEN growls] I'm trying
to be serious here!

367
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,916
[OBI]
Hey, so why did you appoint me

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,125
your official messenger,

369
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,083
rather than make me
Shirayuki's guardian?

370
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,166
Well, I'm happy you asked.

371
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
Because no one else
needs to know you're more

372
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,708
than just my messenger.

373
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,958
It's sort of a decoy.

374
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,125
In other words, I'm Shirayuki's
first line of defense.

375
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,250
So if anything should
happen to her,

376
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,125
you'll be the first to know.

377
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,333
Right. And if people think
you're only working for me,

378
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,291
they won't get nosy.
Nobody will be the wiser.

379
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,833
[OBI]
Understood.

380
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,208
I swear. I'm going to be better,

381
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,750
and I will protect those that
are most important to me.

382
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,833
I think Zen might be
out for the night.

383
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,583
He's probably still
talkin' to Obi.

384
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,708
The stars are so
beautiful right now.

385
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,875
[KIKI] Uh. Yeah, but then
again, they always are.

386
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,416
[MITSUHIDE]
True.

387
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,541
How do you feel
about coming with me

388
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,875
to go get some exercise?

389
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,208
[KIKI]
I'd love to.

390
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,125
[ZEN] Time marches on.
And days turn into months.

391
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,708
Although this world
is ever-changing,

392
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,333
there are a few things I can
count on to never waver.

393
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,500
[ZEN]
There are people that I trust.

394
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,541
Who will stay
faithfully by my side.

395
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,791
And I stay by theirs.

396
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,083
[ZEN] As we continue
traveling together

397
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,791
on this path we've chosen.

398
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,916
[KIHAL]
Those higher classes

399
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,333
do like to look down
on folks like us.

400
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's the most beautiful bird

401
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,375
I've ever laid eyes on!

402
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,500
[IZANA]
When the time comes,

403
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,375
how will he protect
what's important?

404
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,666
[SHIRAYUKI] I still have to try
to do the right thing here!

405
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,458
No matter what it might cost me!
