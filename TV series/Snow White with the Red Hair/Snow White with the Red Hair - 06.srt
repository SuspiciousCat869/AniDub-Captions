1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,500
[GARAK] That must've
been difficult for you.

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
It wasn't too bad.

3
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,958
Luckily, Prince Zen and
the soldiers at Fort Laxdo

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,208
were very helpful.

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,666
[GARAK] Well, you should
be proud of your work.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,458
[RYU]
Yeah, really good job there.

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,875
[GARAK] You can take
the rest of the day off.

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,166
I shouldn't, everyone
else is still working.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,000
[RYU]
Getting rest is important, too.

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,750
Uh. As you wish.

11
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,833
All right. I guess
I'll be going, then.

12
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,166
See you later!

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,083
[door closes]

14
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,500
Shirayuki's really
pushing herself hard.

15
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,833
[RYU]
Yes, she is.

16
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,250
[GARAK] Speaking of which,
I wonder if she knows?

17
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,708
About what?

18
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,583
[GARAK]
About Prince Izana.

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Another new encounter.

20
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,458
On this road I'm traveling.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
This is the destiny I've chosen.

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,916
And where my dreams
become reality.

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Today, I'll accompany Ryu

24
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,625
to the herb garden,

25
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,583
and I'll organize the medical
records right after that.

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,125
Oh, Zen!

27
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:53,625
Hi, Shirayuki. How are you...
Uh, something is different.

28
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,916
"Clarines Kingdom,
Wistal Castle,

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,583
Apprentice Court Herbalist."

30
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,041
You got your official ID!

31
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,750
[SHIRAYUKI] They finished making
it while we were at Fort Laxdo.

32
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,291
And my uniform.

33
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,583
[ZEN]
So I assume that you have

34
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,375
new accommodations
in the castle.

35
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,833
I have even more studying
and work to do, now.

37
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,166
I'll have a much easier
time doing it from here.

38
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,458
That's fair. I'll be
swamped too,

39
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,250
dealing with the aftermath
of the incident at the fort.

40
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,458
It may be quite a while

41
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,750
before we're able to
see each other again.

42
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,666
Uh! Oh, I see.

43
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,625
Shirayuki?

44
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,541
Okay, gotta go!

45
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,708
Just a minute! Doesn't that
bother you even a little bit?

46
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,166
Uh! Well, are you bothered?
Should I be?

47
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,250
Uh! Oh, fine, never mind.

48
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:48,208
[ZEN] All right, then.
Have fun, I'll see you!

49
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,000
We're waiting for
the investigation report

50
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,708
from the army for this.

51
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,958
Has the new fort communication
system been implemented?

52
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,333
[KIKI]
Yes, it has.

53
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,958
Excellent. Now, then.
Shall we go to the archives?

54
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,541
[MITSUHIDE] The soldiers
at the fort will need

55
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,125
to be on extra high alert now.

56
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,500
[KIKI]
Probably.

57
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,208
[ZEN] But, I know they
wanna do their best for me.

58
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,416
We just need to reinforce
the system to empower them.

59
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,916
[MITSUHIDE]
What's the matter?

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,416
[KIKI] The palace guard
stations... they've changed.

61
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,791
[MITSUHIDE] You're right. And
there are more of them, too.

62
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,833
[KIKI]
I wasn't notified of this.

63
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,958
[MITSUHIDE] Zen, hey, wait,
where are you going?

64
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,875
[OBI yawns]

65
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,375
Everyone else is busy,

66
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,750
which means all I
get to be is bored.

67
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm restricted to
such a small area,

68
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,708
and I don't even have
weapons to clean or repair.

69
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,708
[SOLDIER A]
Prince Zen,

70
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,291
we cannot allow you
to proceed any further.

71
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,416
And why not?

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,458
I cannot answer that, sir.

73
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,625
[ZEN]
Very well, then. Thank you.

74
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,500
Kiki, Mitsuhide, make
yourselves presentable.

75
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,833
[KIKI, MITSUHIDE grunt]

76
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,416
[ZEN] Of course, I can't
speak until I'm spoken to.

77
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,625
Hey Obi, come here!
You have ten seconds.

78
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,458
[OBI] Wow. Why give
me so much time?

79
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,166
Listen, I need you to--

80
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,916
You have a scratch.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,708
Oh, you mean this little thing?
It's a funny story, actually--

82
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,708
Please pardon me,
Your Highness.

83
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,500
What do you want?

84
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,750
[SERVANT A] I was told to
deliver this to you post haste.

85
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,416
[ZEN] Sorry, Obi. I'll have
to hear your story later.

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,750
For the moment, keep
your face uncovered.

87
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,833
Sure.

88
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,583
And wait for me in
this room. Got it?

89
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,958
[OBI]
Mm. Okay.

90
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,375
[SERVANT A]
Excuse me.

91
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,166
Shirayuki, the prince has
requested your presence.

92
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,791
Uh, all right. I'm coming.

93
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,500
[SERVANT 6A] Please go to the
Room of Chanting Flowers.

94
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,916
I'm sorry? To the
Room of what, now?

95
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,750
[ZEN]
I beg your pardon.

96
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,750
[door opens]

97
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,041

98
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,125

99
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,250
Well hello, Little Brother.

100
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,083
It's been a long time,
Lord Brother.

101
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,125
I see you've brought
Mitsuhide and Kiki.

102
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,541
Always the faithful little
pair of guard dogs.

103
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,458
Indeed, I have.

104
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,875
Why didn't you inform
me you were returning?

105
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,791
I was just wondering when
your keen eye would notice me.

106
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,458
I wanted to see how
much attention

107
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,625
you actually pay to what
goes on in our castle.

108
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,875
[SERVANT A]
Please wait in here.

109
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,500
And refrain from
making any noise.

110
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Okay?

111
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,541
[SHIRAYUKI] What is this?
What's going on?

112
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,375
[IZANA] I heard you traveled
all the way to Laxdo, Zen.

113
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,041
[ZEN]
Yes.

114
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen?

115
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,666
[IZANA]
I saw the report, too.

116
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,916
It said every soldier
at the fort fell ill

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,916
because of some bandits.
They couldn't even move.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,708
It must've been
extremely traumatic.

119
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
He's speaking so coldly to him.

120
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,291
Only someone with a
higher social status

121
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,416
would take such a tone.

122
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,833
It has to be the First
Prince of Clarines!

123
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,416
If what I've been
told is accurate,

124
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,625
you were only there with a court
herbalist and another attendant.

125
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,875
Why didn't you bring
this new servant here?

126
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,083
[ZEN] Because he is new
and I did not need him.

127
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,958
He's the one with the
wee scratch on his cheek.

128
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:58,000
I thought he was an outlaw, but
it seems he's in your employ.

129
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,166
Now, I didn't see a record

130
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,666
of any guards at the fort
receiving due punishment.

131
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,541
[ZEN]
I did not punish them.

132
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,833
Why not?

133
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,125
They patrol and protect
the surrounding lands.

134
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,166
It's an important duty.

135
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,708
The siege required
their assistance

136
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,208
and pulled them away from
this service for too long.

137
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,916
I felt it was time to return
them to their assigned post.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh, I see.

139
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,625
Then why don't we remove Laxdo
from your weak jurisdiction for,

140
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,125
let's say, six months?

141
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,166
[ZEN gasps]

142
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,833
[IZANA] Even if it was
the bandits' doing,

143
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,750
there were flaws in
the fort's system.

144
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,625
If you do not see fit to
rebuke the soldiers,

145
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,083
then you will receive
their punishment.

146
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,625
[MITSUHIDE] Which will shame
the soldiers far more

147
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,208
than the guilt they
already feel.

148
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,958
[KIKI] Zen can't be
taking this very well.

149
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,083
[IZANA] Someone with
such a soft underbelly

150
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,875
would naturally refuse to
be hard on anyone else.

151
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,500
That wouldn't be fair.

152
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,583
[ZEN]
I understand.

153
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,041

--[KIKI gasps]
--Shirayuki?

157
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,083
[IZANA] Zen, you and your two
toadies are dismissed, now.

158
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,541
Don't you have work to do?

159
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,708
What are you up to?

160
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,000
Zen...

161
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,916
[ZEN]
Fine, we're leaving.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,125
See you later, Shirayuki.

163
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,125
Don't worry. I'll come find you.

164
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,333
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]
Zen?

165
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:48,958
We'll talk soon, Lord Brother.
Mitsuhide, Kiki. Let's go.

166
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,083
[IZANA]
Hmph.

167
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,208
[SHIRAYUKI] So, you're, um...
You're Prince Zen's big brother.

168
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,541
Is that right?

169
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,000
[IZANA] What an adorable
way to address me.

170
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,291
Did you call me up here
because of the incident

171
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,333
at Laxdo you mentioned earlier?

172
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,208
[IZANA]
Hardly.

173
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,250
Uh?

174
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,375
Forgive me, then, because I
don't know why you sent for me.

175
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,875
You and Zen have a rather
special relationship.

176
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,625
I clearly see it.

177
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:22,125
It's odd for a royal to have
a commoner for a friend.

178
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:26,000
This would be interesting to
anyone who might hear about it.

179
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,458
I certainly thought it was.

180
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,541
There must be something
Zen finds alluring

181
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,208
and indispensable
about you, am I right?

182
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,916
I don't know. I can't judge
if people see me in that way.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,541
The only thing I can
do is be myself.

184
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,583
Fair enough.

185
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,208
Sorry to keep you, dear.

186
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,666
You're free to go.

187
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,125
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,250
[IZANA] Now, if you're not
feigning all that humility.

189
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,833
One must then assume
Zen negligently invited

190
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,208
a foreign girl with rather
strange hair into our castle...

191
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,166
Which would make him an
awfully incompetent prince.

192
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,916
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

193
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,625
What is it?

194
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,166
[MITSUHIDE] I dunno.
Can't help wondering.

195
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,291
What would your brother
want with Shirayuki?

196
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,208
[IZANA]
Did you hear that?

197
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,000
She referred to me as
'Zen's big brother'.

198
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,750
I found that terribly
amusing, truth to tell.

199
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:44,333
[IZANA] Now. Let's settle
this matter, shall we?

200
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,458
Ah. Can we go home?

201
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,291
[SASAKI] Why would you say
that? We've only just arrived.

202
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,458
Dummy, I'm saying it
because we're here at all!

203
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,333
Prince Izana made a concerted
effort to summon you today

204
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,541
for the purpose of
deepening your friendship.

205
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,583
Additionally, it will
fortify the accords

206
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,583
between your kingdoms.

207
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,791
Oh, I know!

208
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,208
But why invite me now,
after all this time?

209
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,916
[stomach growls]

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,791
[SASAKI] And now you're
pretending to be sick?

211
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,500
No, I'm not!

212
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,000
[whimpering]

213
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,958
[ZEN] Greetings, Prince
Raj, we welcome you.

214
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,083
I am the Second Prince
of Clarines, Zen Wisteria.

215
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,916
It is an honor and a pleasure.

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,416
Please pardon me.
Greetings to you.

217
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,041
I am Raj Schenazade of Tanbarun.

218
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,583
And I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

219
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,916
Thank you very much.

220
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,791
[MITSUHIDE] I find it very
curious that Prince Izana

221
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,458
would invite Prince Raj here.

222
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,583
Oh come on, who wouldn't
want to meet a moronic

223
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,250
and selfish buffoon
who tried to force

224
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,791
a town girl to be his concubine

225
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,250
and then sent her poisoned
apples when she ran away?

226
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,583
[laughs] Sarcasm
suits you, Kiki.

227
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,916
But it was after he summoned
Shirayuki. Suspicious.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,916
Yeah. Zen thinks there's a
reason behind it, as well.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,916
Hm? What in the world
is that man up to?

230
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm Prince Izana Wisteria.

231
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,833
Welcome to our humble
abode, Prince Raj.

232
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,958
Since we have finally
met face to face,

233
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,416
we should dispense with
further formalities.

234
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,541
Come, let's away to the garden.

235
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,125
See anything good?

236
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,958
[SHIRAYUKI yelps]

237
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,916
What are you doing up here, Obi?

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,041
[OBI] I got outa guard duty.
Thought I'd wander around.

239
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,291
The master and his servants

240
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,041
have really been actin'
strange lately.

241
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,875
Oh, yeah. You're originally
from Tanbarun, right?

242
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,875
Did something happen
between you and Prince Raj?

243
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,375
So I have a wicked idea.

244
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,291
It's actually the reason that
I came up here to get you!

245
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,333
Huh?

246
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,875
[OBI]
C'mon, let's go spy on 'em!

247
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?! Wait--

248
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,041
This makes me uncomfortable.

249
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,375
Do you want a berry?

250
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-mm.

251
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,541
Oh, good, we can hear them.

252
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,791
[HARUKA]
Prince Zen,

253
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,500
I hear you have a new
attendant in your court.

254
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,458
[ZEN] Yes, Lord Haruka.
Did my brother tell you that?

255
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,958
[HARUKA]
Indeed.

256
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,333
He is very nimble and skilled.
Both are valuable assets.

257
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,666
As long as he is prepared to
do battle when the time comes.

258
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,541
You must have a worthy adjutant.

259
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,750
Someone oblivious to his
surroundings will not suffice.

260
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,166
Zen!

261
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,666
[ZEN]
Izana.

262
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,166
[IZANA] I was wondering what
you might have discussed

263
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,208
during the welcome
reception at the gate.

264
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,333
We merely exchanged greetings.

265
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,250
[ZEN] This is true.
We've only just met.

266
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,041
Incidentally, Raj, I heard
that you recently fell

267
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,666
for a beautiful,
red-haired girl--

268
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,166
[choking]

269
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,666
This damsel of yours
is actually here.

270
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,875
She's in the castle as we speak.

271
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,708
You're kidding me. She is?

272
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,916
I mean. Who, again?

273
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,750
I think you know her name.

274
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,500
It was Shirayuki, wasn't it?

275
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,333
I don't like where
this is going.

276
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,916
I heard that the girl left you,

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
but perhaps you
still care for her.

278
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,625
If so, I'd be delighted
to invite her to join us.

279
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,208
[ZEN]
Lord Brother,

280
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,000
you are reading far
too deeply into this.

281
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,583
[IZANA] Am I? It seems
crystal clear to me.

282
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,083
Besides, the girl might want

283
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,500
to return to her home
country someday, you know.

284
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,166
That's quite enough!

285
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,291
My, my. This conversation is
certainly going downhill fast.

286
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,041
Uh? Still with me?

287
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh, sorry.

288
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,000
M-My break's over.
I have to get back.

289
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
What were they trying to say?

290
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,250
Do they want me
to leave Clarines?

291
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,666
Maybe they think I'm
no longer useful.

292
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,583
[RAJ]
Uh...

293
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,625

Speak, Raj.

[nervous chuckling]

296
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,500
Thank you kindly for
the offer, Prince Izana,

297
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,375
but I must politely decline.

298
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,958
Shirayuki definitely didn't
leave because of me.

299
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,208
That's a silly rumor.

300
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,125
She wanted to live
in another country,

301
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
and I wholeheartedly
gifted her my blessing

302
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,916
and support in so doing.

303
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No affection to speak of!

304
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,833
Why are you so
hesitant to see her?

Uh...

your deceptive actions

to be a matter of public record,

309
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,125
you must swear you'll stay
away from her. Forever.

310
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,333
Don't you even dare to
say her name out loud.

Well, this is what I have heard.

315
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,000
Zen considers Shirayuki
to be his fiancée,

316
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,333
and he says they will
soon be married!

317
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,583
[HARUKA gasping]

318
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,708
[ZEN]
Let's have a chat.

319
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,750
[RAJ]
Uh! Uh. Ow, that's my arm.

320
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,125
Is this a statement
we should believe?

321
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,708
I believe I'm going to vomit.

322
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,916
[RAJ groans]

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,458
Care to explain yourself,
Prince Moron?

324
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,958
[RAJ]
Hey, come on!

325
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,083
I had no choice with the way
the conversation was going!

326
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,666
[ZEN]
Yes, you did!

327
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,916
[RAJ] All right, I might have
exaggerated things a little bit

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,708
for effect, but you know
the core of it is the truth!

329
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,958
How so?

330
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,625
[RAJ] You and Shirayuki
are obviously lovers.

331
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,458
Wait a minute. Are you telling
me that you're not?!

332
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,666
Keep your voice down.

333
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,083
[RAJ]
Big problem!

334
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,291
[ZEN]
And why do you care?

335
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,625
[RAJ]
Because if that's really true,

336
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,041
then there'll be no
way to guarantee

337
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,166
that she won't
eventually leave you!

338
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,166
Remember, she knows I'm the
one who poisoned those apples!

339
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,375
I need to be able to keep
a close eye on her.

340
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,125
If you don't want
Shirayuki, that's fine.

341
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,250
I can assure you,

342
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,916
I will valiantly attempt
to make her happy.

343
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,458
What?

344
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,708
[RAJ]
It's apparent that this is

345
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,750
what Prince Izana
would prefer as well.

346
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,333
Of course, she would be treated

347
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,583
with nothing but
courtesy in my castle--

348
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,291
Rejected.

349
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,333
[RAJ]
He-heh.

350
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,916
[RAJ] But wait! You haven't
heard the rest of it.

351
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
[ZEN]
For your information,

352
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,666
Shirayuki is not
currently in this castle

353
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,833
to hide what happened
between you that day.

354
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,708
[gasps]

355
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,750
[ZEN]
You're right.

356
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,458
I cannot possibly guarantee

357
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,833
that Shirayuki will stay
with me in the future.

358
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:29,375
But to clarify, I remain hopeful
in the absence of a promise.

359
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,541
We always want what
we don't have.

360
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,000
So we keep striving for it.

361
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,166
[HARUKA] Hm? Ah, Prince Zen.
Can you explain this nonsense?

362
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,875
A simple misunderstanding.

363
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,708
Raj was jumping to
silly conclusions.

364
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,625
The truth is,

365
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:56,500
I do not consider Shirayuki my
fiancée, nor have I proposed.

366
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:10,083
[bell tolls]

367
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm going to head out now.

368
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,041
[RYU]
Good work today.

369
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
I guess that's it. Raj is here.

370
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,958
How long is he going to stay?

371
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,500
And what'll I do if I have to
go with him when he leaves?

372
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
I don't want to go.

373
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,875
[gasps]

374
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

375
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm so confused.

376
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm at a loss.

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,750
I can't say if I would benefit

378
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,750
or harm him in the
future by staying.

379
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,583
And that makes me wonder
why I'm here now.

380
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,208
Which would make him an
awfully incompetent prince.

381
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's just like before.

382
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:23,375
I had no answer, then,
and I don't have one now.

383
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,875
[gasps]

384
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,250
[ZEN]
Shirayuki...

385
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,916
[ZEN] What is the place you're
planning on going by yourself?

386
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,416
[SHIRAYUKI] The reason I'm
staying in this country.

387
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,708
I want to know it.

388
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,875
See how the rest of
you live in Clarines.

389
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,583
Find out where I belong.

390
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,625
That's the place
where I'm going.

391
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,916
The place where I'll be at home.

392
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,833
Well, when you're there.

393
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,500
I hope I'll still be able
to see you anyway.

394
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,916
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

395
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:20,000
[SHIRAYUKI panting]

396
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

397
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,125
[ZEN]
Shirayuki, what happened?

398
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,291
[IZANA] So tell me, princess.
Have you come to dislike it?

399
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,541
[ZEN] He was the firstborn,
and as such, a priority.

400
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,791
[KIKI] Our little prince
is starting to grow up.

401
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:17,041
[ZEN] And remember,
I'm always on your side.
