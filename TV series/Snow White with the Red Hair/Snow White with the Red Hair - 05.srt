1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
It must be cold

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,166
because we're so close
to the mountains.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,125
[KIKI] Yes, this place is a
far cry from sunny Clarines.

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,208
[MITSUHIDE] I wish we
could take you all the way.

5
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,000
We do feel guilty about that,

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,125
but we need to get
to Laxdo quickly.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,250
There's no reason
to feel guilty.

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,833
I'm just happy you're
taking me as far as you can.

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,458
I can't believe they sent
you all the way to Laxdo.

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,041
Seems like being a court
herbalist is hard work.

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,833
I'm grateful for it, though.

12
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,875
Plus, I like that I get to
spend so much time outside.

13
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,625
By the way, we told Lord Haruka

14
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,208
that you'd been granted a
position inside the castle.

15
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,083
He said "congratulations",
right?

16
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,125
[MITSUHIDE] Yeah, but the
sarcasm was palpable.

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,333
[KIKI]
He's interesting.

18
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,625
He can't hide what
he's thinking,

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,041
so it's funny when he tries.

20
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Yeah, that's true.

21
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,916
Zen. Why the big hurry?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,875
Is there something wrong?

23
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,250
Well, it is a routine
fort inspection.

24
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,500
But we're a little worried

25
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,791
since we haven't heard
from them in a while.

26
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,250
I suppose this is where
we all part for now!

27
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,208
Are you sure you'll be
all right in this cold?

28
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yeah!

29
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,291
[ZEN]
See you soon.

30
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,958
[horse whinnies]

31
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,250
[ZEN] We can learn so
much from the outside.

32
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,291
Wait!

33
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,250
Take care of yourself!

34
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,625
[ZEN] Experiencing this
country in a new way.

35
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,708
Encounters with people
that make this land home.

36
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,291
Discovering feelings
we never knew existed.

37
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,250
It's strange that no one
seems to be on watch.

38
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,583
Hey! Is anyone there?

39
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,125
We're from the
royal guard. Hello?

40
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,916
Be right there!

41
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,750
[panting, yelps]

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,166
[MITSUHIDE]
Whoa, easy there.

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,375
[SHUKA gasps]
You're all here.

44
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,750
Your Highness came, too?

45
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,875
We haven't been getting
routine reports.

46
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,666
I grew concerned.

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,500
You have to leave!

48
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,208
[OBI]
Master!

49
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,000
[ZEN, MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,666
[SHUKA yelps]

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,208
It looks like everyone
inside the fort is asleep.

52
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,125
Asleep?

53
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,500
Um, I've never seen you before.

54
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,625
I'm Obi, the prince's attendant!

55
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,791
Not quite. Your trial
period isn't over.

56
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,541
Come, on. How much longer

57
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,125
am I gonna have to keep
proving my loyalty to you?

58
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
[ZEN] For as long as
it takes. I'm going in.

59
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,625
[gasps] Wait! You can't!

60
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,125
The entire place
has been possessed

61
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,250
by some kind of evil spirit!

62
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,833
Evil spirit?

63
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,125
[SHUKA] It started
about three weeks ago.

64
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,125
One by one all the men
began feeling strange.

65
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,458
They said their limbs
felt weak and heavy

66
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,458
and that their
vision was blurry.

67
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,250
Everyone started getting
dizzy and losing their balance.

68
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,000
We called a doctor to help, but
he ended up falling sick, too.

69
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,666
We couldn't
pinpoint a cause,

70
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,208
so it's gotta be the work
of some evil spirit.

71
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,458
Are you ill?

72
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,583
I feel better than anyone
else around here.

73
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
But still,

74
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,958
I was in no shape to venture
out in search of more help.

75
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,375
[ZEN] I'd like to go in
and take a look around.

76
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,166
[OBI gasps]

77
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,208
No, you can't!

78
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,625
If it's contagious,
you'll get sick!

79
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,958
I've been exposed already,
but... I'll be careful.

80
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,208
Get some rest, you've earned it.
We'll take over from here.

81
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,208
[whimpers] Yes, sir.

82
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,291
Zen. You should try to
get back out by sunset.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,333
[ZEN]
Right.

84
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,333
Mitsuhide, don't let
anyone else in.

85
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to keep
contact to a minimum.

86
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:54,750
Of course, sir.

87
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,166
[OBI]
Please, Master,

88
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,791
do you really think going
in there is the best idea?

89
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,458
There's just too much at risk!

90
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916
I'm willing to take that
chance at this point.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,916
These soldiers need us
to find a solution.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,708
We can't stop him?
This is crazy!

93
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,875
He'd do anything
for his soldiers.

94
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,333
Hold on a second.

95
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,333
Why aren't you advising him?
That's your job, isn't it?

96
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,208
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes. That is my job.

97
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,000
[OBI]
Hm...

98
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,625
[ZEN] Nothing in here seems
out of the ordinary to me.

99
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,958
[OBI] What if the illness really
is the work of some evil spirit?

100
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,833
You believe in
that kind of thing?

101
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,750
I'd rather fight ghosts
than a disease.

102
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,958
[OBI]
Uh...

103
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,916
[KIKI]
This must be the armory.

104
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,458
I don't see why it would
be affec... ted...

105
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,541
Oh.

106
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,041
You mean it was empty?

107
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,708
[OBI] Yes, and I'm
pretty sure that boy

108
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,333
didn't know anything about it.

109
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,791
There were claw marks, too.

110
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,250
Someone used that illness as
a chance to rob the place.

111
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,666
Shall we shift our focus
to hunting bandits?

112
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,166
That's my specialty, you know.

113
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,375
[ZEN]
Put those away. Right now...

114
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,375
A specialty?

115
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,125
What if we brought Shirayuki?

116
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,375
She could have some insight

117
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,000
about what's causing the
soldiers to get sick.

118
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,500
Not to mention healing them.

119
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,666
Go get her.

120
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Right!

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
[KIKI] I hope he gets back
with her before night fall.

122
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,791
Hey, uh, Miss Kiki?

123
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,041
Is Mitsuhide afraid
of stating his opinion

124
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,625
around the prince
for some reason?

125
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,208
I've noticed that you
speak your mind

126
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,833
when you think it's important,

127
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,708
but Mitsuhide seems
go easy on him.

128
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,458
Huh. I wonder.

129
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,791
They're back.

130
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,375
[OBI]
Hm?

131
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,666
[SHIRAYUKI] Did you follow
the doctor's orders exactly?

132
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,583
[SHUKA]
Yes, as much as we could.

133
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,291
But there aren't enough
plants this time of year

134
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,375
to get everyone the
treatment they need.

135
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,208
[ZEN]
Wait, what do you mean?

136
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,333
Cold weather affects potency.

137
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,666
It weakens most herbs,

138
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,708
so you have to use more
to make them work.

139
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,208
Huh.

140
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,291
[SHIRAYUKI] There.
Anything else you remember?

141
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,833
No.

142
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,041
I was usually on watch outside,
so that's all I really know.

143
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,333
I hate that I can't
be more help.

144
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,583
Oh, no, please
don't feel bad!

145
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,791
I won't rest until
these men are well!

146
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,916
I'm Shuka. Just let me
know what I can do.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,875
You've done so
much already.

148
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,875
Right now, you need
to take it easy.

149
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,333
[SHUKA sighs]
Sure.

150
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,458
I think he's worse than
he was when we got here.

151
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,500
Zen, you have to get
some fresh air.

152
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,750
I'm worried about you.

153
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,083
I'll be all right.

154
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,750
Did you hear a word
that I just said?!

155
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,083
[ZEN] I don't like to
be outside in the cold!

156
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,625
Quit making excuses!

157
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:46,791
I can't leave you alone after
bringing you into this mess!

158
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,041
If you could help me
now, I'd let you stay.

159
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,416
You must know I want
you here with me.

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,250
But you can't get sick!

161
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,416
You should go.

162
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,583
I'll do everything I can
to help these men.

163
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,166
I won't get sick.

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,875
It's fine. I'll stay.

165
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:02,708
[MITSUHIDE]
Zen.

166
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,750
Uh?

167
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,750
You told Kiki you'd
be out by sunset.

168
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,583
As prince, it's your
duty to stay healthy.

169
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh!

170
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,916
[ZEN] I was being
selfish. Forgive me.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,791
Let me know if anything changes.

172
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,250
[footsteps]

173
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,541
[MITSUHIDE]
I was impressed back there.

174
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,458
You let logic win over
your stubbornness.

175
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,916
[ZEN]
You were right. Again.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,708
No need to sulk about it.

177
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,625
I understand that you're just
concerned about Shirayuki.

178
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,916
But you really should trust her.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,166
She knows what
she's doing in there.

180
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,583
[ZEN]
I know.

181
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,458
On an entirely
different note,

182
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,708
I didn't know you were so
sensitive to the cold!

183
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,416
Are you sure you should be
lying down in the snow?

184
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,666
[grunts]

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,583
[ZEN] Leave me alone!
That's not what I meant!

186
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,291
Did the prince actually
listen to him just now?

187
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,833
Why does that surprise you?

188
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,375
This is what usually happens.

189
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,583
He only ever listens
to Mitsuhide.

190
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,708
Which must be because
he keeps his mouth shut

191
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,500
unless it's important.

192
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,333
That way the Prince
will take him seriously.

193
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,000
[sighs]

194
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,500
[SHUKA] Hello, Shirayuki! I was
just coming to check on you.

195
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,583
Are you sure you've
gotten enough rest?

196
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,958
As much as I could under
the circumstances.

197
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,791
Good. I haven't determined
the source yet.

198
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,250
But it seems like the
symptoms are changing.

199
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,833
It isn't progressing the way
something like this should be.

200
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,666
What would cause that to happen?

201
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,750
[SHIRAYUKI] That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

202
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,125
In the meantime,

203
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,458
I finally found the medicine
the physician was using.

204
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,125
I plan to try mixing a few
other ingredients with it.

205
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
[gasps]

206
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:06,000
[SHUKA] Ah! Hey, Shirayuki!
Are you all right?

207
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, no. Why is it
coming on so quickly?

208
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
Maybe it varies per person?

209
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,250
I wouldn't know.

210
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,750
[gasps] Wait a second.

211
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,625
Shuka, you said you spent a
lot of time outside on watch,

212
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,333
didn't you?

213
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
Um. Yes.

214
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Then that means the source

215
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,541
must be something in this room.

216
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
The closer they are to the fire,

217
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,250
the worse their symptoms are.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,666
It's really cold
out here tonight.

219
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,666
[ZEN]
Indeed.

220
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,458
[door opens]

221
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,500
[SHIRAYUKI panting]

222
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,791
[ZEN]
Shirayuki? What's wrong?

223
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, don't worry.

224
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,875
I've just been too
close to the fire.

225
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,250
That's the source.
It's coming from the wood.

226
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,625
[ZEN, MITSUHIDE gasp]

227
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,416
[SHIRAYUKI] Burning it
releases harmful particles.

228
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,291
Particles that are
toxic to breathe.

229
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,458
They cause the same
symptoms, too.

230
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,833
[ZEN] Where did
the logs come from?

231
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
From a band of travelers.

232
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
That's what Shuka said.

233
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,333
They left them here at no cost

234
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,291
because they were
too heavy to carry.

235
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,500
[SHUKA]
Your Highness, I'm so sorry!

236
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,083
Don't worry. Are you
feeling better, at least?

237
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,000
[SHUKA] Uh. Yes! The medicine
Shirayuki gave me did wonders!

238
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,666
Thank goodness.

239
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,833
I'm so relieved that it worked.

240
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,500
[ZEN gasps]

241
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,708
You should go.

242
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,916
I'll do everything I
can to help these men.

Would you mind staying
here for a few more days?

I'd like for you to nurse
the soldiers back to health.

Yes!

they're so much better

254
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,875
after just a few days.

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,083
I knew Shirayuki
could handle this.

00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,208
Yeah.

[MITSUHIDE]
Zen.

258
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,875
[ZEN]
Bandits?

259
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,125
Apparently there's a group
of them in the area.

260
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,833
They're using Laxdo
as their base.

261
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,583
So did you find their hide out?

262
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,500
I need a bit more time, but I
have an idea where they are.

263
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,833
Why don't you three let
me find them for you?

264
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,041
It's like I told you before.
Hunting bandits is my specialty!

I swear he's part monkey.

266

He certainly smells like one.

[ZEN]
Kiki, Mitsuhide.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,166
I think the four of us

269
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
need to take care of
the bandits on our own.

270
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,000
We probably shouldn't
keep relying on Shirayuki

271
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,791
to save the day.

[grunting, sighs]

273
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,458
So, what are you making now?

274
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,875
[SHIRAYUKI] An infusion of
medicinal herbs, wanna try?

275
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,500
Medicine always
makes me throw up!

276
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,333
[laughs] It doesn't
taste bad at all.

277
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,500
No, thanks. Hey, Shirayuki?

278
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,083
I have something to tell you.

279
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

280
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,500
Thank you for always
being so nice to me.

281
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,916
And there's something else.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,458
Do you think Zen is
embarrassed of this outpost?

283
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,375
[SHIRAYUKI] What would
make you think that?

284
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,291
[SHUKA] I feel like we've
disappointed him.

285
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,708
I'm scared that he won't visit
us as often because of it.

286
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Does Zen come here a lot?

287
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,333
[SHUKA] Yes, and he spends
time with us on his visits.

288
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,541
He goes out on patrols, listens
to the old soldiers' stories.

289
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,791
He even talks to
apprentices like me

290
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,625
and actually seems to enjoy it.

291
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,083
We count the days till he comes.

292
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,250
I really hope he still wants
to see us after all this.

293
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,583
[SHIRAYUKI] I don't think you
should worry about it.

294
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,125
[SHUKA]
Uh?

295
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,083
Zen doesn't abandon people.
His visits mean that he cares.

296
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,750
You should know a little illness
would never change him.

297
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,833
He may even come more, now!

298
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right. Glad that's done!

299
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,666
Now, I just have to write
the report for my records,

300
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,625
check on the medicine,
prepare one more batch,

00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,291

00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,916
[SOLDIER B]
Please pardon us!

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,250
See that? They're looking
good, thanks to you.

318
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:54,291
If you can handle it,
I'll be back soon!

319
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,208
Right, then. I guess I
should start cooking lunch.

320
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,958
[groans]

321
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,833
So tired...
But I'll get rest soon.

322
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,041
[OBI]
Oh, it's Red.

323
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ouch!

324
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,375
That was graceful. I
wonder what's wrong.

325
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,791
I'd help, but the prince
said not to go near her

326
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,250
without his permission.

327
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

328
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,833
There goes my job.

329
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,791
Oh! Well, this is
quite a surprise.

330
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,125
What brings you here?

331
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,000
[OBI] I'm currently serving
as Zen's attendant.

332
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,791
Interesting.

333
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,375
I appreciate your help.

334
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,166
I hope that you're
not afraid of me.

335
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,541
[SHIRAYUKI] Why would I
be frightened of someone

336
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,500
who just saved me
from a nasty spill?

337
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,750
That's silly. Bye.

338
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,125
Wait a sec.

339
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,791
You don't seem like
you're feeling very well.

340
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Please don't say anything.

341
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,833
I should tell the prince,
but I won't.

342
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,833
Even though he's
my boss, not you.

343
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,833
Then I suppose I owe you one.

344
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,750
Really?

345
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,333
[OBI] Does this mean
she won't tell him

346
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,541
I'm the one who
shot the arrow?

347
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,958
It's a deal. But why do you
think you need to hide it?

348
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,750
[SOLDIERS laughing]

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,541
[OBI] The soldiers seem
to be doing better.

350
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

351
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,083
But they might start
feeling bad again

352
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,083
if they're worried about me.

353
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,583
Why do I want to follow her?

354
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,375
[ZEN] You didn't find
anything in the south?

355
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,333
No, but we still have
to survey the grounds

356
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,291
from the western tower.

357
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,625
[SOLDIER C]
Your Highness,

358
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,708
I've organized a patrol
party of able-bodied men.

359
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
We await your command.

360
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,541
[ZEN] And the soldiers
are well enough?

361
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,291
Yes, sir. We owe it to
Shirayuki, of course.

362
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,041
Your men are ready to
return to our posts.

363
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,375
We'll prove that we are
worthy of your confidence.

364
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,791
Good to hear.

365
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,333
Well, don't overdo it.

366
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,916
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,125
[SOLDIER D] Oh, Shuka, uh, was
there any medicine left over?

368
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,250
No. She only makes enough
for the men on each shift.

369
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,958
I think she's starting
the next batch now.

370
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,833
[ZEN, KIKI]
Uh.

371
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,958
[SOLDIER D]
Oh, all right.

372
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,541
Is everyone still
taking the medicine?

373
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,833
[SHUKA]
Yes, sir.

374
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,500
We're already back up
to three shifts per day.

375
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,750
Right.

376
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,500
And considering each one
is every eight hours...

377
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,583
I'm so blind.

378
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,416
Uh. That's 24 hours.

379
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,666
If she's always working,

380
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,916
then when does Shirayuki
get a chance to sleep?

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,375
Uh!

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,333
[knocking]

383
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,375
Uh?!

384
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen!

385
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,625
[ZEN]
Have a seat over here.

386
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...? Sure.

387
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,666
I want you to close your
eyes and count to 60.

388
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,208
Huh? Is this a joke?

389
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,375
No, it's not. Close your
eyes and don't open them.

390
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,833
But, what for?

391
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,750
Now!

392
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,041
One!

393
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,916
Ah! Eyes are closed.

394
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,500
[ZEN]
Two... Three...

395
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,000
Your face looks so pale.

396
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,666
Why didn't you say something?

397
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,500
[ZEN]
Mm?

398
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,458
[panting] Hi, Master.
I've got some good news.

[BANDIT A] Who woulda thought
they'd fall for the firewood?

402
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,750
[BANDIT B] Now, we gotta
find the right buyer.

403
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,500
We could make some good money!

404
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,291
[ZEN]
Thanks for your confession.

405
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,416
I'll consider that
when sentencing you.

406
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,916
[BANDIT J]
Who do you think you are?!

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,291
We are soldiers
representing the crown.

408
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,541
You've broken laws.

409
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,875
And unfortunately, we
can't just let that go.

410
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,875
[BANDITS laugh]

411
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,208
Let me get this straight.

412
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,833
We're supposed to believe
you four are soldiers?

413
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,916
[BANDIT D] They brought a
lady to the party for us.

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,333
What a thoughtful gift!

415
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,166
Silence. I will not allow
you to insult anyone here.

416
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,125
[BANDITS laugh]

417
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,500
Yeah, what are
you gonna do?!

418
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,000
[ZEN] You're asking the
wrong question, friend.

419
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,166
You should be asking why I'm
taking your theft personally.

420
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,500
Why am I so angry?

421
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,416
Ask me who we must be that
we have no fear of you.

422
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,458
Who I know that you've made
suffer. What am I going to do?

423
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,125
I'm going to be the kind of
person she can believe in.

424
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,333
The kind of person she would
never want to walk away from.

425
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,041
The hell are you
talking about?!

Don't worry about it.

Just needed to get
that off my chest.

You wouldn't understand anyway.

429
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,250
That's enough!

430
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,833
Too slow!

Sorry! I was listening to you.

If not a little intense.

[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, but it's fine.

you weren't feeling well.

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,291
I should've seen it. I wasn't
paying close enough attention.

[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,666
But next time, please,
say something to me.

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,625
We can always work
out a schedule for you

that accommodates
proper rest.

No one needs to handle this
kind of situation alone.

You can trust me, too.

Will you do that?

It's only fair.

Yes, of course I will.

on yourself, either.

You may be exhausted now,
but that changes nothing.

Everyone here was
saved thanks to you.

I don't believe I've
thanked you, yet.

I'm so grateful you came
to help. Sincerely.

That's how I feel about you.

You inspire me.

Discovering feelings
we never knew existed.

474
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,125
These moments are the
lights that never fade.

475
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,541
Greetings, Prince Izana.
Welcome back home.

476
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,458
[IZANA]
Well, hello. Little Brother.

477
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
This makes me uncomfortable.

478
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,125
[RAJ]
I can assure you,

479
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,125
I will valiantly attempt
to make her happy.

480
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,333
[SHIRAYUKI] The only thing
I can do is be myself.

481
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,250
[IZANA] Which would make him
an awfully incompetent prince.
