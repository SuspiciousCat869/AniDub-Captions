I'm sorry, did you think
I simply spawned

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
into existence?

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
I just realized

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
that I don't know where
elves come from at all!

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Most of us live
in a hidden village,

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
deep within the
branches of Yggdrasil.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
Apparently, our people
lived on the surface

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
until very recently.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
How recently do you mean?

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
A hundred thousand years ago.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] However, as younger
species began to prosper,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
the elves were unsure
of how to approach them

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
and decided to
sequester themselves.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Well that seems kind of extreme.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
Although, it is sort of
adorable to think of you

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
as a little kid!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
What's that giddy grin about?

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing, I'm just
wondering what you were like

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
when you were younger!

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
Regrettably, I don't have any
amusing childhood anecdotes

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
for you.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
Well, I do have one from
roughly a millennium ago.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
In the village of the elves,
there lived a child

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
with an endless thirst
for knowledge.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
As a boy, I was
desperate to absorb

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
any and all information I could,

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
spending most of my
days with my nose

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
buried deep in a book.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
Once, I tried to create a place
where I could read in peace.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
Chnarb sit. Edisni.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
Kun kub kam.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It didn't quite work.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
You!

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
Why is it always
something with you?

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
Breaking a branch
off the World Tree

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
is a most serious offense
with colossal ramifications,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
you know!

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I'm sorry.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have to
explain this to you,

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
but every branch of this
tree is a manifestation

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
of life itself, and we
must take care of it!

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
I'll do better next time.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[ELF LEADER] At this rate,
you'll strip Yggdrasil bare!

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
Then I'll just try
a different spell.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
[ELF LEADER]
No! Don't try anything!

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
I've told you many times now.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
Children are to stay
in the nursery

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
unless an adult is present.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
You'll have private quarters
when you're grown.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
Besides--

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it would
be much more fun

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
to live amongst your
friends instead?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
I'm better than him.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
[GIRL ELF B]
What a troublemaker.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
I like my own company.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
It's just-- there are
so many different things

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
I want to learn about
in this world,

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
which is why I need
a place of my own,

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
where I can read my books
all day without anybody

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
disturbing me.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
But if there's something
you'd like to learn,

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
you can just ask an adult!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
That's far better than
sealing yourself away!

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
You adults are the ones
who've always isolated

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
yourselves here inside
the World Tree, though.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
So how could you
possibly know anything

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
that isn't written
inside these books?

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
--No, thank you.
--You brat!

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
Very well, Dearia.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
If your hunger for knowledge
is really that unrelenting,

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
I suppose we can
entrust your care

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
to the great wise serpent.

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I'm too much of a handful,

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
so you've simply
decided to exile me?

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
It's more like, uh,
studying abroad!

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
Far away from here,
in the northernmost lands,

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
near the frozen Ergot Sea,

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
lives a being who
was old and wise

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
even before Yggdrasil grew.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
It's an extremely
dangerous place to live.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
But there will be much
for you to learn there.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] Welcome to the
far reaches of the north,

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
curious little traveler.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
I have been expecting you.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
My name is Jormungandr.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
And I'm Dearia.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.661 position:50% align:center
I've been told that you can
see for a thousand leagues,

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
and that you're a limitless
fountain of knowledge,

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
so please teach me
everything you can!

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
What is it you wish to know?

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
Those loincloths that are
always worn by goblins,

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
are they made of wool or hemp?

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] That's certainly
a specific question!

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.723 position:50% align:center
I haven't been this taken
aback in centuries!

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It doesn't say in my books.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] No one cared
enough to write it down.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Before I share any
wisdom with you,

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
you'll need a safe place to
build a fire and keep warm.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there are many
things you wish to learn,

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
but I believe there are
some very basic concepts

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:36.001 position:50% align:center
in this life that you must
come to comprehend first.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
You see, my young student,
everything that exists

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
in this world is interconnected.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
Obtaining a piece of
information is one thing,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
but true understanding
is another entirely.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, both you and
I have many years to live.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
So first, let us warm
you so that you do not

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
perish from the cold.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
And after that,
I will be happy to unravel

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
all the queries that
burn in your mind.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I look forward to it...

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
...Master.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.123 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] And so, I began
studying under the great

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
serpent's tutelage.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
I learned languages,
philosophy, religion,

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
history, biology,
geography, astronomy,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
medicine, and magic.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
The days I spent with my
Master were most fulfilling.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
However, there was
one slight issue.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.522 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Not again.

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] Whatever is
the matter, young one?

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
It would appear there's
been another earthquake.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
An earthquake?

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
Oh. I didn't sense it at all.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] That's because you're
the one who caused it.

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
[ELF LEADER] That's where
you're going to live?

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
This might be helpful.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The house the grown-ups
built for me was nice.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
For ten days.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
After that, my Master had the
golems put something together.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
[ICE GOLEM A]
All done.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It lasted two days.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
No matter how many
houses I build,

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
they'll just keep
getting crushed.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
In that case--

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Master!

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
From now on, please
resurrect me each morning!

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] You plan to
freeze to death every night?

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
Cold isn't the only thing that
threatens your life here.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
If a wandering berserker
tears you to pieces,

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
what then?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
If I am not able to
ensure your safety,

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
then I have no choice but to
send you back to Yggdrasil.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] No, wait! I'll rebuild
it stronger than ever, Master!

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
It won't be crushed
this time, I promise!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] I regret to admit
that construction is an area

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.387 position:50% align:center
where I am lacking in knowledge.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I just know that
between the two of us,

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to figure out
something that works!

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
I see!

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
Very well, if you're sure.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] Hmm.
I've heard that adding walls

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
makes a structure
more durable.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
We can divide up the interior.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
That makes it look like
a box of desserts.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't need quite
so many rooms

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
for just myself, anyway.

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
But we might as
well try it, right?

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Good!

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
I'll call the golems for help.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.213 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] It's been upgraded from
a studio to a one-bedroom.

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR gasps]
We've failed!

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
What if we tried using
some metal girders

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
to reinforce the exterior walls?

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Oh, good idea!

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] There! You can't get
much sturdier than that.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The cold causes metal
to stick and become brittle!

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
I have to say,
this is a fun puzzle.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
What a great
learning opportunity!

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
Ahem. So, this was a rather
challenging project to complete,

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
but after plenty
of trial and error,

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
I was able to procure
a strong metal alloy

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
that's resistant to cold!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
And it's finished!

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Master, please come look!

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
I built my brand-new house!

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Come here and see it!

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
With this done, I can finally
return to my studies!

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA gasping]

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Hmm? Did you call?

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Goodness, what have I done?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, my child!

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
I'm truly, deeply sorry!

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
Could I have been
responsible for those other

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
earthquakes as well?

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A] My, my, isn't this
a disappointing sight!

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
Even the materials we gave
you were no match for her.

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
Shoulda seen that
one coming, eh?

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
She never has been good at
watching out for her tail.

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
The Graiae sisters.

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A]
Don't look so glum, dearie boy.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
It couldn't be helped.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C] You're far too
small to live with such an

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
enormous creature!

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
Good thing you weren't inside,

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
or you'd have been crushed!

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A] I think you'd be
safer if you ran along home.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE laughing]

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] No. I'll stay here,
no matter what.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
Whatever for?

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
So you're back? That was fast.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
Oh? Finished with
your "studies"?

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
If I went back to
the World Tree,

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
I'd just get all kinds
of snide remarks

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
from the grown-ups.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A]
Some adults they are!

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
Bullying a child!

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
I'd run away too!

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Besides.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
If I figure out how
to build a structure

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
that can withstand Jormungandr,

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
then I'll make
boatloads of money!

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A] That's our
smart little entrepreneur.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
In it for the cash, huh?

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
Let us be your first investors!

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Huh?

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
even if it's risky,

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
I want to stay here so
I can be with you, Master.

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Oh, Dearia.

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry, dearie boy,

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
these old grannies'll
give you a hand.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
Feel free to take
anything you want!

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
Is this lumber going
to be strong enough?

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
That wood's what
we call silver willow.

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
Despite its lightness,
it's very sturdy.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
But it'll never hold up
against Jormungandr.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
What do you think, dearie boy?

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
Did you find your solution?

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
Yes! This'll work!

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
I'm finished!

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
I see!

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
You've found a place where
you're safe from earthquakes!

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
And I can't very well crush
it with my tail this way.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
That was smart thinking!

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
Of course it was.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
After all, I learned
from the very best!

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
That you did, young one.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
I certainly have a wonderful
apprentice, don't I?

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Just one thing.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Hmm?

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] What should I do
about using the bathroom?

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] Ah! Please don't
do what I think you're going to!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
And so, time passed.

00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:44.387 position:50% align:center
I spent a few centuries
as Dark Lord, in name only.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
And just when mankind
had forgotten

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord altogether...

00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
That was when he decided
to come calling.

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.623 position:50% align:center
If you dislike insects,
you should consider

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.834 position:50% align:center
changing your house's
interior lighting.

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
The UV radiation from
fluorescent lights

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.421 position:50% align:center
attracts bugs.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.340 position:50% align:center
So, switching them
for LED lightbulbs

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
should solve the problem.

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:47.177 position:50% align:center
Next time, "A Home
for a Black Dragon."
