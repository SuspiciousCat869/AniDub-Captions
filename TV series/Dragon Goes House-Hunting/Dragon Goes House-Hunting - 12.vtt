00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.093 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Once upon a time,
there lived a magnificent

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.054 position:50% align:center
and terrible dragon who
could harness hellfire

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
and burn a kingdom
to ashes in one night.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
This monster was called
the Flame Dragon Lord.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
Cloaked in the blood
of his enemies,

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
this dreadful villain
wreaked a path of death

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
and destruction,
the likes of which

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
this world had never seen.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.697 position:50% align:center
In an effort to bring
an end to the beast

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
and his apocalyptic
reign of terror,

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center
countless courageous
Heroes banded together

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.203 position:50% align:center
in battle.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
But alas, all were annihilated
without any shred of mercy.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
With his frightening
company of dark followers,

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center
the Flame Dragon
Lord would appear

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
seemingly at random, committing
reprehensible crimes,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
forcing thousands to live in
fear of the next encounter.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
One tragic day, in the
midst of this mayhem,

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
the Princess of Eos
vanished without a trace.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
The king rallied his soldiers
to search for her,

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
but just as they had left the
royal castle defenseless,

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
the Flame Dragon Lord
appeared behind its walls,

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
towering tall as a mountain.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.158 position:50% align:center
And at that moment, the
soldiers looked up in horror

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
to discover...

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
...he was holding
the princess hostage.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Flame Dragon Lord!

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
We have you surrounded!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
If you value your life, you will
surrender the castle at once,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
and release my daughter
to me unharmed!

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
If you do not respond,
we will take your silence

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
as a declaration of war!

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
You are a foul creature who
consorts with darkness!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
And our kingdom
shall never bow to you!

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yells]

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
[KING] You will rue the day
that you foolishly chose

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
to stand against
our noble forces!

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yells]

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] How the heck did I get
myself involved in this mess?

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] You see, when you
and Nell finally emerged

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
from the labyrinth,
and made your way

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
into the castle proper...

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
We're in the palace now!

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
You panicked and tried to run.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
This is bad!

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Quick, let's jump
out the window!

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
Halt! What is
your business here--

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
[HERO, LETTY]
Not you again!

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Then, you ran into the Heroes.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[HERO B]
Damn you, Flame Dragon Lord!

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
How dare you attack
the royal palace!

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm on my way out!

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
So they pursued you.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:02.909 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Easy, drummox!

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
I'm not a sack of potatoes!

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
[HERO B]
Give up, Flame Dragon Lord!

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
Did he say Flame Dragon Lord?

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Watch those claws!
You're hurting me!

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
[HERO B]
Unhand the princess at once!

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT D]
The princess?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia! Save me! Hurry!

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
With the help of my
great sword of justice,

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
I shall sm--

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelling]

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I took care
of the Heroes for you.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yells]

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
My King!

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
The Flame Dragon Lord
has taken over the palace,

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
and he's holding the
princess captive!

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I think that about covers it.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
My, he looks angry.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, I knew we
should've left her

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
in the back of that cart.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] And to make matters
worse, the king seems

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
to believe that you
kidnapped Nell.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we can fix that!

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she could just tell her
dad how it really happened,

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
and everything would be fine!

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you?

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that
you've forgotten.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
The way Father insulted me
that day was unforgivable!

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
Would you like a cup
of tea, Father?

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
I'd love one, thank you!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
And this, too!

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
You brute!

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
I didn't say you could
have a cupcake as well!

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Sweetheart, no!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
I refuse to speak to him until
he comes crawling back

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
to me for forgiveness!

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
All this for a stupid cupcake?

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
Hey, maybe we could use
your magic to get away!

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
--Afraid not.
--Huh?!

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
This castle is warded
against teleportation spells.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they'd be wide
open to potential intruders.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
A fat lot of good that did them!

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
Okay, what if we went
to the sewers

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
and teleported out from there?

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
And wander around
completely lost like we did

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
the first time?
I don't think so!

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
In that case, we play defense.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Welcome to--

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
[STUDIO AUDIENCE]
Building Basics with Dearia!

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
"Castle Defenses."

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
Traditionally, castles are
designed to protect

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
their inhabitants from
various outside hazards.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
And because Letty may
need this information

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
for his future endeavors,
it might behoove us

00:05:58.608 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
to try it out now.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
He sure is into this.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
Since when does he
have his own TV show?

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
Time for the first
order of business.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
[PIP squeaks]

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Huh? What the--

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
[PIP screams]

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
First, we seal
off the outer gates.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
Then, we take care
of the guards.

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
[PIP screams]

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
[PIP screams]

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Now we control all
the important access points.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
That was incredible
work, Piyovelt.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
You're such a smart boy!

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
This is messed up.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
All that remains now
is the drawbridge.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
Storm the gate!

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yells]

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] But they've likely
already crossed it,

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
so there's no use
worrying about that.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Huh?! Are you telling
me they're gonna come

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
barging in here any minute?

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
Did I not adequately explain
there's no reason

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
to be worried?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
The castle is completely
surrounded by a moat,

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
and it only has
one point of entry.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.848 position:50% align:center
This convenient security
feature significantly

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
restricts the flow of invaders
into the property's

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
interior walls.

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
On top of that, our three
layers of defense

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
will likely prove more
than sufficient.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
Now then, let's move onto
our counterattack plan.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Right!

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wait up, Nell!

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
What are you doing? Let me go!

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
You should probably
stay in the castle.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
I mean, since we're about
to go and pick a fight

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
with your dad.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
Don't you think I
understand that?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] Your Majesty!
The inner gates are sealed!

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Even so...

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
I can't abandon my friends
when they're in trouble.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
If I turned my back on you,
I could never forgive myself.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
Papa?

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
She said we were her friends,

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
and she wants to help us!

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. I'll help her too!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yells]

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
Now, the forces you
see down below--

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
they're the royal
army's vanguard.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Uh...

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Yes, we knew that.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
Look closely at that room.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
This is a popular defensive
layout known as a Lion's Den.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
Since the next gate
is to the side,

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
it's impossible for enemies
to attack in a straight line.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
This also leaves them
open to "focused fire"

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
from the surrounding walls.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we don't have
any bows and arrows, though.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
Breathe fire on them.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna burn my tongue.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
That's all right. I've called
for reinforcements.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
The gnomes!

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
We can pelt them
with these rocks

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
until they bleed to death.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
Take aim, and... attack!

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B]
They're throwing rocks!

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER C]
Is it the dragon? 

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.795 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
I don't know!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Suppression fire is a
rudimentary but effective

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
warfare tactic.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
There are various small
openings in the exterior.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER E]
Gah!

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] And winding passages
make it easy to attack

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
from multiple vantage points.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
You can also use corners
to ambush your foes.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
I don't care what your
thought bubble says!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna do that!

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
What news?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.448 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] My King! The enemy's
called in reinforcements,

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
so we can't proceed any further.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
And we don't have eyes
on the dragon itself.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
Fine, then I'll infiltrate the
castle via the secret passage.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
No, Your Majesty!

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
We don't know who else may
be lying in wait inside!

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Has anyone actually spotted him?

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Uh--

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Scary!

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER F] Am I crazy,
or was that a dragon?

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER G]
Was it?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER H] The Flame Dragon
Lord went that way!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS grunt]

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
Oops, I'm sorry!

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
--[SOLDIER G] Was that--?
--[SOLDIER I] It sure was!

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER J] I saw a red dragon
peek out of a doorway,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
but he ran away in fear.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
Why would he do that?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
He must be mocking us!

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
That cursed Flame Dragon
Lord will pay for this!

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
[LETTY sneezes]

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
Somebody must be
talking about me.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
Probably laughing at what
a tragic loser you are.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] If you recall, the plan
was for you to ambush them

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
at the trap door,
not to run away in fear

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
as soon as they
laid eyes on you.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
Well, knowing my dear father,

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
he's just about to
withdraw and regroup.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
That's our chance to escape!

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
Let's hold out for
a little bit longer.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yelling]

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
[yelling continues]

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
[LETTY, NELL]
They're still going?

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Stupid royal army!

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
Their loyalty is
downright exhausting!

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
And what's worse--

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
We've almost made it through!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
[ARMY yells]

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
They've breached all of our
defenses except the last gate!

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
And where did those
gnomes go, by the way?

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
As soon as they left, we lost
our defensive ground completely!

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
They clocked out at
five and went home.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you have
made them stay late?!

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
We treat our workers
with respect.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
However, this is a golden
opportunity to teach you both

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
a thing or two
about the portcullis.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Nothing fazes this guy.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
That's Dearia.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The portcullis can be
utilized for not only defensive,

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
but offensive
maneuvers, as well.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.851 position:50% align:center
Simply raise the
lattice grating.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
[LETTY, NELL]
Wait, why?

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Once the enemy enters...

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.356 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER L]
Now's our chance! Charge!

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yell]

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] ...move to the inside
grating and close it.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER L]
Oh, no! We can't get through!

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The enemy will
be trapped inside.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
Now, the final touch.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER L]
We're stuck in here!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
Curse you, Flame Dragon Lord!

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] These openings are
called "murder holes."

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
Just add boiling water.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
Why does it seem like you're
making instant ramen here?

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Rocks, arrows, and
hot oil, are also effective,

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
or you can install trapdoors
that open up to pitfalls.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yikes.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
They're using ladders
to climb up!

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Crap!

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
Ideally, we'd have archers
ready to shoot them down,

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
but I'm not sure what to do now.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Flame Dragon Lord!

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] Your Majesty,
it's too dangerous!

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
Return my daughter to me safely,

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
and I promise you
won't be harmed!

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
However, if there's a single
scratch upon her delicate skin,

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
I shall flay your hide and drape
it across the castle gates!

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
Mark my words, beast!

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
I don't need treasures!

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
There's nothing in this life
that I could ever value

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
more than my daughter!

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
Forget my belongings!

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
Just give her to me!

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Hey, Nell?
We'd better retreat inside now.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
Can you lead the way?

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
But Letty, if we do that,
they'll discover us--

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
Dearia! Help me with something.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
Search every room,
top to bottom!

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
Check the food stores,
the privies, and all!

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
[KING]
A-ha! Found you!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
[LETTY screams]

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Stop, Your Majesty!

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
--He'll burninate you!
--[KING] Halt, fiend!

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Your Majesty!

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
You'll pay dearly for
kidnapping my daughter!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
But I didn't!

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
The door won't open!

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty, we'll save you!

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
[PIP squeaks]

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Father?

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
How did you know I was in here?

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
And the soldiers
aren't with you?

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Nell!

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Look at me! Are you injured?

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
Um, no--

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Did that dragon mistreat you?

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
--[KING] No amnesia?
--[NELL] No, Father.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy you're safe.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me,
my sweet girl.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
--Three cakes and we're even.
--Yes, darling.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
That's a lot.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
--Extra whipped cream.
--Of course!

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:07.365 position:50% align:center
It seems everything
went as planned.

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
Thanks for casting
that spell on the door

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
so the soldiers can't get in.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
And you lured the king
into this room

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
by using yourself as a decoy.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
That was very brave of you.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
I figured it wouldn't be
too hard to get him

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
to chase me, since he
was so mad and all.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth,
I just really wanted Nell

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
to talk to her dad.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling they
were ready to make up.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
You know, the day
I got kicked out,

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
I felt like I had
been abandoned.

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
But seeing Nell and her father--

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
It kinda made me
wonder about my dad.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
Maybe he forced me
to leave home

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
because he knew it
would be good for me

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
in the end.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
Or maybe he did want
to kick me to the curb.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll never know.

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
How insightful.

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
If our journey together
has taught you that much

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
about life, well,
then that's fine with me.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yeah!

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
[KING]
The dragon!

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
Stay behind me, Nell!

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
--[LETTY yells]
--[NELL] Father, don't hurt him!

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
[KING] I'll make quick
work of you, fiend!

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Father, you don't understand!

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Unhand me!

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
I believe I understand now.
I'm sorry.

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center
It seems my daughter
has caused you gentlemen

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
nothing but trouble.
Please excuse her.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
Oh, not at all!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who should
be sorry for getting her

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
wrapped up in this whole mess!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER M]
It won't open!

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER N]
There must be a spell on it!

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER M]
Someone, call a mage!

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
You protected my
daughter this whole time,

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
yet I allowed myself
to believe rumors

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:44.921 position:50% align:center
about the Flame Dragon Lord.

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
--[NELL yelling]
--[LETTY laughing]

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
What are they saying
about me this time?

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad you let
me explain myself.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
The Heroes always
skip straight to the fight.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
Heroes are unique, aren't they?

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
All that I can say, is that
every type of creature

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
in this world,
human or otherwise,

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
has the potential for
both good and evil

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
among their ranks.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
By the way, were you
looking to live and work

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
in our dwarven-built
training facility?

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
After all of this ruckus,
I think I might end up

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
going somewhere else.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Then your quest continues?

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Uh...

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Ooh! Let me go!
I want to join you!

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
[KING] This "ruckus" is
your royal responsibility.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Drat. I'm in trouble.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
So, um, I was wondering
how I can get out of here.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
Since your soldiers kind
of want me dead.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
[MAGE A]
We cannot pass!

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Damned Flame Dragon Lord!

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
[KING]
I have just the thing.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
[KING] It's fairy dust.
Use it to fly away.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
[NELL] That's not fair, Father,
how dare you hide it from me

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
when you know how badly
I wanted to play with some!

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
We'll tie up the loose ends
and have the mess

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
cleaned up ourselves.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:57.660 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
So, how do I use it?

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
Here. It's very
simple, actually.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
I sincerely apologize
for all the trouble.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.
Honestly, I still can't believe

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
my daughter has been traveling
with the Demon Lord himself!

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
This may not make up for much,

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.679 position:50% align:center
but I've made a list
of all the maintenance

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
that needs to be
done to your home.

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
That's kind of you!

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
Move in a little closer, Letty.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
Close your eyes now, please.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
And this'll make it
so I can fly?

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Temporarily.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
It's a magical
placebo that'll work

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
if you believe
strongly enough!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean
it's all in my head?

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
[NELL] They say if you believe,
your soul will be saved!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
I think that's different--

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.199 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Don't open your eyes yet!

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
Farewell, Letty!

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
Right! We'll meet again!
I mean, I hope so.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!
I wanted to give you this.

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
Pretty!

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
[NELL] That's half of
a fairy stone, Letty.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
As long as you hold onto that,

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
you will always be shown
the way to where

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
the other half is.

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
I'll come and find you when
things calm down here.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50% align:center
Try not to die before then.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
Uh, could you please
not joke about that?

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
We should probably
be on our way, Letty.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay!

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is believe.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
[LETTY grunting]

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if I'm
even doing it right--

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
Wait. Wha--?

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm flying!

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
For the first time in
my life, I'm flying!

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
Thanks for everything, Nell!
And Your Majesty!

00:19:57.864 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
May your journey be safe.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
Well, then.
Let's take our leave, shall we?

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Remember to find a
place where you can land

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
before the magic
wears off, okay?

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
It was great traveling with you!

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Ah! Being up here in the sky
is such a great feeling!

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
Oh! I just remembered!

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
I thought this was
my first time flying,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
but I actually did
it once before!

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.518 position:50% align:center
Y'know what, Dearia?

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:32.894 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.605 position:50% align:center
This really is a fascinating
world that we live in!

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:37.357 position:50% align:center
--[laughs]
--[PIP squeaks]

00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:43.780 position:50% align:center
My, Varney!

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:45.448 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Huh?

00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:47.409 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] This really is a
fascinating world we live in,

00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:48.952 position:50% align:center
isn't it.

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.079 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] Gee, took you long
enough to figure that one out.

00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.414 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:57.293 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA laughs]

00:22:57.377 --> 00:22:58.503 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's the matter?

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.046 position:50% align:center
Was that a weird thing
to say or something?

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.589 position:50% align:center
No, not at all, Letty.

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:03.091 position:50% align:center
But it took you long enough.

00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:04.718 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Don't make fun of me!

00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:08.263 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] After barricading
himself and the princess

00:23:08.346 --> 00:23:11.307 position:50% align:center
inside the royal castle
and the grueling battle

00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:13.393 position:50% align:center
that followed,
the Flame Dragon Lord

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:16.771 position:50% align:center
vanished as suddenly
as he'd appeared.

00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:19.566 position:50% align:center
His heart stolen by
the princess's beauty,

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:22.444 position:50% align:center
he made a solemn vow
never to attack the city

00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:25.697 position:50% align:center
that his sweetheart
cherished so dearly.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.200 position:50% align:center
And so, according to
one account at least,

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:32.579 position:50% align:center
that is the story of the
mighty Flame Dragon Lord.

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:39.544 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, did he
just say that my heart

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.004 position:50% align:center
was stolen by her beauty?

00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:42.297 position:50% align:center
How very interesting.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.049 position:50% align:center
So that was the spin
they decided to put on it.

00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:45.592 position:50% align:center
Well, that's royal
propaganda for you.

00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:47.177 position:50% align:center
Do you have a problem with it?!
