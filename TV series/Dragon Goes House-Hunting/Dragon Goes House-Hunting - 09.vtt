00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.155 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
You must be the Dark Lord.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.078 position:50% align:center
Then allow me to introduce
myself, little man!

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:02.330 position:50% align:center
I'm a black dragon from
the Onyx Mountains.

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
Call me Varney!
Nice to meet ya!

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.418 position:50% align:center
It's a tremendous honor
to make your acquaintance,

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
and I do hope that you
will remember me fondly,

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.088 position:50% align:center
whether or not our
paths ever cross again

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
in this life!

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.467 position:50% align:center
--What's that?
--Hey!

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50% align:center
Don't be stupid, I'm trying to
make a good impression here!

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
I got manners and shit!

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to say,
"the pleasure's all mine!"

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:20.974 position:50% align:center
C'mon!

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] That's a bit much
in this day and age,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.143 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.899 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Aw, man, and I went outta my way

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
to greet the Dark Lord
all fancy-like, too.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
Are you the wrong guy?

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
He wants to see the Dark Lord.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
But I get the sneaking
suspicion he may be trouble,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
so I'll just try and convince
him to leave me alone.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's see. Huh.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it looks a lot like you.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
You have the wrong man.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
Take another look at it.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
I think you'll find I bear
no resemblance to that.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Huh? Really?

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.260 position:50% align:center
Man, you humans and elves
all look the same to me.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.513 position:50% align:center
I have the hardest time trying
to tell you two-leggies apart.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Then why the picture?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
Then again, the Dark Lord
Agency told me

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.603 position:50% align:center
I should come this way.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you gotta be him.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
I need your help with somethin'.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
I suppose we should get
introductions out of the way

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
before we proceed then.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
Call me Dearia,
not the "Dark Lord."

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
'Kay, fair enough,
and like I said earlier,

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
the name's Varney.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
I'm a black dragon, just in
case you couldn't tell

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
by looking.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
I like a woman with
sharp claws and a nice,

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
long tail on her.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I didn't ask.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I think I
may have heard of you.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
Are you the Mighty Dark
Dragon who has that

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
massive bounty on
his head, by chance?

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
That's me!

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
I'm the fearsome dreadwyrm
who leaves mountains

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
of corpses in his wake!

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.390 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I'm burninating
the countryside,

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
and sometimes I'm
lurking in labyrinths!

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
If I hear the Mighty Dark
Dragon's been spotted somewhere,

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
then that's where I'm gonna go!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
'Cause that is just how I roll!

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I think that's
the wrong way around.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I wouldn't
wanna not show up

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
if people are expecting
me somewhere.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
That would be a huge letdown!

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Not sure why that
matters, but whatever.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
Anyway, getting
back to business,

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
what is it you'd like me
to help you with, exactly?

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
What I need is real estate!

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
What?

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
I am terribly sorry,
but I'm afraid

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
that does not quite fall
within my current skill set.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
I would suggest consulting
with a real estate agent,

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
a dwarven artisan,

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
or perhaps your local
social services who--

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
The hell is this?

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
I give you that
humble-ass greeting,

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
and then you go and
tell me to piss off

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
like I'm some kinda newt?

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
You're the Dark Lord,
for crying out loud!

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
Can't you just shazam me
a nice five-star mansion

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
outta thin air?

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] This isn't the best way
to ask someone for help.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50% align:center
Oh, so you don't
like my attitude?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It's more than the attitude.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
Okay then. How about this?

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
I want a house, please,
please, please!

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything!
Just gimme one!

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
I want it and I want it now!

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
He's still missing the point.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
My goodness!

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
You've brought me another
interesting acquaintance.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
--[DEARIA] Master!
--[VARNEY] Whoa! She's huge!

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
You ought to assist him, Dearia.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
Must it be me?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.104 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] The poor
fellow traveled all this way

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
to ask for your help,
and for your help alone.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
If you are any
apprentice of mine,

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center
I expect you to lend your
assistance to anyone

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
who is in need.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah, buddy!
It's good for ya!

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
Would you kindly stay
out of this, please?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
Whoa! So she convinced ya, huh?

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Now, black dragon.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
I do hope you'll
treat him with care.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
There are many things
that he has yet to learn.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
No problem!

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
He's gonna be in good
hands with me, ma'am!

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's get rollin'!

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR]
Save travels to you both.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
So. What is our purpose here?

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
What do ya mean? We're looking
for primo real estate!

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
I mean, I wanted to
do it the easy way

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
and have you conjure
up a house for me,

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
but you wouldn't do that,
so the next best thing is to

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.163 position:50% align:center
repo from somebody else!

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
It's kind of a pain, honestly.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
You're completely
discounting the possibility

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
of earning the money
to buy a custom-built

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
house of your own?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Eh, maybe next time.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
Anyway, this is a Hero
Guild fortress, is it not?

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Yeah, it's one of 'em.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
But I'm pretty sure nobody
would be too bothered

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
if I took it off
their stupid hands.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.226 position:50% align:center
And here I thought
concern for others

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
was a completely
foreign concept to you.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't sass me.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
If attacking a Hero Guild
fortress was your plan

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
from the start, then you
don't need me, do you?

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
This should be no trouble
at all for someone 

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
s renowned as the
Mighty Dark Dragon.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'll take my
leave of you now.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
You're ditching me?

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
But your Master told you
to lend me a hand.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
She won't be too happy.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
I get it, the Dark Lord
doesn't have the cojones

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
--for this fight. Oh, man!
--[DEARIA] Cojones?

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
--What a maroon!
--[DEARIA] Maroon?

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll tell your
Master you backed out.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Very well.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
I will assist you
on one condition.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
And that's you explain
to me what "cojones"

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
and "maroons" are.

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.351 position:50% align:center
I can tell that they're
insults, but what kind?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] Not the type
to let things go, are ya?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
Are you certain you'd like
to approach directly?

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
An aerial attack would
make far more sense.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] Man, you're
dumber than you look.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
Didn't your mama teach
you any manners?

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
When you pay somebody a visit,

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
you're supposed to knock
on the front door!

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
Here's Varney!

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
--Oh, crap!
--Dragon?

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] Yeah, but it
ain't just any dragon!

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
I'm the Mighty Dark Dragon,
and I'm your worst nightmare!

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
I don't barbeque pretty girls,
so you ladies can run along!

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
[HEROES yell]

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] You fellas are
about to become toast.

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
[HEROES yell]

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
Be strong, Heroes.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
We must defeat this
creature as one!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
The mats he drops
will be ours to share!

[HEROES yell]

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
My man! Not bad.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center
Comes naturally.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
We'll never surrender.
Because we are true Heroes!

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
It's our responsibility to carry
the hopes of the people

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
and right the wrongs
of this great land!

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
For we are the sovereign
gods of the new world!

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
That's a bit of a stretch.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
All right, then I'll make
the gods my bitch!

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
Don't stoop to their level.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
Why the hell not?

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
Fighting ain't just
about who hits harder!

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
It's about passion too!

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
[HEROES]
Hear, hear!

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Ah, so I'm the bad guy.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
Well, if this charade is so
important, please continue.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
You don't have to be such a
stick in the mud, Dark Lord.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
[HERO D]
The Dark Lord?

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
[HERO A]
Really?

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
But no one's seen the
Dark Lord in centuries!

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
I thought he was only a legend!

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
You mean they have
legends about you?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
It would seem so.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
I don't think I can deal with
you being more legendary

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
than me...

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It bothers you that much?

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how
legendary you may be!

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
'Cause you're both about
to be good and dead!

[HEROES yell]

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Hey, Dark Lord!

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
This sure is fun, isn't it?

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
What exactly what about this
situation is fun to you?

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
It's not really the
situation that matters.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
What's actually important
is enjoying yourself

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
while you work,
whatever it is you do!

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
I'm not quite sure I follow.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
That way even if you lose,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center
if you had the most fun,
you win!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY laughs]

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Still not following.

[HEROES groan]

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That's the last of them.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
Allow me to send them
off to the church.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY laughs]
That was a real blast, huh?

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
Well, now we've claimed
this Heroes Guild fortress

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
as your new residence,

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.735 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's time for
me to be on my way--

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
Y'know, next I think I wanna
look at a beachfront property!

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
Ready to roll, Dark Lord?

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
Did you not hear
a word I just said?

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
And what exactly do
you mean by "next"?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
I thought you wanted to make
this place your new home.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Ah-ah-ah!

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
You and I both know that
house-hunting is no cakewalk.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
How can I be sure
this one's the best

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
if I don't shop around
for a little while?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
And it's kinda damaged!

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
But you're the one who did that.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.598 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] I can't live in a
house with such a fragile door!

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
C'mon!

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Again, not the door's fault!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
Whatever! Let's head over to the
next place and check it out.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Varney, how many houses
do you plan on viewing?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] How am I supposed
to predict that?

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
I figure I'll know the perfect
spot when I see it, idiot!

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
That was totally uncalled for.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
I truly despise beings like you.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
That's fine with me!

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
Because I just so happen to
hate snobby pretentious nerds!

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
[arguing continues]

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] And that was how
my century-long house hunt

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
with the black dragon began.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The next morning,
at a nearby church...

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
Care to explain this to me?!

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
Do you really need to
create such a ruckus?

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
A news bulletin?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I found it lying
on the main road!

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
"Multiple Hero Guilds Attacked."

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
"Has the Dark Lord
Finally Returned?"

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
Hmm, seems we're
the talk of the town.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
You're the only one in the
headline, Mister "Legendary"!

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
How's that my problem?

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY gasps]

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
I know, I'll send 'em
a letter saying I did it!

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Can we just focus on
finding you a home, please?

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
We've viewed countless
properties,

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
but you haven't liked
a single one.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
This journey has been
a colossal waste of time.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to find
somewhere I want to live

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
when the doors crumble
and the floors cave in?

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I have one suggestion.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
Why don't we test out a variety
of building materials

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
to see which ones can withstand
a dragon's occupancy?

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
You just thought of that?

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
Well, excuse me.

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:19.739 position:50% align:center
But my extensive expertise

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
doesn't cover
construction as well.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
Okay, so how are we
supposed to test stuff out?

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
We'll need to get
several materials

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
and have you walk
and jump on them

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
in order to get an idea
of their durability.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
So, I suppose the
first step is asking

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
a few acquaintances
of mine to procure them.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
I got a better idea!

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
I say we force the Heroes
to help us instead!

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
Next headline is gonna
say "The Handsome

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
and Powerful Mighty Dark
Dragon Has Arrived!"

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] You're still
thinking about that?

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
[HERO H] You hear about
the Dark Lord returning?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[HERO I] I wonder if he'll
attack our base too.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
We're fine.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
Unlike all the other bases,
this one was built

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
by dwarven architects,
so not even

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord could get in--

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
[HEROES yell]

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] A single sweep of your
tail destroyed the outer walls.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
Is this one made out
of reinforced brick?

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center
That clearly won't do.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
I heard it was built by dwarves,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
but judging by
the build quality,

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
I can see that the
budget for this fortress

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
must have been quite low.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
[HEROES]
Who's that?

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
Dark Lord!
Let's head to the next one!

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Very well.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your
cooperation, everyone.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Bye, losers!

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
[HEROES]
Huh?

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
[HERO J]
Hart Fortress got attacked, too.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
Yeah, by the Dark Lord
and a black dragon.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
But oddly, all they did was
break a hole in the wall

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center
and fly away.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
I wonder what they're plotting.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
The roof!

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that won't cut it.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
Work on your roof, would ya?

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
By the way, it may be
prudent to figure out

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
whether a heavier
roof is more resistant

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
to earthquakes as well.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
We'd better keep moving.

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
Later, haters!

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
[HERO J]
What the hell was that about?

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
Now we should see what
structures are the most

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
resistant to fire.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center
--[HEROES yell]
--[HERO M] It burns!

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
So not even marble can
withstand your fire breath.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
If you're looking for
something stronger

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
than my fire breath,
you're outta luck!

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope that
isn't the case.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, finding you
a home could prove

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
to be impossible.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
So, thanks to the Heroes'
generous sacrifices,

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
we finally have the proper data.

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
There's no way for a
dragon to live in a home

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
built for humans.

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I kinda figured
that from the start.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Indeed.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
I believe what you would need
is a large-scale property

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
that was created with
non-human inhabitants

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
in mind.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
Sounds good, but I
wouldn't wanna steal

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
from a non-human.
I do have some morals, y'know.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
Your best option would
be to offer a sizable

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
sum of money to
dwarven builders.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
They've constructed
some of the world's

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
greatest architectural wonders.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
Assuming your budget
allows for it,

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
I'm confident that a
qualified team of dwarves

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
could build you an abode
that more than suits

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
your needs.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
Are you being serious right now?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
Dwarves hate dragons!

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
I ain't got a hoard of gold
for them to steal,

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
but even if I did, I wouldn't
mess with their kind

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
unless I was looking to die.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
I can't stand them anyways.
They always act so greedy.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Well, I know they
have a great fondness

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
for precious metals.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
Hang on, are you saying you've
never met a dwarf before?

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
No, I've never even
spoken to one.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
Then how can you know?

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
That's kinda like looking
at the front cover of a book

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
and pretending that you
read every page of it!

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
Really, man?
You don't know anything.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
Now don't be absurd.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
Eh, who cares?

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
It's not like I have enough
money to hire them, anyway.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Hey.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
Has there always been
a Hero guild out here?

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
That's their flag, ain't it?

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Strange.
I don't see it on the map.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that one was
established very recently.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
I say we go pay 'em
a nice visit.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
What? Why?

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
We've already finished
all our research, so--

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Ah, shut up, nerd.

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go!

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Huh?

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
[HEROES chattering]

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Knock-knock!

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
Better make some
room, everybody!

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
[HERO N]
A dragon?

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Hold the applause, okay?

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
Was all the hullabaloo
entirely necessary?

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
I'm about to trash the joint.
Come, gimme a hand!

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] What on earth
would be the point of that?

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
You don't even
plan to live here.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] I saw some teeny-tiny,
defenseless non-human

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
critters running
around this area.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
Don't want 'em living in fear
of Heroes all the time, do we?

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
So I'm gonna wreck it.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be so hasty, Varney.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
Those creatures may
not live in this area.

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it's
possible they were just

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
passing through here?

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Less talking, more smashing!

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
Man, I can't believe a nerd
like you is this stupid!

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
I mean, you never shut up
about your damn books!

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
An elf with a dragon?
That guy must be the Dark Lord!

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
My patience is gone.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
You dare to bombard
me with insults

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.657 position:50% align:center
while you behave with
such childish entitlement?

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
You're nothing but a homeless
beggar who forced himself

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
--into my care!
--What?!

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.080 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I'm not traveling
with you by choice!

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:01.706 position:50% align:center
You wanna go, you egghead?

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
You talk a big game for a
baby who's always whining

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
about his Master!

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Fine!
If you think that poorly of me,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
then try finding a home
without my help!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
You selfish, obnoxious brute!

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] You'd like that,
'cause then you can--

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
[HERO O]
'Kay, this is bizarre.

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
But we can use it as a
chance to attack them!

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
[HEROES yell]

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
--[VARNEY] Shut your face!
--[DEARIA] Be silent!

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
You never cared at all
about any non-humans!

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
They're just an excuse for
you to do whatever you like!

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
[HEROES yell]

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
Why's that matter?

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
If the Heroes are
paying attention to me,

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
that means they'll be too busy
to mess with the small fries!

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
I'm at the top of the
food chain, aren't I?

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
That's my job!

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
Don't you have
something to protect?

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
It's not that--!

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Of course you don't!

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
'Cause you don't know nothing!

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
Think more about the world!

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
And who you have in it!

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
[JORMUNGANDR] There are many
things that he has yet to learn.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Can I ask you a question?

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
To learn more about you.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
I gotta say, this is a surprise.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've never asked
me about myself before.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
I'm-- thinking about
the world around me.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
Ah, finally see what an
interesting guy I am, huh?

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
All right, ask away!

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
Y'wanna hear all about
my glorious adventures?

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
Not exactly.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
I'm curious.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
What is your reason for
seeking a home of your own?

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
The thing is, let's see,
I just want, y'know--

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
A family, and all that.

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
I ain't getting any younger.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
I need a wife.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
And trust me, the lady dragons

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
won't give a fella
the time of day

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
if he doesn't have his
own stomping grounds.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
There's another problem too,

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
and sadly my good looks don't
quite make up for that.

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
Every time I do
find a good spot,

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
a bunch of Heroes always
come knocking at the door.

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
Ha. It ain't easy being
so damn legendary.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It's more to do with the bounty.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
So you'd like a place
where you can safely

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
bring women home
for some private time?

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
I don't care for the way
you phrased that.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
--A nest for babymaking?
--Even worse!

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
But I don't understand
why you came to me.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there are plenty
of others willing to help,

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
even if you aren't
able to pay them.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Well, the way I see it,

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
if the Mighty Dark Dragon
is gonna retire,

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
he needs a successor!

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
And you're the best choice!

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA chuckles]

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
What interesting logic.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA chuckles]

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
What will you do next?

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY] I gotta keep
on looking, obviously.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
After all, the world's a
real big place, ain't it?

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
So I figure there's gotta
be a proper home

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
for a dragon somewhere.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
Y'wanna...

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Of course I'll come with you.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
You know, you were
right, Varney.

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
Everything I know
about this world

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
I got from the pages of a book.

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
However,

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
If I'm to assist you with
your house-hunting,

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
then I can explore
the world for myself.

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
It's not about you at all.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
Ha. You're funny, man.

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:29.539 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Mayhaps I'll pick up
an architect's license as well.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
[VARNEY]
Nice!

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.379 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The next day, there
was a headline that read:

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
"Dark Dragon Serves
as Dark Lord's Minion."

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
Naturally, Varney was less
than ecstatic, to say the least.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
Letty?

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.726 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It's getting rather late.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
We'll continue the
story another time.

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah, good idea.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
Varney's home.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
I bet it's a really
cool place, huh?

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.075 position:50% align:center
I hope I find a home soon, too.

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.046 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Welcome back, friends.

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:42.672 position:50% align:center
I hope that you're
all enjoying some rest

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:44.924 position:50% align:center
