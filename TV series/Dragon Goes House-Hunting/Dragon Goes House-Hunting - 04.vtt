00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
What is this place?

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.232 position:50% align:center
Why would we ever
visit the tundra?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
Oh, I remember.
We're house-hunting, duh.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.905 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] It's been a while
since I visited this lot.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.407 position:50% align:center
It's a trifle cold.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
You're looking toasty
and warm, though.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.744 position:50% align:center
I've taken the liberty of
preparing winter wear

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
for you, too.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center
Wow, really?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.331 position:50% align:center
Though admittedly,
there weren't very many

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.958 position:50% align:center
options available in your size.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
If it's insulated,
then I'm happy!

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:10.130 position:50% align:center
'Kay, this is nice, but
it's a little constrictive.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
Too flashy for my taste.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:15.093 position:50% align:center
Somehow I'm even colder now.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:16.928 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center
This outfit is warm,
and I can move my arms

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.099 position:50% align:center
and legs around just fine!

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.143 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
He resembles a crab croquette.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.894 position:50% align:center
So why did you bring us
to the middle of a field

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.271 position:50% align:center
of snow again?

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:27.981 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I know how much
living in peace and quiet

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.774 position:50% align:center
appeals to you.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:33.528 position:50% align:center
And as such, I thought this
spot would be perfect.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's cheap,
and so isolated,

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.948 position:50% align:center
heroes won't come around.

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
You sure like to take
things to the extreme, huh?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
Also, I don't see any
houses around here.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Correct. You'll build
your own. Right here.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Seriously?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
This is for you.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
--A shovel?
--Yes.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The Yeti.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.015 position:50% align:center
A creature native to
this extreme region.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wait, where'd this come from?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Let's observe them
in their natural habitat.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center
They spend their lives
roaming the tundra,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
hunting for sustenance.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
In this desolate land,
blanketed in ice and snow

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
year-round, the yeti
must remain nomadic

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
to feed themselves
and their young.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
It's a lifestyle in which
building a permanent

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
home is simply out
of the question.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
So instead, the yeti live
in temporary dwellings,

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
igloos they've built themselves.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
[YETI speaking incoherently]

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
You'll construct your own
home in a similar fashion.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
Use as much snow as you require.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
I have to do it?!

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Since there are no
security measures to consider, 

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
you should be able to manage
the work yourself.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
Cost of construction?
That's zero.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
It's free materials.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
You can build the home of your
dreams on some of the cheapest

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
land available, and all it'll
take is a little hard work on

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
your part!

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] You do know how sketchy
you just made this sound, right?

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
The lot stretches before you,
out to those far mountains.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
Build wherever you like.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
All that?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
As I said, the land is cheap.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
Well, it's time to get to
work building your igloo.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I guess... here's good.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Start by compressing
the snow with your feet.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
You're looking for a patch with
the right hardness and density.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
This snow is suitable
for our purposes.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
Now, on to the next step.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
Create blocks out of snow,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
and stack them up in a
circular configuration.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
Fill any gaps with extra snow.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
The smaller you build it,
the warmer it will be.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Got it.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
The three rooms you'll need are
the main room, a storage area,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
and finally the entryway.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
The main room should always
end up being a step higher

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
than the rest of the rooms.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
You'll want to hang seal pelts
on the walls throughout 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.200 position:50% align:center
that area.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Because those'll help
insulate us from the cold!

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
The weather's cleared up.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
Look, Dearia!

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
I finished it!

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
--Excellent work.
--Aww, shucks.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
Now for the inconvenient
matter of living here.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] As I had mentioned
to you earlier, this location

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
is extremely remote.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
Put plainly, not dying
can prove to be quite

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
the challenging endeavor.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
In fact, you should
experience that yourself.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try to survive
here for the next three days?

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
Take care not to
freeze to death now.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Not another training arc!

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait!

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
Is there someplace maybe a
little less rugged I could live?

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
--This will build character.
--[LETTY] But I have plenty!

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
I will check on you
in three days' time.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
Best of luck!

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
No! Wait!

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Guess I should
gather some firewood.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Well, so far,
this isn't too terrible.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Oh! Three reindeer!

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
If I can catch them,
I can eat them.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
But what's the best method?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yells]

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
[LETTY groans]

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
No! I'm stuck!

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
Help me! I could
really use a hand here!

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] What was I thinking,
trying to hunt?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
I've always gotten
meat from the butcher.

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
I should head back
to the igloo soon.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
The weather isn't making
this any easier.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
Hello? House?

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
Where are you?

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
I can't see anything
in all this.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
It's a total whiteout!

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
There's something big and
scary behind me, isn't there?

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yells]

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
Please let me go!

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna taste gross!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
Ah. You're inviting me in?

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I'm so grateful!

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Welcome, Letty!

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
I was just finishing
up with dinner,

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
so why don't you
take your coat off

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
and make yourself at home?

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia! Thank goodness!

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
I was afraid I was
done for out there!

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.769 position:50% align:center
Wow, you know,
the inside of this igloo is, uh,

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
surprisingly warm and toasty!

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
Actually, it's more than that.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of burning up in here.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Dinner is served.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
Um, Dearia?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
I took my shirt off
because it was hot.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
You can always disrobe
if you're feeling the heat too.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
I mean, I don't really
have a whole lot left

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
I can take off, so--

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] As you can see,
the yeti's stripped down

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
--to his waist.
--[LETTY] He can do that?!

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
My, is it ever hot in here!

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
And he can talk?

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
We've all made ourselves
more comfortable.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What are the dwarves doing here?

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
And the heroes, too?

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
It's getting too hot in here.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
No, the igloo's melting!

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
Just a dream?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
I'm not even gonna try
to unpack that one.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
I'm so hungry.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
What I wouldn't give for
a fishing rod right now.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
What am I gonna do?

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
An egg?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
But what kind? Huh--

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
A yummy one?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
If I eat this,
that makes me an egg thief!

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
Come on, Letty!

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
That would make me
just as bad as the guy

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
who stole the egg
while I was sleeping!

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
I'm better than that!

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
Only unfertilized eggs
are fit for eating

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
in my book!

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, little guy, no
dragon's gonna eat you today!

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
Well, with that settled, I guess
I'd better head back home.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
Wait... What?!

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to get to the shore?!

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
Swim for it?!
But I don't know how!

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
I can't even be certain
that as a dragon,

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
I'd survive a plunge
into the icy, briny,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
scary, cold ocean.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
No, please don't jump!

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
You still have a future!

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
Things are bound to get better!

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
I swear!
Don't leave me here alone!

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Nothing's gotten better.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
My belly's so hungry,
it started a riot.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
[crying]

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
No, no, no!

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to eat the egg!

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to eat the egg!

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Don't eat it, don't eat it,
don't eat it, don't eat it!

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
Please don't eat... me!

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
A dragon?

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
Oh, good, you're awake.

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling
all right, friend?

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
I think.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
Can you stand?

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Uh, yeah. I'm okay.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
Hi there, Davy Jones
is the name.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
And you are?

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
Uh, my name is Letty.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, likewise, sir.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
I got lost in a
terrible snowstorm,

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
then ended up adrift
on an ice floe,

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
but how did I--

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
That's right!
I got swallowed by a big whale!

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
Aye, and you're inside
that whale right now.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
[LETTY gasps]
Oh, no!

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
This is how I go,
digested by a giant whale!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
It's tragic!
Goodbye, cruel world!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
Hey, calm down. Enough!

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you sure are a
scaredy-cat for someone

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
so big.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
But I'll die--

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
Come along.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
There's something
I'd like to show you.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
--Please, come in.
--Wait, really?

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
You'll be just fine. Come.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
It's my room. Look around.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, sure, okay.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Oh! It's so squishy!

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
Care for some tea?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
Wait. How'd you get tea?

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
We're inside of a whale.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
[DAVY] Ha. It swallowed
a few boxes that fell off

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
a sinking ship.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
And that's not all!

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
We have gems, cutlery,
cooking ingredients,

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
even gunpowder!

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
Wow, thank you!

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
Boy, I sure didn't expect
it to be so warm in here.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
A bit stuffy,
but really not too bad.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
Aye.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
The water outside
might be frigid,

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
but it's pleasant inside.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
Winters are warm,
and summers are cool.

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh...

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
Plus, heroes never
come a-calling.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
That's a relief.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
Just wish we could do
something about the smell.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
I wonder.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
What were you doing in the
middle of the ocean, anyway?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
Oh, that.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
Sounds rough.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
Looking for the perfect home.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
Guess even dragons can be
picky on some occasions.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yeah.

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
How'd you like to take a tour,
maybe get some fresh ideas?

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't mind?

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
Nah. Come along.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
Here is the laundry room.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
What is that thing?

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
Washing machine.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
A wha--?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
[DAVY] You put dirty clothes
in, and it washes 'em

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
clean on its own.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
[whale song]

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
Uh, where'd that
noise come from?

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
That's the whale song.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
The vibration it creates
cleans all of the dirt

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
and gunk off of the clothes.

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Ultrasonic cleaning.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[DAVY] This room's where
the clothes are dried.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
Just watch.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.377 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
'Kay. Watch what?

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
[DAVY] It's a massive wind
tunnel, formed whenever

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
the whale breathes.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
That air dries the wet clothes
almost instantaneously.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh...

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
And probably makes
them stink, too.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
This right here is fuel storage.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
I can use drippings of the
whale's fat to cook food,

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
light all the lamps,
and even make soap

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
for bath time.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
Cool!

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
it also helps the whale

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
shed a couple of pounds!

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] That might be
too much information.

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.491 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
And this is the kitchen.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
Check out these fresh fish,
also swallowed by the whale.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
A whole boatful!

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah! Fantastic!

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
I'll cook a feast for the ages!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
Wow! Really?

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm pretty hungry!

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah!

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for the meal!

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
Thanks for tidying up.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
The bath is ready for you
whenever you want it.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you mean this
place has a bathtub too?

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
A tad lukewarm.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kinda gross,
but also feels nice.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
One should never
look a gift horse

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
in the mouth, Letty.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
The whale's body heats it.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
So, whaddaya say?

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
Wanna stay here
with me for a while?

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I wouldn't want
to intrude on you!

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
You're more than welcome.

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to have someone around.

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
Think it over.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.335 position:50% align:center
That Mister Jones
is such a nice guy.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
He fed me, and gave
me a nice, warm,

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
squishy bed to sleep in.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
His home is pretty great too.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't mind living
in a place like this.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
Although, I wonder if I'll
ever be able to get out.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia--

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Gotta pee.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
Where's the toilet?

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
Mister Jones?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
What in the world is he
doing up at this hour?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
Wait, why's he
sharpening his knife?

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
Is he planning to eat me?

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
He's gonna cut me up
into little pieces

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
and feed me to the
whale as rent payment!

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Not good.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
Am I trapped here with a madman?

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
Is there no hope of escape?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
Letty?

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait, good what now?

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.404 position:50% align:center
We'll be eating
breakfast shortly.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
I'm getting it all ready now.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Um, Mister Jones?

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
Why are you cooking
breakfast this late at night?

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
It's morning, not night.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
We're in a whale, remember?

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
We don't see the sun.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Oh.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
--Hittin' the head?
--Uh-huh! Yes, please!

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
It'll be on your left,
down that hallway.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
On the left, huh?

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
Once you're done,
just kick the toilet.

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
It'll flush on its own
after you do.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wait, where does it flush to?

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center
Out into the ocean, of course!

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
But what does it come out of?

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:57.058 position:50% align:center
Don't ask! I'm tryin'
to cook here!

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
I see. So you gotta get
back to the surface?

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yeah.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
I need to make sure this egg
gets back to its parents.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
That, and someone
important's waiting

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
for me out there.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
A shame.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
I would've been glad to
have you as a roommate.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
So how exactly
are you planning on

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
getting outta here?

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
You mean there isn't
any way to get back?

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
No. There is a way to get you
out if you really wanna leave.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
It's just--

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
[DAVY] We're gonna launch you
through the big guy's blowhole.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
We're wha--?!

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
What are those barrels for?

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
That's not gunpowder, is it?

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
This here? It's just pepper.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
Why pepper?

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
[DAVY]
It'll make the whale sneeze.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
That should get you outta here.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
And I'll survive that, right?

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
Though I've never had to
blow out a dragon before.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.416 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll have to see.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
Don't get stuck, or I won't
be able to get you down.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm having second thoughts!

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
[DAVY chuckles]
Buck up, my boy!

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
You're a dragon!

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
That little egg's counting
on you to have

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.222 position:50% align:center
some courage, Letty.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
Right! Then let's do this!

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
Countdown!

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
Five! Four!

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
Three! Two! One!

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center

[LETTY grunting]

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Owie.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
Wait, I'm alive! We did it!

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
The egg!

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
Good. It's still in one piece!

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
I made it!

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
I'm free to breathe the fresh
air and bask in the sun!

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
My stomach's starting
to eat itself.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yes! I finally found food!

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm gonna eat you!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
I'm a dragon, after all.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
I can kill a little seal, easy!

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
Okay, instincts.
Time to do your thing!

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
Don't be fooled by its cuteness!

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
It's a delicious slab of meat!

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
I just can't! It's too adorable!

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
[crying]

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] It appears you are
ill-suited to this lifestyle.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
No, over here.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
There are some who,

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
if they found themselves
in your situation,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
would fit right into the
survivalist lifestyle needed.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
But I can see that's not
the sort of being you are.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
I never knew you were
part seal, Dearia!

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
I just assumed you were an elf!

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I am an elf.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
I borrowed this pelt from
a selkie friend of mine.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
Wearing it lets me
transform into a seal.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
It's all yours, babe.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
So, were you also the
reindeer and the rabbits?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I didn't go that far.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
Though I did keep watch
on you from a distance,

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
to ensure no harm came to you.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
Oh. He's been swallowed
by a whale.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
You sure look comfortable!

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
I thought the extreme
survival conditions

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
might awaken your
dragon sensibilities,

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
but you're far too sweet
natured to survive

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
in this climate.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
I apologize for testing
you like that.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well sure, that's okay.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
This really is you
though, right?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna
disrobe, are you?

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
Whatever do you mean by that?

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
But, what would you have done
if I'd actually tried to bite

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
you as a seal?

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
Likely nothing at all.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
I daresay I would have
been far too impressed

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
by how strong you'd become.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
Dearia!

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much--!

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
With the understanding
that it would take

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
far more than that to
sink your teeth into me.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
[LETTY sneezes]

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
Here, have some stew.
It should help warm you up.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
That sounds wonderful,
thank you.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Wherever did you find this egg?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
I saw it lying in the snow,

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
and then it wound up
on the same ice floe

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
as me and then--Stop!

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
Do you have an egg allergy?

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
No, that is not why
I'm freaking out!

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
I grabbed it because
I really wanted

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
to return it to its parents.

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
[crack]

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
Papa!

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
Papa! Papa!

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
Papa! Papa!

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
--[DEARIA] Congratulations.
--[LETTY] It's not mine!

00:21:58.568 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT]
Papa!

00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:33.455 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Have you ever thought
about building an igloo?

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.332 position:50% align:center
Here's the most simple
way to go about it.

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50% align:center
Stack up some empty boxes,
then pack in snow around them.

00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:41.046 position:50% align:center
Wait for it to freeze.

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:42.505 position:50% align:center
Next, remove the boxes,

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.966 position:50% align:center
and you've got yourself
a brand new igloo.
