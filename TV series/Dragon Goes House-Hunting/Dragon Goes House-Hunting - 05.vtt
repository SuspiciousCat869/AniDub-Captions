Now, Letty.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.734 position:50% align:center
Let's examine a few
properties in this region.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:53.071 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Hey, uh, is it just me,
or is it kinda hot here?

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:54.990 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I think it might be your outfit.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.116 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Oh.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.585 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, I like
warm places like this

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.128 position:50% align:center
a heck of a lot better!

00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:10.380 position:50% align:center
I see, so you dislike
the cold, then.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:11.965 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you're
all right abandoning

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.258 position:50% align:center
the igloo you built?

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
It's cool.

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:17.179 position:50% align:center
Those yetis were
happy to take over.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That's good.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.849 position:50% align:center
[YETI vocalizes]

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
I was thinking we
ought to look into

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.894 position:50% align:center
a communal living
arrangement for the next

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.312 position:50% align:center
few properties we tour.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.897 position:50% align:center
Something tells me that
you would fare better

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.398 position:50% align:center
in a place like that.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:29.858 position:50% align:center
I was planning on
reaching out to a couple

00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:31.693 position:50% align:center
of my old landlord
friends, but--

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
Their communities are
geared toward bachelors.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
Papa!

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
I am a bachelor! Not a papa!

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50% align:center
--Please accept this gift.
--What for?

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50% align:center
To celebrate the birth
of your first child.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
Aw, thanks, Dearia.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.545 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.088 position:50% align:center
What kind of a home
would you like to share

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.798 position:50% align:center
--with your papa?
--[PIPBERT chirps]

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.383 position:50% align:center
Are you even listening?

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.635 position:50% align:center
But Letty, as I've
explained before,

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
when a creature is born,
it may become attached

00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:00.264 position:50% align:center
to the first living
thing that it sees

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.641 position:50% align:center
due to a phenomenon known
as imprinting, remember?

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:07.646 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] And the effect is
practically impossible to undo.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] I know, but do
you really think it's okay

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.401 position:50% align:center
for me to raise this little guy?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:16.238 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Actually, I have
a little story about that.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.115 position:50% align:center
A long, long time ago--

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.700 position:50% align:center
There was a human
explorer who took

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:24.121 position:50% align:center
an expedition through the woods
and discovered a massive egg.

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
No sooner had he found it,
an enormous bird

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
hatched from it.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.421 position:50% align:center
The bird followed the
human everywhere,

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.299 position:50% align:center
believing he was its father.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
The explorer tried
numerous times to return

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
the baby bird to the wild,
but the creature

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
was determined to stay by
his side, no matter what.

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:46.727 position:50% align:center
And so, the man raised
the bird as though

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
it were his own child,
which, in turn,

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
meant that the bird grew
up believing that it too

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.275 position:50% align:center
was a human being.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Wow, this imprinting
thing is serious!

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.156 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Unfortunately, the bird
didn't realize how short

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
human lives were.

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:05.162 position:50% align:center
So when the explorer died,
it stayed with the corpse.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.457 position:50% align:center
Some say that you can
still hear its sorrowful cries.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
"Father. Father."

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the
relentless pecking.

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
Peck, peck. Peck, peck.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
It's a ghost story now!

00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] And while half of that
tale is pure fabrication--

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, so which
half was the real one?

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.597 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] After a chick
imprints on someone,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
it cannot be returned
to its parents.

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
First half, I hope?

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:29.770 position:50% align:center
Am I to assume that
you brought it with you

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
because you realized
that was the case?

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:33.941 position:50% align:center
Luckily, it's a
hraesvelgr chick,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
so it'll grow up just fine
without much intervention.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.070 position:50% align:center
It's what?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] A giant eagle
with an affinity for cold.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.535 position:50% align:center
They live along rivers
in the northern

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:45.911 position:50% align:center
mountain region.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.080 position:50% align:center
The baby ones eat snow
until they get old enough

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.498 position:50% align:center
to leave the nest.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Whoa.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Once it reaches
adulthood, your job is done.

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
It can summon a blizzard
with one strong flap

00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:57.673 position:50% align:center
of its wings, so you
don't need to worry

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:58.924 position:50% align:center
at that point.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
Now I'm more worried!

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
For now, all that you need to do

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
is keep it cold and make
sure it has enough

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:06.932 position:50% align:center
snow to eat.
Simple, yes?

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.101 position:50% align:center
Well, not really,
because there's no snow

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.519 position:50% align:center
or ice around here.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.569 position:50% align:center
--How's this?
--I stand corrected.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Still.

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:27.536 position:50% align:center
I can't help thinking I'm gonna
screw this up somehow.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
In that case, my previous
idea might just work.

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:34.543 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Perhaps here...

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:43.135 position:50% align:center
...we can find a more
suitable caretaker.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.980 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hey! This is awesome!

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
I've never actually seen a
housing community before!

00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
The cost of living in
one of these places

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
is significantly less
than it would be

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:03.155 position:50% align:center
for an independent unit.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.282 position:50% align:center
In a communal space,
you can also call upon

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
your neighbors to help you.

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
So it's an ideal spot
to raise a little one.

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.039 position:50% align:center
However, there aren't
many units that can house

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
larger tenants such as yourself.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.210 position:50% align:center
Most of them are instead
designed with small

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
to mid-sized residents in mind.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.173 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Why don't they
accommodate larger tenants?

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.509 position:50% align:center
--A dragon!
--That's crazy!

with the slightest
of movements,

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.223 position:50% align:center
which leads to
higher repair costs.

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.766 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] They tend to be
a lot noisier as well,

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.896 position:50% align:center
even if they don't
intend to be a bother.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.315 position:50% align:center
Which typically means
more noise complaints.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Larger species don't
often make their homes

00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
in communities like this
one, so there isn't

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
much demand, anyway.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.617 position:50% align:center
So does that mean Heroes
don't show up here, either?

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.536 position:50% align:center

Um, hello. I'm Letty.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.758 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] We're actually not here
to discuss housing, though.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:33.180 position:50% align:center
[ORTHROS B] So, you're
looking for adoptive parents!

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.058 position:50% align:center
I can't say I've ever met
a dragon who's so gentle!

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
Well, I think it's quite lovely.
Don't you?

00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, it's heartwarming,
I'll give you that.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Are these two like a
married couple, or what?

00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
No, not exactly.

00:08:45.901 --> 00:08:47.945 position:50% align:center
Two-headed creatures
have differing tastes,

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.531 position:50% align:center
which can make it quite
difficult to find partners.

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:52.533 position:50% align:center
These two are brothers,
but they provide each other

00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:54.910 position:50% align:center
companionship in
place of a lover.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.620 position:50% align:center
That's tragic!

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.247 position:50% align:center
You know we'd do
anything to help you out

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
under normal
circumstances, Dearia.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
But some of our tenants
have been terribly

00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
unhappy lately.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.381 position:50% align:center
We recently had to handle
an issue with a resident

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
who was complaining
about somebody else's

00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:11.927 position:50% align:center
children being too loud.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.971 position:50% align:center
Besides, my hearing's
started to go.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
So I dunno if I can
take care of a kid.

00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:17.975 position:50% align:center
You poor darling.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Um, well, it just hatched,

00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:21.520 position:50% align:center
so it doesn't make
a lot of noise yet.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
I don't think you'd have to
worry about it crying loudly.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.232 position:50% align:center
[ORTHROS B]
That's true!

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
Look, it's so small
and adorable!

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.528 position:50% align:center
[ORTHROS A]
Right, it is pretty tiny.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.572 position:50% align:center
Maybe it wouldn't
be too much trouble.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
[ORTHROS B] Would you like
to live with us, little guy?

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.576 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT]
Papa!

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
[yelling continues]

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
That was wicked loud, bro!

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.253 position:50% align:center
Please tell me you're okay!

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.590 position:50% align:center
Dude! Speak to me! Brother!

00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:54.261 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.847 position:50% align:center
You need a mother for your
little hatchling, do you?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't you sweet.

00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
Heads up.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
It cries real loud whenever
it gets upset though.

00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.314 position:50% align:center
[EMPUSA A]
That just means he's healthy!

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:08.192 position:50% align:center
Practically everyone living
in our building has children,

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:10.027 position:50% align:center
so I don't think anybody
would have an issue

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.778 position:50% align:center
with him.

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center
How about I take this
adorable little fellow in?

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
Wow, that would be perfect!

00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.327 position:50% align:center
Come in for some tea,
why don't you?

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
We can hash out the details.

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:21.747 position:50% align:center
[LAMIA A]
Just a damn second!

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
You got another pet?

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows the
HOA doesn't allow you

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
to have animals
in this building!

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
He isn't a pet,
he's my beautiful son,

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50% align:center
thank you very much.

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
[LAMIA A growls]

00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you?

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
Should I assume you're
going to keep that one

00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:39.473 position:50% align:center
in a cage, too?

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.934 position:50% align:center
Ya got a very funny way
of disciplining children!

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.602 position:50% align:center
You're the reason our
residents are always

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
complaining about
how this whole unit

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.480 position:50% align:center
smells like a zoo!

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Have you ever considered
it might be you

00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
they're smelling?

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
You're the one who reeks
of manure, you dumb cow!

00:10:51.944 --> 00:10:53.779 position:50% align:center
Pretty words coming from
the disgusting snake

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
who smells of rotting sardines.

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you'd be less
bitter if you weren't

00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.326 position:50% align:center
flat as a board!

00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:03.789 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] This is no environment
to raise a child in!

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.250 position:50% align:center
Um, let's all take a
deep breath, okay?

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
You stay out of this,
dragon boy!

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to get killed?

00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
Yeah, mind your own business!

00:11:11.547 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

They're worse than Heroes.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.553 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I see this is
going to take a while.

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.513 position:50% align:center
Let's go and ask someone else.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.265 position:50% align:center
[LETTY sniffs]
Okay.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.980 position:50% align:center
Why, of course. I'd be happy
to take this little fellow in.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.649 position:50% align:center
I have several children
of my own, actually,

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.568 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure they'll
get along perfectly.

00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:33.861 position:50% align:center
Why don't you
come on over here

00:11:33.944 --> 00:11:35.571 position:50% align:center
and make him feel
welcome, everybody?

00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:39.241 position:50% align:center
Hello there!

--Indeed not!

I'm so tired.

00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:21.046 position:50% align:center
Finding foster parents
is awfully hard.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
It would seem so.

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:24.675 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.515 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,
I never figured out

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
how it got separated
from its real family

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
in the first place.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
It's simple. After hraesvelgr
lay their eggs in the snow,

00:15:37.563 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
they keep their nests
hidden by staying away

00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:40.941 position:50% align:center
until the eggs hatch.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.569 position:50% align:center
It may sound cruel, but it's
the safest way they know.

00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:46.363 position:50% align:center
Most likely, this one's nest
was buried in a bad spot,

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:47.948 position:50% align:center
so it emerged alone.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
That makes sense.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, then it
probably would've been

00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:52.953 position:50% align:center
smarter for me to just
leave the egg alone,

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
and maybe its mommy
would've come back

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.123 position:50% align:center
to pick it up eventually.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.709 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, that's
certainly a possibility.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
But if you ask me,
it wasn't very likely.

00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:03.255 position:50% align:center
Had you simply left
the egg there,

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
it's safe to assume
something else would've

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.259 position:50% align:center
come along and eaten it.

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
I believe the only reason
that bird is alive

00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:11.013 position:50% align:center
is because you protected it.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:13.849 position:50% align:center
Therefore, you needn't blame
yourself for its plight.

00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:16.894 position:50% align:center
I mean, yeah, maybe.

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Perhaps you
should be its father, Letty.

00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me? No way!

00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:23.567 position:50% align:center
It probably doesn't even
want me to be its dad!

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.029 position:50% align:center
I'm a wimp and a coward.
Useless, too.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
I mean, think.

00:16:28.739 --> 00:16:32.201 position:50% align:center
If someone attacked us, I
couldn't keep this baby safe!

00:16:32.284 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
I'd suck as a dad.

00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:37.998 position:50% align:center
Yes, he could hate you. Easily.

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.209 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
You're not supposed to agree!

00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:42.503 position:50% align:center
I knew it, I'm screwed.

00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Then again, I think
all parents feel that way.

00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:50.052 position:50% align:center
Nobody starts out as
the perfect caregiver.

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.179 position:50% align:center
The only way you can learn
and grow as a parent

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
is by laughing,
crying, and worrying

00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
alongside your children
through the years.

00:16:57.351 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
Besides, strength and
bravery are not the only

00:16:59.478 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
qualities that make
a good father.

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
Though if you can't protect
them with physical strength,

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
then you're in trouble.

00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:17:07.903 --> 00:17:09.363 position:50% align:center
[BUGBEAR A]
Oh, there you are.

00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
Dearia! I heard that
you were in the area.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Long time no see, eh?

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:20.541 position:50% align:center
Why, hello.
What a lovely surprise.

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
Hello there!

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:22.668 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.211 position:50% align:center
Actually, I've been
thinking about having

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.797 position:50% align:center
a few renovations done
on my building soon.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
Do you think you might
be able to come up

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
with an estimate for me?

00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:30.968 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I'd be glad to.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.970 position:50% align:center
I'm going to go take
a look with him.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.847 position:50% align:center
Would you mind waiting
here for a few minutes?

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
Sure, take your time.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[BOY BUGBEAR A] I heard you're
looking for some parents

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:40.853 position:50% align:center
for a baby bird!

00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:42.396 position:50% align:center
Yeah, everyone says so.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:43.397 position:50% align:center
So are you?

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hm? Mmm...

00:17:45.524 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A] If you don't
want it, hand it here!

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.658 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A laughs]

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
Dwarves'll pay a hefty
price for a rare creature

00:17:57.536 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
like that.

00:17:59.872 --> 00:18:02.958 position:50% align:center
And I could use some
extra cash, for sure.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.293 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
He's gonna fight me, isn't he?

00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:08.130 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
Forget it! We are not gonna
sell him to the dwarves!

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Never, not in a million years!

00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A]
Why?

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
You don't even know
what to do with it!

00:18:16.847 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Sorry, not happening!

00:18:18.724 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A] Fine, then give
me one of those bear cubs.

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
No way, no how!

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
If you harm one hair
on their heads,

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:27.024 position:50% align:center
then I'll, uh, I'll--!

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.275 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A]
You'll what?

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.902 position:50% align:center
Run away and cry?

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
I'll... set you on fire!

00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
With, uh, my breath.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.999 position:50% align:center
It's really hot and stuff.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.210 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A] Huh? Sorry,
didn't hear what you said.

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
My hair's coverin' my ears.

00:18:49.922 --> 00:18:53.467 position:50% align:center
C'mon now, I'll take
good care of 'em.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
I'd really rather do
this the easy way,

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
but if you're gonna
make it complicated--

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.895 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I knew it. This is impossible!

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll never be strong
enough to protect anybody.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.149 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
No. I'll save them.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.616 position:50% align:center
I have to!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.537 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Agh! Ow! It burns!

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh, I wasn't kidding
when I said it was hot!

00:19:24.248 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
He may look harmless--

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.961 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A]
Huh?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.379 position:50% align:center
But I should warn you,
he's been called

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
the Flame Dragon Lord
of Mass Destruction.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.218 position:50% align:center
He's turned countless
Heroes to ash,

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
and once razed an entire
kingdom to the ground

00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
in a single night.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.266 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A]
That's the Flame Dragon Lord?

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
If you don't run now, you
might just be barbecued.

00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:48.814 position:50% align:center
[CATOBLEPAS A yells]

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The Heroes certainly
have made you famous,

00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:52.985 position:50% align:center
haven't they, Letty.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.695 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna be famous.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for protecting my kids.

00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
[BOY BUGBEAR A]
Did you see that, Dad?

00:20:00.826 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
It was scary!

00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:05.122 position:50% align:center
[BOY BUGBEAR B] Yeah, but that
dragon was super amazing!

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.250 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you one thing,
being a parent is no easy job.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
I respect that guy.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Can I tell you something?

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:12.838 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
Come, come.

00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:31.857 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] You risked your life
to guard those little ones.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center
Which makes you a dad.

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
Papa! Papa!

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Thanks!

00:20:57.633 --> 00:20:59.218 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I suppose we should
focus on looking at

00:20:59.301 --> 00:21:02.179 position:50% align:center
family-friendly properties
from here on out.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.639 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
That would be awesome.

00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
By the way, have you
decided on a name

00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:08.769 position:50% align:center
for the little fellow yet?

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
[LETTY laughs]

00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
I had to give it a whole
lot of thought, but yeah!

00:21:13.232 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
I finally decided
on the name Pip!

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:18.237 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That took a lot of thought?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] His full name
is Piyovelt Phelpia

00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:22.491 position:50% align:center
Pi Alpine Piyoderika.

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.910 position:50% align:center
What do you think?
Sounds pretty noble, doesn't it?

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:26.787 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Spoken like a proud father.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.091 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] When searching
for a home in Japan,

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:04.801 position:50% align:center
one may hear the English
words "apartment"

00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:06.136 position:50% align:center
or "mansion."

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.097 position:50% align:center
But what do these
terms truly represent?

00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:11.141 position:50% align:center
Each word conjures an
image of a certain type

00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:13.018 position:50% align:center
of building, but there's
actually no official

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.937 position:50% align:center
definition for either one.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.897 position:50% align:center
It's up to the owners to
decide which descriptors

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.442 position:50% align:center
they wish to use to
sell their properties.

00:23:20.526 --> 00:23:23.237 position:50% align:center
In fact, "heights,"
"co-op," and "maison"

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.864 position:50% align:center
are commonly used
in real-estate listings,

00:23:25.948 --> 00:23:28.408 position:50% align:center
but those are also chosen
by individual owners

00:23:28.492 --> 00:23:30.911 position:50% align:center
and carry no
particular significance.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.288 position:50% align:center
"Chateau," "residence,"
and "palace" are words

00:23:33.372 --> 00:23:36.250 position:50% align:center
that are often used to
describe a luxurious place,

00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:37.459 position:50% align:center
which, in other parts
of the world,

00:23:37.543 --> 00:23:39.878 position:50% align:center
is reserved for royals
or the upper class.

00:23:39.962 --> 00:23:41.338 position:50% align:center
But properties like
these are not always

00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.757 position:50% align:center
as luxe as their names imply.

00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:46.385 position:50% align:center
The next episode is entitled
"A Dragon In Trouble."
