00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.182 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah!

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What a cute little house!

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
Bet if I lived here,
I'd be super safe!

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
My home, sweet home.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
I was starting to be
afraid I'd never find

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.661 position:50% align:center
the right place!

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
[DWARF E]
Oh. there you are, Letty.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
Welcome home!

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yells]

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.723 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Good, you're finally awake.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.433 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.477 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but do I know you?

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.446 position:50% align:center
Ah, where are my manners?

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
My name is--

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
Um... Uh-huh! I'm okay.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.205 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate
you saving me.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.999 position:50% align:center
You can call me Letty, sir.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50% align:center
Someone told me that I
would find an elf gentleman

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
around here who's a
really good architect!

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That's why you've come?

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
My, that certainly
is a coincidence.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
I am that selfsame elf.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
Please call me Dearia.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
Hello? Are you still with me?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
Well, that's quite troublesome.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
--Find me a place to live!
--Oh, yes, I'd be happy to.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
Now then, you basically
have three options.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
You can build a home,
you can also purchase

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
an existing residence,
or you have the choice

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
of renting from an owner.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
Oh! I haven't decided that yet!

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
All right. Well, I'm highly
qualified as both an architect

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
and a real estate agent,
so I'm up for anything.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
So cool!

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
Here, take my card.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
Ooh! So classy!

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
Uh, let's take a look here.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're a Demon Lord?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. That, too.
I'm quite versatile.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] So, he's like a Demon
Lord of real estate?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
You're awesome!
I'm so glad I met you!

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
First off, it would be
helpful if you could

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
describe to me what
sort of a home

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
you might be
interested in having.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Sure! Um, I think...

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
I want to live in a cute
and cozy little cottage!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I'm not sure a cottage
could accommodate your size.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
I fully intend to
respect your wishes,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
but a simple design
such as this one

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
leaves a lot to be desired
in terms of security.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.099 position:50% align:center
If Heroes invaded,
you'd be done for.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
Heroes?

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me
there are even more

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
of those bullies out there?

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
Oh, they're everywhere, and yes,
they're all that ridiculous.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
Do they have to be so cringey?

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
While hunters concern
themselves with catching

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
non-human targets,

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
Heroes tend to be
bloodthirsty killing machines.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
They steal, pillage, and
sometimes they may even

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
take part in political coups.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
It would take a whole
day to try and list off

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
all their crimes.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
Ah, well.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose
a lecture about Heroes

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
is terribly relevant.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
So, shall we commence
with a tour?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
What are we going
to tour, exactly?

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
Oh, just a dwelling.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
It's something that Heroes
might call a dungeon.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can call it home.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What's that say?

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Whoa. It's ginormous!

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
Is this really all one building?

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
It's a 27-year-old structure
that's been designed

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
to resemble the temples
of ancient times.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second.
How did we get here?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
With a rudimentary
teleportation spell.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
This place was designed
for powerful inhabitants,

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
and features multiple
Hero-proofing measures.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
The owner only recently
made the decision

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
to sell the place.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
If you find it to your liking,

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
you'll need to make
an offer quickly.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I dunno.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
It seems like it's
way too big for me.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Dragons require larger spaces.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
This is an awful lot
of house for just little

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
old me, ya know?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
I woul d suggest that you
watch where you step, Letty.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
If you activate a trap...

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[LETTY screaming]

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
...there's a chance you may die.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
Suppose I should've
mentioned that before.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
What the heck is wrong
with this place, Dearia?!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
It's a dungeon with
anti-Hero traps.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
There are four levels total.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
The topmost floor
is aboveground,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
and the other three are
located below the surface.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
And in order to protect the
living quarters at the top,

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
the rest of the structure
has been optimized

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
with traps, to drop any
would-be intruders

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
further and further underground.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
Most Heroes who've entered
this home have died

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
violently within.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
Since we're here,
perhaps we should explore

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
the dungeon for a bit.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
Or we could leave.

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
Oh? But I'm quite proficient
at resurrection spells.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I prefer not
dying, thanks.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
First, we must open this door.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
If you simply place
the correct shape

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
into this depression...

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
Oh, sweet. This'll be easy!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
...there's a chance you may die.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Why, though...!

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
[LETTY groans]

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
You're wonderfully obedient.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Thank you, I guess.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
How does this one work?

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Look there.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
If you light up all of those
in the correct order,

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
it causes a drawbridge
to open up.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Yeah right, he's
trying to trap me again!

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm smarter than that!

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
Obedient, my tail!

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
You baffle me.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
Did I not tell you to light
them in the correct order?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
You're such a jerk!

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
Let's take a look
at the third basement.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second, Dearia...

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
[LETTY whimpers]

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yells]

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yells]

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] We reached
the bottom so quickly.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
Though that last drop
was a surprise.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hey, listen.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Do you think we could
take a breather, please?

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
I agree. A break is in order.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
Luckily, there's a
healing spring right here.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] This is awesome,
but couldn't a Hero use it

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
to heal their injuries, too?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry,
the sensors pick up on

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
any unfamiliar entities
and flush them away.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
This house hates me!

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
Well, what did you think?

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
So, that's how
dead goldfish feel.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
Where does that drain go?

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
You'll find certain questions in
life are best left unanswered.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yikes!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
So those are all the anti-Hero
safety features covered.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
Now, for the obstacle
course to get back up top.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
Give it your best try!

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Really?

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
Better than going back
the way we came, though.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
Here I go!

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
--One question.
--Uh-huh?

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Are you choosing
not to fly out of modesty?

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yeah, modesty.

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER A]
Ugh, which way to the exit?

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
Hm? Hey guys,
take a look up there!

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
That's a dragon!
It's scaling the wall!

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER C] Aww, sweet!
Rare mats for days!

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
Don't let it get away!

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me!

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Stop right there.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
You will not interfere
with his climb.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
Who is this guy?

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURER A]
Why's an elf here?

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
Don't know, don't care.
Let's take him down!

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
That'll show ya!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
I believe I told you...

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
...that you shouldn't interfere.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
Don't you look down, Letty.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
[ADVENTURERS yell]

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
Just keep your eyes closed.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
You're nearly there!

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.707 position:50% align:center
Ah, I finally got out
of that place!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
A most excellent effort.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia!

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Letty.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
I must say, I'm very impressed.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
Wow, that means so much!

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Shall we sign the papers?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but no thanks.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I just don't think
I could live in a house

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
that's designed to kill me.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] After that tour,
poor Letty's muscles were sore

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
for days on end.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ow, it really hurts.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
I do hope you'll be
all right, Letty.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm fine.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
My muscles are feeling a lot
less sore now, at least.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
But I really don't
want to deal with

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
any more crazy traps.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Noted.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you'll be more
excited about seeing

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
the next property, then.
It doesn't have any traps.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
That's good to hear.
So, what's it like?

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
Let me see, uh, how do I put it?

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
Heroes will never
bother you there.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect bachelor pad.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
I'm certain that
if you moved in,

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
you'd never feel lonely again.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
Wow!
That's totally perfect for me!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Despite having been
built over 200 years ago,

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
the place still has
plenty of life left in it.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
It does need repairs, though.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
That's fine!
I just wanna go check it out!

00:12:56.276 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
You know, I gotta admit,
it looks a little haunted to me.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
It is haunted.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
'Kay, next house!

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Don't be hasty.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
At least take a brief tour
before you write it off.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
But... But it's scary!

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Why would I want
a haunted mansion?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
Just think of it
as a fixer-upper.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Slow down!

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
So when you use
the word "haunted,"

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
--you mean, like...?
--With ghosts.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
I was hoping that might
just be real estate jargon.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I'm simply
providing disclosures.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What are "disclosures"?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] If the property
has certain defects,

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
the seller is required
to make the buyer

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
aware of them.

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Okay, and being haunted
is one of those things, right?

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Correct. Also...

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
Also?

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
Everyone has to die sometime.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wait, huh?!

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Oh, and exorcisms won't work.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Uh...

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Now, I'd like you
to get a sense of the place.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
So we'll both be
staying the night here.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
I went ahead and took
the liberty of preparing

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
a bed for you.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
So extra!

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
Oh, and here.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
Please use this vacuum
cleaner if you run

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
Into any trouble.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry, what do you mean,
"run into trouble"?

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
You simply press R
to activate the Strobulb.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
The what?

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] You're also going
to need this ink ribbon

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
as well as this typewriter.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
How are those gonna help me?

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
Just look it up.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm so confused!

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
Great. No match.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.274 position:50% align:center
I wish I had a lamp.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Letty? I'll be staying
in the next room over

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
if you need something.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hey, don't leave!

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Sweet dreams.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to have
sweet dreams in here?!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
Please stay with me!

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:17.042 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
I neglected to give
you something.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
These are healing items.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Could you please
knock next time?!

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
It's so dark and scary!

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Come on, sun!

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and rise already!

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
Huh? It was just a painting.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
That startled me.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
Nope, not just a painting!

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
Dearia! Help me!

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
Where is he?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
What happened to the door?

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
And where is the next room over?

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
This is the worst!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
Crap, something's following me.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
I can feel it.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
[LETTY screams]

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
A ghost! A real ghost!

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's weird.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Why did the camera
change to first-person?

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
Now it's even scarier!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
And it's so dark.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to see anything?

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
--[GHOST A] Excuse me.
--[LETTY] Yes?

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
[GHOST A]
Take this.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Oh, thank you.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
That was lucky!
I've got a light!

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Who gave it to me?

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
You know what?
Let's not address that.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
No thoughts, head empty!

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
I just gotta find Dearia.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
Man, it's so dark in here...

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
Somebody definitely
died in there!

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
Well, I know I'm
not going that way.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
Should I turn around?

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
[yells] More ghosts!

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't have a choice!

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
[GHOUL A]
Huh?

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.213 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Letty? Letty?

00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
Please wake up.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
[GHOUL B]
Rise and shine.

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[GHOUL A]
Fainted again.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to think
this may all have been

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
too much for him.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL laughs]

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
This is the way we normally
welcome our visitors!

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
I have to say, I would
never have expected

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
a dragon to be so delicate.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What? So you were welcoming me?

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Ah yes, good morning, Letty.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
Here is the owner.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
This property belongs
to Lord Samuel.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
He was the one who
reigned over these lands

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
nearly 200 years ago.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
When I told him that
I would be bringing you

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
to look at the property,

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
he pulled out all
the stops to make it

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
a fun experience.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
These spirits are
his loyal retainers.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
They wanted to
organize a little scare

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
for your enjoyment.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Would've preferred
a gift basket.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
This place would
make a lovely home.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
It's prime real estate.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Not to be rude,
but I don't really get

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
what's prime here.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
The lack of Heroes,
for starters.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
The artifacts in here
are of no value to them,

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
so they don't bother
approaching.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
The coins are worthless,
the potions are expired,

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
and the swords and other
weapons are all broken.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
Besides, wraiths
and ghouls never drop

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
anything valuable
when they're killed,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
so it would be
foolish for a Hero

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
to waste their time
trying to get in.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
And then, secondly,
the ghosts constantly keep

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
a vigilant watch over
the entire property,

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
so you'll never have
to worry about security

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
or being lonely.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center
Uh, that's really creepy.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL]
Hmm.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
Well, I can always rally
my retainers and leave

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
if that suits you more.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
Uh, you don't have to...

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL]
Oh, it's quite all right.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
We'll stay in our graves
in the backyard,

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
and you can simply
let us know whenever

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
you need us.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Great, there's a graveyard, too?

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
And there's also a special.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
If you purchase today,
all the ghouls

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
who are squatting
here will remain!

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
--Bone buddies! Yay!
--[LETTY] Yeah, no!

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yells]
Hey, stop it! Put me down!

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
That does bring back memories.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make me
wanna buy your house!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL]
Yes, it certainly does.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
The first time we met,
back when blood

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
still flowed in my veins,
you traveled

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
with a different dragon, yes?

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
I'd say that's probably
why I have a bit

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
of a soft spot for dragons.

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL laughs]
A Demon Lord with a soft spot!

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Um, Dearia?

00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
Little help over here?

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Oh, goodness.

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
Give me just a moment, please.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
Look. Can I be honest with you?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.710 position:50% align:center
I feel like I should pick
a place where it's easier

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
for me to relax,
and I can't really do that

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
with dead people around, so...

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
[GHOULS]
Aww...

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
That's perfectly understandable.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
I'll search for houses that
the dead wouldn't dare haunt.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Maybe try somewhere
that the living would want

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
to haunt instead.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL chuckles]

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Your mansion's nice and all,
but it's not for me.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
No, it's all right.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
Everyone deserves to find
a home that's right for them.

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
Well, g'bye.

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL]
Oh, and Sir Dragon?

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hm?

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
[SAMUEL]
Travel safely!

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Thanks!

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
[LETTY laughs]

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
That Lord Samuel is a
really scary-looking guy,

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
but he's so cool!
I like him!

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
As do I.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
In life, he was double-crossed
by a close friend

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
and driven away
from his own lands.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
He and his hundred
retainers committed suicide.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
They were then
reborn as wraiths,

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
who terrorized and slaughtered
everyone who lived there.

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Quite inspirational.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Letty decided
he didn't care for wraiths.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.220 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] I'm too scared
to get up and pee!

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.024 position:50% align:center
So, you'd like to avoid
haunted properties?

00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:21.026 position:50% align:center
Well, if the previous
resident met their demise

00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:23.737 position:50% align:center
while in the home,
the unit will be considered

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.489 position:50% align:center
a "stigmatized property,"
and real estate agents

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:28.408 position:50% align:center
are required to share
this information

00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:30.035 position:50% align:center
with potential buyers.

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:32.579 position:50% align:center
[SLIME A] I wish they would've
mentioned the ghost!

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:34.873 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] It's called a
"duty to disclose."

00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:36.875 position:50% align:center
Interestingly, in countries
where old housing

00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.502 position:50% align:center
is abundant, prospective
buyers are unconcerned

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
with the previous
owner's manner of death,

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.298 position:50% align:center
and may even prefer
to live in residences

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:44.674 position:50% align:center
that are haunted.

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.552 position:50% align:center
Next episode is "My First Home."
