If I don't get out of here,

what are they planning
to do to me?

I can't let that happen!

a way to escape!

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:37.950 position:50% align:center
I know, Pip.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.077 position:50% align:center
But I--

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.203 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
But I should still try!

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
That hurt!

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.962 position:50% align:center

You can turn me into
weapons and sell me off,

The heck are you talking about?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
Looks like we got ourselves
another clueless newbie, huh?

[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.819 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] Huh?
What's the matter, little guy?

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:14.987 position:50% align:center
You feeling hungry?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
Um, hi.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.323 position:50% align:center
Can you please
get us out of here?

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.701 position:50% align:center
I was in the middle
of a big journey!

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
Now I can't find my friend,

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
and I really don't
wanna get turned into

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.123 position:50% align:center
cool fighting equipment.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.250 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you've
got problems, all right.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:31.962 position:50% align:center
You can leave whenever.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.883 position:50% align:center
You should have some tea
before you take off, though.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
I can introduce you to everyone.

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
To "everyone," huh?

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
How many prisoners
do they have here?

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.602 position:50% align:center
I bet the leader's really scary!

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.605 position:50% align:center
If you punks step outta line,
I'll tear ya to pieces!

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[PRISONERS]
Sir!

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.191 position:50% align:center

Hey. We got us some new blood.

[PRISONERS]
Hey, newbie! Come on in!

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.450 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What kind of prison is this?!

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
The dog guy is Daniel.

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
Kobold, not werewolf.

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
These are the Skeleton Bros.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.041 position:50% align:center
What's up, buddy!

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.919 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] And check out this
devastating beauty here.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
Our very own Madonna.

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
The lovely Cassandra!

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.927 position:50% align:center
Oh, you don't have to make
such a fuss, you know.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
But here's a headshot
if you want one.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
Um... Thank you.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.349 position:50% align:center
And you can call me Steve.
Just Steve.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.893 position:50% align:center
And this is, uh, everybody else.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.229 position:50% align:center
[PRISONERS chattering]

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
Wanna stick around
and hang with us for a bit?

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
Um, sure.

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] So all of you are
down here because

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.195 position:50% align:center
you were captured?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.363 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
Yup.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
Have you ever tried to get away?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.783 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
Oh, no.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.077 position:50% align:center
Actually, this dungeon is
part of a fighting arena

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
that's owned by some
old human Margrave.

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:48.497 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.957 position:50% align:center
The atmosphere's chill.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
No hunters. No salesmen.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.379 position:50% align:center
We do get Heroes
every now and then.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.964 position:50% align:center
Do I smell glory?

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.216 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] But the jailers
take care of them for us.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.218 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's way
easier to stay in.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.638 position:50% align:center
We're free to hang out
with each other anytime,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
and the food's not half bad.

00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:07.975 position:50% align:center
That sounds great,
but at the end of the day,

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.393 position:50% align:center
it's still a prison!

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
Even if it seems like they're
treating you okay now,

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.522 position:50% align:center
something bad is
definitely gonna happen!

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
I bet you'll change your
mind after you see

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
the amenities they have in here.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.116 position:50% align:center
We have this enormous
bath to keep us clean,

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
complete with jacuzzi jets!

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:29.246 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] Not to mention all
the latest fitness equipment

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
so we can stay in shape.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:35.169 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] And a state-of-the-art
theater... for entertainment!

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:37.963 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's sweet! [gasps]

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50% align:center
Wait, they probably only
have all that cool stuff here

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
so you won't try to leave!

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, our
rooms are literal jail cells!

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:45.262 position:50% align:center
Well, actually...

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Everyone's welcome to
decorate their quarters.

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Here's where Cass lives.

00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
That looks like a
full-blown remodel!

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.982 position:50% align:center
We call this the Queen's
Chamber, for obvious reasons,

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
so remember to bow down
when you walk by, yeah?

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.571 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't wanna get cursed.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
I guess that about does
it for the dungeon tour.

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
You should start thinking
about your decorations.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
Oh, I dunno, Steve. I'm not--

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.916 position:50% align:center
The jailers can get you
whatever mats you need.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
They like to play cards with us.

00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:19.755 position:50% align:center
Oh! You're back!

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Were they here the whole time?!

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
All right, guys.
It's time to get to work.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
The first round is the
skeletons versus the dragon.

00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get ready!

What work is he talking about?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.774 position:50% align:center
I told you this is
an arena, right?

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center

Hm?

who've brought countless
foes to their doom!

because they're already dead!

be facing a new challenger!

he'll have you
quaking with terror!

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
Give it up for the Red Dragon!

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.405 position:50% align:center
Can the Skeleton Brothers
hold it together against

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
the devastating strength
of his fire breath?

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center

can't actually breathe fire!

as many times as we want!

I guess it's probably fine.

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
It's all according
to the script.

00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
So, you have shows
like this every day?

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.892 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's once every three days.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
We always base the outcome
on the betting odds,

00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
so the house earns a
healthy profit every time.

00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
You lose today.

[KOBRA]
Got it!

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] The Margrave makes a
killing from these things,

00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:49.071 position:50% align:center
and as long as he's happy,
we get the star treatment.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.365 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Oh. That makes sense.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
Yeah, humans usually
just cause us trouble,

00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
but I'd say this is a pretty
good way to coexist.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.500 position:50% align:center
That sounds great!

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.087 position:50% align:center
Hey, sorry about that, Pip.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.922 position:50% align:center
Your Papa had to do some work!

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
Where are you,
my precious child?!

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
Where did you go?
Please come to Papa!

Are you here?

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
Here, maybe?

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
In here?

00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:23.647 position:50% align:center
He's gone.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.482 position:50% align:center

[LETTY]
Pip! You're safe!

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.993 position:50% align:center
He was in the drainage ditch.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.953 position:50% align:center
I found him and put
him in the ice room.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.247 position:50% align:center
Sure loves the cold, doesn't he?

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, mister!

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.709 position:50% align:center
You saved my son's life!

Ah, just doing my job.

00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.714 position:50% align:center
I took the liberty of ordering
some snow for him, too.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.299 position:50% align:center
Keep an eye on him from now on.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
Right! Thanks!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.261 position:50% align:center

I never knew life
could be like this.

up to right now.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
He must be looking all over.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:11.028 position:50% align:center

Dearia was not looking.

I'm out--

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
[TAVERN B] Amazing!
He's won 12 matches now!

00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
You really know
how to drink, Elf!

00:10:21.163 --> 00:10:22.873 position:50% align:center
But I'm up next.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.584 position:50% align:center
Loser foots the bill
for the booze.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.212 position:50% align:center
You still okay with those rules?

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

[NARRATOR]
Nor was he worried.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Ten days after Letty
came to the arena...

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:53.237 position:50% align:center
Man, they really
worked us to the bone!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
I'm dead-tired!

00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:56.323 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
Great job today.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.076 position:50% align:center
The crowd's been getting bigger
since you showed up here.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.913 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Okay, where's Dearia?

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
Why the long face?

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.958 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT]
Papa!

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:10.671 position:50% align:center
Good work out there.
He behaved the entire time.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.631 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for babysitting!

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.800 position:50% align:center
My pleasure.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] I really thought
Dearia would've found me

00:11:16.552 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
by the second or third day.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.099 position:50% align:center
I guess magic can't
do everything.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.517 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he tried.

[GUARD A]
Guys! We have news!

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.564 position:50% align:center
And it's about the Margrave.

Gather round, all!

00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:32.818 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
The Margrave is dead?

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hmm?!

00:11:35.112 --> 00:11:36.530 position:50% align:center
Well, how's that affect us?

00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:40.117 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean, humans kick
the bucket all the time.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.702 position:50% align:center
What's the big deal
about this one?

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
That just means the arena
gets a new owner, right?

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
How I wish that were all it was.

00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
You see, he left it
to his eldest son,

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
who wishes to close
it down immediately.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.298 position:50% align:center
He thinks it's barbaric.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:59.720 position:50% align:center
And since the arena's
closing, you'll all be killed.

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.305 position:50% align:center
Wait, he's just gonna
kill everybody?

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:02.598 position:50% align:center
But why would he do that?

00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:06.602 position:50% align:center
Is this my fault?

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
He must've found out that
I was pocketing our profits

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.898 position:50% align:center
to build a rotating theatre.

00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:12.608 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because we
fudged the numbers

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.860 position:50% align:center
in our favor to
score extra cash?

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
You what?

00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:18.030 position:50% align:center
Or because we went on
that nice vacation?

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.740 position:50% align:center
Those were such fun times!

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:23.619 position:50% align:center
You have that many reasons?

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:24.870 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
No.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.163 position:50% align:center
They just don't want you
to take revenge on them

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.040 position:50% align:center
for capturing you.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
they still don't have a clue.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
So we're safe!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.336 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
They were in on it?

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
I mean, they enslaved all of us
and then we scammed them.

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
I say that makes us even.

00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Uh, sure?

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
Thing is, we've got more
than that to worry about.

00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't even know
about this if we hadn't

00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
just heard it from the
Margrave's mercs outside.

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
Once they get all
the human workers out,

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
they'll come in
and kill you all.

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Wait, you mean
they're here already?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
How are we gonna survive this?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.612 position:50% align:center
No two weeks, huh? Brutal.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.614 position:50% align:center
All right.
We're gonna bust out.

Yes sir!

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.784 position:50% align:center
But how do we escape
if the mercenaries

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.370 position:50% align:center
are already right outside?
They'll see us!

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
That's easy.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.082 position:50% align:center
There's an ancient aqueduct
that runs underneath

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
the compound.

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
It connects to an old
well outside the walls.

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
The whole thing's too
old to be on a map.

00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:18.924 position:50% align:center
But just to make
absolutely sure they don't

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
figure out we're going that way,

00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
we'll have to keep
the humans distracted.

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
So we're gonna need a
dedicated team for that part.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Why would you pick me?!

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:31.687 position:50% align:center
Because you stand out.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.980 position:50% align:center
You're a dragon.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:34.565 position:50% align:center
I can't be part
of the plan though.

reach right in and kill 'em.

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.374 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.210 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll lay out the
box plan for you.

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
You get some porn.

00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:23.507 position:50% align:center
Set it out, and then hide
and wait for them to take it.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
That's when you sneak up
behind them, and strike!

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
[MERC screams]

00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:31.598 position:50% align:center
Is it really that easy?

00:15:31.682 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
Trust me, it is.

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
Try it on those guys.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
They must be around
here somewhere.

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Okay.

00:15:43.402 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
First I get close to them,
then set the book down.

00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Wait. How do I drop
the book without them seeing?

00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:56.123 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, did I forget
a step or something?

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.541 position:50% align:center
I can't see where I am!

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
[MERC E]
The walls are closing in!

00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What are we running from?

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:08.177 position:50% align:center
Don't leave me behind!

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.262 position:50% align:center
[MERC G] Dammit!
I think we hit a dead end!

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.847 position:50% align:center
This door won't open!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.433 position:50% align:center
[MERC G] Crap! I didn't
know there were traps!

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.851 position:50% align:center
[ALL yell]

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:18.854 position:50% align:center
That really hurt.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
What just happened?

00:16:20.564 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
Ah! Are you guys okay?

00:16:22.858 --> 00:16:24.610 position:50% align:center
Whoa, I'm a murderer.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
[MERC H]
What was that noise?

00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:28.280 position:50% align:center
This is not good!
Just how many of them are there?

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
We found ya!

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.283 position:50% align:center
--What to do?
--[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:35.204 position:50% align:center
No, Pip!
Please don't scream in here!

00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:37.164 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT screams]

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.875 position:50% align:center
[MERCS yelling]

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
[MERC H]
It's driving me insane!

00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:52.221 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL]
You can go home now, boys.

00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
We-- We should run!

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
[MERC I]
This ain't over!

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.187 position:50% align:center
I figured that the echo
would be unbearable

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
in a place like this.

00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:03.607 position:50% align:center
That sound came from your child?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
Well, our cover's definitely
been blown by now.

00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:17:07.903 --> 00:17:10.239 position:50% align:center
Hang on, where's Cassandra?

00:17:10.322 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
Oh, she's right over there.

00:17:13.242 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
[CASSANDRA]
Last riddle!

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
Your unit's allotment
of beer was stolen by

00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:19.081 position:50% align:center
one of your companions
and sold away!

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:22.209 position:50% align:center
Tell me, who pilfered
all that alcohol?

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Here's a hint.

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
The culprit is wearing
brand-new gear.

00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:28.799 position:50% align:center
[MERC K]
I knew it was you!

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.551 position:50% align:center
[MERC J]
That beer was for all of us!

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:31.635 position:50% align:center
You suck!

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
[CASSANDRA laughing]

00:17:35.514 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
[STEVE] She's using her
riddles to trick the mercs

00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:39.268 position:50% align:center
into fighting each other.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Scary!

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
Don't look that way, Pip.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.273 position:50% align:center
Well, let's keep moving.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.524 position:50% align:center
Um, right!

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.570 position:50% align:center
[MERC M]
Aha! Found them!

00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:50.863 position:50% align:center
[MERCS]
Gotcha!

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
And showtime.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:58.245 position:50% align:center
Horse Kick!

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:02.583 position:50% align:center
Oops. You lose.

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:06.295 position:50% align:center
[MERC N]
The hell is this place?

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:07.838 position:50% align:center
[MERC O]
It's giving me the creeps.

00:18:13.177 --> 00:18:14.136 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
[MERC yelling]

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
[MERC P]
Where are they?

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
--[MERC Q] That way!
--[MERC P] No, this way!

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
The others have probably
found their way

00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
outta here by now.

00:18:28.317 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
Yes, we bought them
more than enough time.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.321 position:50% align:center
Now it's our turn to escape.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.325 position:50% align:center
This way.

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.161 position:50% align:center
[MERCS]
Ha!

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.580 position:50% align:center
You think we'd let
you monsters get away?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
They've got us surrounded!

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:48.629 position:50% align:center
[MERC C] I have to admit, that
was a cute little diversion.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:51.298 position:50% align:center
[MERC B] But now there's
nowhere left to run!

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:54.301 position:50% align:center
[MERC C] Right, and as soon
as we drag you all out of here

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
kicking and screaming...

00:18:57.304 --> 00:18:59.765 position:50% align:center
...we'll turn you into all
kinds of awesome gear and--!

00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia!

00:19:08.232 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
You seem to be getting
by all right. Mostly.

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
You found me!

00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:14.780 position:50% align:center
Have you been looking
for me the whole time?

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:16.073 position:50% align:center
Oh, absolutely not.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
I heard you'd been brought here,

00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
but I figured it would be
a better character-building

00:19:20.953 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
opportunity if I let you
solve your own problems

00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
for once.

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.625 position:50% align:center
That's why I decided to bide
my time and let the situation

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.669 position:50% align:center
play out from afar.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:30.504 position:50% align:center
I'm here about something else.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.256 position:50% align:center
You're a jerk!

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.799 position:50% align:center
Who's this? Friend of yours?

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
[CASSANDRA]
He's very handsome.

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
My name is Dearia.

00:19:37.553 --> 00:19:39.555 position:50% align:center
Thank you all for
looking out for Letty.

00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:40.848 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, no worries!

00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
I heard there were
groups of men coming

00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.394 position:50% align:center
to slaughter nonhumans,
so I came to assist you.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:46.812 position:50% align:center
Though, now that I've arrived,

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.815 position:50% align:center
I can see that you've got
everything under control.

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
Now all we have to do
is get out safely!

00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:56.822 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Yes, but first, I'm
going to erase the memories

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
of these guards so
they won't follow us.

00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Magic really is convenient.

00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:05.289 position:50% align:center
[SKELETONS]
Best of luck, dudes! See ya!

00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy you guys are okay!

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:13.130 position:50% align:center
[STEVE]
We're still missing a few.

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Sorry to make you wait!

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
The guards!

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.598 position:50% align:center
It took you guys that long
to deliver your resignations?

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:26.185 position:50% align:center
It did take a while
to liberate everything

00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
from the storerooms, though.

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:30.314 position:50% align:center
Sweet! Nice going!

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
[chattering]

00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:36.278 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
So, what'll your next move be?

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
I dunno yet,
but we'll figure it out.

00:20:38.739 --> 00:20:41.325 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should try and
hack it as a traveling circus.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
They sure are
a tight-knit group.

00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, totally.
--[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
If you wanted to stay with them,

00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:52.336 position:50% align:center
it might be an
ideal setup for you.

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I
think I'll pass.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.340 position:50% align:center
I mean, who knows
what I would have to do

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:57.925 position:50% align:center
in a circus.

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.177 position:50% align:center
Ah. Understood.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.305 position:50% align:center
Still, I learned
a lot from them.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
It makes no difference
to them who, what,

00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:07.059 position:50% align:center
or where they are,

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center
because as long as
they're all together,

00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
they'll always be at home.

00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
Papa!

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.943 position:50% align:center
And now, I know that even
if it takes me a while,

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
I can have something like
that for me and my family

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.321 position:50% align:center
one day, too.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
That's a nice thought.

00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:26.495 position:50% align:center
Thanks for everything, you guys!

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:34.545 position:50% align:center
So, uh, I didn't hear from
you for like ten days.

00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:36.797 position:50% align:center
What were you doing
all that time, anyway?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.257 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Nothing, really.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
On my way here--

00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:42.553 position:50% align:center
Ah! Please don't hurt me!

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
I visited the local lords
and made sure they knew

00:21:45.097 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
about the many crimes
of the Margrave

00:21:46.807 --> 00:21:48.934 position:50% align:center
who's now in power.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
So I'm sure dealing
with the combat arena

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
will be the least of his
troubles from now on.

00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
Don't tell, all right?

00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:56.942 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.237 position:50% align:center
You've got so many
human friends, Dearia!

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.321 position:50% align:center
It's really handy!

00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:03.282 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Only work contacts, of course.

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.701 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] That's the Dark Lord
of Real Estate for ya!

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
You're so cool!

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50% align:center
Now, Veranda versus balcony.

00:23:39.837 --> 00:23:41.088 position:50% align:center
What's the difference?

00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
A veranda has a roof,
while a balcony does not.

00:23:44.675 --> 00:23:46.885 position:50% align:center
