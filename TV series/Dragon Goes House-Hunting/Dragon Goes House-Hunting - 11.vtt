My, it's so lovely out.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.032 position:50% align:center
--[DEARIA] How is this?
--Oh, wow! It looks perfect!

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.534 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
You seem to have slept well.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:01:59.869 position:50% align:center
Indeed I did!

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.872 position:50% align:center
I have been on the run
for several days now.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.916 position:50% align:center
So I'm quite accustomed
to camping out.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.379 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I'm not so sure I would
refer to that as "camping."

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
This satchel is quite handy.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.884 position:50% align:center
By the way...

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.471 position:50% align:center
Why has Letty been acting
so worked up today?

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.099 position:50% align:center
Is it an upset stomach, perhaps?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
Wait, I know!

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
You lay eggs every
morning, don't you!

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50% align:center
Practice your Lamaze breathing!

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm a boy!

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50% align:center
Actually, it's all because
I asked him to make

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.567 position:50% align:center
a decision regarding
which property

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.193 position:50% align:center
he'd like to view next.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center
And he's having
a hard time of it?

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
Kinda, yeah.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
I've always let Dearia handle
this stuff until now.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
Let's just leave it to chance.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.954 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Come now, drummox!

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
You are Piyovelt's father,
are you not?

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.334 position:50% align:center
And you can't even
pick out a nice place

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
to live?

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
Can't you be a better
role model for him?

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
I mean, at the very least,
you could try not

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
to be such a complete
and utter garbage pile!

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center

I am most pleased to make
your acquaintance,

Red Dragon.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
I have come here on
behalf of the NHIRS.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
What seems to be the problem?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
I do hope that you're all right!

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
I believe he's gone into shock.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
Please allow me
to resurrect you!

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Nah, it's cool. I'm alive.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
Again, I'm honored to meet you.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
You see, I'm employed
as a tax counselor

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
with the Non-Human
Internal Revenue Service.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
You may call me Nashim.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
Our records show that
you have some unpaid

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
income taxes for this past year,

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
so I've come here today
to speak with you.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
Um, okay?

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM] You moved out
of your family's home,

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50% align:center
so you can't be their dependent,
which means you pay income tax.

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
There's also a fixed asset
tax you're required

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
to pay if you possess property.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
Additionally, if you've taken
out a home loan, then...

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I get it! This is a spell!

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
It's not a spell;
you're just stupid.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
When a member of a
high-ranking species

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
becomes independent,
the government requires

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
an annual report for
income tax purposes.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
It seems we have yet
to receive your paperwork.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
Uh, my tax paperwork?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
How clueless are you?

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
Everyone pays a bit of their
income to the government.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
That's what taxes are.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
You need to report
how much you earned

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
over the past year
to determine the amount

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
you're supposed to pay, drummox.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
What? Dragons too?

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
No one told me that
dragons paid taxes!

to buy a house?

Could it be?!

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
Do forgive me.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
Please don't let my presence
affect your conversation at all.

a haunted statue.

[NASHIM]
I can't ignore that either.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, there's a traveling
branch of the NHIRS

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
tax office that's
not too far away.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
So, would you like
to go and file there?

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
Surely, you wouldn't
want to be found guilty

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
of tax evasion, now, would you?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.024 position:50% align:center
It is a crime.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
on this form that are
marked "required."

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
This is just so we have
your name, species,

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
and occupation.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
Occupation?

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
Oh, but I assume most of
your income comes from

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
raiding villages
or slaying heroes,

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
so you can simply put down
"self-employed" there.

Uh, perhaps it's better
if we move on.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
You have two young children,
do you not?

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
Wait, two?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! You've got it all wrong!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
The bird's mine, but--

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
I must admit, I'm a bit jealous!

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
She's wise, beautiful,
and quite convincing

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
at taking a human form.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
Pardon?

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
I am a human!

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
Flesh-and-blood,
you insolent moron!

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM]
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What?

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
It's kind of a
complicated situation.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM]
Oh!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
I understand, you must be
saving her for dinner, then!

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna eat her,
dude, just drop it!

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM] There, that should
be the last of your forms.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
Someday, when you're
a proud homeowner,

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
do come back here
to take care of your

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
property taxes with us!

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay. I'll, uh, do that.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
Ah, and while we're
on the subject...

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
You should also declare
that enormous house

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
you built a while back, Letty.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot that!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
How lucky you remembered, sir.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
I gave it away to somebody
right after I built it, though.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
I see. That shouldn't
be a problem at all.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
It simply means that
we'll have to account

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
for a capital gains deduction.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
What's a capital deduction?

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.347 position:50% align:center
I've got all the
necessary contracts.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
Total cost after
property and agency fees,

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
plus building expenses.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM]
Ah, very good.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
Might I take a look at
the form for the property

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
transfer tax?

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] That was paid before
the sale contract was closed.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM] Yes, but depreciation
costs do not apply

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
for a private residence,
meaning...

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] There's no property
acquisition tax within range

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
of the royal capital.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM] That would mean
that the consumption tax

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
would be covered
by the other party.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Well, these
are the final numbers.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
Would you like to see?

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
[NASHIM]
That's all right.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
We can have him sign later.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Sounds reasonable.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
How pitiful.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
were that feeble.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT]
Papa!

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Piyovelt.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
What do you say we lend
your dear father a hand?

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Acquisition. Depreciation.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Letty? Letty, wake up.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT]
Papa!

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
[LETTY screams]

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
Enough dawdling, drummox!

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
They've finished
preparing your tax forms.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
Oh, good. Thanks a lot, Nell.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Also, look at this.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Our next destination.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
--[PIPBERT squeaks]
--[LETTY] Huh?!

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Leaving it to you
would've taken an eternity,

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
so I decided to let your son
choose a home to tour.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
They say a picture's worth
a thousand words, you know.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh, you two!
This means so much to me!

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
That was enough to
bring you to tears?

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
Some dragon.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
This is the first and only
time that we're deciding

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
in your place!

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Next time, you'll have
to make your own choice!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
Y'know, I have a real good
feeling about this one!

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
Hey!
This means pretty soon,

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
I won't have to check the
box that says "unhoused"!

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Indeed!

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
So where is the next property?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
In the royal capital's
old sewer system.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you non-humans
had your own royal capital.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
We don't.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
This is in the human
royal capital.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
Actually, Nell,
it's extremely close

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
to your previous home.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Unacceptable!

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I can't believe we're here.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
In the human city!

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Beneath it, actually.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
[NELL whining]

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:59.386 position:50% align:center
If my retainers had any idea
that their beloved princess

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
was creeping through the sewers!

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
No one would ever
suspect that a princess

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
and a dragon were
just below their feet.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
There's no need for
you to be nervous.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Well I am!

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
How could you be so
foolish and insensitive

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
as to bring me down here?

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
And you should've
noticed my apprehension

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:15.985 position:50% align:center
and refused to go.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I guess it must
have been the way he

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
presented the question.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
Shall we leave now,
or would it be better

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
to rest a bit first?

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] He never asked
where we should go!

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
That's right, he railroaded us!

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
Why would a dragon
choose to reside

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
in a place like this, anyway?

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Here we are.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Wow. It actually
looks kind of home-y!

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
In fairness, this property is
already a few centuries old,

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
but it was built by dwarves,
so it's sure to last

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
for a long time.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
Just a moment.

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
I know exactly where we are!

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Our kingdom has a
dungeon just like this.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
It's designed for
training Heroes!

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
You train Heroes?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I feel so betrayed!

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
Most human-non-human
exchanges happen

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
in dungeons, yes?

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
I suppose that's true.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
There are plenty of
monsters living here

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
for Heroes to spar with.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
I guess a lot of us do live
in dungeons, don't we.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I understand it now.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
Understand what?

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The kingdom
commissioned this dungeon

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
to be built by dwarves.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
Its intended purpose
was to provide a place

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
where Heroes could level
up and hone their skills.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
Then, numerous
non-humans were hired on

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.309 position:50% align:center
as live-in employees.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
These workers were
expected to play the part

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
of "enemies" for the Hero
trainees to encounter

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
in battle.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
That means, if you'd like
to take up residence here,

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
you'd need to become
a public servant.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
There'd be an interview
process, of course,

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
but since you're a dragon,

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
I imagine you'd have
a sporting chance at it.

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
Of course! Who would disagree?

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Why not here? It's not bad.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know.
I'm not really into fighting.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
[NELL] But you'd be getting
a home and a job,

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
all in one!

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Why don't we just
take a look at the property,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
for starters?

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'd like to, but what
if we run into a group

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
of Heroes or something?

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Don't worry your
head about that.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
The grounds are closed today.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Wow. This really
is a government facility.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
I've always dreamed about a
dungeon-crawling adventure!

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
Just leave everything to me!

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
We're gonna tour it,
not tear it apart, right?

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
The dungeon awaits!

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
Woohoo!

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
Well, somebody's enthusiastic.

off the beaten path.

Everyone knows that, drummox!

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
It's news to me.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
Didn't your parents' house
have any treasure boxes

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
inside of it?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
Well, no!

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
I mean, think about
how silly that sounds.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
Why would you leave
all your valuables

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
in the middle of your hallway?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.066 position:50% align:center
Indeed. That does seem
a little absurd.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
But you must've had a
mimic or two lying around!

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
No! I don't want those scary
things in my house!

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
Fine, then what about
containers that give you items

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
when you break them?

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
We store our stuff
in drawers, like normal!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center

[MAN B] But watch out
for mimics, got it!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
I'd say the dungeons
that Nell is imagining

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
are probably the product
of human superstition

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
and stereotypes.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
Oh! I get it now.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
So this place is what
humans think a dungeon

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
is like, huh?

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
Yes, precisely.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] There's no need
to be so disappointed, Nell.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.610 position:50% align:center
You can easily hire a
mimic for your own house.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
Are you able to start
tomorrow, by chance?

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
Due to heroes and their
insatiable greed,

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
there's been a significant
demand for in-home

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
theft prevention recently.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
Do look at this brochure.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
Wow, seriously?

When you find yourself a home,

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
I'll give you one as a
housewarming gift!

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
No, thanks! I'm good!

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
At any rate,

Well, I'd rather not fight him.

Nothing.

to go straight?

It's dungeon magic
