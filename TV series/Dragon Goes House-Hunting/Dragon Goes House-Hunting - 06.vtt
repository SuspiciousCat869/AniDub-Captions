[LETTY] See, I had all
that money saved up

And buy cold medicine, too!

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
And then, Pip needed
more snow to stay cool,

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.492 position:50% align:center

The market is always in need
of more dragons, Letty.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.214 position:50% align:center

They don't persecute anyone
based on their species

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.822 position:50% align:center
or nationality.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.657 position:50% align:center

popular trading spot.

[DEARIA] Some merchants carry
your typical adventurer's

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:25.706 position:50% align:center
fare of weapons,
defense items, and potions.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
While others offer
forbidden tomes,

illicit substances,

inventory is either stolen

or smuggled.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
So basically this place
is a wretched hive

Yes, I suppose it is.

That's a rather uncharitable
way to describe it, though.

In a crowded city like this one,

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center

find plenty of jobs.

How about a dragon hide?

If I had to guess,
I would say most of them

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.345 position:50% align:center
probably hit the "Steal"
button by accident.

00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I dissect you?

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
I'd rather you didn't!

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:38.352 position:50% align:center
You may not.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
What is it you'd like
him to do for you?

00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:41.897 position:50% align:center
Oh! Right.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.066 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I guess I got a
little carried away there.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.651 position:50% align:center
I just want you to come
with me really quick

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.903 position:50% align:center
so I can pretend that
I summoned you!

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Summoned me?

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
You mean, like, you say
something awesome,

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
and then the sky opens
up and I come out like

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:55.661 position:50% align:center
"whoosh" or whatever?

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no can do.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
It's fine, you don't have
to do anything fancy!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.835 position:50% align:center
I'll handle the theatrics.
You can just show up!

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:04.795 position:50% align:center
You see, I kinda promised
somebody I could

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:05.963 position:50% align:center
summon a beast.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
So you're actually
gonna try to summon

00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
something for us?

00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
All right then, loser.

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll see
what you come up with.

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:19.935 position:50% align:center
Ha! I hope you're prepared!

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.854 position:50% align:center
Now, Red Dragon!

00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.522 position:50% align:center
I call upon thee!

00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:34.992 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Rawr!

00:09:41.957 --> 00:09:43.125 position:50% align:center
He doesn't care!

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.710 position:50% align:center
Hey, is somebody cooking fish?

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
Smells good.

00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:47.171 position:50% align:center
Is that a real dragon?

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
Or is it just some guy
in a mascot suit?

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:50.841 position:50% align:center
[ROBERT]
How rude!

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.593 position:50% align:center
If you're not convinced,
then I'll have to show you

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
its legendary attack!

00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:57.598 position:50% align:center
Now, Dragon!
Unleash your Aura et Rabora!

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] No fair! That wasn't
part of the contract!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
Aura et-- what was it?

00:10:02.895 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to pull that off?!

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:06.857 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap, what do I do?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.615 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT yelling]

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:22.915 position:50% align:center
Um... What just happened?

00:10:22.998 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
Your son noticed that
you were in a bad spot,

00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:27.211 position:50% align:center
so he decided to lend
you his assistance.

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.045 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.339 position:50% align:center
Thanks a million, Pip!

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:33.592 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.469 position:50% align:center
He says, "You're too
powerful and cool

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.221 position:50% align:center
to waste your time
on those weaklings!

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
I took care of them for you!"

00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT giggles]

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:42.476 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Totally.

00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:47.773 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] We earned a lot
of money from that job!

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Yes.

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Typically, requests with that
kind of specificity yield

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:53.904 position:50% align:center
greater rewards than
the more general ones.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.073 position:50% align:center
Do you have any more
assignments for dragons?

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.908 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you betcha.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.536 position:50% align:center
This guy needs one
for a-- a magic test.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.790 position:50% align:center
Got a new technique
I've been working on,

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.500 position:50% align:center
and I figured this was
the perfect way to see

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.836 position:50% align:center
whether or not it'll
pierce dragon scales.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.379 position:50% align:center
Thank you for helping me today!

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
Wait a second, so if this
trick works, I'll be dead?!

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
[MAGE A]
Here we go!

00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
--[PIPBERT squeaks]
--[LETTY] Stop it!

00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but Papa's risking
life and limb at the moment.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.847 position:50% align:center
Let's be patient, all right?

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT squeaks]

00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
[MAGE A]
Come on, you gotta hold still!

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:25.978 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Oh, my! Hello there, handsome.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
Do you have a few minutes
to sit and chat with me?

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
Relax, I'm only teasing.

00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:34.653 position:50% align:center
Well, this is
a surprise, Lilith.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
It's been decades.

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
Your memory must
be failing you, milord.

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm hardly
a day over 20.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
Is that the look you're
going for these days, then?

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:45.664 position:50% align:center
Oh, please,
don't call it a "look."

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.125 position:50% align:center
Anyway, when I heard about
an elf wandering around

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
this marketplace with a dragon,

00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
I figured it might be you.

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
Are you house-hunting
for dragons again?

00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:55.591 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
As paid work, yes.

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:11:58.177 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you
should go over there

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.180 position:50% align:center
and help him out?

00:12:01.263 --> 00:12:04.308 position:50% align:center
I've cast a spell on him to
increase his magic defense.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
He'll be fine.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Hmm?

00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center
Something to say?

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:13.025 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.526 position:50% align:center
When you first became
the Dark Lord,

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
you didn't care
about anyone else,

00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:17.279 position:50% align:center
human or otherwise.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.615 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking about
how much you've changed.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Ah, my first
days as the Dark Lord.

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
I was different, then.

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:29.917 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS chattering]

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] That was the unluckiest
day of my entire life.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.049 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN A]
A new Dark Lord!

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS cheering]

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Today we've seen the birth
of a new Dark Lord--

00:12:54.066 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
I abdicate.

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Already?

00:12:56.068 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
But, wait, milord!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
You were hand-chosen by destiny!

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:00.239 position:50% align:center
You cannot refuse it!

00:13:00.322 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
--Then I'm resigning.
--No, you can't do that!

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:04.201 position:50% align:center
--Okay, I quit.
--You can't quit!

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
Then I'll step down.

00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.496 position:50% align:center
Call it what you want,
what's done is done!

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
Why do you choose your Dark Lord
with a random drawing?

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
Seems a little crude.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
You need not
question the method!

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.671 position:50% align:center
The "I Choose You"
was built to select

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
our first Dark Lord,
and it's worked ever since!

00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:19.842 position:50% align:center
This model is the Mark Eight!

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:22.094 position:50% align:center
No other device is
capable of assessing

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
the user's magic ability
to the necessary level

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:25.973 position:50% align:center
of precision!

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.267 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Not versions one through seven?

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
The very fact that
you tried your hand

00:13:30.227 --> 00:13:31.270 position:50% align:center
at this lottery...

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I've made a grave mistake.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
I only came here so
that I could pick up

00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
a book I ordered.

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.695 position:50% align:center
[TURTLE A]
Here's your participation prize.

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
Aw, I guess this means
I'm not the Dark Lord.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.409 position:50% align:center
Is it all right if
I give it a try, too?

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
Knock yourself out!

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:49.955 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I was seduced by
those silly pocket tissues.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.832 position:50% align:center
[TURTLE A]
My Lord!

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.710 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
All hail the great Dark Lord.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:56.587 position:50% align:center
You can call me Lilith, milord.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.173 position:50% align:center
I work as a traveling
fortune teller.

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.260 position:50% align:center
Would you like to
discover how successful

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
your reign will be?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
The Dark Lord gets
a discount, of course.

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.725 position:50% align:center
No, thank you.
I don't intend to reign.

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.143 position:50% align:center
[TURTLE A]
Huh?!

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
Surely you are
not willing to give up

00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
the title of "Dark Lord."

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
Why, you would have dominion
over every living thing!

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:21.612 position:50% align:center
Status, honor, and fortune
are yours for the taking!

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.155 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That may be the case.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.741 position:50% align:center
You'll find I don't care.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
If that's true, then what
is it that does interest you?

00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
For one thing,
I would like to know why

00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:33.999 position:50% align:center
a Ratatoskr has such
a dramatic overbite.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Who even cares about that?!

00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:37.878 position:50% align:center
Anyway, if you're
quite finished,

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
I think I'll take my leave now.

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY] Thank you all for
gathering here on this

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:53.977 position:50% align:center
auspicious day to
witness the crowning

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
of our new Dark Lord!

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center
I am Godfrey, Grand Chamberlain

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
of the Dark Lord Agency,

00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:00.984 position:50% align:center
and I will be presiding as
Master of Ceremonies

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
for this historic occasion.

00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
And now, without further ado!

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
Please welcome
the next Dark Lord!

00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
The Third of His Title!

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
Dearia Mel-- Marcean-- Or not?

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:21.088 position:50% align:center
No--!

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
We must find the
Dark Lord at once!

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
The Dark Lord's Palace.

00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
They only give tours
on public access days.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
What a rare opportunity.

00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:34.226 position:50% align:center
This impregnable
fortress was forged

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
by the magic of
the first Dark Lord!

00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:39.231 position:50% align:center
I might as well
look around, right?

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
I sense powerful, ancient
magic with every step I take.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.530 position:50% align:center
How fascinating!

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.657 position:50% align:center
I'm assuming these
symbols are probably charms

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.826 position:50% align:center
meant to keep intruders at bay.

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.661 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY]
Hurry!

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
He can't have made it
outside the palace walls

00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
in that amount of time!

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.290 position:50% align:center
We have to search
every nook and cranny

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
until he's found!

00:15:58.417 --> 00:15:59.293 position:50% align:center
[FROG A]
Hey! Sir!

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
Look! Right there!

00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:02.421 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.006 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY]
My Lord!

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.550 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
One of them's still unfinished.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
But what's missing?

00:16:08.427 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
This, perhaps?

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:11.430 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY]
Wait!

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Yes?

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY] Why did we suddenly
end up outside of the palace?

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:21.148 position:50% align:center
[FROG A] It seems the Dark
Lord must've activated

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:24.443 position:50% align:center
the anti-intruder charms, sir!

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY]
I see!

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.030 position:50% align:center
They can teleport
such a great distance!

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:29.281 position:50% align:center
Wait, what am I saying?

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
Now's not the time
to be impressed!

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
We must continue
our search at once!

00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.040 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY yelling]

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
Who opened the water
gates in the hallway?

00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
I would say it's probably
the Dark Lord, sir!

00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:48.342 position:50% align:center
Goodness me!

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.219 position:50% align:center
Someone toggled the
switch that activates

00:16:50.302 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
the Room of Freezing!

00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:53.889 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,
I'd wager it was

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.183 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord again,
Mister Grand Chamberlain!

00:16:58.227 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
[FROG B yelling]

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
All right, which one
of you is responsible

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:03.482 position:50% align:center
for turning up the heat
in the Room of Burning?!

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
If we don't find
the Dark Lord soon,

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
everyone will go home,
and the coronation

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.618 position:50% align:center
will have been a
complete disaster!

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.329 position:50% align:center
[FROG A] I'm more concerned
about running out of HP.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
We must dispel all the
anti-intruder charms,

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
every last one!

00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:25.254 position:50% align:center
Right this instant!

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
Um, I think...
that'll be kind of tricky.

00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:35.222 position:50% align:center
[STATUE A]
Coming online.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.849 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY gasps]

00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:43.647 position:50% align:center
All of this ancient magic.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
It's extremely fascinating.

00:17:45.524 --> 00:17:47.401 position:50% align:center
I'll most definitely ask
my master to teach me

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
more about it when I return.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.241 position:50% align:center
We looked everywhere
for you, milord.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're still
in the palace.

00:17:57.536 --> 00:18:00.080 position:50% align:center
Now then, if you would
be so kind as to join us

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
in the grand hall
for your ceremony.

00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
[FROG A]
Oh, boy.

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Not this again.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:15.012 position:50% align:center
[GODFREY]
Have mercy, Dark Lord!

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
In the end, once you
agreed to handle

00:18:18.849 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
a bit of Dark Lord paperwork,

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:23.896 position:50% align:center
knowing their pleas
fell on deaf ears,

00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:25.606 position:50% align:center
they allowed you to leave.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
And where exactly
did you hear that story,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
if I may ask?

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Why, from your
Master, of course.

00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:39.203 position:50% align:center
But the Dark Lord holds
no actual power.

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.038 position:50% align:center
That title hasn't meant
anything since our war

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.456 position:50% align:center
with humanity.

00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:45.918 position:50% align:center
Ever since the peace
treaty was signed,

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord has been
nothing but a figurehead

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.921 position:50% align:center
for show.

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:52.925 position:50% align:center
Now, all species and
regions have autonomy,

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.177 position:50% align:center
so there's no need for
that position anymore.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.180 position:50% align:center
Any conflicts are handled
by the Ministry of Justice,

00:18:58.263 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
with the Ministry of
Security stepping in

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.309 position:50% align:center
for emergencies now and then.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
All the Dark Lord does
anymore is appear on posters.

00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
I would never trouble myself
with such pointless nonsense.

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Look at you!

00:19:10.943 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
You were never
this talkative before.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
That black dragon really
changed you, didn't he?

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
I'm a little jealous.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.661 position:50% align:center
It's merely a side-effect of
growing older, I'm afraid.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:21.912 position:50% align:center
Too old.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Oh, please, you
look the same as you did

00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
a thousand years ago!

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelling]

00:19:27.793 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
Well, then.
My charge is done working.

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:31.380 position:50% align:center
Farewell.

00:19:32.381 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[LILITH]
Hold on, before you go--

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:35.968 position:50% align:center
There's just one more thing.

00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:39.847 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm dead.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.099 position:50% align:center
I'm definitely dead.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.560 position:50% align:center
I'm a dragon-meat platter
with a nice salad.

00:19:44.643 --> 00:19:46.687 position:50% align:center
Calm down, Letty.
It's only a bit of soot.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
Oh, why didn't the spell work?

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:52.943 position:50% align:center
Hey, I guess you're right!

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
Everything's fine!

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
I'm tougher!
It looks like I leveled up!

00:19:57.281 --> 00:19:58.282 position:50% align:center
No, you didn't.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wow, shut down!

00:19:59.992 --> 00:20:01.243 position:50% align:center
[MAGE A]
Here's your pay.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.287 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Thank you so much!

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.872 position:50% align:center
This is great!

00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:07.416 position:50% align:center
With all this money, I can build
my own house now, right?

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.419 position:50% align:center
Yes, and you'll be able
to live comfortably.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:11.837 position:50% align:center
I'm going to pick up
a few supplies

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.964 position:50% align:center
for the next steps
of our journey.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:15.674 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
you should wash yourself off

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
at the well in
the market square.

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT]
Papa!

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.345 position:50% align:center
Sure, that sounds good.

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:25.267 position:50% align:center
[PIPBERT, LETTY humming]

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Ah, that's a lot better!

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:28.729 position:50% align:center
Thanks for waiting, Pip.

00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:31.607 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Hey, dragon.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.567 position:50% align:center
Huh? Yeah? What's up?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.153 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you to
do me a tiny favor?

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.030 position:50% align:center
I need you to take a
few things to this little hut

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.615 position:50% align:center
on the outskirts of town.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:40.866 position:50% align:center
Here's a map!

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
Um, sorry, but I have to
meet up with my friend.

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:46.747 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Aw, come on,
I'll pay you and everything.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
[LILITH] Humans are
gathering outside town

00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
because they heard
there's a dragon nearby.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.212 position:50% align:center
Live dragons are always
a hot commodity,

00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:55.297 position:50% align:center
as I'm sure you know.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
I doubt they'll attack
you inside the city,

00:20:57.925 --> 00:20:59.176 position:50% align:center
but please be careful.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.603 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I'd like to buy all
these for half-price, please.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEP C]
Huh?

00:21:12.356 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Honestly, dragons can
be such difficult creatures.

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
Hi. I came to deliver
a few things for you.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
You can just leave
'em in that little hut.

00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:23.617 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wait--!

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.078 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.
I assume you mean this thing.

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
--[MAN C grunts]
--[LETTY yells]

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
--Uh-oh!

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.921 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Dearia! Help!

00:23:07.596 --> 00:23:10.307 position:50% align:center
Do you consider natural
light to be a must?

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.643 position:50% align:center
Then you should know
about the "right to light."

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:15.229 position:50% align:center
Let's say you live in a
home that has natural light,

00:23:15.312 --> 00:23:17.439 position:50% align:center
but then a large
structure is built nearby

00:23:17.523 --> 00:23:20.275 position:50% align:center
that causes you
to lose access to it.

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:21.652 position:50% align:center
The loss of natural
light is linked

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.695 position:50% align:center
to negative health effects,
and would make it

00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:26.490 position:50% align:center
more difficult to dry laundry.

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:28.659 position:50% align:center
As such, many
countries enforce laws

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.911 position:50% align:center
that protect the right
to light by placing limits

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.746 position:50% align:center
upon the size of
buildings to be erected

00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:35.082 position:50% align:center
in preexisting neighborhoods.

00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:37.876 position:50% align:center
This may be why most
dragons live underground.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.795 position:50% align:center
Or why the Dark Lord's
palace is located

00:23:39.878 --> 00:23:42.130 position:50% align:center
so far off the beaten path.

00:23:42.214 --> 00:23:43.632 position:50% align:center
Though, personally,
I would be happy living

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
in a small bungalow.

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
