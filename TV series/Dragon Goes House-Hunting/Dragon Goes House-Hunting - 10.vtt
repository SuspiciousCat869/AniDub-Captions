[NARRATOR] Hunters, brave
travelers who chase after

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.481 position:50% align:center
monsters, with a trusty
cait sith by their side.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
Here, we have a
Hunter named Huey,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.819 position:50% align:center
who pursues a singular quarry.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.238 position:50% align:center
A creature he met through
a chance encounter.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Me?

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.994 position:50% align:center
Let's capture the Red Dragon!

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.586 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] I had just finished
a job that required me

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.630 position:50% align:center
to steal a dragon's egg.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
We were camping out
near the Zorata Mines,

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
one of the many
dwarven strongholds.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50% align:center
That was when I first
laid eyes on him!

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
One thing is certain.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
This dragon shows no aggression,
nor willingness to take flight.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
So it's a new species!
It must be!

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.319 position:50% align:center
That's a-meow-zing!

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Truthfully, Letty is
just a coward who can't fly.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] I swear we'll have
his hide this time, Albert!

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50% align:center
Sounds purr-fect!

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] Well? Have you
picked up his trail yet?

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
A-purr-ently someone
spotted it up

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
at the Temple of Fall!

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
[HUEY]
Is that so?

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
I guess that means it's time
to go dungeon-diving!

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
I can hardly wait!

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
Actually, I don't believe
that'll be necessary.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Nya?

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] It looks like the
dragon's already moved along.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] Meow!
But we paid for that info!

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
The only way we can
make up for it meow

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center
is if we loot that stupid
temple for all that it's worth!

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
We'll make it back double!

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
[HUEY]
Don't be absurd.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
Robbery is against the law.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
I'm sorry.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.698 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Adventurers tend
to forget about things

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
like the law from time to time.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
Stealing eggs for a job
doesn't count, by the way.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
This doesn't bode well.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
He walked into...
the Forest of the Dead.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Too much of
a scaredy-cat to go in?

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
[HUEY]
Yes.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Relax, dude!

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
None of those stories about
ghosts are actually true!

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
But what do I do
if they are true?

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Arrow. Dagger.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
You can't defend yourself
from a ghost

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
with these basic weapons!

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
It's not like I know how
to make stuff explode,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
or shoot lightning bolts
from my eyeballs,

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
or bring people back
from the dead!

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
I'm just a regular,
everyday normal guy!

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't throw a hissy.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
We should be okay
in broad daylight!

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
Ghosts only come out at night!

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
That may be so,
Albert, but ghosts

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
aren't the only thing
I'm afraid of.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Paw-thetic!

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
[HUEY]
This forest is dead.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
That has to be the result
of poison gas pollution

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
or something.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
You sphinx so?

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[HUEY]
I say we go around.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Purr-fectly fine.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
There's a house here?

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
And a big one, too!

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] Are you sure a dragon
would live somewhere like this?

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] The map we got
from those old ladies says

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
this is meow-st
definitely the place!

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
Interesting, so it's a
dragon you're looking for!

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
We're not really supposed
to do this, but what the heck.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
We could help you out!

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
We would never disappoint
a hunk like you!

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] A clear breach
of client privacy.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Let's go and say meow-dy!

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
You good, dude?

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
This situation feels wrong
to me somehow.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Huh? You kitten me?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] If he were like this, I'd
feel better about attacking.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
But what if he's just
enjoying dinner?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to
make peace with that?

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
I could never barge
into someone's house

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
without their permission!

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
Fur real?

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
[HUEY] Maybe it'd be different
if it looked like some

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
evil lair, but it's so quaint!

We shouldn't simply take
what they say at face value.

Either way, it seems
he's no longer here,

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, old friend?

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
You'd be up a tree
without my help, buddy.

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Glad to lend a paw!

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
As for the Flame Dragon Lord--

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
you took it a little bit

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
too far that time, Dearia?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
I merely relegated
them to ashes.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's exactly
what I meant!

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Those savages were
demanding organs from people

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
they'd only just met.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
I hardly think they were
deserving of mercy.

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
Well, when you put it that way-

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
I was exercising some restraint.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.077 position:50% align:center
Literally how, though?

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
--Take a look over there.
--[LETTY] Huh?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I spared the horse and cart.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
It's magic!

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
It appears the other party
decided to leave on their own.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
That's a relief we didn't
have to fight both.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Other party?

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
If they had attacked us
from that angle,

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that I might
have accidentally blown

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
your head clean off your neck.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
Hey, think of
the bird-y children!

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind of stuff
they were carrying in these.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
Judging by the exterior,
it looks like most

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
of these items were crafted
in some other area.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
These are stolen
goods, no doubt.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
Then I guess we
should get them back

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
to their rightful owners.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
What is it, Letty?

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
Can you believe this?
'Cause I can't!

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
Unless I'm crazy, there's
a human girl in here!

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
This dragon's a father of two!

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
And who are you talking to?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What should we do, Dearia?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it, but
do you think this girl

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
might have been, you know,
like abducted?

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
From the looks of it,
I'd say so.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
Then let's go into town
and get the guards

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
to help her out!

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] They'd just think
you were the kidnapper.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
You're right.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
I could use my magic
to teleport her and the cargo

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
back into the city.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds like a good idea!

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
I'm sure someone
will take her in.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
She's not a cat!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
Besides, how do we know she
won't get kidnapped again?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
You may be right.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
Well, let's ask for her address.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Wait, don't wake her yet!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
Let me hide first!

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
Why would you hide?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] If she wakes up and sees
a dragon, she'll freak out!

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Right, good thinking.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
[PIP squeaks]

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
[PIP squeaks]

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hey. Don't be afraid.
I don't bite. Heh...

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
[ALL scream]

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
You'd better explain
yourselves to me right now,

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
you insolent peasants!

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
Who are you and where
have you taken me?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[PIP]
Papa!

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
[NELL] I am the esteemed
daughter of Edred Wilhelm

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
Ostern Fran Malloy L...

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
...von Alvin, Andriana Ellen
Croixdeia Margarethe

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
Emmalyn Petra Ingrid--

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
Royal Princess! Bow to me!

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
That's an impressive title.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
You dare to mock my name?

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Actually, Letty wasn't
the one who kidnapped you.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
I assume those charred
corpses are probably

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
the culprits, or they were,
I should say.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
we soundly defeated them.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
That's when we chanced upon
you and the stolen cargo.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
I see, and how can you prove
that your story is true?

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Well, consider this.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
Letty is very unique
for a dragon.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
He's sweet, gentle,
and kind to a fault.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
Aw, stop it!

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
Not to mention he's
a cowardly weakling

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
who can't fly or
digest spicy food.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
Trust me, he isn't
capable of kidnapping.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] It's true, but you
didn't have to say it.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
All right. I suppose I shall
take you at your word.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Judging by that
pea-brained visage,

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's harmless.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
If you'd like to
return home now,

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
I would be happy to
provide a teleport.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but no.
I actually just ran away.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
Ran away?

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
It's been a difficult journey,
but I refuse to go back.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:40.427 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Very well.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hold on a second!
You're so young!

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
It's not safe for you to run
away from home like that!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
Your mom and dad must
be worried about you!

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
[NELL]
Silence, cretin!

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
They say that elven wisdom
is greater than any book.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
May I ask for yours?

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
What about?

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
I need to find a suitable
house where I can lay low

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
for the time being.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
Someplace where my
pursuers will never

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
come looking for me.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Do you know of such a dwelling?

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
Quite possibly!

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
What other features do you
require in your dream home?

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Let me see here.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
What about me, Dearia?

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
Since this is such
an urgent request,

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
I'll settle for essentials!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
It must be made
entirely of glass,

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
surrounded by tropical flora.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
We'll need a slide
on the second floor,

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
and a sculpture of bathing
goddesses in the center.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
And of course, a stage
for my entertainment.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
That's the bath!

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's just the bath?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
It's quite basic, I know!

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
I see, so we're looking for
a discreet hiding spot

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
that has a private
bath attached.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
Perhaps--

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
All I see is a cave.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
It may look modest
from the outside,

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
but this is actually a
four-room residence.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
That is a surprise!

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
No one would ever
think to search for me

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
inside a cave, of all places.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
But... why are you
still tagging along?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
Because Dearia's helping
me find a house too,

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
thank you very much!

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
What kind of a dragon
goes house-hunting?

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
You need a safe place
where you can hoard

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
all of your treasures?

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
Look, it's none of
your business!

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Well, I suppose
you can stay with me

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
if you become my servant!

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
Not on your life!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] In that case,
I'll bill the agency fees

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
and property cost to you, Letty.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
Tight fit.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.916 position:50% align:center
Now then, where would you
like to begin the tour?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
The bath, of course!
I'll freshen up from the trip.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
Feel free to enjoy
the bath now, miss.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
[NELL] Huh? You would dare to
call that leaky faucet a bath?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
Better yet, it's a free-flowing
cold mineral spring.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
These can be an excellent
treatment for athlete's foot,

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
rheumatism, and nerve pain.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
But I don't have any of
those ailments, you dimwit!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
A proper bath should
have sufficient water flow

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
to fill up a bathtub.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
Not only that, but
an extensive variety

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
of luxurious oils, bath salts,
scrubs, and soaps.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
--You're really spoiled, huh?
--[NELL] Quiet, drummox.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
