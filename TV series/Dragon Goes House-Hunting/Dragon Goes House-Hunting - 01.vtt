[NARRATOR]
This world of ours...

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.808 position:50% align:center
...is home to a vast
menagerie of life.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
Birds. Beasts.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
Botanical beings.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
Fish and insects.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
Faeries and spirits.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
And, of course...

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
...even humans.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
But the one being that
reigns above them all

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
is the mighty dragon.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
Its wings can soar upon
the strongest wind.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
Its claws can pierce
through the hardest stone.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
And its fiery breath could
raze the entire world

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
to ashes.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
This legendary creature
is more than worthy

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
of its lofty throne.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
However--

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% align:center
In very rare cases,
one may encounter a dragon...

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.368 position:50% align:center
[LETTY'S DAD]
You idiot!

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I'm sorry!

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
...that is none of those things.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Most living
beings are born into,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
or easily acquire, a home
that suits their needs.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
Many reside upon the surface.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
Others dwell in deep waters.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
Some even prefer
to live in a fiery pit.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
But all beings, large and small,

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.026 position:50% align:center
understand the importance
of having a home

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
they can call their own.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
Wow, this place is great!

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
Damp, but not too damp.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
Practically no natural light.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME] And it was built
just 93 years ago!

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
My goodness, it's brand-new!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME] The mana
concentration is lovely!

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
And three baths, too!
That's a big plus for me!

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME] Ooh, it says here it
comes equipped with a system

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
that prevents overflow
on rainy days!

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
The hallways are a bit narrow.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
But that's not a
dealbreaker for us slimes!

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Oh, look, babe!
There's so much storage space!

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.813 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME] We'll finally have
enough room to display

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
our mana stones!

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
Check this out!

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking we could use
these nooks for beds!

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
That way, no one'll
step on us while

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
we're napping ever again!

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME] We're trying to get
away from it all, right, Honey?

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME laughs]
That's true.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
This one certainly has charm.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
And with all these rooms,
it'll be good for

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
starting a family.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME]
Oh, darling! Really?

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Thank you
for touring the property.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
Oh, no, thank you, sir!

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
So, how are we feeling
about this place?

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
You were right on the money.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
It's a perfect fit for us.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That's great to hear.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
Now then, if you purchase today,

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
you'll find that the previous
owner's camouflage spell

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
is still under contract,
which means that

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
the entrance to your
home will stay hidden

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
for another two years
at no cost to you.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME]
Did you hear that, honey?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
We have to buy this place!

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME] Yeah, it's
perfect! We'll take it!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Thank you very much.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME] We were lucky to find
it on such short notice, too.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
The thing is, unfortunately,
our previous home

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
got featured in a popular
Hero magazine.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
Before we knew it,
the place was crawling

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
with them!

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
So we had to move out.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
I'm sorry that happened to you.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
This cave has several
safety features,

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
such as Hero-deterring traps
and emergency escape routes.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
So you can have comfort
as well as peace of mind.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
Thanks a million, sir.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
It's nice to have
somewhere to call home.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
Now, if we were a couple
of big, powerful dragons,

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
we would never have
to worry about surviving

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
this harsh world on our own!

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
[F SLIME] Where did that
come from, sweetheart?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
[M SLIME]
Oh, I'm just being silly, honey!

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] You know, I'm not
so sure that's true.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
I can't believe I got disowned!

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
I fell asleep when I was
supposed to be watching our egg,

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
and a hunter walked
right out with it!

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
I tried to get it back, but I
went home empty-clawed!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
Guarding one egg
was too much for you

00:05:58.274 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
to handle, huh?

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
You are an absolute
disgrace to all dragonkind,

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
do you understand me?
Shameful!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
But Daddy, the egg's
not gone forever.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
It'll respawn when we
switch the map, so--

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
Do you think this
is a video game?

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.043 position:50% align:center
Dragons are noble creatures.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
Which means we're supposed
to be bold and brave!

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
If you want to be called my son,

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
then you must learn
to live on your own!

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[DRAGONS laughing]

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
My whole family abandoned me.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
Okay, what do I do?

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
Um, somebody help! Anybody!

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50% align:center
Wait, if a hunter finds
me out here--

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
It looks so tasty!

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that I'll get eaten!

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean,
I realize I'm a dragon.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
But let's see--

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
I've got three strength,
.3 agility, eight defense,

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
five stamina, and a -7 for luck.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
How can I survive
with stats like that?!

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
And why haven't
I updated my picture?

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
Why did I have to
be born a dragon?

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.771 position:50% align:center
And what kind of
dragon has lame stats

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
and a goofy ID photo?

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.236 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll only ever be
bold and brave in my dreams.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
I'll probably just
wind up as someone's

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
cool-looking gear someday.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
That might be okay.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
I just need to find a
nest to hide in till then.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I get it now!

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The tale of
The Three Little Trolls.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,
there lived a trio of tiny,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
helpless little trolls.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Their extreme weakness
made them a trash mob,

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
but they worked
together to build

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
an impenetrable fortress.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
There, they lived
happily ever after,

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
with no fear at all of being
murdered in their sleep.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
I need that! Mm-hmm!

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
If I want to survive out here,

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
then I've got to find
a safe nest I can live in!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
Here I go!
My search begins today!

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Home sweet home awaits!

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center

Cheers!

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
Look what we got!

[DWARVES cheer]

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
How'd I end up here?!

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
All I did was ask politely if
they would build me a house.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Um, excuse me.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
[DWARF GUARD A]
Hm?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Where's the dwarven city?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
Is this the place?

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
[DWARF GUARD B]
Ah! Dragon!

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
I bet it wants to
steal all our gold!

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
And now I'm here.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
[DWARF BOSS] Ah, a dragon!
Now that's a rare sight.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
Boss. What's the plan?

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
Do you really need
to ask me that?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
Gather 'round!
It's time for a vivisection!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
[DWARVES cheer]

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
Wait, can we talk
about this, please?

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
I just wanted you guys
to build a house for me!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
'Cause I heard dwarves
were really good

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
at stuff like that, that's all!

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sorry if I said
something wrong!

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
[crying]

This is scary!

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
I wanna go home now!

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
I wish my Mommy
and Daddy were here!

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
I didn't do anything! Let me go!

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
Hey. Stop crying, now.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
Listen, kiddo!

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
We can build you a house, easy.

[LETTY whimpering]

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Sure, but not
without compensation.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Dragon mats are quite valuable.

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
Give us your claws.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
Well, okay. I guess
I can spare part of them.

[DWARF BOSS]
Your horns, too.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
Oh. You can have the tips, but--

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
[DWARF BOSS] And your
tail and wings, as well.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
We'll take a few of your organs.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
Definitely your heart.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
Then we can build you
a nice resting place!

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Sounds like
a final resting place!

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
I knew I was gonna get
made into cool gear!

[DWARF BOSS]
All right, lads.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
We might as well
start with the tail.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] I've got to find
a way out of this mess!

Don't try to run away, big guy.

Hey, look!

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
There's somebody trying
to steal your gold!

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
Ugh, that's the oldest
trick in the book.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
They'll never fall for it!

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.632 position:50% align:center
--[DWARVES] What?!
--[LETTY] Wow, okay!

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center

Hey! We saw him first!

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
Give that back!

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
We won it fair
and square, come on!

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
Yikes. That was close.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness the
dwarves ended up fighting

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
the monster hunters.

Oh, my, what's wrong?

[HARPY B] Please don't cry,
you sweet creature!

Whatever could've happened
to bring on those tears?

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
Tell us your worries.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center

You were driven out
of your home? Oh, no!

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
That sounds terrible.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
Come and stay with us then!

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
Huh? You really wouldn't mind?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[HARPY A]
Of course not!

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
You see, our young
have just learned to fly

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
so our nest is empty.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
It's up there!

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
Up where?

High in that tree. You see it?

I would.

the Fly action yet!

Huh?

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
Then what are those
two giant wings for?

Well, you see,
I met these nice harpies,

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
and they said you guys
could probably help me.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center

"send their regards,"

That's for sure!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN B] I hate to break it to
ya, but you're gonna have to try

someplace else.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
And try having a little
more confidence in yourself!

You're a dragon, aren't ya?

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center

I can't thank you
enough for this, sir!

I'm sorry, I forgot I've never
gone swimming before.

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
[M SAHAGIN A] Shoulda
thought o'that ahead o'time.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
But I reckon it's prob'ly
better if you can find

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
a place'a your own, anyhow.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
You should head out east.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Why, what's east?

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
[M SAHAGIN A]
There's a forest that way.

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
If y'look near the
great tree Yggdrasil,

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
you'll find an elf who's
a darn good architect.

Makes his living in
construction and real estate.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
Matter o'fact,
he built my house!

He's an awfully nice fella
who goes by the name of Dearia--

was about to be dragon food.

I supposed to go?

Look! A dragon!

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap, I think
the hunters found me!

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
Stop right there, foul beast!

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
T'would seem that your
good luck has run out!

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.100 position:50% align:center
Avast!

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
With the might of
our Hero powers,

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
we've come to purge this
land of your unclean soul!

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Hm?

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
So, where are
the hidden cameras?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
[ERIK] This isn't a television
show, you accursed fiend!

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
We're Heroes!
Here to slay thee!

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
--Who?
--You, idiot!

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're gonna slay me?

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
Do you see anyone else here?

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
Sheesh, relax, would you?

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not like you
guys are hunters, right?

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
[ERIK]
We're Heroes!

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Hero. One who performs heroics.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
You go around calling
yourselves heroes?

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
Of course,
what's wrong with that?

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
I dunno, it's just
a little cringey.

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
Speak plainly, dragon!

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
It's one thing if somebody
else calls you a hero,

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
but if you say it--

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
It's a job title, you idiot!

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, so do you guys work
at the hero store or what?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
You know what,
I don't have time for this!

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
I won't mince words with
an agent of darkness!

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
It sure seemed like
you had time to me.

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[ERIK] Enough!
I'll silence you for good!

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
[ERIK yells]

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
--You can't just dodge!
--[LETTY] Sure I can!

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'd rather not fight!

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
All I wanna do is
to find a safe place

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
where I can live in peace!

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
[ERIK]
I've heard enough out of you!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
A true Hero should
never concern himself

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
with the tribulations of
others, just his own will!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Really? That's kinda messed up!

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
[ERIK] Slaying a dragon
would bring us glory

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
above all other Heroes!

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
Thus, you shall draw your
last breath this day!

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
What a bunch of greedy jerks!

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
There is no safe place
for scum like you.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
You're nothing more than
a monster who deserves

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
to rot in the pits of hell!

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Somebody help!

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
[LETTY grunting]

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
My, my.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
That creature's quite weak.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
You ought to be kinder.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
All right, keep dealing
that damage!

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't tell me that's him!

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
--Demon Lord--
--[GROUP grunts]

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Goodness me.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
Those incorrigible heroes
don't seem to care

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
who they hurt.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
It really is a terrible shame.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
Are you all right
over there, my friend?

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
Oh, my.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:27.203 position:50% align:center
Now this is quite
an unusual sight.

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
Where is it you come from,
if I may ask?

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
--[LETTY] I don't know.
--What?

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
But I just wanna go home.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.340 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] And that was how
I met Mister Dearia.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
I'd only just gotten kicked
out of my family's home,

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
but I was already off
on a great house-hunting

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.222 position:50% align:center
adventure!

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Now that he's been evicted,

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
cast out into a cold,
uncaring world,

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
will our weak little
dragon be able to find

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:58.109 position:50% align:center
the peaceful abode
of his dreams?

00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
One thing is for certain.

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
His exciting real-estate
journey has just begun!

00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
Are you hunting for a new home?
Five minutes from the trains?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.294 position:50% align:center
Well, what's that in meters?

00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:41.212 position:50% align:center
We all walk at different speeds.

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.340 position:50% align:center
But the standard is
80 meters per minute.

00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.842 position:50% align:center
That's the speed most
women walk in heels.

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.510 position:50% align:center
Next time, "A Home With Falls."
