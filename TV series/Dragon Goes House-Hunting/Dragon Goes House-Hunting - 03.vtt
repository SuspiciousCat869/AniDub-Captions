00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50% align:center
We do have another tour planned,

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.149 position:50% align:center
but first, let's make a
brief stop elsewhere.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's cool.
So where do you wanna stop?

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
The cavern of the Aged Crone.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.783 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
a really scary place.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.493 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Worry not, I merely
need to return the bed

00:01:58.576 --> 00:01:59.744 position:50% align:center
they provided for you.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
Return it? Wait.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
Does that mean we
have to go back

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50% align:center
to get it, too?

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.292 position:50% align:center
Actually, I brought it with me.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh? But that thing was huge!

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.006 position:50% align:center
It's here in this bag.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
These little things are an
utter must for adventuring.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:17.220 position:50% align:center
They can carry any item,
regardless of its size.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.304 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
So it's a Bag of Hol--

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.514 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Just a bag.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
Do they run their showroom
from inside this cave?

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.238 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
These fine ladies have
been doing business here

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
for about a thousand years now.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.788 position:50% align:center
--Hello there!
--[LETTY whimpers]

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
We've missed you, Dearie Boy.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center
Finally come to make honest
women out of us, eh?

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
These women are
the Graiae Sisters.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
Exceptionally skilled crafters
and frequent buyers.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
Are you his latest charge?

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center
Yeah, my name's Letty.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
We refuse to serve newcomers
most of the time.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
But since you're here
with Dearie Boy--

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
We will allow you
to feast your eyes

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
upon our wares!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Whoa!

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A] We've got everything
anyone could ever need!

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.570 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
Whether you're a wee pixie--

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
Or a big, lumbering giant!

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Look at this massive door!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.369 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] They also have
a number of dragon-sized

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.037 position:50% align:center
doors available.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] Hey, shouldn't
there be a doorknob?

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] They're sold
separately, and for good reason.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
The destinations change,
depending on which

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
magic knob you use.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
Wow! That sounds awesome!

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
Let's try it out.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
[DWARF A]
How's business?

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
[DWARF B]
Times have been rough.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
[DWARF C] If only we
could've looted that dragon.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
[DWARF D]
Let's try to hunt him down!

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
[DWARF E]
Sounds good to me!

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
Nope. No reason to
go through that door.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
None whatsoever.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Something wrong?

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
A young'un like you might
be more impressed with this.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
Don't ogle it too hard,
you got that?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
The Gate of the Gallant Lady!

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Hey, is that painting alive?
That's so incredible!

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Simply tell her the
magic word and the door

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
will open.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Whoa, really?

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Yes, but there is a time limit.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
Your time is up.
Now, let's read.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] If you fail, she reads
an embarrassing poem you wrote.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
This one is called
"My Flame of Love,"

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
written by Letty.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
"The day we met, my darling,
I considered it sublime.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
And now, my passionate
flame of love for you

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
burns hotter all the time."

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
"Though my hollow,
scaly body feels the heat

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
and turns to toast,
I cannot help but smile

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
because it's you
I love the most.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
Ah, my darling
sweetheart, sugar pie,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
I cannot bear to part--"

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
Please, no more!

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
[LETTY crying]

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
My life is over.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A]
Oh, don't be such a baby.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, a single beam of light,

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
shining down from the heavens
to welcome my poor soul.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
Here I come!

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Don't go into the light, Letty!

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
I mean, you can't.
It's a fixture.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Aw.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
What's that? Gah!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
What the heck? It bit me!

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Salamanders.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but why?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
They're in here because
they're serving

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
a jail sentence for arson.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
These little critters
are awfully handy

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
for giving off light,
which is why we've taken

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
to using them for lanterns
while they're incarcerated.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
They don't need any fuel!

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
You just have to
watch your fingers

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
whenever you get near 'em!

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.409 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
And if they start to get ornery,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
you can just soak 'em in water.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
Yup, that fixes 'em every time!

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Old ladies are scary.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE chattering]

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
I spy a nice fixture you
might like over there, Letty.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Whoa! It's so beautiful!

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
If I had a fireplace,
I could knit next to it,

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
or play with my dog
in front of it,

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
all sorts of fun stuff!

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A] Well, shoot for
the stars, why don't you.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE B]
You sure he's a dragon?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C]
He should've been born a newt.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
That dog's too big for
indoors, I would say.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE A] Anyway, that
fireplace is created out of

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
brick that was forged within
the primeval flame.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.778 position:50% align:center
It's perfect for a dragon
because it won't be

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
damaged by your fire breathing.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
There's one drawback, though.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
It weighs a hundred tons.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Huh?!

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] The floor in any
average home would collapse

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
under the weight of it.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
That figures.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] However, if you build
a brand-new home

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
from the ground up,
you could factor

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
that weight into your plans
and adjust accordingly.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
Build it?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE]
That's ridiculous!

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
Why are you worrying
about the floor

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
when you should be worrying
about the expense?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
There's no way you've
got enough cash

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
to build your own
house, big fella.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Well, I--

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
[GRAIAE C] You could always
sell us your wings!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
[LETTY gasps]

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Would you like that?

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
I have a fine location in mind.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
We can discuss
payment details later.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50% align:center
Shall we get building?

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] What kind of
house will we build?

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
One that's just for you.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
[LETTY yelps]

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
[SALAMANDER A]
Huh?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yoo-hoo!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Here they are.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
This view is unbelievable!

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
That's what makes it
such a great location.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
One thing, though.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
I'm really excited to build
a house and everything,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
but I'm not sure if I
can afford something

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50% align:center
like that right now.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
That's fine.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.949 position:50% align:center
When you consider the total
value of your organs

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
and material drops,
you're worth a great deal.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
[LETTY] But I can't live
anywhere if I'm dead!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
Relax. I was kidding.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
How much money do you
have on hand, if I may ask?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Hold on a second.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
Let me get my wallet real quick.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] Of course, dragons
like to keep things behind

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
their inverted scales.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's a super
convenient place to hide

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
your valuables!

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
Which is why we don't
like it when people

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
try to touch us there, y'know?

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
And we're always being hunted,

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
so it would be hard
to lug a bag around

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
all the time.

Yup, one of my baby teeth!

[DEARIA]
Huh.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
I held onto them just in case,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
because I heard a legend
about a nice fairy

who comes and turns
them into money

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
if you put them under
your pillow at night!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
I hate to tell you this,
but that's merely fantasy.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
Holding onto your baby
teeth won't earn you

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
any money, sadly.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Okay then, I guess I'm broke.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, dragon teeth
do sell for a high price.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
[LETTY]
Yeah?

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
That being said, adult teeth
are far more valuable.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA]
It's all right.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
The money problem
will solve itself.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
That will be clear soon enough.

Now, since I have an idea
of your tastes and desires,

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center

Wow, I love it, Dearia!

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
Then I say we should commence

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center

immediately.

Where'd these guys come from?!

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
I've called upon my employees.

You see--

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
Gnomes are highly skilled
at construction.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
And the ogres, they can assist
us with all the heavy lifting.

A Shinto groundbreaking service.

Oh, no thank you.
I'm not religious.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
Then would a human
sacrifice suffice?

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
Can we not?

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center

Um, I'm sorry about that, sir!

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center

Excellent, thank you.

Do you think there's anything
that I can help out with?

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
I can't handle
any heavy lifting,

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
and I don't exactly
have any special skills.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,
I'm pretty sure

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center

the place from you.

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
You made me sound that cool,
and they seriously bought it?

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
Call me crazy, but I'm kinda
sorta getting the feeling

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
that you knew that this
would happen the whole time.

Of course not.

Okay, well, if you weren't
doing anything shady,

then how come you
didn't just tell me

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
what you were up
to from the start?

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
[DEARIA] I suppose I
anticipated a few hiccups.

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
However, I wasn't expecting
there to be trouble

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
of this magnitude.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center

Then I'm sure you'd like
to know more about taxes.

00:23:38.335 --> 00:23:40.587 position:50% align:center
Structures are subject
to a consumption tax,

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.005 position:50% align:center
but land is not.

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.924 position:50% align:center
This is because land
doesn't deteriorate.
