- IT'S ABOUT TO BE HER BIRTHDAY.

26
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,291
- IN THREE DAYS... THAT
DOESN'T GIVE YOU A LOT OF TIME.

27
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,333
IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO
GET HONOKA A BIRTHDAY PRESENT,

28
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,541
THEN I SUGGEST YOU HURRY.

29
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER ASKED
HER WHEN HER BIRTHDAY WAS.

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,208
- Nana: I WANT YOU TO SEE HER
FOR THE PERSON SHE IS.

31
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,875
STOP WORRYING SO MUCH
ABOUT BEING PERFECT

32
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,500
AND REALLY GET TO KNOW HER.

33
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,666
- MAYBE SHE WAS RIGHT.

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,708
I'VE BEEN SELFISH AND
WAS ONLY WORRIED

35
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,250
ABOUT WHAT I WAS FEELING.

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,375
I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT HONOKA AT ALL.

37
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,833
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY
OWN GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY.

38
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,875
SO MUCH FOR BEING A GOOD
BOYFRIEND. I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

39
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,708
OKAY. THIS SATURDAY
I'M SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY

40
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,208
SHOPPING FOR
HONOKA'S GIFT.

41
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,250
I'M GONNA BE A GREAT
BOYFRIEND FROM NOW ON.

42
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,375
I'LL FIND HER THE
PERFECT PRESENT.

43
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,333
- I'M SO GLAD YOU GOT TO MEET
NANA YESTERDAY, AKITSUKI.

44
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,208
YOU EVEN GOT TO
SEE HER PERFORM.

45
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,791
- YEAH, IT WAS NICE OF
HER TO STICK AROUND

46
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,833
FOR AS LONG AS SHE DID.

47
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,666
WHAT KIND OF THINGS
DOES SHE LIKE?

48
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,916
WHAT COULD I GET HER THAT
WOULD MAKE HER REALLY HAPPY?

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,791
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

50
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,708
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.
JUST DAYDREAMING.

51
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,750
WHATEVER I GET HER, I WANT
HER TO REALLY BE SURPRISED.

52
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,875
- AKITSUKI, I FORGOT TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

53
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,500
ARE YOU FREE SATURDAY?

54
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,333
- I DON'T KNOW, WHY?

55
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,458
- WELL, SINCE WE
HAVE THE DAY OFF,

56
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,375
I THOUGHT WE COULD GO SOMEWHERE.

57
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,625
- AH, I REALLY WISH I COULD,

58
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,083
BUT I ALREADY MADE
PLANS FOR THAT DAY.

59
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,958
- YOU DID?

60
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,625
- YEAH, WITH YASUNOBU.
I'M SORRY.

61
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,375
IT'S JUST THAT WE'VE BEEN
PLANNING ON DOING SOMETHING

62
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,000
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE NOW.

63
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,166
- I SEE. THAT'S OKAY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU

64
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,958
AT THE LAST MINUTE. SORRY.

65
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,625
- NO BIGGIE. I'M SORRY
I WON'T SEE YOU.

66
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,583
I FEEL BAD, BUT HER BIRTHDAY
IS IN TWO DAYS.

67
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,416
- TOMORROW IS THE ONLY DAY
I HAVE TO SHOP FOR A GIFT.

68
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,583
- WHAT CAN I GET HER THAT
WILL REALLY MAKE HER HAPPY?

69
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,458
- NO PROB!

70
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,208
- HUH?

71
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,916
- IT'S EASY. GET HER A BUNCH OF
RED ROSES, ONE FOR EVERY YEAR.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,625
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

73
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,125
- OH COME ON NOW. THAT SORT OF
THING IS CHEESY. BE SERIOUS.

74
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,500
- I AM BEING SERIOUS,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

75
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,166
GIRLS LIKE THAT KINDA STUFF.
YOU MAY THINK IT'S LAME,

76
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,166
BUT THEY THINK IT'S ROMANTIC.

77
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,875
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN
A GIRL TO BE UPSET

78
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,708
BECAUSE SHE GOT A BOUQUET OF
ROSES FROM A GUY SHE LIKES?

79
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,958
MY SUCCESS RATE'S A 100%.
THIS IS VALUABLE ADVICE.

80
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,333
- I'M SURE THAT KIND OF THING
WORKS WONDERS FOR YOU.

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,083
I JUST CAN'T SEE MYSELF BUYING
ROSES IN A FLOWER SHOP.

82
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,958
- HUH? SO YOU'RE
SAYING YOU WON'T

83
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,416
BUY YOUR
GIRLFRIEND FLOWERS

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID OF
HOW IT MAKES YOU LOOK?

85
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,208
- UM, WELL I GUESS SO.

86
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,541
- IT SUCKS, BUT IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE GIRLS HAPPY,

87
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,208
YOU HAVE TO DO STUPID THINGS.

88
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,083
THAT'S JUST THE
WAY IT IS.

89
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,208
- WELL, THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

90
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,416
- Ayano: YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
I WANT FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

91
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,833
- YEAH, WHAT WOULD REALLY
MAKE YOU HAPPY, AUNT AYANO?

92
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,916
- OH, GOSH. HONESTLY, I'D
BE HAPPY WITH ANYTHING

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
AS LONG AS WHOEVER BOUGHT IT
PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT.

94
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,875
- YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
BE SPECIFIC.

95
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,583
- OH, YOU'RE BUYING A GIFT?

96
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,791
NOW LET ME GUESS.
IS IT FOR SAKURAI?

97
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,416
- YEAH, HER BIRTHDAY'S
COMING UP.

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,958
- YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET HER A
CUTE STUFFED ANIMAL, YAMATO!

99
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,166
- A STUFFED ANIMAL?

100
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,958
- YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY GIRLY,

101
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,333
SO SHE'D PROBABLY LIKE
A GREAT BIG TEDDY BEAR,

102
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,583
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

103
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,833
- HMM. ISN'T THAT A LITTLE
CHILDISH THOUGH?

104
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,583
- Miho: NOT REALLY.

105
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,958
- HOW ABOUT A DIAMOND AND
PLATINUM NECKLACE?

106
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,875
- DON'T DO THAT, YUKA!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

107
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,666
- LEMME TELL YOU
A SECRET, YAMATO.

108
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,041
THE WEIGHT OF
YOUR LOVE IS MEASURED

109
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,458
IN THE QUALITY OF YOUR GIFTS.

110
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,625
AND THERE'S NOT A GIRL
ALIVE WHO WANTS A GUY

111
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,833
WHO BUYS CHEAP PRESENTS.

112
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,291
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH, I GET IT.

113
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,375
- Megumi: I DON'T MIND
INEXPENSIVE GIFTS.

114
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,625
I THINK A RING WOULD BE NICE.

115
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,000
I WOULDN'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT COST

116
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,583
AS LONG AS IT CAME FROM
SOMEONE WHO LIKED ME.

117
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,625
- ( all sigh )

118
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,708
- OH, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

119
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,000
- HUH? WHY? IS THAT BAD?

120
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,041
- I THINK THAT SHE'D
REALLY LIKE A TEDDY BEAR!

121
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,375
- SHE'S NOT A CHILD!
SHE'D RATHER HAVE DIAMONDS!

122
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,958
- COME ON YOU GUYS, BE SERIOUS.
THIS ISN'T HELPING.

123
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,166
- FINE! THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO IT YOURSELF!

124
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,333
- OKAY. SORRY.

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
- I GUESS IT'S BEST IF I PICK
SOMETHING OUT MYSELF.

126
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,833
BUT NOTHING I SEE IN HERE LOOKS
LIKE SOMETHING SHE'D EVEN WANT.

127
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,125
THIS IS SO COMPLICATED.
WHAT'S THAT?

128
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,833
- YOU PERV! YOU'RE READING
A PORN MAGAZINE!

129
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,958
- UH, NO I'M NOT!

130
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,500
- WAIT A MINUTE!
ISN'T THAT A GIRL'S MAGAZINE?

131
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,000
- NO, NOT REALLY.

132
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,041
- WOW, YOU HAVE SUCH AN
IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF INTERESTS.

133
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:33,291
- SHUT UP. I'M JUST USING IT
TO FIND A PRESENT FOR HONOKA!

134
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,041
- I'M DESPERATE. HER BIRTHDAY'S
ONLY TWO DAYS AWAY.

135
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,250
- I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.
- HMM...

136
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,958
- SO, PLEASE, TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK, ASAHINA?

137
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,083
WHAT SHOULD I GET HER?

138
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,583
- I DON'T KNOW. DOES
SHE LIKE JEWELRY?

139
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,250
MAYBE A NECKLACE OR SOMETHING.

140
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,541
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
I'M TERRIBLE AT THIS.

141
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,375
COULD YOU COME SHOPPING WITH ME
AND HELP ME PICK SOMETHING OUT?

142
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,791
- WHAT?

143
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,250
- UH, NEVER MIND. NOTHING.

144
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,791
- WHY NOT.

145
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,458
- I CAN'T GO WITH YOU ALL DAY,

146
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,375
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT TO
GET DONE IN THE MORNING.

147
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,041
BUT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
GO WITH YOU AFTER THAT,

148
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,791
IF YOU WANT.

149
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,166
- REALLY? YOU MEAN IT?

150
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,291
- I'M THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED
YOU GET A NECKLACE.

151
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,416
SO IF YOU GO BY YOURSELF
AND PICK SOMETHING WEIRD,

152
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,916
IT'S GONNA MAKE ME LOOK BAD.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,291
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER.

154
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,666
I REALLY HAD NO IDEA
WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO.

155
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,625
- IT'S OKAY. DON'T MENTION IT

156
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,291
SO WHY DON'T WE MEET IN SHINJUKU
AROUND TWO O'CLOCK?

157
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,250
- THAT'S GREAT. SORRY ABOUT
THIS, BUT I APPRECIATE IT.

158
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,000
- JUST DON'T OVER SLEEP, OKAY?
I HATE WAITING FOR PEOPLE.

159
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,666
- BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

160
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,208
I'LL BE ON TIME!

161
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,583
THIS IS OKAY, ISN'T IT? I'M JUST
GOING SHOPPING WITH HER

162
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,083
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

163
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,375
SHE'S HELPING ME BUY
HONOKA'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

164
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,750
- ( sighs )

165
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,541
THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD KNOW
WHEN MY BIRTHDAY IS.

166
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,291
- ( people chattering )

167
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,208
- Yamato: ASAHINA!

168
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,083
- YOU ARE LATE!
- I'M SO SORRY!

169
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,041
- WELL I DON'T REALLY COME HERE
VERY OFTEN, SO I GOT LOST.

170
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,083
WHAT ARE WE DOING ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE ANYWAY? THIS IS NUTS.

171
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,041
COULDN'T WE HAVE JUST STAYED IN
THE IKEBUKURO AREA?

172
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,666
- ( scoffs ) DO YOU EVER USE
THAT BRAIN OF YOURS?

173
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,916
IT WOULD'VE BEEN TOO EASY TO RUN
INTO SOMEONE WE KNOW OUT THERE.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,833
- AH! MAKES SENSE.

175
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,750
- COME ON. LET'S GET GOING.

176
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:43,375
- AN UNEXPECTED GIFT.
FROM A BOYFRIEND?

177
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,041
YEAH, RIGHT.

178
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,750
- WELL LOOK WHO IT IS!
HONOKA SAKURAI!

179
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,916
- OH, HEY, YOU GUYS.
HOW'S IT GOING?

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,083
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

181
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,500
- YOU'RE HERE BY YOURSELF?
THAT SUCKS.

182
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,375
- YEAH, I GUESS.

183
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,958
- AND WHAT'S THIS? A HOROSCOPE?
WHAT'S YOUR SIGN?

184
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,000
AREN'T YOU A VIRGO?

185
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,041
- AH YES.

186
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,375
- THAT'S RIGHT. I
THOUGHT SO, SEPTEMBER.

187
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,375
YOUR BIRTHDAY'S
TOMORROW, ISN'T IT?

188
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,458
- YEAH. HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

189
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,083
- WELL, ACTUALLY YAMATO
TOLD US YESTERDAY.

190
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,291
HE WAS ASKING EVERYONE
WHAT THEY THOUGHT

191
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,125
HE SHOULD GET YOU FOR
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

192
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,083
I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED
HE EVEN REMEMBERED.

193
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,791
- UH, SAOTOME, WAIT A MINUTE.

194
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,833
BE QUIET! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURPRISE, YOU KNOW!

195
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,750
- OH, SERIOUSLY?

196
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,583
- UM, FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT.

197
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,041
KNOWING YAMATO, IT'S PROBABLY
NOT GONNA BE ANYTHING GREAT,

198
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,541
BUT YOU SHOULD STILL ACT
SURPRISED WHEN YOU SEE IT, OKAY?

199
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,791
- GEEZ.
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

200
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,875
- WELL, I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU
LATER, HONOKA. HAVE A GOOD DAY!

201
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,333
- Megumi: WAY TO GO! WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO KEEP IT A SECRET!

202
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,583
- NOW SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
SURPRISED. IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

203
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,000
- Yuka: OOPSIE!

204
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,541
- SO AKITSUKI DID KNOW
ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY AFTER ALL!

205
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,291
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR HIM, TOO!

206
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,916
- I FEEL REALLY AWKWARD HERE.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,666
- HELLO! STOP DAY DREAMING
AND PICK SOMETHING.

208
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,250
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

209
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,833
- RIGHT. SORRY.

210
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,833
- HERE, THIS ONE LOOKS
KINDA CUTE.

211
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,000
EXCEPT I DON'T THINK HONOKA

212
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,958
WOULD EVER WEAR
ANYTHING THIS FLASHY.

213
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,083
MAYBE WE SHOULD
LOOK FOR SOMETHING

214
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,625
A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED

215
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,500
- MORE SOPHISTICATED,
DEFINITELY.

216
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,375
I'M SORRY, I WISH I COULD BE
OF MORE HELP TO YOU.

217
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,250
- WELL LET'S GO TO
SOME OTHER STORES

218
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,666
AND SEE WHAT WE FIND THERE

219
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,000
- YEAH. OKAY.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,375
( laughs )

221
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,250
YOU'RE REALLY QUIET TODAY,
ASAHINA. ARE YOU TIRED?

222
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,416
- NOT REALLY.

223
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,541
SO, I THINK I'M TORN BETWEEN
THE FIRST AND FIFTH

224
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,250
NECKLACE WE PICKED
OUT FOR HONOKA.

225
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,791
I COULD SEE HER WEARING
EITHER ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY.

226
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,666
SO I GUESS IT'S UP TO
YOU NOW, ISN'T IT?

227
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,125
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE BETTER?

228
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,083
- LIKE BETTER?
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. GOSH.

229
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,875
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THEY
LOOKED LIKE TO BE HONEST.

230
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,666
- AH!

231
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,916
- I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,916
WHICHEVER ONE YOU LIKED
BETTER WOULD BE GOOD.

233
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,541
- OKAY THAT'S IT.

234
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,541
- UH, WHAT'S "IT?"

235
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,916
- Suzuka: WHENEVER I
ASK YOUR OPINION,

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,291
YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU DON'T KNOW

237
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,708
AND LEAVE IT UP TO ME.
GIVE ME A BREAK!

238
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,833
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR. I'M NOT THE
ONE WE'RE SHOPPING FOR HERE.

239
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,000
- I'M GOING HOME.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

240
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,166
- NO, DON'T.

241
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,333
- PLEASE, ASAHINA,
I'M SORRY, OKAY! WAIT!

242
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,208
- HEY YOU GUYS. WOULD YOU MIND
NOT ARGUING IN FRONT OF

243
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,083
MY STAND. YOU'RE SCARING
MY CUSTOMERS.

244
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,625
YOU SHOULD BUY SOMETHING
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

245
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,500
I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT.

246
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,208
- HEY, WAIT. DIDN'T YOU USED
TO WORK FOR THE NEWSPAPER?

247
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,916
- DON'T BE UPSET!
COME TAKE A LOOK!

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,083
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
BETTER, I PROMISE!

249
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,083
- OKAY.

250
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,541
- SORRY, I ONLY HAVE
ACCESSORIES FOR GIRLS.

251
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,291
YOU COULD BUY SOMEONE
A GIFT, THOUGH.

252
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,708
- A GIFT?

253
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,958
- HEY, ASAHINA! CAN YOU
COME HERE FOR A SEC?

254
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,791
I NEED YOU TO TRY
SOMETHING ON FOR ME!

255
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,000
- NO WAY! I MEAN, HOW IS THAT
GONNA HELP YOU CHOOSE?

256
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,000
- COME ON, PLEASE. I HAVE A
REALLY GOOD FEELING

257
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,416
ABOUT THIS ONE.

258
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,708
- FINE. I GUESS IT WON'T HURT TO
PUT IT ON FOR JUST A MINUTE.

259
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,125
- I KNEW IT.
IT LOOKS GREAT.

260
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,291
- YEAH, BUT WHO CARES?

261
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,958
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT
LOOKS GOOD ON ME.

262
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,875
- IT'S OKAY. SEEING IT ON
HELPED ME REALIZE WHAT I WANT.

263
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,125
UM, 'SCUSE ME. WOULD YOU MIND
WRAPPING THIS ONE UP

264
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
AS A GIFT FOR ME, PLEASE?

265
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,458
- SURE, NO PROBLEM!
THANKS VERY MUCH!

266
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
AFTER ALL OF THAT,

267
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,541
YOU ENDED UP BUYING HER PRESENT
FROM SOME WOMAN ON THE STREET.

268
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,416
- WHO CARES WHERE IT'S FROM.
I REALLY THINK SHE'LL LIKE IT.

269
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,833
- MAYBE I BOUGHT TOO MUCH?

270
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,500
- YEAH, WITH YASUNOBU.
I'M SORRY.

271
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,083
IT'S JUST THAT WE'VE BEEN
PLANNING ON DOING

272
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,000
SOMETHING TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE NOW.

273
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,000
- HE WANTED TO SPEND THE DAY
LOOKING FOR A PRESENT FOR ME.

274
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,500
THE LEAST I COULD DO AFTER THAT
IS COOK HIM SOMETHING DELICIOUS.

275
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,541
- MMM, IT'S DELICIOUS.
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

276
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,833
HONOKA, YOU'RE LIKE
AN IRON CHEF IN A DRESS.

277
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,708
- I HOPE HE LIKES IT. I REALLY
JUST WANNA MAKE HIM HAPPY.

278
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,833
- Suzuka: OKAY, WELL I GUESS
I'M GONNA GO HOME NOW.

279
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,708
- 'KAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP, ASAHINA.

280
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,083
- I DON'T GET IT.

281
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,791
WHY ARE THEY TOGETHER?

282
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,625
- Ayano: SO, YAMATO.

283
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,583
WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND HONOKA A
NICE BIRTHDAY PRESENT YESTERDAY?

284
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,166
- YEAH, I GOT HER A
CUTE NECKLACE.

285
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,541
I THINK SHE'LL LIKE IT.

286
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,791
- REALLY? YOU CAN'T PICK
OUT A NECKLACE, YAMATO.

287
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,666
YOU HAVE TERRIBLE TASTE!

288
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,125
- GORO LIKES IT, RIGHT? I THINK
THAT IT'S PERFECT FOR HER.

289
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,416
ISN'T IT?

290
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,166
- WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL.
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

291
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,166
- CAN I SEE THE NECKLACE YOU
BOUGHT HER? PRETTY PLEASE?

292
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,625
- NO, I'M SORRY. YOU CAN'T.
I ALREADY WRAPPED IT.

293
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,708
- YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU'RE SUCH A JERK.

294
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,625
- UH, HI. SORRY ABOUT THIS.

295
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,458
I WANTED TO ASK YOU NOT TO SAY
ANYTHING UNNECESSARY TO HONOKA.

296
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,791
YOU ALWAYS MAKE THINGS WORSE
BY SAYING TOO MUCH.

297
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,083
- DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

298
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,208
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO HER ABOUT YOU.

299
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,166
- I WANNA BELIEVE THAT,
BUT YOU MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT.

300
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,750
- HEY, DO YOU THINK A NECKLACE
IS THE RIGHT GIFT FOR HER?

301
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,291
I MEAN, WILL SHE EVEN LIKE IT?

302
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,500
I KNOW IT'S ANNOYING, BUT I'M
STARTING TO DOUBT MYSELF.

303
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,250
- WELL STOP THAT, SHE'LL LOVE
IT. YOU PICKED IT, DIDN'T YOU?

304
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,291
- YEAH AND I THINK IT'LL LOOK
GREAT ON HER!

305
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,250
OKAY. I'M GONNA GO
GIVE IT TO HER.

306
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,333
- GOOD.

307
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,041
- ( door bell rings )

308
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,666
- HELLO?

309
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,708
- HEY, THERE. HOW ARE YOU?

310
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,000
- HI, AKITSUKI. YOU'RE HERE
EARLY. IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

311
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,583
- NOTHING'S WRONG.
UM, WELL...

312
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,875
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HONOKA!
I GOT YOU THIS!

313
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,166
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KNEW

314
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,708
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.

315
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,958
- WELL, I DID! I JUST DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE

316
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,916
BECAUSE I WANTED TO
SURPRISE YOU.

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,833
- I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS,
AKITSUKI, IT'S JUST...

318
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,250
WELL, I ALREADY KNEW
YOU WERE GOING

319
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,708
TO BUY ME A PRESENT YESTERDAY.
BECAUSE I RAN INTO YUKA

320
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,208
AND MEGUMI AT THE STORE
AND THEY TOLD ME.

321
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,208
THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO.
IT JUST SLIPPED.

322
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,083
THEY FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT.

323
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,875
- ( laughs ) THAT'S SO FUNNY.

324
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,750
THEY ARE SO DEAD!

325
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,791
- I HAVE TO SAY IT REALLY MADE
MY DAY WHEN I FOUND OUT, THOUGH.

326
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,875
THANK YOU SO MUCH, AKITSUKI.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

327
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,541
- WELL, I'M GLAD IT
MADE YOU HAPPY.

328
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,083
- I THOUGHT ABOUT
PRETENDING NOT TO KNOW

329
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,666
AND JUST ACTING SURPRISED.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO

330
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,500
YOU ABOUT ANYTHING,
EVEN IF IT MADE YOU SMILE.

331
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,625
- I TOLD HER I WAS SPENDING
THE DAY WITH YASUNOBU,

332
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,833
BUT I WAS REALLY OUT
WITH ASAHINA.

333
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,708
- I WANTED TO ASK YOU NOT TO SAY
ANYTHING UNNECESSARY TO HONOKA.

334
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,250
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

335
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,833
- ACTUALLY, NO.
IT'S ABOUT THE PRESENT.

336
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,708
- I KNOW.

337
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:49,666
ASAHINA. SHE WENT
WITH YOU TO BUY IT.

338
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,458
I ACTUALLY SAW THE TWO
OF YOU YESTERDAY

339
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,291
WHEN I WAS OUT SHOPPING.

340
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,791
- PLEASE DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, HONOKA,

341
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,291
I DON'T LIKE HER LIKE
THAT, I PROMISE!

342
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,416
- I KNOW YOU DON'T...

343
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,666
YOU JUST BROUGHT HER WITH
YOU TO HELP PICK OUT

344
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,208
THE PERFECT PRESENT
FOR ME, RIGHT?

345
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,166
- YEAH, THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.

346
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,000
EVERYONE KNOWS I HAVE TERRIBLE
TASTE IN STUFF LIKE THAT.

347
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,916
- WELL THEN, IT'S OKAY,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME. REALLY.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,833
- AH! GREAT.

349
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,125
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? IT REALLY
DOES PAY TO BE HONEST!

350
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,208
- WELL THEN, ARE YOU
GOING TO OPEN IT?

351
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,250
- ASAHINA IS THE HARDEST PERSON
IN THE WORLD TO SHOP WITH.

352
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,833
IT WAS CRAZY! I SWEAR,
EVERYTHING WE LOOKED AT

353
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,083
SHE THOUGHT WAS CUTE OR NICE
OR SOMETHING YOU'D LOVE.

354
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,916
WE WERE IN SHIBUYA AND SHE
DRAGGED ME EVERYWHERE.

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I SWEAR, BEFORE WE KNEW IT,
IT WAS EVENING.

356
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,458
- WOW. SOUNDS LIKE A LONG DAY.

357
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,041
- IT WAS AFTER ALL THAT WALKING,
WE WERE HUNGRY AND TIRED

358
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,333
AND I ACTUALLY GOT DIZZY!

359
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,583
ASAHINA WAS HER USUAL
GROUCHY SELF, OF COURSE.

360
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,291
AND OH MAN! SHE WAS
SO ANNOYED

361
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,875
WHEN SHE REALIZED THE PRESENT
I PICKED OUT WAS THE BEST.

362
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,791
AFTER ALL THAT, IT PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

363
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,500
IF I HAD GONE ALONE.

364
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:59,083
- WHY DOES HE SEEM SO HAPPY
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HER?

365
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,375
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
THAT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE

366
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,916
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER.

367
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,500
- IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT WHEN
WE GO SHOPPING TOGETHER.

368
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,083
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH!

369
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,250
JUST STOP IT.
I DON'T CARE.

370
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M SORRY,
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

371
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,625
- I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH.

372
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,333
HERE.

373
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,958
I DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE.

374
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,791
- WAIT, HONOKA!

375
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,958
- YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT.

376
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,333
I CAN'T PRETEND TO BE HAPPY WHEN
YOU SAY THOSE THINGS TO ME.

377
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,666
- I'M SUCH A STUPID JERK. I
CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT TO HER.

378
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,833
ASAHINA.

379
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,416
- HEY, HOW'D IT GO TODAY?

380
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,083
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF HONOKA
LIKED HER NECKLACE OR NOT.

381
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,625
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO AFTERWARDS?
DID YOU GO SOMEWHERE NICE?

382
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,083
- NO, I WENT TO THE
ARCADE ALONE.

383
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

384
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,000
- WELL, I TOLD HER THAT I BOUGHT
HER PRESENT WITH YOU,

385
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,500
SO SHE GAVE IT BACK TO ME.

386
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,208
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL HER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

387
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,750
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

388
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,958
- SHE KNEW THAT WE WENT SHOPPING
TOGETHER BECAUSE SHE SAW US.

389
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,791
SHE WAS FINE, SO I TOLD
HER HOW THE DAY WENT

390
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,083
AND SHE FREAKED OUT.

391
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,166
- OF COURSE, SHE DID.

392
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,625
YOU DON'T THINK, DO YOU?

393
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,500
SOMETIMES I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW INSENSITIVE YOU CAN BE.

394
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,791
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

395
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,333
I'M SORRY FOR THIS, TOO.

396
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,375
YOU WERE A BIG HELP
TO ME YESTERDAY

397
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,375
AND NOW YOUR TIME'S BEEN WASTED.

398
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,250
- UH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

399
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,291
ANYWAY, YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT
HOW YOU HANDLED THIS TODAY.

400
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,958
- I DON'T NEED TO
THINK ABOUT IT.

401
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,541
I KNOW WHAT I DID.
I SAID TOO MUCH, AS USUAL.

402
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,833
BUT IS THIS REALLY THE REASON

403
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,041
HONOKA GAVE THE
NECKLACE BACK TO ME?

404
