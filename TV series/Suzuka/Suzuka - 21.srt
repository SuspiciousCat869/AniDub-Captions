- ALL RIGHT. RELAY.
I KNOW I CAN DO THIS.

26
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,791
HI!

27
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,375
- PLEASE DON'T
TALK TO ME, YAMATO.

28
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,500
- I NEED TO FOCUS BUT
I CAN'T STOP THINKING

29
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,541
ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE HATES ME.

30
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,916
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, AKITSUKI?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,041
YOU NEED TO WAKE UP!
YOU KEEP DROPPING THE BATON!

32
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,625
- UH, I'M SORRY.

33
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,833
- HEY, MIYAMOTO, I KNOW THIS GUY
MAY BE A FAST RUNNER BUT, UH,

34
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,041
HIS BATON WORK IS TERRIBLE!

35
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,000
- WOULD YOU GIVE HIM
A BREAK, SASAKI.

36
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,333
THIS IS HIS FIRST TIME
TO PRACTICE

37
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,375
WITH THE RELAY TEAM, OKAY?

38
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,958
- I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE
HAS TO START SOMEWHERE,

39
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,000
SO I GUESS I CAN BE
A LITTLE MORE PATIENT.

40
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,041
BUT JUDGING BY HIS PROGRESS,

41
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE'S
ACTUALLY TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

42
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,958
I MEAN WERE YOU REALLY
TRYING YOUR BEST JUST THEN?

43
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,375
IT SURE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT...

44
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,875
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

45
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,708
IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THAT
HE'S TRYING HIS BEST.

46
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,208
- POOR AKITSUKI.

47
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,375
- ( bell chiming )

48
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,083
- I REALLY SUCK.

49
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,250
I WAS SO DETERMINED TO EXCEL
IN TRACK AND FIELD

50
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,041
AND NOW I'M JUST...

51
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,791
- AKITSUKI!

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,000
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
YOU JUST FINISH PRACTICING?

53
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,250
- UH, YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

54
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,208
- HAD SOME STUFF TO DO.
SO, HOW YOU DOING WITH RELAY?

55
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,875
- WELL, I KNOW
I'M HOLDING EVERYONE BACK.

56
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,750
I KEEP DROPPING
THE STUPID BATON.

57
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,791
I THINK THEY ALL HATE ME.

58
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,166
IT SUCKS BECAUSE THIS ISN'T
THE KIND OF THING

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,250
I CAN JUST PRACTICE ON MY OWN.

60
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,125
I REALLY FEEL BADLY ABOUT IT.
- WELL, IF YOU WANT...

61
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,000
I COULD HELP YOU.

62
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,166
I MEAN, SINCE I MADE SUCH A BIG
DEAL ABOUT YOU DOING YOUR BEST

63
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,625
THE OTHER DAY.

64
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,541
I MAY AS WELL DO MY PART TO MAKE
SURE YOU DON'T SCREW UP.

65
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,791
- OKAY. THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,

66
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,375
BUT I THINK
THE FIELD'S CLOSED SO...

67
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,666
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,208
I KNOW OF ANOTHER PLACE
WE CAN GO THAT'LL WORK.

69
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,291
SO HURRY UP
AND GET READY, OKAY?

70
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,125
- OH, WOW.

71
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,750
A PARK?

72
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,708
- THAT'S RIGHT. HUGE, ISN'T IT?

73
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,083
I THOUGHT THIS ONE WOULD BE GOOD

74
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,208
SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THE
STRAIGHT COURSE TO PRACTICE ON.

75
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,250
- WAIT! WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY ARE YOU STRIPPING?

76
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,375
- CALM DOWN. IT'S MY UNIFORM.
YOU'RE SUCH A DORK.

77
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,708
IF WE'RE GONNA PRACTICE
FOR THE MEET,

78
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,625
WE SHOULD DO IT UNDER
MEET CONDITIONS.

79
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,833
- BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE SEES US?

80
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,333
- OH, PLEASE. HURRY UP
AND TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

81
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,625
WE NEED TO GET BUSY.

82
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,916
- DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT!
IT SOUNDS WEIRD!

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,833
- WELL, YOU'RE BEING WEIRD!

84
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,375
SEE, YOU'RE DOING
MUCH BETTER ALREADY.

85
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,083
LET'S GO ONE MORE ROUND
SO THAT IT ALL SINKS IN.

86
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,583
- RIGHT!

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,208
THIS IS IT. I'M GONNA DO IT.

88
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,125
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

89
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,458
- WHAT HAPPENED? ALL YOU HAD TO
DO WAS GRAB THE BATON, AKITSUKI.

90
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,166
THE TIMING WAS PERFECT.
IT WAS RIGHT THERE.

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,166
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

92
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,875
- ( sighs )

93
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,791
WELL, I THINK WE BETTER
CALL IT A DAY.

94
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,458
- HUH?

95
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,166
- I'M GONNA GO GET US SOME
JUICE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

96
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,291
- I'M SO CONFUSED. WHAT IN
THE WORLD AM I DOING?

97
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,333
I FEEL LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY DOING
SOMETHING OR SAYING THINGS

98
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,041
JUST TO MAKE SOMEONE ELSE HAPPY.

99
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,791
I WANTED TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND
FOR HONOKA.

100
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,083
I'M PRACTICING LONG HOURS
FOR TRACK BECAUSE

101
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,791
HASHIBA BELIEVES IN ME.

102
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,041
BUT FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T SEEM
TO FULLY COMMIT TO ANYTHING.

103
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,416
I ONLY MAKE HALF AN EFFORT

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,625
AND I END UP LETTING
EVERYONE DOWN ANYWAY.

105
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,166
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT IS I WANT TO DO.

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,958
( exclaims ) THAT'S COLD!

107
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,208
- OH, GREAT. YOU WERE SULKING
AGAIN, WEREN'T YOU?

108
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,875
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

109
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,041
IS IT BECAUSE SENPAI
GOT MAD AT YOU?

110
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,125
- NO, THAT ISN'T IT. NOT REALLY.

111
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,041
- SO THEN WHAT'S THE MATTER?

112
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,458
- TO BE HONEST, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

113
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,250
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU.

114
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,375
I WISH I COULD EXPLAIN. REALLY.

115
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,833
- LET ME GUESS, I BET THIS HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOU

116
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,000
AND SUZUKA, DOESN'T IT?

117
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,750
DO YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT TELLING
HER SO MUCH INFORMATION?

118
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,875
LIKE ABOUT YOUR BREAKUP
WITH SAKURAI?

119
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

120
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,208
- ARE YOU SURE?
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

121
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,958
I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU BREAKUP
WITH HER BECAUSE OF SUZUKA?

122
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,041
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

123
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,041
- NO. IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE I JUST
JUMPED INTO THE RELATIONSHIP

124
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,541
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING.

125
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,958
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY
THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

126
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,875
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT
YOU BROKE UP WITH SAKURAI

127
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,333
BECAUSE SHE WAS ANNOYING?

128
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
SHE WAS REALLY HURT BY THAT!

129
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,750
AND ALL YOU DID WAS MAKE
SUZUKA ANGRY

130
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,083
BY USING THAT STUPID REASON
TO COVER UP THE TRUTH.

131
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,458
- YEAH, I KNOW! BUT, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT NOW?

132
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,416
JUST SAY, "SORRY, I LIED?"

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,375
- SEE. THAT IS WHY YOU WERE SAD.

134
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,958
WELL, NOW THAT I KNOW
I CAN HELP YOU CLEAR THIS UP.

135
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,958
I'LL JUST SAY, "AKITSUKI TOLD ME
NOT TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT... "

136
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,541
TRUST ME. SUZUKA WILL UNDERSTAND
IF SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH

137
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,958
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

138
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,750
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL HER
THAT WE TALKED TONIGHT,

139
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,250
SO DON'T WORRY.

140
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,083
- I GUESS... I MEAN, IF YOU DID
THAT THAT WOULD BE...

141
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,416
- OKAY. WE'LL SETTLE ALL OF THIS
TOMORROW, THEN.

142
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,000
- NO. JUST A MINUTE.

143
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,583
- OH, GREAT. NOW WHAT'S WRONG?

144
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,291
- DON'T TALK TO HER. I'LL DO IT.

145
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,125
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

146
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,958
- I MEAN, I KNOW ASAHINA'S JUST
GOING TO THINK THAT I'M LYING

147
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,416
AND I'M TRYING
TO COVER MY TRACKS.

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,666
IT'LL PROBABLY BE
REALLY EMBARRASSING,

149
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,208
BUT I HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF THIS MYSELF.

150
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,375
BECAUSE I'LL JUST FEEL GUILTY
IF I DON'T.

151
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,041
- AKITSUKI...

152
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,916
- BUT, IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE THAT
AFTER I TELL HER THE TRUTH,

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,458
SHE'LL MAKE ME REGRET
SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL.

154
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,333
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
JUST DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

155
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,041
WHEN I ASKED YOU WHAT WAS WRONG,

156
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,208
YOU SAID YOU HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS BOTHERING YOU.

157
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,041
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT YOU JUST WANTED

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,583
TO MAKE UP WITH SUZUKA.

159
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,250
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST SAID THAT.

160
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,125
- YEAH. SHE'S RIGHT.

161
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,208
BECAUSE IT'S SO AWKWARD
BEING AROUND HER AT HOME!

162
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,583
- YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

163
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,791
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY IT MATTERS SO MUCH,

164
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,500
BUT I CAN'T STAND THE FACT
THAT ASAHINA STILL HATES ME.

165
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,875
BUT, IF I SAY THAT TO HER
THEN SHE'LL JUST...

166
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,833
NO, I NEED TO GO ABOUT THIS
ANOTHER WAY.

167
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,291
IF SHE ANSWERS LIKE THAT,
THEN I COULD MAYBE ...

168
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,041
NO. FORGET IT.

169
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,291
- WHAT ARE YOU MUMBLING ABOUT
OVER THERE? EAT YOUR FOOD.

170
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,333
- ( screams ) IT'S HOPELESS!

171
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,208
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY I GO
ABOUT THIS, I'M GOING TO FAIL!

172
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,166
- WELL, THAT WAS DRAMATIC.
SERIOUSLY, YAMATO,

173
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,083
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS SEEM LIKE YOU
HAVE SOME KIND

174
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,916
OF INCURABLE TRAUMA GOING
ON IN YOUR LIFE?

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,375
- ( sighs ) MAYBE IT WOULD BE
BETTER IF HASHIBA TALKED TO HER.

176
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,708
I DON'T KNOW.

177
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,416
- WHAT? YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HER, YET?

178
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,083
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

179
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,166
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST LET
ME TALK TO HER.

180
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,416
- BUT...

181
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,666
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
TALK TO WHO?

182
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,875
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
YOU. JUST EAT YOUR NOODLES.

183
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,458
- I GET IT. YAMATO'S SINGLE NOW,

184
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,125
AND SO YOU FIGURED YOU
WOULD JUMP ON THAT

185
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,166
BY PRETENDING
TO BE HELPFUL.

186
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,541
- WHAT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS
AND YOU KNOW IT!

187
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,333
- GEEZ! YAMATO!
HAVE I TAUGHT YOU NOTHING?

188
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,250
YOU'RE REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO
REBOUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

189
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,583
- THAT'S ENOUGH! IT'S NOT TRUE!

190
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,333
WE'RE NOT AS DISTURBED AS YOU!

191
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,708
- HOW AM I DISTURBED?

192
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,500
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO'S TRYING
TO DATE MY FRIENDS.

193
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,166
- ( scoffs ) OH, LIKE YOU
HAVEN'T TRIED BEFORE?

194
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,625
- WHATEVER! YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME!

195
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,458
- THANK YOU!

196
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,208
- OH, I'M SORRY.

197
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,583
THINKING ABOUT IT ISN'T GOING TO
ACHIEVE ANYTHING.

198
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,916
I NEED TO JUST DO IT.

199
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,083
I'M SURE IF I GIVE HER
A CLEAR EXPLANATION,

200
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,416
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

201
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,875
- ( mewing )

202
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,958
- HI, GORO.
DID YOU JUST GET BACK?

203
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,291
- HEY! SORRY.

204
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,291
- FOR WHAT? HAVE YOU DONE
SOMETHING TO ME

205
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,208
AND I JUST HAVEN'T NOTICED IT?

206
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,958
- WHAT? NO!
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT!

207
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,250
LOOK, I TOLD YOU WHY I BROKE UP
WITH HONOKA, BUT

208
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,875
IT WASN'T THE TRUTH.

209
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,166
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ABOUT THIS NOW?

210
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,458
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO LIE.

211
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,208
THE TRUTH IS THERE WAS
ALWAYS SOMETHING WRONG

212
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,375
BETWEEN ME AND HONOKA.

213
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,000
WE FOUGHT ALL THE TIME
AND JUST REALIZED

214
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,916
WE WEREN'T
GETTING ALONG.

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,541
THAT'S ALL.

216
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,500
- IF THAT'S ALL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY SO IN THE FIRST PLACE?

217
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,708
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP
SUCH STUPID LIE?

218
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,541
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE.

219
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,250
- I KNOW.

220
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,000
- I DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU THAT
THE REASON WE STARTED FIGHTING

221
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,791
IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE
SHE THOUGHT I STILL LIKED YOU.

222
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,666
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON
WE BROKE UP, THOUGH.

223
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,000
DON'T THINK THAT.
THAT'S JUST HOW IT STARTED.

224
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,708
WE BROKE UP BECAUSE
I WAS CARELESS

225
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,375
AND I WASN'T TREATING HER RIGHT.

226
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,041
- OKAY, SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ALL THIS

227
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,041
WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT IT
THE FIRST TIME?

228
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,583
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT, ASAHINA.

229
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,333
- WELL, I FEEL GUILTY.

230
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,791
YOU JUST TOLD ME I'M THE REASON
YOU BROKE UP WITH HER!

231
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,791
- SEE, THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!

232
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,750
THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL YOU!

233
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,333
- THEN WHY ARE WE STANDING HERE
TALKING ABOUT IT?

234
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,000
WHAT'S THE POINT OF
EVEN BRINGING IT UP AGAIN?

235
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,000
- BECAUSE...

236
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,708
I CAN'T TAKE IT. I DON'T WANNA
FIGHT WITH YOU ANYMORE.

237
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,666
IT'S GETTING ANNOYING.
I CAN'T FOCUS ON THINGS.

238
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,041
I CAN'T EVEN PRACTICE
BECAUSE I'M TOO BUSY WORRYING

239
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,416
ABOUT HOW MAD YOU ARE AT ME.

240
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,875
- AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

241
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,166
YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF, YOU KNOW.

242
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,666
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE.

243
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,958
- I KNOW THAT. AND I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY, OKAY?

244
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,583
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO HATE ME.

245
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,208
- I DON'T GET IT.

246
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,500
- DON'T GET WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

247
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,666
ASAHINA! ASAHINA!

248
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,250
( sighs )

249
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,333
- ( door opens )

250
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,500
- ( groans ) DAMN IT!

251
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,833
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

252
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,666
IT JUST SOUNDED LIKE
I WAS MAKING EXCUSES.

253
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,833
I MESSED EVERYTHING UP.

254
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,041
I SHOULD'VE JUST LET HASHIBA
TALK TO HER FOR ME.

255
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,125
ASAHINA WOULD'VE
LISTENED TO HER.

256
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,000
I JUST MADE IT WORSE.
WHY DO I TRY?

257
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,708
( sighs ) THIS REALLY SUCKS!

258
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,833
- Miho: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

259
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,958
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET
THIS MUCH LAUNDRY PILE UP!

260
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,541
I BET IT'S MOLDY!

261
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,041
- I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
WITH PRACTICE

262
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,000
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY TIME TO DO IT. GEEZ!

263
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,083
- SO YOU WERE JUST GOING TO WAIT
UNTIL YOU RAN COMPLETELY OUT

264
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,416
OF CLOTHES TO DO YOUR LAUNDRY?

265
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,541
- NO. I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE LAUNDROMAT.

266
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,125
GOODNESS, MIHO'S STARTING TO
SOUND EXACTLY LIKE HER MOTHER.

267
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,291
NAG, NAG, NAG. SERIOUSLY.

268
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,000
HEY, ASAHINA!

269
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,416
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BOTH DOING
LAUNDRY TONIGHT, HUH?

270
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,541
- YEP.

271
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,250
- WITH ALL THESE PRACTICES
WE'RE HAVING,

272
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,250
IT'S EASY TO LET IT ALL PILE UP,
ISN'T IT?

273
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,083
- NO. I HARDLY EVER LET
MY LAUNDRY PILE UP.

274
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,208
- OH, SORRY.

275
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,041
- ( machine whirring )

276
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,500
- UH, HEY! I HAVE TWO MEAT AND
POTATO CROQUETTES HERE.

277
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,250
- WOULD YOU LIKE ONE, ASAHINA?
- NO THANKS.

278
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,916
- OH, OKAY.

279
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,625
OH, YEAH, GUESS WHAT? I WAS
THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO GROW

280
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,583
SOME CHERRY TOMATOES
OUTSIDE ON THE VERANDA!

281
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,333
IF I HAVE A GOOD CROP,
I'LL GIVE SOME TO YOU, OKAY?

282
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,583
- ( beeping )

283
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,750
- SINCE YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME,

284
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,750
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO
THE CONVENIENCE STORE?

285
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,750
- I REALLY DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TIME LEFT.

286
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,000
BESIDES I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED.

287
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,375
- RIGHT.

288
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,083
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?
WHY IS SHE IN SUCH A BAD MOOD?

289
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
IS IT BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LIKE
BEING STUCK HERE WITH ME?

290
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,791
ASAHINA, DID YOU SEE?
YOUR LAUNDRY'S DONE.

291
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,125
IF YOU WAIT TOO LONG
TO TAKE IT OUT,

292
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,916
YOUR CLOTHES WILL GET WRINKLED.

293
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,000
SORRY.

294
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,625
- I CAN'T TAKE IT OUT.

295
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,250
LOOK, I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT OUT
WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

296
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,000
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING?

297
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,750
- UH, NOT THIS.

298
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,291
- YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

299
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,708
I CAN'T WANT TO TAKE IT OUT
BECAUSE MY UNDERWEAR'S IN THERE.

300
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,541
- OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE NOW.

301
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,333
I GET IT! SHE JUST WANTED TO
TAKE HER UNDERWEAR OUT!

302
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,500
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
CATCH THAT EARLIER.

303
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,791
UM, I GUESS I'M GOING TO
THE CONVENIENCE STORE THEN.

304
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,166
- HEY! WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

305
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,333
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- I DECIDED I WANT IT.

306
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,625
THE CROQUETTE. I'M HUNGRY NOW
AND I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE,

307
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,458
SO JUST LEAVE IT HERE.

308
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,000
- SEE, YOU WANTED IT.

309
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,125
- IS THAT A PROBLEM?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

310
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,625
( muffled ) WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
LATER. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT!

311
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,000
- HOLD ON! YOU CAN'T LEAVE YET!

312
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,708
- WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

313
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,333
- I DON'T LIKE EATING BY MYSELF.
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

314
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,583
ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE THIS.

315
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,250
STAY HERE AND EAT WITH ME.

316
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,541
- FIRST YOU WANT ME TO GO.
NOW YOU WANT ME TO STAY.

317
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,916
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU, ASAHINA!

318
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,375
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

319
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,750
EAT FIRST, THEN LEAVE!

320
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,041
- HEY! SHOULDN'T YOU BE A LITTLE
NICER WHEN YOU WANT

321
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,000
SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU?

322
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,458
- JUST SAYIN'.
- I DON'T WANT IT, THEN!

323
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,333
- OH, COME ON! WHY ARE YOU
BEING LIKE THIS ASAHINA?

324
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,125
- LIKE WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

325
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,541
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT
HOW YOU'RE ACTING.

326
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,291
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER?
- WOULD IT KILL YOU TO BE

327
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,791
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT
- A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATE?

328
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,375
-SHE WAS SO MATURE, SO TOGETHER.
- YOUR TIMING IS TERRIBLE,

329
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,708
- BUT SHE'S SPOILED AND MOODY.
- NO IDEA ON TREATING GIRLS,

330
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,541
- SHE THROWS TANTRUMS
LIKE A CHILD.

331
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,125
- IT JUST PISSES ME OFF!

332
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,875
- YOU'RE JUST RUDE, YAMATO!

333
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,333
- THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
CHARMING ABOUT HER ANYMORE.

334
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,625
- HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

335
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,666
HELLO? ANYONE THERE?
STOP DAYDREAMING!

336
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,625
- OKAY, WE FINISHED
OUR CROQUETTES.

337
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,083
I'M GOING TO THE STORE.

338
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,000
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, TAKE YOUR TIME.

339
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,583
- YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW.

340
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,416
( sighs )

341
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,000
- ( phone ringing )

342
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,291
- HELLO?

343
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,291
- HOW'S IT GOING OVER THERE?
IT'S HASHIBA.

344
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,291
- OH, HI. HOW ARE YOU?

345
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,208
- GOOD. I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW EVERYTHING WENT TODAY.

346
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,125
WERE YOU ABLE TO PATCH THINGS UP
WITH SUZUKA?

347
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,916
ACTUALLY, UM...

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,791
- OH, NO! DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

349
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,416
- NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

350
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,083
- ARE YOU SURE?

351
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,000
- YEAH! ABSOLUTELY! THANKS FOR
CHECKIN' ON ME, THOUGH.

352
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,208
- OKAY. I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW THEN.

353
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,708
- OKAY, BYE!

354
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,750
- YOU DON'T REALLY SOUND
LIKE YOU'RE OKAY.

355
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,083
- WELL, I REALLY WISH I COULD
SAY THAT EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

356
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,958
BUT I CAN'T. I MEAN, ASAHINA
WENT HOME WHEN SHE WAS DONE.

357
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,333
( sighs )

358
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,250
- ( phone ringing )
- WHAT NOW?

359
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,458
- HELLO?
- HI.

360
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,875
- UH, ASAHINA...

361
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,416
( groans )

362
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,125
OUCH!

363
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,916
- I'M SORRY. I WAS SO SURPRISED
I DROPPED THE PHONE.

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,416
WHAT'S GOING ON?

365
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,541
- I'M NOT...

366
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,666
I WANTED TO SAY
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU ANYMORE!

367
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,333
SO JUST DON'T MESS UP
IN THE RELAY RACE, OKAY?

368
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,083
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOSE
JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT

369
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,583
IN A FIGHT WITH ME.

370
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,625
GOOD NIGHT.

371
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,875
- I WON'T LOSE!

372
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,375
I'M GONNA CROSS THE FINISH LINE
WITH A HUGE LEAD!

373
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:16,000
( laughing ) JUST WATCH! I'LL
SHOW YOU, ASAHINA! I'M FAST!

374
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,000
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYONE AS FAST AS ME!

375
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,208
- Miho: HEY! YAMATO!
KEEP IT DOWN!

376
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,916
- THIS WILL BE THE GREATEST
RELAY RACE EVER!

377
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,583
JUST THEN I REALIZED.

378
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,291
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SAY
OR WHAT SHE DOES,

379
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,166
I LIKE ASAHINA STILL.
