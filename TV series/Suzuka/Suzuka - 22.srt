26
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,833
- THANKS. SMELLS GREAT.

27
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,458
- I WONDER HOW YAMATO'S
DOING LATELY.

28
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,708
I'M PRETTY SURE I HEARD HIM SAY
THAT TODAY WAS HIS SECOND MEET.

29
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,416
- I DON'T KNOW. IF IT IS, I HOPE
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING STUPID

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,166
TO EMBARRASS HIMSELF OUT THERE.

31
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,291
RIGHT, GORRO?

32
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,041
- ( purring )

33
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,916
- BUT I'M SURE SUZUKA
IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,833
I REALLY WISH THAT
I COULD SEE IT.

35
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,000
YOU KNOW, SHE WON THIRD PLACE

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,875
AT THE INTER-HIGH COMPETITION
LAST TIME!

37
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,833
WOULDN'T IT BE NEAT IF SHE SET
A NEW HIGH JUMP RECORD?

38
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,791
- YES, IT WOULD.
SHE'S VERY TALENTED.

39
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,625
I'M SURE SHE'LL DO A GREAT JOB.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
- ( grunting )

41
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,875
- ASAHINA...

42
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,625
I CAN'T DECIDE IF I SHOULD
CONFESS TO HER OR NOT.

43
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,125
- I'M SORRY.

44
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,416
- I'VE ALREADY BEEN
REJECTED ONCE.

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,916
I'M SURE IT WOULD HURT EVEN MORE
THE SECOND TIME.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,708
I DON'T THINK I COULD
HANDLE THAT AGAIN.

47
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,000
BESIDES, I HAVEN'T CHANGED
AT ALL SINCE THEN.

48
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,250
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
TO MAKE HER LIKE ME.

49
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,750
SO IF I CONFESS TO HER NOW

50
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,625
I'M SURE SHE'LL JUST
TELL ME THE SAME THING.

51
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,291
SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T
GO OUT WITH ME

52
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,291
BECAUSE WE BARELY
KNEW EACH OTHER,

53
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,250
BUT I KNOW WHAT
THE REAL REASON IS.

54
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,833
- Suzune: HE WAS A YEAR AHEAD
OF SUZUKA AT THEIR JUNIOR HIGH,

55
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,958
AND HE WAS THE STAR
OF THE TRACK TEAM.

56
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,333
SUZUKA ADMIRED HIM A GREAT DEAL.

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,916
- IT'S POINTLESS.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,125
ASAHINA DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

59
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,250
SHE'S STILL...

60
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,541
STILL...

61
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,500
- STALKING SUZUKA AGAIN,
I SEE.

62
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,125
CREEPY.

63
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,000
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A RACE
COMING UP SOON.

64
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,750
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
GETTING READY FOR THAT?

65
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,125
- I STILL HAVE SOME TIME LEFT.

66
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,250
NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR
BUSINESS. WHY ARE YOU HERE?

67
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,041
- DUH. CHECKIN' OUT
THE GIRLS A'COURSE.

68
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,541
I'M GONNA GIVE HER
A SEVEN AND A HALF

69
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,583
BUT SHE'S ABOUT A FIVE,
SIX AT THE MOST.

70
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,541
- YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

71
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,833
- OH, YEAH.

72
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,916
I THINK MY NEW GOAL'S
GONNA BE TO WIN THE HEART

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,833
OF EVERY CUTE GIRL IN THE WORLD.

74
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,500
- WHAT FOR?

75
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:24,791
- WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' THIS TRACK AND FIELD FOR?

76
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,250
I MEAN, I KNOW HOW EVERYONE ELSE
FEELS ABOUT YOU DOING IT.

77
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,416
YOU'RE FAST, AND THEY PICKED YOU
TO BE ON THE RELAY TEAM

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,541
BUT STILL IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE IT'S REALLY YOU.

79
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,208
- NO, I ENJOY IT. REALLY.

80
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,291
- CUT IT OUT, YAMATO.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

81
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,083
I KNOW YOU TRIED TO HIDE IT,
BUT YOU ONLY JOINED THE TEAM

82
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,750
SO YOU COULD BE CLOSER
TO SUZUKA.

83
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,458
SO TELL ME, HOW ARE THINGS
GOIN' IN THAT DEPARTMENT?

84
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,250
- YOU'RE RIDICULOUS!
I'M COMPLETELY OVER ASAHINA!

85
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,791
OKAY, I STILL LIKE HER.

86
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,083
- DUH.

87
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,708
- BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

88
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,583
- WHY? ARE YOU AFRAID
OF BEING REJECTED AGAIN?

89
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,458
- WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

90
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,166
- THERE YOU ARE.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

91
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,916
- OH, SORRY, SEMPAI.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,583
- IT'S ALMOST TIME. YOU SHOULD
START WARMING UP, YOU KNOW.

93
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,625
- RIGHT. THANK YOU.

94
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,083
- HEY, I ALMOST FORGOT.

95
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,125
THIS is YOUR FIRST COMPETITION
AS CAPTAIN, ISN'T IT?

96
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,125
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
THAT'S AWESOME.

97
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,000
- YEAH, BUT IT STILL
FEELS A LITTLE WEIRD

98
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,000
BEING CALLED A CAPTAIN.

99
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,958
- WELL, IT FEELS WEIRD
CALLING YOU A CAPTAIN.

100
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,458
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY
LOOK LIKE ONE.

101
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,208
- WOW. YOU REALLY DON'T
HOLD BACK, DO YOU?

102
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,666
I AGREE WITH YOU THOUGH.

103
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,166
I PROBABLY WASN'T THE BEST
CHOICE FOR CAPTAIN THIS SEASON.

104
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,208
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
KAZUKI TSUDA.

105
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,666
- TSUDA?

106
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,166
- I GUESS THE TWO OF
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW

107
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,916
WHO HE WAS THOUGH, WOULD YOU?

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,625
HE WAS A PRETTY AMAZING GUY.

109
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,625
ASAHINA AND I WENT TO THE SAME
JUNIOR HIGH THAT HE DID.

110
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,666
BUT HE PASSED AWAY IN A TRAGIC
CAR ACCIDENT TWO YEARS AGO.

111
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,333
HE AND ASAHINA ALWAYS FOUGHT.

112
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,375
HE WAS KIND OF COCKY TOO.

113
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,291
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A PRETTY
IRRESPONSIBLE GUY,

114
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,833
NO ONE WAS MORE DEDICATED
TO TRACK AND FIELD THAN HE WAS.

115
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,208
HE HAD QUITE A PROMISING FUTURE
AHEAD OF HIM.

116
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,875
IN HIS LAST HUNDRED-METER RUN,

117
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,166
HE SET AN ALL-TIME RECORD AS
THE FASTEST RUNNER IN JAPAN.

118
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,541
- WOW. SOUNDS LIKE
HE WAS REALLY TALENTED.

119
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,500
- HE WAS.

120
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,541
I THINK HE PROBABLY
INSPIRED ASAHINA AND ME

121
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,250
MORE THAN WE REALIZED.

122
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,291
- SO IF THAT'S TRUE,

123
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,791
THAT MAKES ME WONDER IF SUZUKA
EVER HAD A THING FOR THIS GUY.

124
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,583
HMM?

125
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

126
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,041
SOMETIMES I THINK
SHE MAY HAVE.

127
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,750
I MEAN, SHE STILL
MAKES SPECIAL TRIPS

128
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,541
TO VISIT HIS GRAVESITE EVEN NOW.

129
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,000
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF
SHE'S STILL HAVING A HARD TIME

130
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,875
GETTING OVER KAZUKI
AND DEALING WITH HIS DEATH.

131
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,166
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I THINK
I BETTER GET GOING, AKITSUKI.

132
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,208
DON'T BE LATE
FOR FINAL CALL, OKAY?

133
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,416
- I WON'T.

134
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,791
- I GET IT.

135
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,500
YOU DON'T WANNA
CONFESS TO SUZUKA

136
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,166
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
OF REJECTION.

137
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,083
YOU THINK SHE'LL COMPARE YOU TO
TSUDA AND THAT SCARES YOU.

138
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,958
- SHUT UP.

139
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,583
- MAKES SENSE THOUGH.

140
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,333
HE WAS RELIABLE AND ACTUALLY
CARED ABOUT TRACK AND FIELD.

141
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:27,041
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE FASTEST
RUNNER IN JAPAN? THAT'S AWESOME!

142
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,708
MAN, IT'S GOTTA BE TOUGH KNOWING
YOU'LL NEVER LIVE UP TO THAT.

143
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,916
- SHUT UP.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,958
( screaming )

145
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,833
SHUT UP!

146
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,250
- WHAT WAS THAT?

147
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,291
- IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
SCREAMING OVER THERE.

148
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,708
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY BAD.
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

149
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,750
- SEE IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE
HIS SCHOOL JERSEY.

150
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,875
- IS THAT YAMATO?

151
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,541
WHAT'S HE DOING UP THERE?

152
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,791
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

153
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,791
- DUDE, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
CHILL OUT.

154
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,875
- I ALREADY KNOW ALL OF THAT!

155
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,666
I KNOW ASAHINA STILL HAS
FEELINGS FOR TSUDA,

156
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,333
AND I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER BE
AS GOOD AS HIM.

157
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,083
BUT I HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT YET.

158
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,750
- COME ON, YAMATO. I KNOW YOU'VE
GOT SOME GOOD IDEAS UP THERE.

159
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,208
- HMM.

160
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,208
I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD BACK
ANYMORE.

161
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,291
I'M GONNA BE THE NUMBER ONE
SPRINTER IN JAPAN!

162
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,833
JUST YOU WAIT!

163
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,666
- SO, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SAYING?

164
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
ARE YOU FEELIN' ALL RIGHT, MAN?

165
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,291
- SHUT UP!

166
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
COME OVER ME,

167
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,041
BUT I'M DETERMINED
THIS TIME!

168
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,333
- AKITSUKI!

169
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,791
WHERE'RE YOUR SPIKES?

170
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,125
- HOLD STILL.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

171
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,375
- YOU DIDN'T FORGET TO WEAR
YOUR UNIFORM AGAIN, DID YA?

172
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,541
- OH, COME ON.
HE ISN'T A CHILD, SEMPAI.

173
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,208
- I'M AWARE OF THAT,
BUT HE'S DONE IT BEFORE.

174
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,000
- AKITSUKI, JUST DO THE BEST
YOU CAN, OKAY?

175
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,250
- YOU'RE THE ACE ON OUR TEAM,
AND WE'RE COUNTIN' ON YA,

176
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,791
SO YOU BETTER NOT FORGET IT!

177
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,500
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE SAID THAT TO ME.

178
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,541
- ALL RIGHT, GO GIVE 'EM HELL!

179
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,583
- AKITSUKI, WAIT.

180
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,166
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN OR
EIGHT PEOPLE IN THIS COMPETITION

181
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,958
WHO CAN MAKE THAT ELEVEN SECOND
MARK, SO JUST MAKE SURE THAT...

182
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,541
- YEAH, I KNOW!

183
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,000
- ALL RIGHT THEN. LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

184
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,625
- I SAW YOU ON THE HILL.

185
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,791
WOULD YOU STOP ACTING SO WEIRD?
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

186
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,791
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO WARM UP.

187
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,750
- OH. WELL, DON'T
OVERDO IT, 'KAY?

188
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,958
- I'M NOT GOING TO FAIL.
I CAN'T!

189
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,375
I HAVE TO WIN,
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!

190
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,916
- ( sighs )

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,250
THIS IS SO DUMB.

192
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?

193
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,791
YOU LOOK GRUMPY. HERE.

194
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,791
MAYBE YOU NEED
SOME MORE CALCIUM.

195
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,000
- MY DIET'S JUST FINE,
THANK YOU.

196
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,791
IT'S ABOUT AKITSUKI AND SUZUKA.
THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE UP.

197
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,041
- OH, WELL, I KINDA THOUGHT
THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

198
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,458
BUT MAYBE
YOU'RE A LITTLE JEALOUS?

199
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,250
- NO! THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

200
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,375
I'M JUST ANNOYED WITH
THE WHOLE SITUATION.

201
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,166
I MEAN, AKITSUKI'S UPSET
BECAUSE SUZUKA HATES HIM,

202
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,541
SO I TRY TO BE THERE
FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

203
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,041
I JUST FEEL SO STUPID.

204
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,541
YOU KNOW, I PUT SO MUCH ENERGY
INTO TRYING TO HELP

205
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,250
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
I'M JUST TIRED OF IT.

206
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,958
- WELL, YOU WERE BEIN'
A GOOD FRIEND.

207
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,833
THERE WAS JUST NOTHIN'
YOU COULD'VE DONE.

208
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,333
THAT'S WHY I SAID
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THEM ALONE

209
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,166
- OH, SHUT UP!

210
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,791
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
DOING HERE ANYWAY, HATTORI?

211
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,500
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M YAMATO'S BIGGEST FAN.

212
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,083
I LOVE WATCHING HIM RUN!

213
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,666
- HUH?

214
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,291
- I ALWAYS LEAVE THOROUGHLY
ENTERTAINED AND EVEN INSPIRED.

215
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,416
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

216
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,666
I WONDER WHAT
HE'LL DO THIS TIME.

217
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,208
I'M SURE WE'RE ALL IN
FOR A SURPRISE.

218
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,791
- Man 1: HEY, ISN'T THAT
ARIMA OVER THERE?

219
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,333
- Man 2: YEAH, I THINK IT IS.

220
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,583
- Yamato: ARIMA EMERSON.

221
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:48,083
THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT
HE'S IN THIS DISTRICT TOO.

222
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,375
- HIS BEST TIME FOR THE HUNDRED
METERS IS 10.46 SECONDS.

223
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,541
- YOU'RE ANNOYING ME, TUCK YOUR
TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS

224
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,125
AND GET OUTTA HERE.

225
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,291
- I HAVE TO BEAT HIM IN ORDER
TO BECOME NUMBER ONE IN JAPAN.

226
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,833
AND I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THAT.

227
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,083
- HEY, AKITSUKI!
GO GET 'EM!

228
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,000
- ALL RIGHT.

229
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,041
I GUESS IT'S THE MOMENT
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

230
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,208
MAN, HE SURE LOOKS
NERVOUS THOUGH.

231
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,666
- OH, GREAT. I WONDER
IF HE FEELS NERVOUS.

232
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,291
- HMM.

233
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,625
- Man: ON YOUR MARKS.

234
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,208
- WHAT IF I LOSE?

235
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,458
I'VE PRACTICED FOR TWO MONTHS
WITHOUT STOPPING.

236
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,833
WHAT IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH?

237
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,666
I'LL CONFESS TO HER ANYWAY

238
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,291
AND SHE'LL PROBABLY REJECT ME.

239
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,666
I HAVE TO WIN!

240
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,333
NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME.

241
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
I STILL WANNA BE WITH ASAHINA.

242
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,875
- Man: GET SET.

243
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,125
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

244
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,041
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW.

245
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,916
ALL I CAN DO NOW
IS WIN THIS RACE!

246
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,041
- ( gunshot )

247
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,875
HE'S OFF TO A GOOD START.

248
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,416
- NUMBER 136. 10.81 SECONDS.

249
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,708
- ( grunts ) YES!

250
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,500
- WOW. HE DIDN'T MESS UP
THIS TIME.

251
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
- 10.81 SECONDS.

252
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,583
- HMM. HE CAN RUN FASTER
THAN TSUDA.

253
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,958
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

254
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,791
- Yamato: 10.81 SECONDS!

255
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,791
I BEAT MY RECORD!
I CAME IN FIRST PLACE!

256
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,916
- UM, WELL...

257
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,958
- WHAT?

258
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,791
- Sasaki: YEAH, GOOD JOB.

259
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,500
IF YOU CAN DO THAT IN RELAY,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

260
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,916
- YEAH, RIGHT.

261
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,083
WHAT?

262
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,625
WAS I RUNNING TOO SLOW?

263
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,791
- WE ALREADY KNOW
YOU CAN RUN FAST, YAMATO.

264
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,250
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU?

265
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,625
DON'T OVERDO IT.

266
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,250
DO YOU KNOW WHY I SAID THAT?

267
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,333
YOU REALLY NEED TO PACE
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

268
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
STOP FOCUSING ON RUNNING FAST

269
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,541
AND THINK ABOUT
HOW YOU'RE RUNNING.

270
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,333
- I THINK I GET IT.

271
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,500
- SEMPAI TOLD YOU ONLY
A FEW CAN RUN THIS RACE

272
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,125
IN UNDER ELEVEN SECONDS.

273
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,916
BUT YOU NEED TO HOLD THAT SCORE
FOR THE LATTER PORTIONS AS WELL.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,916
AND YOU NEED
YOUR STRENGTH FOR THE RELAY.

275
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,708
- YEAH, I KNOW.

276
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,625
- ONLY TWENTY FOUR MAKE IT
TO THE SEMIS.

277
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,375
YOU CAN'T WEAR
YOURSELF OUT.

278
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,166
IF YOU PACE YOURSELF, YOU CAN
MAKE IT PAST THE PRELIMINARIES.

279
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,541
- I WORKED REALLY HARD THOUGH.

280
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,875
- YEAH, WE KNOW YOU DID!
IT WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

281
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,041
GOOD JOB, AKITSUKI!

282
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,875
- ( crowd cheering )

283
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,875
- Kinugasa: THAT ARIMA'S GOOD,

284
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,166
BUT HE SLOWS DOWN
DURING THE SECOND HALF.

285
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,166
- Man: FIRST PLACE NUMBER 91!
11.9 SECONDS!

286
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,291
- ARIMA'S BEST TIME IS
10.46 SECONDS.

287
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,500
AND MINE WAS...

288
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,375
MINE WAS 10.81.

289
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,000
AND I JUST DID THAT TODAY.

290
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,541
THAT'S A DIFFERENCE
OF .35 SECONDS.

291
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,250
IT WON'T BE
EASY TO CATCH UP.

292
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,166
WE PROBABLY WON'T BE IN THE SAME
GROUP AT THE SEMIFINALS.

293
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,666
BUT IN THE FINALS, I'M SURE
I'LL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH HIM.

294
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,916
- UH. HI, AKITSUKI!

295
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
UH, DO YOU... DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

296
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,166
NEVER MIND. I GUESS YOU
ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING.

297
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,250
SORRY, I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

298
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,333
- IT'S COOL.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

300
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,333
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
I'M DOING JUST GREAT!

301
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,250
OKAY, GOOD LUCK!
I'LL SEE YOU LATER!

302
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,416
WHEN I TALK TO AKITSUKI NOW,
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE STRANGERS.

303
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,833
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE WE WERE SO
CLOSE JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

304
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,166
- UH, WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN, EXACTLY?

305
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,833
- YOU SEE, WE GO BY TIME IN THE
HUNDRED METER FINALS.

306
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,958
SO THAT JUST MEANS YOU DON'T
NEED TO RUN THIS ONE.

307
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,916
- UH.

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,916
- THE TOP EIGHT RUNNERS IN THE
SEMIFINALS ARE ALL SET.

309
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,541
THEY'RE QUALIFIED FOR THE
METROPOLITAN MEET.

310
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,083
THAT MEANS THEY'LL JUST BE
RANKED BASED ON THEIR TIMES

311
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,791
AND THAT'LL BE IT
FOR THAT COMPETITION.

312
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,375
- SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING
IS THAT YOU MAY AS WELL CONSIDER

313
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,333
THE SEMIFINALS TO BE THE FINALS.

314
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,875
- SO THAT MEANS I WON'T BE
COMPETING WITH ARIMA THIS TIME.

315
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,541
- WELL, THIS MUST BE A SHOCK.

316
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,291
I BET YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
BE RUNNING IN THE FINALS,

317
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,500
HUH, AKITSUKI?

318
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,958
- WELL, YEAH.

319
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,375
- MAN, YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW THESE THINGS ARE RUN FIRST.

320
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,750
LET'S GO, AKITSUKI!

321
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,041
- UH, OKAY!

322
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,208
- THAT SASAKI IS STILL AS
DIFFICULT AS EVER, ISN'T HE?

323
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,708
- YEAH, HE'S A LITTLE INTENSE,

324
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,500
AND HE HAS NO
PATIENCE FOR PEOPLE

325
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,708
WHO AREN'T AS SERIOUS ABOUT
TRACK AND FIELD AS HE IS.

326
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,125
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S SO HARD
ON AKITSUKI LATELY.

327
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,291
'CAUSE HE JUST CAN'T
FIGURE HIM OUT.

328
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,916
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW BADLY
AKITSUKI WANTS THIS.

329
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,000
- IT'S OKAY.

330
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,375
I DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE
AGAINST ARIMA IN THIS RACE.

331
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,708
THEY SAID THAT WE'RE JUST
COMPETING BASED ON TIMES.

332
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,791
10.48 SECONDS.

333
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,083
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO BEAT THAT TIME RIGHT NOW.

334
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,250
- HEY! YOU READY, MAN?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

335
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,583
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GETTING NERVOUS.

336
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,083
- I'M SORRY, SEMPAI,
I AM A LITTLE NERVOUS.

337
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,583
- DUDE, YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

338
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,583
YOU'VE GOT WEAK KNEES ALREADY?

339
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,333
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

340
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,250
I'M JUST AFRAID I MAY NOT HAVE
ANY ENERGY FOR THE RELAY RACE.

341
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,958
- OH GREAT, AKITSUKI.
THIS IS EXACTLY

342
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,166
WHY I DIDN'T WANT YOU ON
THE TEAM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

343
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,041
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. IF YOU'RE GOING
TO WIMP OUT ON THE RELAY,

344
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,791
AT LEAST FINISH FIRST
IN THE HUNDRED METER.

345
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,583
AND BEAT EMERSON.

346
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,875
- THAT I CAN DO.

347
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,375
- DON'T BLOW THE RACE
WITH A SLOW START.

348
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,916
- I WON'T.

349
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,708
I HAVE TO BEAT HIM.

350
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,541
I HAVE TO RUN AT LEAST .1
SECONDS FASTER THAN ARIMA.

351
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,875
I'LL BECOME THE TOP SPRINTER
IN JAPAN IN FRONT OF ASAHINA!

352
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,250
- I GUESS THE SEMIFINALS
HAVE ALREADY STARTED.

353
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,708
- ( panting )

354
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,000
- SUZUKA!

355
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,541
( panting )

356
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
YOU'VE MISSED IT!

357
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,958
AKITSUKI'S ALREADY
FINISHED RUNNING!

358
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,833
- SO, HOW'D HE DO?

359
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,166
- HE FINISHED IN 10.68 SECONDS

360
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,958
AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD!

361
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,041
ON TOP OF THAT,
HE BROKE ARIMA'S RECORD

362
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,333
FROM THE INTER-HIGH COMPETITION

363
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,833
AND IS RANKED NUMBER ONE
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR!

364
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,416
- I SEE.

365
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,416
- HE'S AMAZING, SUZUKA! I JUST
KNEW AKITSUKI WAS GOING TO BE

366
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,625
THE ONE TO ACCOMPLISH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

367
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,000
- WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE
ACTING ALL DEPRESSED?

368
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,250
SHOULDN'T YOU BE CELEBRATING?

369
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,291
YOU'VE BEEN NAMED NUMBER
ONE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

370
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,583
- I'M NOT ANYMORE.

371
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,500
LOOK.

372
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,333
- SECOND PLACE?

373
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,458
- MY TIME WAS 10.68.

374
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,250
EMERSON'S WAS 10.50.

375
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,125
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT BASTARD
PULLED AWAY FROM ME SO EASILY.

376
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,083
- MAYBE HE JUST...

377
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,541
WELL, YOU DID PLACE SECOND,
YOU KNOW.

378
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,166
DON'T FORGET YOU STILL QUALIFIED
FOR THE METROPOLITAN MEET.

379
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,833
- SECOND OR THIRD PLACE
MEANS NOTHING TO ME!

380
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,875
I JUST...

381
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,666
I WANT TO WIN FIRST PLACE!

382
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:34,250
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY RUNNING?

383
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,083
I THINK MY START IS LOOKING A
LOT BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

384
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,791
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE MY FORM IS
TOO BAD WHEN I'M AT TOP SPEED.

385
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,291
IT'S JUST IN THOSE LAST TWENTY
METERS THAT I FEEL MYSELF

386
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,875
STARTING TO SLOW DOWN, AND I
HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FIX THAT.

387
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,625
- UM, ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK
I CAN HELP YOU

388
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,625
WITH THOSE TECHNICAL AREAS.

389
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,625
- I'M SORRY.
- I SEE.

390
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,958
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

391
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,000
YOU'RE A HIGH-JUMPER,
SO NEVER MIND.

392
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,208
SO I'LL JUST GET HELP
FROM KINUGASA SENPAI.

393
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,291
SORRY FOR WASTING
YOUR TIME WITH THIS.

394
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,500
- IT'S OKAY.

395
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,875
- SEE YA!

396
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,458
- WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY IS HE
SO SERIOUS ALL OF A SUDDEN?

397
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,416

00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,208
COOL! GOOD LUCK, ASAHINA!

TIME TO CHEER PEOPLE UP?

IF YOU CHANGE YOUR RUNNING STYLE
THAT QUICKLY

417
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,833
YOU'RE GONNA RETURN
TO YOUR OLD HABITS

00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,541
WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT!
