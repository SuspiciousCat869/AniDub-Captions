- ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

27
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,208
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

28
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,916
- SORRY, I HAVE AN EARLY
PRACTICE TODAY.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,750

BIT STANDOFFISH LATELY...

32
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,458
SHE'S ALWAYS LEAVING
EARLY AND COMING HOME LATE.

33
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,083
I HARDLY SEE HER ANYMORE.
AND WHEN I

34
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,666
DO SEE HER, SHE
BARELY NOTICES ME.

35
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,791
I THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOING
WELL. WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

36
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,625
THIS GIRL'S GIVING
ME A HEADACHE.

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,916
WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO
MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,791
- YOU MEAN TODAY?
- HUH?

39
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,375
- PLEASE, ASAHINA. WOULD YOU
COME WITH ME AFTER PRACTICE?

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,000
- IS THIS GUY ASKING HER OUT?

41
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,708
- I DON'T KNOW.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

42
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,958
- THAT'S RIGHT. JUST US.

00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,375
- WHO DOES THIS GUY THINK HE IS?
HE SURE IS COMING ON STRONG...

44
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,291
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
WITH HER, PRETTY BOY...

45
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,416
HURRY UP AND REJECT
HIM, ASAHINA.

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,625
- Soichi: SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

47
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,416
- SHE THINKS YOU'RE A MORON!
- SURE, WHY NOT?

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,958

- WHY! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

51
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE SAID YES
TO THAT GUY, JUST LIKE THAT!

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,250
IS SHE THE KIND OF GIRL WHO

53
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,500
WILL JUST GO ANYWHERE
WITH SOME GUY?

54
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,458
- YOU SHOULD CALM DOWN, DUDE.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO POP.

55
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,041
- SHUT UP!

56
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,708
WAIT. HOLD ON. I THINK I'M
IN THE MOOD FOR KARAOKE.

00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,875
- EXCUSE ME?

58
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,916
- FOR SOME REASON I JUST
FEEL LIKE SCREAMING.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,041
- OH BOY, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE TONS OF FUN.

YOU WANNA JOIN US FOR
SOME KARAOKE OR WHAT?

63
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,166
- WHY'D YOU DO THAT?
I MEANT JUST US.

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,791
- OKAY, SURE.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,416
- WELL, THE MORE THE MERRIER.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, YAMATO?

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,333
- BUT IF HONOKA'S THERE
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SCREAM

KNEW YOU COULD SING SO WELL.

I HOPE THAT I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO MAKE YOU UPSET.

- BUT, THAT'S MY...
THAT'S MY DRINK.

00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,250

97
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,166

98
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,916

YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,541
- THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE...

- HEY. STUPID CAT...
I DON'T WANNA MEET THIS DUDE.

00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,208
- OH, YOU MUST BE
YAMATO AKITSUKI.

128
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,083
I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT
ABOUT YOU FROM ASAHINA.

129
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,833
- REALLY? SHE CERTAINLY
HASN'T MENTIONED YOU.

130
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,750
I WONDER WHY.

131
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
- MY NAME'S SOICHI MIYAMOTO.

132
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,833
I'M A JUNIOR FROM
TRACK AND FIELD.

133
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,083
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN OUR TEAM?

134
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,041
- WHAT'S THAT?

135
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,208
- HE KNEW YOU AND
I ARE FRIENDS,

136
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,166
SO HE ASKED FOR AN INTRODUCTION.

137
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,041
HE WAS IMPRESSED WITH YOUR
TIME IN THE RACE THE OTHER DAY.

138
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,458
- SO THAT'S WHAT WAS...
GOING ON...

139
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,500
- I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT FEEL WEIRD

140
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,041
IF I CAME TO SEE YOU ALONE,

141
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,416
SINCE WE'VE
NEVER MET BEFORE.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
SO I ASKED ASAHINA
TO COME ALONG WITH ME.

143
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:34,791
SHE AND I HAVE
KNOWN EACH OTHER

144
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,458
SINCE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

145
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,541
- ( laughs ) OH, YEAH, OKAY.
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE NOW.

146
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,208
IT'S NICE TO MEET
YOU, SOICHI. WELCOME!

147
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,416
- THANK YOU...
WILL YOU JOIN THE TEAM?

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,750
- NO, AFRAID NOT.

149
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,125
- ARE YOU SURE?
YOU HAVE THE TALENT

150
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,958
TO BECOME AN AMAZING SPRINTER.

151
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,583
- NO, I DON'T.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

152
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,375
I PROBABLY JUST GOT
A LUCKY BREAK

153
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,541
WHEN I WON THAT RACE LAST WEEK.

154
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,416
- MAYBE THIS ISN'T A GOOD DAY.
I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN LATER.

155
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
- BUT, SENPAI...

156
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,916
- YA KNOW, I COULD TELL
JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,208
HE'S DEFINITELY YOUR
TYPE, ASAHINA.

158
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,833
- ( gasps )

159
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,791
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

160
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,000
- ( chuckles )
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,

161
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,583
AKITSUKI. HAVE A
GOOD DAY, YOU TWO!

162
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,583
- SO I'M THE TYPE OF
GUY THAT YOU LIKE?

163
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,375
- UH...
- UH...

164
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,541
MAYBE SHE DOES
LIKE ME AFTER ALL.

165
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,750
- ( Yamato groans )

166
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,375
- IN YOUR DREAMS, CREEP!

167
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:40,250
- I'M SO SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?
- I THINK I'LL LIVE.

168
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,083
- ♪ STARTING LINE ♪

169
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:48,291
- ♪ TOGETHER WE'LL
REWRITE THE STORY ♪

170
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,250
- HMM. SO, YOU'RE ASKING

171
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,708
FOR MORE OF MY IMPECCABLE
INSIGHTS INTO WOMEN?

172
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,750
- I GUESS... I MUST BE
CRAZY OR SOMETHING...

173
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,125
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE THAT I CAN ASK.

174
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,083
- SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'D SUZUKA DO

175
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,541
THAT'S GOT YOU SO UPSET?

176
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,666
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER. IT'S JUST
ABOUT GIRLS IN GENERAL.

177
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,625
- LOOK, DUDE,
I KNOW IT'S ABOUT HER.

178
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,291
AND FROM WHAT I CAN
TELL, SHE LIKES YOU.

179
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,916
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT!
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING!

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,375
UH, DO YOU WANT SOME
OF MY CORNDOG?

181
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,375
- WHAT ARE YOU, FOUR?
ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT ME.

182
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,125
- HERE. I REALLY DON'T HAVE
A CLUE HOW WOMEN THINK...

183
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,875
AND I DON'T THINK I EVER WILL.
IT'S JUST NOT A SKILL I POSSESS.

184
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,958
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

185
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,833
- IF YOU'RE SO
WORRIED ABOUT IT,

186
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,375
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
AND ASK HER YOURSELF?

187
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,333
- HOW CAN I ASK HER
HOW SHE FEELS?

188
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,333
IF SHE LIKES ME OR NOT?

189
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,708
- ( thunder rumbling )

190
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,333
- UH, MUST BE A BLACKOUT.

191
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,250
- ( knock on door )

192
00:09:55,333 --> 00:10:00,125
- Suzuka: YAMATO, ARE YOU
THERE? I'M COMING IN.

193
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,916
THE LIGHTS WENT OUT
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME BY.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,666
YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

195
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,041
- NO, I DON'T MIND.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

196
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,625
- I'LL BE FINE. I THINK I JUST
NEED SOME COMPANY FOR A WHILE.

197
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,250
- NO, I UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S THAT THING?

198
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:22,000
- IT'S AN AROMA CANDLE, SILLY.
- AROMA?

199
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,791
- DO YOU HAVE A LIGHTER
ANYWHERE, OR A MATCH?

200
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,125
- I THINK SO.

201
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,375
- Suzuka: SEE, SMELLS
NICE, RIGHT?

202
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,833
- YEAH. SURE.

203
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,833
- ( wind blowing )

204
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,666
- WOW, LISTEN...
IT'S COMING DOWN HARD.

205
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,458
- WHAT'S WRONG? DON'T TELL ME
THAT WIND SCARED YOU.

206
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,875
- WHAT? OF COURSE NOT.

207
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,125
HMM...

208
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,833
- YOU ARE SCARED, AREN'T YOU?
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

209
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,166
- DON'T BE SILLY.

210
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,250
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

211
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,666
- ( lightning bolt )

212
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,916
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK...
I JUST FELL OVER.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,791
- UM, IF YOU SAY SO.

214
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,333
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IDEA, THAT'S ALL.

215
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,166
- IT'S NOT THAT I'M SCARED.
I JUST DON'T LIKE IT.

216
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,541
- HUH?

217
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,708
- Suzuka: WHEN IT WOULD
STORM WHEN I WAS A KID,

218
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,583
IT WOULD KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT...

219
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,958
BUT I WASN'T ALONE,

220
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,791
BECAUSE MY SISTER WOULD
KEEP ME COMPANY.

221
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,416
- OH! YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT
YOU HAD A SISTER, ASAHINA.

222
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,708
- YEAH. AND WE'VE
ALWAYS BEEN VERY CLOSE.

223
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,708
I MISS HER NOW
THAT I LIVE HERE IN TOKYO.

224
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,166
- YOU GREW UP IN
YOKOHAMA, RIGHT?

225
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,583
- UH-HUH, IN A LITTLE
TOWN OUTSIDE THE CITY.

226
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,791
BUT FROM CERTAIN SPOTS,

227
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,750
YOU COULD SEE THE BAY
BRIDGE, THE HARBOR,

228
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,541
AND THE DOWNTOWN SKYLINE.
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THERE.

229
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,208
- IT'S COMPLETELY
OPPOSITE OUTSIDE HIROSHIMA.

230
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,833
WHERE I GREW UP IN THE COUNTRY,

231
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,000
YOU CAN'T SEE ANY LIGHTS
AFTER EIGHT AT NIGHT.

232
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,333
- NO WAY, REALLY?

233
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,875
- REALLY! BUT WE DID HAVE
TONS OF FIREFLIES.

234
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,791
AND IN THE SUMMERTIME
THEY WOULD ALL GATHER

235
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,166
IN HUGE SWARMS
AROUND THE NEARBY STREAMS.

236
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,041
- YOU HAVE TO COME AND
SEE IT SOMETIME.

237
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,250
- REALLY?

238
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,458
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
SEEN A FIREFLY BEFORE.

239
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,833
- I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM.
- THEN SOMEDAY WE WILL.

240
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:42,000
WHAT AM I DOING? IT'S NOT
LIKE WE'RE GONNA TAKE

241
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,958
A WEEKEND TRIP TOGETHER. SHE'S
NOT EVEN MY GIRLFRIEND.

242
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,125
- ( thunder rumbling )

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,291
- LISTEN, ASAHINA?
- WHAT IS IT?

244
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,583
- REMEMBER THAT
DAY LAST WEEK

245
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,041
WHEN WE WALKED HOME IN THE RAIN?

246
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,875
- YEAH, I'VE ACTUALLY

247
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,208
BEEN MEANING TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT DAY AS WELL.

248
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,250
- WHAT?

249
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,000
- IT'S JUST, I HAD TO JUMP
OUT OF THE WAY OF THE CAR.

250
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,583
- RIGHT, THE CAR...
I UNDERSTAND.

251
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,500
IS IT TRUE?
WHAT YOU TOLD ME EARLIER?

252
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,958
- HUH?

253
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,708
- THAT YOU FELT SO ALONE
WHEN YOU FIRST MOVED HERE?

254
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,833
- MMM-HMM.

255
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,708
- DO YOU STILL FEEL
THE SAME WAY NOW?

256
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,541
- NO, I FEEL DIFFERENTLY NOW.

257
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,208
- IS SHE GONNA SAY
SHE'S NOT LONELY BECAUSE OF ME?

258
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,125
- WHEN I LEFT HOME, I LEFT MY
FRIENDS AND FAMILY BEHIND.

259
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,458
BUT I HAD TO COME HERE.

260
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,666
AND I KNOW THAT THE MOVE
WAS THE BEST FOR ME.

261
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,000
NOW I JUST, HAVE
TO MAKE THE MOST

262
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,291
OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY
I HAVE HERE.

263
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,500
- GUESS I WAS WRONG.

264
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,791
- BUT I DO GET TO GO BACK

265
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,125
AND SEE MY FAMILY
FAIRLY REGULARLY.

266
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,875
- BECAUSE YOUR SISTER
GETS LONELY, I BET?

267
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,958
- THAT'S PART OF IT.

268
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,291
- ( lightning bolt )

269
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,333
- ( gasps )

270
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:19,458
- MY FOOT FELL ASLEEP.
- IF, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY.

271
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,666
- YOU SURE GET
SCARED EASILY, ASAHINA.

272
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,625
- I TOLD YOU. I'M NOT SCARED.

273
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,083
AND BESIDES, YOUR HEART
IS RACING FASTER THAN MINE.

274
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,333
- ( exclaims ) THAT'S DIFFERENT.

275
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I DON'T KNOW...

276
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,500
IT'S BECAUSE I...

277
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:51,458
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
THE POWER'S FINALLY BACK ON.

278
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,625
- YEAH, IT IS.

279
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,250
- I GUESS I'LL BE
GOING THEN. THANKS,

280
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,083
AND SORRY IF I BOTHERED YOU.

281
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,833
- WAIT, ASAHINA.
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

282
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,541
- IT'S NOTHING. NEVER MIND.

283
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,041
- NIGHT THEN.

284
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,333
- ( door closes )

285
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,416
- I JUST WASTED A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY

286
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,208
TO TELL HER HOW I FEEL.

287
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,250
YET AGAIN.

288
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,791
- Miho: MOM, CAN I
HAVE SOME MORE TEA?

289
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,250
- Ayano: SURE, MIHO.
WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

290
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,375
- SHE SURE LOOKS
GOOD THIS MORNING.

291
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,666
- YAMATO, WOULD
YOU LIKE SOME MORE?

292
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,750
- ( gasps ) YEAH, SURE.

293
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,708
- THAT'S YOUR SECOND
BOWL ALREADY. YOU KNOW,

294
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,375
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
EAT SO FAST.

295
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:57,125
- GEEZ, BOSSY. ANYWAY, I
HAVE TO TAKE OFF. SEE YA.

296
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:02,083
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR RICE, YAMATO?
- WHAT'S UP WITH HIM TODAY?

297
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,250
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

298
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,166
I FEEL SO AWKWARD WHENEVER
I TRY TO TALK TO HER.

299
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,625
( stomach growling )

300
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,666
OH...

301
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,166
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS
IS GONNA BE ENOUGH.

302
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,333
MAYBE I SHOULD GET TWO.

303
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,666
HOROSCOPES, HUH?
IT'S NONSENSE.

304
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,125
I'M NOT GONNA LET THE
STARS TELL ME HOW TO LIVE.

305
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,083
THE SIGN WITH THE BEST
LUCK THIS MONTH IS LEO?

306
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,041
I THINK I'M A LEO.

307
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,583
"YOU'LL ENJOY A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE

308
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,750
WHO HAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED
YOUR LIFE THIS MONTH." REALLY?

309
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,958
"WEARING BLUE UNDERWEAR

310
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,125
WILL DEFINITELY BRING
YOU GOOD LUCK, LEO."

311
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,000
I WONDER IF A
BLUE PATTERN COUNTS.

312
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,458
"IF YOU CONFESS, YOU WILL
GET YOUR DESIRED ANSWER."

313
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,625
CONFESS?

314
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,916
( laughing ) WHAT DO YOU
EVEN MEAN, "CONFESS?"

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,750
JUST COME OUT AND
SAY, "I LIKE YOU!"

316
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,708
- HEY, STOP THAT.
UNLESS YOU WANNA BUY IT.

317
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,958
- I'M SORRY.

318
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,500
- ( clock chiming )

319
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,583
- A HOROSCOPE? REALLY?

320
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,750
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
TELL SUZUKA EVERYTHING?

321
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,166
- I DIDN'T SAY I WAS GOING
TO TELL HER ANYTHING!

322
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,250
I'M JUST ASKING HOW
YOU WOULD TELL A GIRL

323
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,500
YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN HER! GEEZ!

324
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,791
- UH-HUH.

325
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,958
WELL, IF IT WAS ME AND
I LIKED SOME GIRL,

326
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,416
I'D PROBABLY ASK HER
TO GO OUT SOMETIME.

327
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,416
THAT WAY, SHE'LL GET THE HINT
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

328
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,125
- SO THAT'S IT?
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

329
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,500
SO YOU WOULD ASK
SOMEONE YOU LIKED TO "GO OUT?"

330
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,416
WHAT DOES "GO OUT"
MEAN EXACTLY?

331
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,750
- WELL, IT MEANS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE.

332
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,500
YOU COULD GO TO DINNER
OR THE MOVIES. OR SHOPPING.

333
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,791
- ( laughs) WHAT? BUT WE ALREADY
DO STUFF LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME!

334
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,916
- BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOU REMEMBER?

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,666
- EXCUSE ME?
- HMM?

336
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,250
IS IT OKAY IF I EAT
WITH YOU GUYS?

337
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,125
- SURE THING. HAVE A SEAT.
- THANKS.

338
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,833
HEY, WE'RE BOTH HAVING
THE SAME KIND OF NOODLES.

339
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,333
I LOVE UDON.
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

340
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,291
- WHAT'S THAT? OH, YEAH.

341
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,250
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
CAN I DO ANYTHING?

342
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,208
- TELL ME SOMETHING, HONOKA...

343
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,375
HAVE YOU EVER TOLD A GUY YOU
LIKE HOW YOU FELT ABOUT HIM?

344
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,833
- I DON'T THINK SO.

345
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:27,416
- SAKURAI? I THINK YOU GOT
ENOUGH PEPPER ALREADY.

346
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,083
- AND DO YOU THINK THAT
THE TERM "GOING OUT"

347
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,291
MEANS YOU'RE A COUPLE?

348
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,666
OR DOES IT JUST MEAN
HANGING OUT AS FRIENDS?

349
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,166
- UH, "GOING OUT?"

350
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,125
- WELL, I'VE NEVER
BEEN ASKED OUT,

351
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,958
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT, EITHER.

352
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,833
- I SEE. WELL, THANKS.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

353
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,666
- OH, YOU'RE LEAVING?

354
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,041
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA EAT THAT?

355
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,375
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

356
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:01,375
- ( panting ) OH, HOT!
- WATER.

357
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,208
- WHY'D YOU LET ME
DO THAT, HATTORI?

358
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,708
- I TRIED TO STOP YOU.

359
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,125
- ( whistle blows )

360
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,583
- Boy: OKAY, LAST LAP.

361
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,708
- WOW, ASAHINA.
I'VE NEVER SEEN

362
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,458
ANYONE JUMP AS
GRACEFULLY AS YOU DO.

363
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,666
- Soichi: YOU MAKE IT
LOOK EASY, ASAHINA.

364
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,666
- THANK YOU.

365
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,083
- ( exclaims )

366
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,125
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

367
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,750
- IF GOING OUT MEANS EATING
TOGETHER OR GOING SHOPPING,

368
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,875
ASAHINA AND I ALREADY DO THAT.

369
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,625
IF I CONFESS AND
SHE REJECTS ME,

370
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,875
I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THOSE
THINGS WITH HER ANYMORE.

371
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,000
I MEAN, I KNOW SHE
DOESN'T EXACTLY HATE ME...

372
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,708
THERE'S A CHANCE SHE
WON'T TURN ME DOWN,

373
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,416
BUT DOES THAT MEAN SHE
FEELS THE SAME WAY?

374
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,666
I GUESS I WON'T KNOW
UNLESS I ASK HER.

375
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,375
SO I HAVE TO CONFESS.

376
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,541
- WHO IS HE TALKING TO?

377
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,791
- I CAN'T DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

378
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,875
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

379
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,666
- Suzuka: YAMATO!

380
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,416
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU EVERYWHERE.

381
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,541
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD PRACTICE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

382
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,458
- WE ALL GOT OUT EARLY TODAY.

383
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,541
AND I THOUGHT THAT
MAYBE WE COULD GO SHOPPING.

384
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,250
- SURE. LET'S GO.

385
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,791
I DON'T THINK I CAN JEOPARDIZE
WHAT I HAVE WITH HER.

386
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,791
IF MY CONFESSION
DOESN'T GO WELL...

387
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,541
- WHAT'S UP? YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

388
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,416
- NO...
WELL, YES, I MEAN, MAYBE I DO.

389
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:48,458
I LIKE HER. I LIKE HER.
BUT I, I CAN'T DO IT.

390
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,125
SOMETIMES I THINK YOU
ONLY TAKE ME SHOPPING

391
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,791
TO CARRY YOUR BAGS.

392
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,041
YOU SHOULD AT
LEAST BUY ME A MEAL.

393
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,208
- IT'S A DEAL THEN.

394
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,500
YOU'LL GET THE BAGS
AND I'LL GET THE DINNER.

395
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,666
THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK.

396
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,833
- WELL, COME ON ALREADY.
- OKAY.

397
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,375
I CAN'T TELL HER. NOT NOW.

398
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,500
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
I'LL KNOW IT.

399
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,208
IT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

400
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,166
AND I LIKE THINGS AS
THEY ARE, FOR NOW.

401
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,750
WE DON'T HAVE
TO BE "GOING OUT."

402
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,500
I JUST WANT TO BE WITH HER.

403
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,041
- SO, WHAT'S FOR DINNER?
- CROQUETTES...

404
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,583
I HOPE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

405
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,166
- ALL RIGHT? I LOVE CROQUETTES,
YOU KNOW THAT!

406
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,250
- GOOD!

407
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,666
- I CAN'T FIND THE WORDS
TO DESCRIBE HOW I'M FEELING.

408
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,083
BUT AM I REALLY OKAY
WITH THIS? BECAUSE...

409
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,250
THE MORE I'M AROUND HER,
THE MORE I LIKE HER.

- ASAHINA AND I WENT TO
THE AMUSEMENT PARK TODAY.

443
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,375
WHEN I INVITED HER, SHE SAID,

444
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,541
"I GUESS I CAN GO WITH
YOU IF YOU WANT."

445
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,583
TO SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T KNOW HER,

446
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,375
THEY'D THINK SHE
WASN'T INTERESTED,

447
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,583
BUT I COULD TELL THAT
SHE REALLY WANTED TO GO.

448
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,541
SHE JUST WOULDN'T SAY IT.
THAT GIRL'S SO WEIRD SOMETIMES.
