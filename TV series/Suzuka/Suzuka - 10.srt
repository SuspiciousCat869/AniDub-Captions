25
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:45,000
OR WHAT I'LL SAY WHEN
I SEE ASAHINA.

26
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:48,458
I JUST KNOW THAT I HAVE TO GO
TO FIND HER.

27
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,666
I CAN'T GET HER OFF MY MIND.

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,625
AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

29
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,208
( panting)

30
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,250
IT MUST BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

31
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,000
IT CAN'T BE THAT HOUSE, CAN IT?

32
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,125
IT IS?

33
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,958
THIS IS HER HOUSE?
IT'S MASSIVE.

34
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,458
HER FAMILY MUST BE LOADED.

35
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,666
MAYBE, I SHOULD THINK
OF WHAT I'LL SAY FIRST.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,583
- Woman: EXCUSE ME,
MAY I HELP YOU?

37
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,541
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

38
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,541
- OH, ME? I'M A FRIEND OF
ASAHINA'S FROM SCHOOL.

39
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,666
MY NAME'S YAMATO AKITSUKI.

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,916
- AND JUST WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, YAMATO?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,250
- I GUESS I'M NOT EXACTLY
SURE WHY I'M HERE.

42
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,833
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

43
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,416
THAT I TALK TO ASAHINA,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

44
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,458
- SO, DON'T TELL ME
YOU RAN ALL THE WAY HERE.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,083
- YEAH.

46
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,500
- CHASING AFTER SUZUKA?

47
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,875
- I THINK I'LL JUST HEAD BACK.

48
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,000
- IT'S OKAY, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO HER.

49
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,625
AND YOU CAN
MEET KAZUKI, TOO.

50
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,166
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE
TWO OF YOU WENT TO FANTASY LAND

51
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,625
AND THAT YOU CONFESSED YOU
HAD FEELINGS FOR SUZUKA.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,750
- UM, YEAH, THAT'S IT.

53
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,000
- AND NOW YOU THINK THAT SHE
CAME BACK HERE TO GO ON A DATE.

54
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,458
THAT MUST MAGNIFY
YOUR SENSE OF REJECTION.

55
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,750
- ( laughs )

56
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,333
AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

57
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,458
( thinking) IT'S LIKE SHE'S
TORTURING A WOUNDED ANIMAL.

58
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,500
AND WHERE ARE WE GOING, ANYWAY?
WE'VE BEEN WALKING FOREVER.

59
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,291
EVEN IF SHE IS TAKING ME TO MEET
ASAHINA AND KAZUKI,

60
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,041
WHAT IN THE WORLD
AM I GOING TO SAY?

61
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,625
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
THIS ONE THROUGH.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,041
- HE WAS IN AN ACCIDENT.

63
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,750
A TRUCK SLAMMED INTO HIS
BUS WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY

64
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,291
TO A TOURNAMENT.

65
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,333
- YEAH. IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE GONE HOME TO SEE HIM.

66
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,708
- SHE CAME HOME
TO SEE KAZUKI, BUT HE'S GONE.

67
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,166
I KNOW THIS
MUST SEEM INSENSITIVE,

68
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,000
BUT THE LOOK ON
HER FACE, IT'S SO MATURE.

69
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,541
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

70
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,666
- KAZUKI...

71
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,041
HE WAS A YEAR AHEAD OF SUZUKA
AT THEIR JUNIOR HIGH,

72
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
AND HE WAS THE STAR
OF THE TRACK TEAM.

73
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,041
SUZUKA ADMIRED HIM
A GREAT DEAL.

74
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,625
SHE RESPECTED HIS DRIVE
AND DETERMINATION.

75
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,000
- ( gunshot fires )

76
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,333
- THEY CALLED HIM "KAZUKI TSUDA,
THE ROCKET STARTER."

77
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,875
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE RUN
AS FAST AS HE COULD.

78
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,750
- DID YOU SAY, "ROCKET STARTER"?

79
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,458
- IT WAS A SILLY NICKNAME
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

80
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,875
KIDS CAME UP WITH FOR HIM.

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF
REMIND ME OF KAZUKI.

82
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,541
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS
SINCE HE PASSED.

83
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,708
AND EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS,

84
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,166
SUZUKA COMES BACK
HERE TO VISIT HIM.

85
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,958
- I SHOULD GO.

86
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,666
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

87
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,791
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ASAHINA
THAT I CAME HERE TODAY.

88
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,000
- SUZUKA.

89
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,458
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

90
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,416
- I THINK IT'S TIME WE
HAD A LITTLE TALK.

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,625
- OKAY.

92
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,750
- KAZUKI'S BEEN GONE
FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW,

93
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:28,583
AND I'M STARTING TO THINK
IT'S TIME TO LET GO.

94
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,500
YOU SHOULD SPEND YOUR DAYS
OFF WITH YOUR FRIENDS,

95
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,541
LIKE A NORMAL HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENT.

96
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,625
GO SOMEWHERE FUN AND EXCITING.
MAYBE FANTASY LAND?

97
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,083
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO A PLACE LIKE THAT.

98
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,833
- SUZUKA.

99
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,625
WHY CAN'T YOU LET IT GO? PLEASE.

100
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,583
YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF
REMIND ME OF KAZUKI.

101
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,625
- I COULD TELL
JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM.

102
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,333
HE'S DEFINITELY
YOUR TYPE, ASAHINA.

103
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,000
- I WAS JUST A REPLACEMENT.

104
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,041
- Man: THIS STOP, EBISU STATION.

105
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,041
- ASAHINA NEVER SAW ME
FOR WHO I AM.

106
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,833
SHE JUST SAW ME
AS A REMINDER OF KAZUKI.

107
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,958
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

108
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,166
( sighs )

109
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,083
- Miho: YAMATO.

110
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,041
- HMM?

111
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,750
- HOW DID IT GO?
SO, DID YOU TALK TO HER?

112
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,333
YOU BETTER HAVE, BECAUSE I SURE
WENT TO A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE.

113
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,375
I TRACKED DOWN
HER HOME ADDRESS FOR YOU.

114
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,666
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, THANKS FOR THAT.

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,416
- NOTHING. I JUST NEED TO GET
SOME REST, I THINK.

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,083
- BUT IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR SUPPER.

118
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,416
WHAT'S WRONG?

119
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,416
- ( bell ringing )

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,041
- YOU CAN DO IT, COME ON.

121
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,166
- Suzune: KAZUKI'S BEEN GONE
FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW,

122
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,833
AND I'M STARTING TO THINK
IT'S TIME TO LET GO.

123
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,166
- MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

124
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,416
BUT IT FEELS LIKE TIME HAS
STOPPED MOVING SINCE THEN.

125
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,333
- Man: ASAHINA!

126
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,666
LOOKS GOOD! I FEEL BETTER

127
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,916
ABOUT LEAVING KNOWING
THAT YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,208
- THANKS, SENPAI.

129
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,000
- I THINK I'VE TAUGHT YOU
ALL THAT I CAN.

130
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,791
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL DO GREAT
ON YOUR ENTRANCE EXAMS,

131
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,750
BUT GOOD LUCK.

132
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,583
AND THANKS AGAIN FOR EVERYTHING.

133
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,541
- I'M CONFIDENT THAT
WITH YOU HERE THE HIGH JUMP TEAM

134
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,250
WILL REMAIN ON
THE TOP OF THEIR GAME.

135
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,416
- THANKS.

136
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,208
- Kazuki: I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

137
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,000
YOU SURE SHE'S AS GOOD
AS YOU THINK SHE IS?

138
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,000
- Suzuka: TSUDA SENPAI.

139
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,541
- YOU KNOW AS WELL
AS I DO THAT SUZI HERE

140
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,250
TENDS TO CHOKE UNDER PRESSURE.

141
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,125
AND I'M NOT SO SURE
HAVING HER AS THE LEADER

142
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,708
OF THE SQUAD IS A GOOD THING,

143
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,416
BUT I GUESS
WE'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH.

144
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,750
- I DON'T HAVE TO STAND HERE AND
TAKE THIS FROM SOMEONE WHO'S

145
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,000
NEVER WORKED HARD FOR
ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE.

146
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,625
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ANYWAY?
YOU'RE JUST A SPRINTER.

147
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:10,166
AND MY NAME'S NOT SUZI. DOES
HE HAVE TO BE OUR NEW CAPTAIN?

148
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,750
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEONE
WHO'S MORE DESERVING THAN HIM.

149
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,416
MIYAMOTO SENPAI, MAYBE.

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,250
- BUT KAZUKI'S THE BEST ATHLETE
ON THE TEAM, BY FAR.

151
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,875
- THE MAN'S RIGHT.

152
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,000
- BIG DEAL. YOU JUST
GOT EXTREMELY LUCKY

153
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,333
GOING TO NATIONALS
TWO YEARS IN A ROW.

154
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,208
- ARE YOU JEALOUS? YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN MADE IT TO REGIONALS YET.

155
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,250
SO YOU'D BETTER DO AS
THE CAPTAIN TELLS YOU

156
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,041
AND GET ALONG WITH ME, OKAY?

157
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,791
- EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF YOU,

158
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,208
IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM
IF YOU'RE RESPECTFUL ENOUGH.

159
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,458
- OH, REALLY?

160
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,583
- CALM DOWN, YOU TWO.
KAZUKI'S RIGHT.

161
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,333
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND SOME WAY TO GET ALONG

162
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,208
AND STOP ARGUING ALL THE TIME.

163
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:45,041
- SURE. WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT. RIGHT SUZI?

164
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,166
- STOP CALLING ME THAT.

165
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,958
( thinking ) REALLY. WHY IS
THIS GUY THE NEW TEAM CAPTAIN?

166
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
- Kazuki: GEEZ!

167
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,208
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT PEOPLE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE FUN

168
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,583
WHILE THEY'RE PRACTICING.

169
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,333
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO
LIGHTEN UP ONCE IN A WHILE.

170
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,250
- I DON'T NEED TO LIGHTEN UP,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO NEEDS

171
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,791
TO LEARN HOW TO BE SERIOUS.

172
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,208
IT'S NOT THAT HARD!

173
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,375
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE A JOKE
WITH YOU, DOESN'T IT?

174
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,583
- NOT EVERYTHING.

175
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,250
- HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT
THEY'VE BEEN ARGUING

176
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,083
EVEN MORE THAN USUAL LATELY.

177
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,333
- YEAH, SHOULDN'T WE
DO SOMETHING, MIYAMOTO?

178
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,875
- NO, LEAVE 'EM ALONE.

179
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,041
WE NEED TO LET THEM WORK OUT
THEIR PROBLEMS ON THEIR OWN.

180
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,500
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THEY'LL BE ABLE

181
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,250
TO RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES.

182
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,250
- HEY, MIYACCHI! IT'S BEST
TO GRILL SAUSAGES, RIGHT?

183
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,833
- NO, IT'S DEFINITELY BEST
TO BOIL THEM.

184
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,291
- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE
EVER GONNA LEARN

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,166
TO LIKE EACH OTHER. SERIOUSLY.

186
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,791
- UGH! WHY ARE YOU
SO HARDHEADED?

187
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,666
( thinking ) HE'D ARGUE WITH ME
EVEN IF I SAID THE SKY WAS BLUE.

188
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,250
- Kazuki: AWESOME.

189
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,083
WE FINALLY GOT IN
THE NEW SHIPMENT

190
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,583
OF STARTING BLOCKS TODAY.

191
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,666
- THAT'S WAY TOO MANY.

192
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,583
GREAT. HE CAN'T EVEN MANAGE
OUR BUDGET PROPERLY!

193
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,833
YET HE EASILY MADE HIS WAY
INTO THE NATIONAL TOURNAMENT

194
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,916
IN HIS SECOND YEAR
OF JUNIOR HIGH.

195
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
IT WAS MY FIRST YEAR AND
I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT

196
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,958
THROUGH THE REGIONALS.

197
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,833
MAN, I HATE THAT GUY.

198
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,291
BUT THAT WAS LAST YEAR.

199
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,166
NOW THIS YEAR'S MEET IS MY
CHANCE TO QUALIFY FOR NATIONALS.

200
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
- 'M SURPRISED WE'RE THE ONLY
ONES WHO MADE IT TO REGIONALS.

201
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,291
I FIGURED WE'D HAVE MORE
TEAMMATES HERE WITH US.

202
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,833
- I JUST GOT LUCKY.
I BARELY EVEN QUALIFIED.

203
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,458
BUT I THINK THAT YOU TWO
HAVE A GOOD CHANCE

204
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,916
OF MAKING IT TO THE NATIONALS
IF YOU APPLY YOURSELVES.

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,916
- WELL, I'M A SHOO-IN. I'M NOT
SO SURE ABOUT SUZI, THOUGH.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,333
- SO ARROGANT.

207
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,125
- IT'S JUST LIKE
I'VE ALWAYS SAID.

208
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,375
YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO CHOKE
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE.

209
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,750
AND I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

210
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,625
BUT ATHLETES THAT CAN'T
PERFORM WELL UNDER PRESSURE

211
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,000
WILL NEVER MAKE IT TO THE TOP.

212
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,958
- Announcer: NUMBER SIXTEEN.
SECOND ATTEMPT, FAILED.

213
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,666
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?

214
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,541
I CAN'T GET THE RIGHT TAKE OFF.

215
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,333
AND THE FORM ON MY JUMP
WAS TERRIBLE!

216
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,666
IF I DROP THE BAR AGAIN, I'LL BE
OUT OF THE PRELIMINARY.

217
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,500
- HEY, SUZUKA!

218
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,916
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP
AND DON'T GIVE UP YET.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,541
YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN
JUMP THAT HEIGHT EASILY.

220
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,250
- ( gasps ) TSUDA SENPAI?

221
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,875
OH MAN, YOU'RE HOPELESS!

222
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,041
YOU BETTER FIND YOUR RHYTHM
OR YOU'RE OUTTA HERE!

223
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,541
LIKE THIS.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

224
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,291
- ARGH! STOP IT ALREADY,
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

225
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,416
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO DISQUALIFY
YOU IF YOU DON'T BE QUIET.

226
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,375
- OH, I'M SORRY, SIR.

227
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,458
- ( thinking ) IDIOT.

228
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,166
HERE GOES.

229
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,208
- WOULD YOU MIND GETTING A
LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER?

230
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,083
I CAN'T GET BOTH OF YOU
IN THE PICTURE.

231
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,166
- I'M NOT MOVING.

232
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,125
- YOU COULD SHOW
SOME APPRECIATION.

233
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,541
THE ONLY REASON YOU
MADE IT TO THE FINALS

234
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,708
IS BECAUSE I HELPED YOU.

235
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,041
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF,

236
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,125
I COULDA MADE THAT JUMP
EASILY WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

237
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,916
- BUT I DIDN'T HELP
YOU OUT IN THE FINALS

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,041
AND YOU ONLY MANAGED TO

239
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,333
COME IN AT AN EMBARRASSING
SIXTH PLACE.

240
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,916
- YOU ARE SO ARROGANT!

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,208
WHAT DOES AN IDIOT SPRINTER
LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT HIGH JUMP?

242
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,208
- YOU'VE REALLY GOT SOME FIRE
IN THAT TONGUE OF YOURS,

243
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,541
DON'T YOU, SUZI?

244
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,291
- KNOCK IT OFF. I'M TRYING
TO TAKE A PICTURE HERE,

245
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,375
AND I DON'T HAVE
ALL DAY YOU KNOW.

246
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,500
- ALL RIGHT, FINE. LET'S DO IT.

247
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,583
- ( camera clicks )

248
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,416
- Suzuka: TSUDA SENPAI RAN
THE HUNDRED METERS

249
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,083
IN TEN POINT EIGHT TWO SECONDS.

250
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,125
THAT WAS THE BEST TIME
IN THE COUNTRY THAT YEAR.

251
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,083
AND HE WAS OFF TO
NATIONALS ONCE AGAIN.

252
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,000
AND THEN, ONE DAY...

253
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,541
- AND THAT'S IT.

254
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,375
- THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND
TO HELP OUT.

255
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,875
CLEANING GOES A LOT QUICKER
WITH AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS.

256
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,416
- OH, NO PROBLEM. SO TODAY WILL
BE MY LAST DAY OF PRACTICE HERE.

257
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,791
AFTER NATIONALS TOMORROW,

258
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,750
I'LL BE LEAVING AND WE WON'T
BE TEAMMATES ANYMORE.

259
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,375
I HOPE I GO OUT WITH A BANG
AND BRING BACK A GOLD MEDAL.

260
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,416
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.

261
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,375
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT. AFTER ALL,

262
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,458
YOUR TIME IN THE REGIONALS WAS
THE BEST IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

263
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,375
- THANKS, BUT WHAT'S WITH YOUR
NEWFOUND FAITH IN ME?

264
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,958
- IT'S NOT NEW...

265
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,958
- WELL, I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

266
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,000
THIS IS THE NATIONALS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

267
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,708
- SENPAI...

268
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,333
- I KNOW I TEND TO COME OFF
A BIT COCKY AT TIMES.

269
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,500
BUT BEFORE A RACE I'M THE
MOST NERVOUS PERSON

270
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,166
ON THE STARTING LINE, ACTUALLY.

271
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,291
AND ALL I WANT TO DO
IS FIND A PLACE TO HIDE.

272
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,458
- REALLY? I THOUGHT
YOU NEVER GOT NERVOUS.

273
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,250
- WELL THEN, YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

274
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,958
'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS GOT
BUTTERFLIES BEFORE A RACE.

275
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,125
- HMM, I SEE.

276
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,875
- I WISH YOU COULD GO WITH ME.

277
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,625
I COULD USE A FRIENDLY FACE
ON THE SIDELINES.

278
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,500
- YOU'LL BE FINE. YOU
REALLY DON'T NEED ME

279
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,125
TO GO WITH YOU ANYWAY.

280
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,625
AND EVEN IF I DID GO, YOU'D
PROBABLY MAKE FUN OF ME

281
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,250
THE WHOLE TIME.

282
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,416
- LISTEN, SUZUKA.

283
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,208
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU

284
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,000
EVER SINCE THE DAY WE MET.

285
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,875
I'M SORRY THAT I WAS
ALWAYS MEAN TO YOU.

286
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,166
I WANTED TO BE MYSELF AND ACT
NATURALLY AROUND YOU

287
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,416
BUT I COULDN'T.

288
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,750
SO, I MASKED IT
BEHIND THE CONSTANT BICKERING.

289
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,583
- IT'S OKAY.

290
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,333
I MEAN, I DID THE SAME.

291
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,083
- SO YOU DON'T REALLY HATE ME?

292
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,833
- NO, I DON'T HATE YOU.

293
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,541
I DON'T.

294
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,208
- BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO
BE WITH YOU, SUZUKA.

295
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,458
- BUT YOU'RE GOING.

296
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,333
YOU'LL BE LEAVING SOON
AND THEN WHAT'LL WE DO?

297
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,625
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE CAN
FIGURE IT OUT.

298
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ME NOW.

299
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,541
WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK
FROM NATIONALS,

300
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,041
WITH THE GOLD MEDAL OF COURSE.

301
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,416
LATER.

302
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,125
- I'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT.

303
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,375
I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE LIKED ME.

304
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,208
WHAT SHOULD I DO? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL HIM.

305
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,875
( sighs )

306
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,166
I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY
HOW I FELT ABOUT YOU.

307
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,583
NOT UNTIL YOU WERE ALREADY GONE
AND BY THEN IT WAS TOO LATE.

308
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,416
I WISH I HAD THE CHANCE
TO TELL YOU HOW I FELT.

309
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,250
TSUDA.

310
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,708
- THE METROPOLITAN TOURNAMENT'S
COMING UP TOMORROW

311
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,458
AND AKITSUKI STILL HASN'T
SHOWN UP FOR PRACTICE.

312
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,166
- WELL, CAPTAIN, I STILL HAVE
HIM ENTERED AS OUR TOP SPRINTER.

313
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,000
BUT I AM STARTING TO WORRY
ABOUT HIM. I WONDER WHERE HE IS.

314
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,583
- SENPAI, I DON'T MIND
TAKING A LOOK AROUND

315
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,166
TO SEE IF I CAN FIND HIM.

316
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,375
- OKAY, THANKS, HASHIBA.

317
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,500
- NO PROBLEM.

318
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,375
- ( bell ringing )

319
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,208
- HEY, MR. TRACK AND FIELD,
YOU GOOFIN' OFF AGAIN?

320
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,250
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
- Miki: HEY, AKITSUKI.

322
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,041
- HMM?

323
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,041
JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING IN HERE?

324
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,750
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
AT PRACTICE.

325
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,625
- SORRY. I DON'T
FEEL LIKE GOING TODAY.

326
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,916
- COME ON! WOULD YOU
STOP BEING SO IRRESPONSIBLE?

327
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,375
YOU'RE REPRESENTING US
AT THE TOURNAMENT THIS WEEKEND.

328
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,083
- WHY DON'T YOU BACK OFF A BIT?

329
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,750
HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO TO PRACTICE.

330
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,875
- STAY OUT OF THIS.

331
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,333
LISTEN, IF YOU EVER HOPE
TO BE WITH SUZUKA

332
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,625
THEN YOU CAN'T GO
ON ACTING LIKE THIS.

333
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,250
I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE.

334
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,958
AKITSUKI, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

335
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,291
MIYAMOTO SENPAI BELIEVES IN YOU.

336
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,000
THAT'S WHY HE ENTERED YOU
IN THE TOURNAMENT.

337
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,291
COME TO PRACTICE
AFTER SCHOOL, OKAY?

338
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,166
( sighs )

339
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,875
- ( doorbell ringing )

340
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:47,875
- HMM?

341
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,250
YES.

342
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,833
OH, ASAHINA?

343
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,000
- I CAME TO ASK YOU
IF YOU'RE QUITTING THE TEAM.

344
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,458
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HARD
AND MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS.

345
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,708
I WAS BEGINNING TO
THINK THAT MAYBE

346
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,625
YOU WERE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.

347
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,000
BUT NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

348
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,583
- WHY WOULD YOU START...
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

349
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,416
WHAT? YOU ALWAYS WANTED ME
TO QUIT, DIDN'T YOU?

350
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,458
NOW I'M GIVING YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED.

351
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,166
- I SEE.

352
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,750
YOU CAN NEVER TAKE ANYTHING YOU
DO SERIOUSLY, CAN YOU, YAMATO?

353
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,041
YOU JOIN THE TEAM ON A WHIM,
THEN QUIT JUST AS EASILY.

354
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,125
YOU'RE JUST AN
IMPULSIVE LITTLE BOY.

355
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,916
- YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT,
'CAUSE I'M NOTHING LIKE HIM.

356
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,958
BECAUSE I'M NOT KAZUKI, AM I?

357
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,541
WHAT WERE YOU DOING, ASAHINA?

358
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,291
JUST USING ME AS A WAY
TO PRETEND TO BE WITH HIM?

359
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,125
IS THAT ALL THAT I AM TO YOU?

360
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,708
I'M TIRED OF BEING COMPARED
TO SOME DEAD GUY.

361
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,041
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

362
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:07,166
I GUESS THAT MAYBE I CROSSED
THE LINE BRINGING UP KAZUKI.

363
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,833
AND SHE LOOKED AT ME
WITH SUCH DISGUST.

364
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,458
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

365
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,416
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT
AKITSUKI MIGHT NOT BE COMING.

366
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,625
HEY, ASAHINA, HAVE YOU
HEARD ANYTHING FROM HIM?

367
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,958
- NO, NOT REALLY.

368
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,708
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

369
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,583
