IT'S ANOTHER HOT DAY.

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,833
SUMMER'S STARTED
WITH A VENGEANCE.

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,041
- BE HONEST WITH ME, ARE YOU
REALLY COMING TO PRACTICE TODAY?

27
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,041
- YEAH. I'LL BE THERE.

28
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,958
- WELL, GOOD.

29
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,000
- UM... ANYWAY,
I WAS THINKING...

30
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,583
- WE BETTER HURRY UP OR
WE'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

31
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,416
- ( he sighs )

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,041
- WHY IS SHE SO COLD?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,208
- ( bell tolls )

34
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,708
- AND NOW WE'LL BE MOVING ON
TO SOME WORD PROBLEMS,

35
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,333
EVERYONE'S FAVORITE.

36
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,458
TRAIN A LEAVES STATION...

37
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,166
- I WONDER IF SHE'S
STILL MAD AT ME.

38
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,583
I'M TIRED OF BEING COMPARED
TO SOME DEAD GUY...

39
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,000
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

40
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,250
- ( he screams )

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,416
- AFTER A FIGHT LIKE THAT...

42
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,208
I DON'T KNOW IF OUR FRIENDSHIP
WILL EVER BE THE SAME.

43
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,208
- AS MUCH AS I DON'T
WANT TO ADMIT IT,

44
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,083
I KNOW THAT AKITSUKI
STILL LIKES ASAHINA.

45
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,541
- ( puffing and panting )

46
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,416
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU IDIOT! RUN!

47
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,625
- ASAHINA DOESN'T SEEM
TO LIKE HIM.

48
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,000
BUT THEN WHY DID
SHE SAY THAT?

49
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,833
MAYBE SHE JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE HER TEAMMATE LOSE.

50
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,416
OR DOES SHE LIKE
AKITSUKI LIKE I DO?

51
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,000
- ( people chattering )

52
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,041
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

53
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,833
- ( whistle blows )

54
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,416
- THAT'S GONNA DO IT FOR TODAY.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,166
- ALL RIGHT!

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,500
- MAN... FINALLY.

57
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,791
- GOOD PRACTICE, AKITSUKI...
HERE'S A TOWEL.

58
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,916
- THANKS.

59
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,750
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD
YOU HOW NICE YOU ARE?

60
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,750
- NO. NOBODY'S EVER
TOLD ME THAT BEFORE.

61
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,625
- HEY, MANAGER.
I SURE COULD USE A TOWEL.

62
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,583
- I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT BE THIRSTY.

63
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,916
SO I BROUGHT YOU A
BOTTLE OF WATER AS WELL.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,291
- SHE IGNORED ME.

65
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,541
- I GUESS IT'S TIME
THAT I GET GOING.

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,041
OH. WAIT. AKITSUKI?

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,500
WE COULD WALK HOME

68
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,791
- TOGETHER IF YOU WANT.
- AKITSUKI!

69
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,416
- ( he coughs )

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,333
- FOR YOUR PUNISHMENT YOU HAVE
TO DO TWENTY EXTRA DASHES

71
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,875
EVERY DAY AFTER PRACTICE.

72
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,000
- WHAT'S THAT? I CAN'T
RUN ANY MORE TODAY.

73
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,166
AND WHAT'S THIS
PUNISHMENT FOR, ANYWAY?

74
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,791
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALREADY?

75
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:23,166
- OKAY, OKAY. I REMEMBER WHAT
I DID. I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,666
- ALL RIGHT. YOU BETTER GET
STARTED THEN.

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,375
- HE DIDN'T HURT YOU,
DID HE? AKITSUKI?

78
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,166
- WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE
SO HARD ON ME ALL THE TIME?

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,708
HE THINKS HE'S SO TOUGH.

80
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,375
- I THINK HE JUST EXPECTS
A LOT OUT OF YOU.

81
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,208
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

82
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,416
- YOU SHOULD GET STARTED.

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,875
I'LL STAY WITH YOU
UNTIL YOU FINISH UP.

84
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,750
- DON'T BE SILLY. THERE'S NO
REASON FOR YOU TO STAY.

85
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,666
- YEAH. BUT I...

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,583
- DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT
GOING TO SLACK OFF.

87
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,916
I'LL TAKE
MY PUNISHMENT. PROMISE.

88
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,708
- GOOD LUCK THEN.
I'LL SEE YA.

89
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,791
- LATER.

90
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,125
- AFTER I LEAVE, HE'LL BE
HERE ALONE WITH ASAHINA.

91
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,208
- GEEZ, ARE YOU SETTING UP
TO TRAIN SOME MORE?

92
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,791
- YEAH, IF I WANT TO DO
WELL AT THE REGIONALS,

93
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,541
I HAVE TO WORK HARD.

94
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,500
- I WONDER IF AKITSUKI
WILL EVER LIKE ME

95
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,291
THE WAY HE LIKES HER.

96
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,041
- ( puffing and panting )

97
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,708
- MAN, THIS IS ROUGH.

98
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,416
I WONDER HOW MUCH LONGER
SHE'LL GO ON IGNORING ME.

99
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,833
SHE'S SO MAD, IT'S LIKE I DON'T
EVEN EXIST TO HER ANYMORE.

100
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,250
I FEEL SO EMPTY AND HUNGRY.

101
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,916
I SHOULD FINISH AND GO HOME.

102
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,791
- I CAN'T LEAVE. I WANT
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

103
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,083
HE MUST BE DONE BY NOW.

104
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,625
SHOULD I GO CHECK?

105
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,541
- ( exhaling loudly )

106
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,875
- I'VE FINALLY
FINISHED ALL OF THEM.

107
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,916
ASAHINA.

108
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,458
SHE MUST BE LEAVING.

109
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,333
DAMN IT. CAN'T SHE EVEN
SAY A SINGLE WORD TO ME?

110
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,666
IT'S ONLY "GOODBYE."

111
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,541
- IF YOU WERE A BIT NICER,
THEN MAYBE I WOULD.

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,583
- I THOUGHT THAT YOU
HAD LEFT ALREADY.

113
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,041
- I FORGOT SOMETHING THAT
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,583
- OW!

115
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,708
- YOU REALLY SHOULD
BE STRETCHING

116
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,458
EVERY DAY
AFTER PRACTICE.

117
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,833
AND YOU CAN'T JUST
PRETEND TO STRETCH.

118
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,416
- YOU SAID YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO SAY.

119
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,541
WAS THAT IT, OR IS THERE MORE?

120
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,666
- I HAVE MORE.

121
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,083
- OW, OW, OW, OW, OW!

122
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,000
- YOUR STARTING STANCE
COULD USE WORK.

123
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,500
AND YOU LEAN FORWARD TOO
MUCH WHEN YOU'RE AT TOP SPEED.

124
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,541
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
THE LAST FEW RACES

125
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,000
AND I THINK YOUR TECHNIQUE
NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT.

126
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,166
- WHAT? YOU MEAN THAT
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME?

127
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,791
- YOU SHOULDN'T LET
IT GO TO YOUR HEAD.

128
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,708
I JUST THOUGHT I COULD HELP.

129
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,375
- OH. THANKS THEN. I GUESS.

130
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,125
MAYBE SHE DOES STILL
CARE FOR ME AFTER ALL.

131
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,375
BUT AS LONG AS WE CAN BE
FRIENDS, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

132
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,708
HONOKA. ARE YOU STILL HERE?

133
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,708
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
GONE HOME ALREADY.

134
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,458
- OH. I FORGOT SOMETHING
SO I THOUGHT

135
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,375
I'D STOP BY AND SEE
HOW YOU WERE COMING ALONG.

136
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,916
- I SEE. WELL, I JUST FINISHED.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,583
ASAHINA WAS JUST POINTING OUT
ALL OF MY SHORTCOMINGS TO ME.

138
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,666
ACCORDING TO HER,
I'VE GOT QUITE A FEW.

139
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,041
- I THOUGHT I'D GIVE
YOU SOME ADVICE

140
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,000
FROM ONE TEAMMATE
TO ANOTHER, GEEZ.

141
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,958
- OH. OKAY.

142
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,291
I'M SURE ASAHINA HAS HIGH
EXPECTATIONS FOR

143
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,916
AKITSUKI AS AN ATHLETE,
AND JUST WANTS HIM TO GET

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,083
BETTER TO HELP THE
TEAM AS A WHOLE

145
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,166
BUT I STILL WONDER, IF THERE'S
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

146
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,791
- ( whistle blows )

147
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:13,958
- OKAY. THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY.

148
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,250
- YOU DID WELL, AKITSUKI.

149
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,333
YOU DIDN'T SKIP PRACTICE
FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

150
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,375
- I BARELY MADE IT.

151
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,125
- WELL, YOU WON'T HAVE TO
PRACTICE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

152
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,750
YOU'LL HAVE THE
WHOLE DAY TO REST.

153
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,375
- AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE
PRACTICE ON SUNDAY.

154
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,500
- ( doorbell rings )

155
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,000
- HELLO?

156
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,833
- GOOD EVENING, SIR.
I'M WITH THE CABLE COMPANY.

157
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,958
- I THOUGHT THAT YOU WORKED
FOR THE NEWSPAPER.

158
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,333
- TODAY I'M HERE TO GET YOU
TO SIGN UP FOR CABLE.

159
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,625
SELLING NEWSPAPERS IS
MY OTHER PART TIME JOB.

160
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,208
- OH, IS THAT SO?

161
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,166
- IF YOU SIGN UP TODAY,
I'LL EVEN THROW

162
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,250
IN THESE FREE TICKETS
TO THE WATERPARK.

163
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,375
THESE ARE THE LAST
TWO THAT I HAVE.

164
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,041
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

165
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:10,000
- LIAR. YOU'VE PROBABLY
GOT TONS OF THOSE.

166
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,833
- YOU'RE SUCH A SUSPICIOUS KID.

167
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,291
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THIS TIME
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

168
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,458
TAKE THESE AND GO
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

169
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,416
AND IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT
CABLE, LET ME KNOW.

170
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,125
- BUT I DON'T
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

171
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,416
- WHAT? THE WATERPARK?

172
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,791
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

173
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,916
- YOU MEAN, ABOUT ASKING
SUZUKA TO GO WITH YOU?

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
- RIGHT.

175
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,166
- LISTEN, MAN. WHAT KIND
OF A RELATIONSHIP

176
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,041
DO YOU THINK A GUY
AND A GIRL HAVE

177
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,541
IF THEY GO TO THE POOL ALONE?

178
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,375
- UM, WHAT KIND?

179
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,791
- IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE IN SOME
MANGA OR TV DRAMA SERIES.

180
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,500
SO UNLESS SHE'S GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU

181
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,791
OR YOU'RE ALREADY GOING OUT,

182
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,541
THERE'S NO WAY SHE'D
GO WITH YOU.

183
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,666
- GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

184
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,125
- AND BESIDES. SHE ALREADY
SHOT YOU DOWN ONCE.

185
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,458
IF I WERE YOU,

186
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,250
I WOULDN'T WANNA GO
THROUGH THAT DISGRACE AGAIN.

187
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,500
DIDN'T YOU LEARN
ANYTHING LAST TIME?

188
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,208
- BUT I THOUGHT THAT
MAYBE SHE'D WANT TO GO

189
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,291
BECAUSE IT'S SOME GOOD
LOW-IMPACT EXERCISE.

190
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,458
- YOU DON'T NEED TO CONVINCE ME!

191
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,541
YOU'RE PROBABLY TOO
LATE ANYWAY.

192
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,666
I BET A GIRL LIKE SUZUKA

193
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,750
ALREADY HAS PLANS
FOR HER DAY OFF.

194
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,041
- YEAH, I BET YOU'RE RIGHT.

195
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,541
SHE'LL PROBABLY GO HOME.

196
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,708
- I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT, DUDE.

197
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,958
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

198
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,833
I SHOULDN'T ASK HER.

199
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,625
BESIDES, I'M AFRAID TO HEAR
THAT SHE ALREADY HAS PLANS.

200
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,500
- OH, AKITSUKI,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

201
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,166
- OH, HEY, HONOKA.

202
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,958
- IT'S HOT TODAY, ISN'T IT?

203
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,041
- UH-HUH, IT'S JULY ALREADY.

204
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,166
- AND I BET IT'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER HOT DAY TOMORROW.

205
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,291
- PROBABLY.

206
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,791
- SO TELL ME, AKITSUKI,

207
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,916
DO YOU HAVE PLANS TOMORROW?

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,750
- NOT YET. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

209
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,916
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,375
HOW 'BOUT WE GO TO
THE WATERPARK TOGETHER.

211
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,666
SEE, LOOK, TWO TICKETS.

212
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,375
A GIRL GAVE THEM TO ME
FOR FREE LAST NIGHT.

213
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,291
- WHAT? WITH ME?

214
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,083
- I KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE FOR.

215
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,500
THEY'RE FOR THAT
BRAND NEW WATERPARK.

216
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,625
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA GO?

217
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,208
BECAUSE I WOULD TOTALLY
LOVE TO JOIN YOU.

218
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,833
- YEAH, BUT WE WERE...

219
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,000
I WANTED THE TWO OF US TO GO.
JUST ME AND AKITSUKI.

220
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,083
- I WANNA GO, TOO.

221
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,708
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET A
GOOD LOW-IMPACT WORKOUT

222
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,791
WITHOUT STRAINING MY
HIP AND LEG JOINTS.

223
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,125
- HEY! SUZUKA. DO YOU
WANNA GO WITH US?

224
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,166
- GO WHERE?

225
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,083
- OH. THE FOUR OF US ARE GOING
TO THE WATERPARK TOMORROW.

226
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,875
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY JOIN US.

227
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,583
- MAYBE SHE ALREADY HAS PLANS.

228
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,250
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
TO COME WITH US.

229
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,916
- THERE'S NO WAY SHE'LL COME.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,250
I'M SURE SHE'LL GO
SEE TSUDA TOMORROW.

231
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,041
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

232
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,708
- WONDERFUL! I CAN'T WAIT.

233
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,666
- SWEET!

234
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,416
- DID SHE DECIDE TO
GO BECAUSE OF ME?

235
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,291
THERE'S NO TELLING
WITH THIS GIRL.

236
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,416
ASAHINA.

237
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DECIDED TO COME.

238
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,541
IT SEEMED LIKE SHE DECIDED
AFTER LOOKING AT ME.

239
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,500
MAYBE SHE CAME SO WE COULD
SPEND THE DAY TOGETHER.

240
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,875
- THANKS FOR WAITING.

241
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,583
- WEREN'T YOU EVER TOLD
IT'S NOT NICE TO STARE?

242
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,541
- I... I WASN'T STARING.

243
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,208
- ARE YOU PRACTICING TO BECOME
A DIRTY OLD MAN, AKITSUKI?

244
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,875
- I SAID I'M NOT STARING.

245
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,708
- HE CAN'T TAKE
HIS EYES OFF HER.

246
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,083
WELL, THANK YOU, BUT,
EVEN IF YOU DID GIVE ME

247
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:14,083
THE FREE TICKETS, WHO
WOULD I GO WITH?

248
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,666
- I'M SURE THERE'S AT LEAST
ONE BOY THAT YOU LIKE.

249
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,083
YOU SHOULD INVITE HIM
AND THEN TEMPT HIM

250
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,125
WITH A SEXY BATHING SUIT.

251
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:25,208
- I'LL DO MY BEST. I HOPE THIS
SWIMSUIT'S SEXY ENOUGH.

252
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,666
- IF ASAHINA DID DECIDE TO COME
BECAUSE OF ME,

253
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,166
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD
BE MORE AGGRESSIVE,

254
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,291
AND SHOW HER I WANT
TO BE WITH HER, TOO.

255
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,291
SO, HEY, WHAT DO...

256
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,333
- WE SHOULD GO
RIDE THE WATERSLIDE.

257
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,958
I HEARD IT'S THE TALLEST
IN THE WORLD.

258
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,250
- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
RUNNING AROUND THE POOL.

259
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,500
- BUT IF WE DON'T HURRY THEN
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.

260
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,125
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO, AKITSUKI?

261
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,083
- SAKURAI. HOW ABOUT WE GO AND
CHECK OUT THE WAVE POOL. HUH?

262
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,750
- AKITSUKI, WHY DON'T YOU
COME ALONG WITH US?

263
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,833
- NAH. I'LL JUST STAY HERE.

264
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,375
- WELL, OKAY.

265
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,666
- COME ON, LET'S GO ALREADY.

266
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,083
- ALL I'M INTERESTED IN
TODAY IS TRYING TO GET

267
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,750
CLOSER TO ASAHINA, AND MAKE
HER LIKE ME AGAIN.

268
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,083
- ( both screaming
and laughing )

269
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,083
- HOW MANY TIMES ARE THEY
GONNA RIDE THAT THING?

270
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,500
YOU'D THINK THEY'D BE
BORED OF IT BY NOW.

271
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,416
THEY'VE BEEN RIDING
IT FOR AN HOUR.

272
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,583
WHEN ARE THEY GONNA PAY
ATTENTION TO ME?

273
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,458
- Honoka: AKITSUKI?

274
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,875
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
GONE IN THE WATER YET,

275
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,083
HAVE YOU? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

276
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,000
- NOTHING. I JUST WANT TO
SIT HERE AND RELAX.

277
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,791
- HE'S SITTING HERE SO
HE CAN LOOK AT ASAHINA.

278
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,583
HEY. CAN I ASK YOU
A QUICK QUESTION?

279
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,333
DO YOU THINK THIS SWIMSUIT
IS TOO SMALL FOR ME?

280
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,791
IT FEELS A LITTLE TIGHT
IN THE CHEST AREA.

281
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,916
- ( he screams )
- I'VE GOT A BUG IN MY EYE.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,208
- I'M SORRY.

283
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,583
- HEY! I THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND YOU HERE, SAKURAI.

284
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,791
- COME ON, I WANNA GO ON
THE WATERSLIDE TOGETHER.

285
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,041
- OH. BUT I WAS JUST...

286
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,875
- HURRY UP, LET'S GO.

287
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,583
- WAIT, HOLD UP, KOBAYAKAWA.

288
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,375
I DON'T WANNA GO ON
THE WATERSLIDE.

289
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,000
- HERE SHE COMES.
NOW'S MY CHANCE.

290
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,083
- ASAHINA.

291
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,208
I THINK I'M GONNA GO GET SOME
JUICE. DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

292
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,625
MAYBE SHE'LL GO WITH
ME TO GET A DRINK.

293
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,125
- I COULD SURE USE
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

294
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,166
HOW ABOUT SOME JUICE, AKITSUKI?

295
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,291
- HUH?

296
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,916
- SUZUKA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,125
- WELL, I'LL HAVE A MELON SODA.

298
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,208
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

299
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,375
- LET'S RIDE THE
WATERSLIDE ONCE MORE

300
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,083
AND THEN WE CAN CHECK
OUT THE WAVE POOL.

301
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,333
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

302
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,250
- I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
SHE DIDN'T COME FOR ME.

303
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,041
MAYBE SHE JUST
LIKES THE POOL.

304
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:40,375
- DO YOU GUYS WANNA GO?
- I'M SO SUNBURNED.

305
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,416
- NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A GOOD DAY. I HAD A BLAST.

306
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,125
- ME, TOO.

307
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:50,083
- WELL, I DIDN'T MANAGE TO
GET ANY CLOSER TO ASAHINA.

308
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,875
- I HARDLY GOT A CHANCE
TO TALK TO AKITSUKI AT ALL.

309
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,416
- HOW ABOUT WE STOP AND GET A
BITE TO EAT BEFORE WE GO HOME?

310
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,625
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

311
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,708
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA EAT?
- I WANT SOME MEAT.

312
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,208
- MEAT?

313
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,500
- YEAH. LET'S GET
SOME BARBECUE.

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,250
- HEY, GUYS, WAIT UP.
DON'T LEAVE ME BEHIND.

315
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,083
DAMN SHOELACES.
THEY'RE ALWAYS TRIPPING ME UP.

316
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,708
ASAHINA. IS SHE
WAITING FOR ME?

317
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,958
SORRY.

318
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,208
HEY, ASAHINA.

319
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,208
I WAS JUST WONDERING...

320
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,500
- ( crackers burst )

321
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,250
- OH WOW! THOSE ARE AMAZING.

322
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,166
- HEY. AKITSUKI.

323
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,541
AKITSUKI?

324
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,375
- IT'S SO PRETTY.

325
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,375
- YEAH. THEY'RE REALLY
QUITE NICE.

326
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,291
THEY REMIND ME OF THE FIREWORKS
WE SAW AT THE PARADE.

327
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,375
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I'M COMING ON TOO STRONG.

328
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,375
IT'S JUST THAT...
OH, WELL, NEVER MIND.

329
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,583
- WELL, LET'S GO. I IMAGINE
EVERYONE'S WAITING FOR US.

330
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,958
- ASAHINA.

331
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,541
I JUST...

332
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,333
- IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T WANNA

333
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
GO THROUGH THAT DISGRACE AGAIN.

334
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,125
DIDN'T YOU LEARN
ANYTHING FROM LAST TIME?

335
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,625
- THERE THEY ARE.

336
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,125
- HEY. WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

337
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,083
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU EVERYWHERE.

338
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,500
I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER FIND YOU.

339
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,541
- SORRY. YAMATO'S
SHOELACES WERE UNTIED,

340
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,125
SO WE HAD TO STOP TO FIX THEM.

341
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,833
- YOU'D BETTER BE
CAREFUL, AKITSUKI.

342
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,375
- SORRY.

343
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,291
- LET'S GO GET SOMETHING
TO EAT ALREADY.

344
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,083
- OKAY.

345
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,375
I GUESS SHE MUST
STILL BE MAD AT ME.

346
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,291
- I SAID THAT MY FRIENDS
ASKED ME TO GO

347
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,916
TO THE WATERPARK
WITH THEM TODAY.

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,500
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH.
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

349
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,875
WE WENT EARLY AND
STAYED THE WHOLE DAY.

350
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,666
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT
OF FUN. I'M GLAD YOU WENT.

351
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,958
I JUST CALLED BECAUSE I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

352
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,041
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE COMING BACK
HOME TODAY TO VISIT KAZUKI,

353
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,416
BUT THEN YOU NEVER SHOWED UP.

354
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,000
- WELL, I WAS COMING, BUT...

355
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,375
- I UNDERSTAND. I HOPE YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME TODAY.

356
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,958
DID YOU GO WITH ANY
BOYS THAT YOU LIKE

357
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,541
OR WAS IT JUST THE GIRLS?

358
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,083
- THERE AREN'T ANY GUYS I LIKE
HERE. YOU'RE OUTTA YOUR MIND.

359
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,333
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE TO TALK ABOUT,

360
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,166
THEN I'M HANGING UP NOW.

361
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,291
- HEY, WAIT.

362
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,791
I THINK SHE WAS PROTESTING
A BIT TOO MUCH.

363
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,333
I CAN STILL READ THAT
GIRL LIKE AN OPEN BOOK.

364
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,333
KEEPING SUZUKA FROM
COMING BACK HOME, HUH?

365
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,208
I GUESS THAT GUY ISN'T DOING
TOO BAD FOR HIMSELF.

366
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,166
- ASAHINA.

367
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,208
I WAS WONDERING, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO WALK HOME WITH ME?

368
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,208
- SURE. I GUESS SO.

369
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,000
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

370
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,583
- GO AHEAD.

371
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,250
- IT'S JUST THAT IT SEEMS
THAT YOU AND AKITSUKI

372
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,625
ARE REALLY CLOSE, AREN'T YOU?

373
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,250
YOU TWO ARE ALWAYS HANGING OUT
TOGETHER AND HAVING FUN.

374
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,208
- IT'S NOT REALLY THAT MUCH FUN.
ALL I DO IS COMPLAIN.

375
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,958
- OH, REALLY? IS THAT ALL?

376
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,000
- I DON'T THINK I COULD I GET
CLOSE TO A GUY LIKE HIM.

377
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,541
WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING.

378
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,041
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

379
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,708
- THEN, IT'S OKAY?

380
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,333
- HUH? WHAT WAS THAT?

381
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,625
- IT'S OKAY IF I TELL
HIM HOW I FEEL?

382
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,666
I MEAN THAT... THE THING IS,
I REALLY LIKE AKITSUKI

383
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,166
AND I HAVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME,
SINCE BEFORE YOU KNEW HIM.

384
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,708
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

385
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,041
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

386
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,208
- I KNOW I DON'T.

387
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,958
BUT WHEN I SEE YOU TOGETHER

388
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,791
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT YOU
HAVE FEELINGS FOR AKITSUKI.

389
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,541
- I... I DON'T.

390
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,875
I JUST DON'T FEEL
THAT WAY ABOUT HIM.

391
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,375
I DON'T LIKE YAMATO LIKE THAT.

392
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,541
YAMATO.

393
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,666
- OH. SORRY.

394
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,625
- HONOKA?

395
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,208
- HEY, YOU KNOW THAT I DIDN'T
MEAN WHAT I SAID.

396
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,208
- IT'S FINE. I GET IT. REALLY.

397
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,750
I KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE ME.

398
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,208
I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW.

399
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,291
- SORRY.

400
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,916
- WE SHOULD REALLY BE GETTING
BACK. IT'S ALMOST DINNERTIME.

THAT WE WERE JUST GOOD FRIENDS.

434
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,375
BUT I REALIZED THAT MY EYES
WERE ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR HER.

435
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,083
FOR HONOKA.

436
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,625
IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF HAPPINESS

437
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,541
THAN BEING WITH ASAHINA.

438
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,541
WHEN I'M WITH HONOKA,
I FEEL COMPLETELY AT EASE.
