- ( chattering )

25
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,458
- Captain: BEFORE WE START
TODAY'S PRACTICE,

26
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,375
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU ALL
TO A NEW MEMBER OF OUR TEAM.

27
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,708
- I'M AKITSUKI. I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETING ALL OF YOU.

28
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,333
- HE ACTUALLY SIGNED UP?

29
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,583
- YEAH, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
- I'M SURPRISED.

30
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,041
I NEVER THOUGHT HE'D
ACTUALLY JOIN US.

31
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,791
- WE'VE SURE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.

32
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,250
YOU BLEW US AWAY WITH YOUR
TIME ON THE

33
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,583
HUNDRED-METER DASH
THE OTHER DAY.

34
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,958
- I WAS SURPRISED THAT YOU
WERE ABLE TO BEAT KOBAYAKAWA.

35
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,625
- THAT WAS AMAZING.

36
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,833
- ( chuckles )

37
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,625
- SO, AKITSUKI... HAVE YOU
DECIDED WHICH EVENT

38
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,041
YOU'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON YET?

39
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:24,291
- HUH? I THINK I'LL CHOOSE
THE HUNDRED-METER DASH.

40
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,666
- GOOD CHOICE.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,541
I THINK THAT'S THE PERFECT
PLACE FOR HIM, CAPTAIN.

42
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,041
HE SEEMS NATURALLY SUITED FOR
SHORT DISTANCE RUNNING.

43
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,500
- I AGREE.

44
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,416
PRACTICE MAY SEEM
A BIT ROUGH AT TIMES.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,958
JUST TRY YOUR BEST TO KEEP UP.

46
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,208
- I'LL DO WHAT I CAN, CAPTAIN.

47
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,916
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
STARTED! I WANT EVERYONE

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,958
TO SPLIT UP INTO TWO
GROUPS, GUYS AND GIRLS.

49
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,041
START OFF WITH THE "GOLDFISH
DROPPINGS" EXERCISE.

50
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,166
- WELL, THAT SHOULD BE A GOOD
ENOUGH WARM UP FOR ME TODAY.

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,416
- WHAT'S A GOLDFISH DROPPING?

52
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,833
THIS DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD YET.
THE PACE IS KINDA FAST,

53
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,625
BUT I THINK I CAN KEEP UP.

54
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,291
HOW MANY LAPS ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO RUN, MIYAMOTO SENPAI?

55
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,875
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

56
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
DON'T TELL ME WE HAVE TO DASH
FROM THE BACK OF THE LINE...

57
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,041
ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT.

58
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,625
- YOU'RE NEXT, AKITSUKI. GO!
- OKAY.

59
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,041
I CAN'T MAKE IT.

60
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,500
EVERYONE'S RUNNING
WAY TOO FAST.

61
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,666
THIS SEEMS LIKE WAY
MORE THAN JUST A WARM UP.

62
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,000
( panting )

63
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,916
I NEVER KNEW I COULD
FEEL THIS BAD.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
IT FEELS LIKE MY BODY IS
COMPLETELY SHUTTING DOWN.

65
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,375
NOBODY ELSE EVEN SEEMS
PHASED BY IT.

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
- SO, ARE YOU HAPPY
WITH YOURSELF?

67
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,666
YOU TOTALLY RUINED THAT
EXERCISE, YOU KNOW.

68
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
YOU TALKED WAY TOO MUCH AND
KEPT CHANGING YOUR FORM.

69
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,291
EVERYONE'S PACE SLOWED DOWN.

70
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,708
ALL YOU DID WAS SLOW US DOWN.

71
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:00,125
I KNEW THAT YOU WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT.

72
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,041
- Miki: GEEZ, WHAT A
TASKMASTER, HUH?

73
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:08,125
YOU MUST BE AKITSUKI. I'M MIKI
HASHIBA, NICE TO MEET YA.

74
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,583
I'M A SPRINTER, TOO. SO I'LL
GIVE YOU SOME TIPS IF YOU WANT.

75
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,791
- OH, THANKS, I GUESS.

76
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,375
- NOW THAT WE'RE
WARMED UP WE SPLIT UP

77
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,666
INTO OUR SEPARATE EVENTS.

78
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,125
SO COME ON, LET'S GO.

79
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,791
- WAIT. CAN'T I REST JUST
A BIT LONGER?

80
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,208
- SORRY, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

81
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,708
WE STILL HAVE A LOT LEFT
TO DO TODAY, YOU KNOW.

82
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,875
- ( groaning )

83
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,750
- Boy: EVERYBODY
FALL INTO FOUR LINES.

84
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,500
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO NOW?

85
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,750
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP. I
WANT YOU TO DO FOUR SETS

86
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,833
OF FIFTY-METER
DASHES. YOU GOT IT?

87
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,625
- All: GOT IT!
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

88
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,750
( exhaling heavily )

89
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,791
- WE'RE NOT DONE YET.
TWO MORE SETS TO GO.

90
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,625
COME ON, AKITSUKI. WE'RE
ONLY HALF WAY THERE.

91
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,875
- MY SIDES ARE CRAMPING...

92
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,833
THERE'S NO TIME TO CATCH
MY BREATH BETWEEN SETS.

93
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,208
- BECAUSE BEING
ON THE TEAM TAKES

94
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,208
A LOT OF HARD WORK
AND COMMITMENT...

95
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,458
WE'RE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO
IMPROVE OURSELVES.

96
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,958
BY ONE SECOND.
BY ONE CENTIMETER.

97
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,291
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE IT, YAMATO?

98
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,916
- SHE MAKES IT SEEM SO EASY

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,291
EVEN AFTER ALL OF THAT
RUNNING THAT WE JUST DID.

100
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,583
- Boy: AKITSUKI.
STOP DAYDREAMING.

101
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,250
- OH, SORRY.

102
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,916
- ( whistle blowing )

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,208
- Captain: THAT'S IT FOR
TODAY. GOOD JOB, GUYS.

104
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,208
- ( exhales ) I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S FINALLY OVER.

105
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,291
- Boy: MAN, I COULD DIE
FROM STARVATION.

106
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
- Soichi: LET'S GO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT THEN.

107
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,416
- GREAT IDEA.

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,833
- HEY, AKITSUKI! DO YOU WANNA
COME AND EAT WITH US?

109
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,250
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT FOOD RIGHT NOW.

110
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,125
- WELL, OKAY THEN, BUT MAKE
SURE THAT YOU STRETCH

111
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,875
AND COOL DOWN
PROPERLY, ALL RIGHT?

112
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,458
- I'M ALREADY DOWN AND OUT.

113
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,291
- ( Soichi chuckling )

114
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,291
- NO, I MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD
DO SOME COOL DOWN EXERCISES.

115
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,708
- YOU MEAN I HAVE TO
RUN SOME MORE?

116
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,666
- Soichi: TRUST ME, IT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

117
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,458
- Kobayakawa: LATER, ROOKIE.

118
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,875
- MY MOUTH IS SO DRY I CAN
BARELY SWALLOW...

119
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,000
I NEVER KNEW IT WOULD
BE THIS HARD.

120
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,750
MAYBE ASAHINA WAS
RIGHT ABOUT ME.

121
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,416
MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED
WHAT IT TOOK TO BE ON THE TEAM.

122
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,750
I DON'T KNOW.

123
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,208
SHE WORKS OUT
THIS HARD EVERY DAY

124
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:30,375
AND THEN SHE SEEMS TO BE TOTALLY
FINE AFTERWARDS.

125
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,041
HUH? ASAHINA?

126
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,083
SHE'S STILL PRACTICING?

127
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,291
- Miki: SHE'S QUITE
THE WORKAHOLIC, ISN'T SHE?

128
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,000
BESIDES WHAT SHE
DOES WITH THE TEAM,

129
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,375
SHE HAS THIS SPECIAL
TRAINING PROGRAM.

130
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,458
SUZUKA AND I WENT TO
DIFFERENT JUNIOR HIGH

131
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,500
SCHOOLS GROWING UP...

132
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,791
BUT I SAW HER AT
EVERY TRACK MEET,

133
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,208
AND SHE ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME.

134
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,583
SHE WAS SUCH A PERFECTIONIST.

135
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,833
- WHAT?

136
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,625
SHE WOULDN'T TOLERATE
ANYTHING BUT THE BEST

137
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,625
FROM HERSELF AND HER TEAMMATES.

138
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,750
WINNING WAS SO EASY FOR
HER. BUT SHE DIDN'T SMILE,

139
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,541
NOT EVEN WHEN SHE HAD WON.

140
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,791
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU ANGRY?
GOSH, I HATED HER.

141
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,708
BUT ONCE I GOT TO KNOW HER
BETTER, I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND.

142
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,500
HER GOALS ARE
JUST MUCH HIGHER.

143
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,250
SO SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED.

144
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,291
EVEN IF SHE'S THE CHAMPION.

145
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,166
AND I REALLY RESPECT
THAT ABOUT SUZUKA.

146
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,875
HOW SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO BETTER HERSELF.

147
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,583
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING.

148
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,875
I'M TRYING TO
IMPRESS HER WHEN

149
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,916
SHE'S THE STAR OF
THE TRACK TEAM.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,333
I WISH I COULD JUST
BE MYSELF AROUND HER...

151
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,208
BUT SHE ALWAYS
MAKES ME SO NERVOUS.

152
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,083
I FEEL LIKE THE CLOSER I GET TO
HER, THE FARTHER SHE SLIPS AWAY.

153
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,458
- MIKI, CAN I GET YOU TO TELL
ME HOW MY FORM LOOKS?

154
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,708
- SURE.

155
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,416
WELL, I GUESS
SUZUKA NEEDS MY HELP

156
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,208
SO I'LL BE SEEING YOU LATER.

157
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,250
YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND
GET SOME REST.

158
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,291
- I'D LOVE TO BUT I
DON'T THINK I CAN GET UP

159
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,458
RIGHT NOW, MUCH LESS WALK HOME.

160
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,041
( laughs )

161
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:57,000
- HEY! THERE YOU ARE, YAMATO.
YOU READY TO GO HOME YET?

162
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,458
YOU DON'T LOOK SO HOT.

163
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,958
- SAY SOMETHING TO US, AKITSUKI.
- WHY ARE YOU GUYS HERE?

164
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,333
- 'CAUSE I KNEW WE'D
HAVE TO DRAG YOU HOME.

165
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,458
I FIGURED YOUR FIRST DAY
WOULD REALLY WIPE YOU OUT.

166
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,250
GUESS I WAS RIGHT.

167
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,583
- HERE, LET ME HELP TOO.

168
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,166
- WELL, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
BE CAREFUL ON YOUR WAY HOME!

169
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,291
- SURE THING.

170
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,750
- SO ARE YOU STILL
GLAD YOU JOINED THE TEAM?

171
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,250
- AMAZING.
- HUH?

172
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,750
- ASAHINA'S AMAZING...
SHE REALLY IS.

173
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,250
- I THINK YOU'RE SO TIRED YOUR
BRAIN'S SHUTTING DOWN ON YOU.

174
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,416
- NO, I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
- Honoka: I'M LOSING MY GRIP.

175
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,166
OH, I'M SO INCREDIBLY
SORRY, AKITSUKI.

176
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,833
- ( chuckling )
DUDE! YOUR FACE!

177
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,375
- THERE'S NO OTHER WORD TO
DESCRIBE ASAHINA THAN "AMAZING."

178
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,541
( screaming )

179
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,125
- AND THAT'S EVERYTHING THAT
WILL BE COVERED ON THE TEST.

180
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,083
NOW MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT LATE
TOMORROW, 'CAUSE IF YOU ARE,

181
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,500
I'M LOCKING YOU OUT.

182
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,416
- ( groaning )

183
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,500
- HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN A
LOT OF PAIN.

184
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,250
EVERY DAY, YOU PUSH YOURSELF
SO HARD. I DON'T GET IT.

185
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,291
- AH, I THOUGHT I'D
FIND YOU HERE.

186
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,875
- OH, HEY THERE, HATTORI.

187
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,625
- I DIDN'T THINK IT
WOULD LAST THIS LONG.

188
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,750
- I KNOW, HE'S BEEN ENDURING THE
PRACTICES FOR OVER A WEEK.

189
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,250
- ( sighs ) NOT HIM. I WAS
TALKING ABOUT YOU, SAKURAI.

190
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,833
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

191
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,666
- YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE
EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL

192
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,416
AND WATCHING HIM PRACTICE.

193
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,416
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND
JOIN THE TEAM ALREADY?

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,250
IT'S TAKING UP ALL
YOUR FREE TIME AS IT IS.

195
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,000
BUT I GUESS THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE...

196
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,291
'CAUSE YOU'RE WAY TOO SLOW.

197
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,166
- WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

198
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,791
( panting )

199
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,666
IF I WANTED TO...
I COULD RUN FAST.

200
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,166
- HURRY BEFORE THEY CLOSE.

201
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,291
- DON'T WORRY, THE COMIC SHOP'S
OPEN FOR ANOTHER HOUR AT LEAST.

202
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,708
- OH, WOW. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
KIDS SURE ARE FAST THESE DAYS.

203
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
IT'S PERFECT.

204
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,208
- NOW LISTEN. THIS'LL BE OUR
LITTLE SECRET, OKAY?

205
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,916
- EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON AKITSUKI.

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,250
- ( cat meowing )

207
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,333
- OH, HELLO, GORO.

208
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,541
AND HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

209
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,625
YOUR NOSE SURE IS DIRTY.

210
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,666
SOMETIMES I WISH
THAT I WERE YOU, GORO...

211
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,666
'CAUSE THEN I'D BE ABLE
TO BE AROUND AKITSUKI

212
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,750
WHENEVER I WANTED.

213
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,875
AND HE'D GIVE ME TONS
OF ATTENTION.

214
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,625
'CAUSE THE WAY
THINGS ARE NOW,

215
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,791
HE HARDLY SEEMS
TO KNOW I'M ALIVE.

216
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,916
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHAT I SHOULD

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,583
OR EVEN COULD DO TO
MAKE HIM NOTICE ME MORE.

218
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,583
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE
ANY WORDS OF ADVICE, GORO.

219
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,666
- Yuka: THAT'S SO SAD.

220
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
I HAVE TO SAY I'M A
LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED

221
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,166
YOU DIDN'T COME TO ME

222
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,458
WITH YOUR TROUBLES, SAKURAI.
I MEAN, I'M FULL OF GOOD ADVICE.

223
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,791
- UM, SO THEN, WHY DID WE HAVE
TO COME TAKE A BATH TOGETHER?

224
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,541
- THEY SAY YOU HAVE
TO BE NAKED IN ORDER

225
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,041
TO HEAR THE NAKED TRUTH.

226
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,666
- I SEE. AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T
THINK YOU EVER TOLD ME.

227
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,833
HOW EXACTLY IS IT THAT
YOU KNOW AKITSUKI?

228
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,666
- OH, HE AND I GO WAY BACK.
- OH.

229
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,083
- AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

230
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,375
LATELY I'VE BEEN A
LITTLE BIT WORRIED

231
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,291
ABOUT YAMATO'S STATE
OF MIND, YOU KNOW.

232
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,625
HE CAN BE SO IMPULSIVE.
ALWAYS MAKING DECISIONS

233
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,958
WITHOUT THINKING
THEM THROUGH.

234
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,208
- WELL, I GUESS I COULD
SEE THAT...

235
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,875
BUT TO ME, AKITSUKI'S
ALWAYS SEEMED SO SINCERE,

236
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,916
AND SERIOUS, AND RELIABLE.

237
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,791
- REALLY? EVEN AFTER HE'S
MADE THIS INSANE ATTEMPT

238
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,833
FOR ATTENTION FROM A GIRL
WHO REJECTED HIM?

239
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,208
- HUH? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, WHO REJECTED HIM?

240
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,375
- OH, WELL...
NO ONE.

241
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,333
- JUST TELL ME. WHO WAS IT?

242
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,458
- WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU WERE GOING
TO FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER.

243
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,958
OKAY, YAMATO TOLD SUZUKA THAT HE
LIKED HER, RIGHT?

244
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,833
BUT SHE REJECTED HIM. AND HE
INSISTS THAT HE STILL LIKES HER.

245
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,666
- ( gasps )

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
AKITSUKI TOLD ASAHINA
THAT HE LIKED HER?

247
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,916
- HE SAYS THAT HE'S NEVER
GONNA GIVE UP ON HER,

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,166
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

249
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,666
THAT HE JOINED THE TRACK
TEAM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

250
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,875
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
TOO MUCH, HONOKA...

251
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,375
LIKE ALL MEN,

252
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,000
YAMATO IS ALWAYS CHANGING HIS
MIND ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS.

253
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,458
YOU'LL GET YOUR
CHANCE, I'M SURE.

254
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE
BEEN SO FOOLISH.

255
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,750
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

256
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,333
- THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN
PUSHING HIMSELF SO HARD.

257
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,250
HE'S TRYING TO IMPRESS ASAHINA.
I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE WITH HIM.

258
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,958
- WAIT, NO, THAT'S NOT THE
WAY TO THE DRESSING ROOM.

259
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,333
- I HAVE TO BE STRONG. I WON'T
LET THIS MAKE ME CRY.

260
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,333
I'M NOT GONNA CRY...
I'M NOT GONNA...

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,125
( whimpering )

262
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,416
( Honoka sobbing )

263
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,666
- I SWEAR I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING, HONOKA.

264
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,500
I COULDN'T HAVE. THE
STEAM MADE IT HARD TO SEE.

265
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,291
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M UPSET.

266
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,041
- ( gasps ) THEN WHY
ARE YOU CRYING?

267
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,250
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO IN A
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

268
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,750
I'LL WALK YOU HOME,
IT'S GETTING DARK.

269
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,125
YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

270
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,041
- NO PROBLEM. I'D WORRY
ABOUT YOU IF I DIDN'T.

271
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,333
- YOU MUST BE REALLY TIRED
AFTER PRACTICE.

272
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,416
- I'M ALL RIGHT, ACTUALLY.
I'M GETTING USED TO IT.

273
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,333
- I SEE. AND HE DOESN'T MIND

274
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,833
BECAUSE HE GETS TO
BE WITH ASAHINA.

275
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,583
COULD YOU WAIT HERE

276
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,166
WHILE I RUN INTO THE
CONVENIENCE STORE REAL QUICK?

277
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,250
- SURE.

278
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,541
- Store Clerk: THANKS.
COME AGAIN.

279
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,041
- I'M SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING, AKITSUKI.

280
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,875
- THAT'S OKAY.

281
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,416
- WHAT DID YOU GET, ANYWAYS?
- NOTHING MUCH, REALLY.

282
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,833
YOU WANNA SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE?

283
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,791
HERE.

284
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,750
I REMEMBERED YOU
SAID YOU LIKED THESE,

285
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,416
SO I WENT AHEAD AND GOT YOU ONE.

286
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,916
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
- I KNOW.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,250
BUT I WANTED TO THANK
YOU FOR WALKING ME HOME.

288
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,833
- THEN THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.

289
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,250
I'M STARVING, AND I'M SURE
THIS WILL HIT THE SPOT.

290
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,666
- TASTY.
- IT'S SO GOOD.

291
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,041
- I KNOW. BUT ASAHINA
WAS SUSPICIOUS

292
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,541
AND DIDN'T WANT TO TRY THEM.

293
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,916
BUT SHE DID AND LOVED THEM,
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO DELICIOUS!

294
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,500
- THEY ARE.

295
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,916
EVEN THOUGH HE'S HERE WITH ME,
HE'S STILL THINKING OF ASAHINA.

296
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,833
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONOKA?
- OH, I'M FINE.

297
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,416
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG.

298
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,750
IT'S JUST... HEY.

299
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,083
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

300
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,875
THAT I'M THINKING OF JOINING
THE TRACK TEAM, TOO.

301
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,375
- REALLY? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEP.

302
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,458
I WON'T GIVE UP EITHER.

303
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,458
- YOU KNOW...
IT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK.

304
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,166
- I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

305
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,625
I'LL DO ANYTHING TO BE WITH
YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN.

306
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,750
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M HONOKA SAKURAI.

307
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,833
I'M YOUR NEW TEAM MANAGER.

308
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,083
- YOU'RE SO CUTE.

309
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,541
- WE'VE NEVER HAD A
MANAGER BEFORE.

310
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,750
- EVERYONE'S JOINING THE TEAM.

311
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,000
BUMMER! I'LL HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE TO HANG OUT WITH.

312
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,916
HEY, YUKA. IT'S ME. WANNA GO
HIT UP SOME KARAOKE?

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,250
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU MEANT THAT

314
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,083
YOU WERE GONNA BE
THE TEAM MANAGER.

315
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,708
- I'M HORRIBLE AT SPORTS, BUT I
WANNA BE PART OF THE TEAM,

316
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,916
SO I THOUGHT I'D
BE BETTER SUITED

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,791
TO MANAGERIAL TASKS INSTEAD.

318
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,541
- I SEE.

319
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,958
- SO THE NEW GIRL'S PRETTY GOOD
FRIENDS WITH AKITSUKI.

320
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,750
- I GUESS SO.

321
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,208
- MAYBE SHE'S HIS GIRLFRIEND.

322
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,208
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, MIKI.

323
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,166
LET'S GET GOING.

324
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,083
- HEY! WOULD YA HOLD ON A
SECOND! SUZUKA.

325
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,791
- THIS IS THE LAST
ONE, AKITSUKI.

326
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,500
I WANT YOU TO GIVE
IT ALL YOU GOT.

327
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,875
- SURE.

328
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,666
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I'D BE
DOING SO MUCH LAUNDRY.

329
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,708
YUCK!

330
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,500
I THOUGHT THAT BEING A
MANAGER WOULD HELP ME

331
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,916
TO GET CLOSER TO AKITSUKI.

332
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,750
BUT IT HASN'T REALLY
TURNED OUT THAT WAY.

333
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,708
- Captain: THAT'S IT.
WE'RE DONE FOR TODAY.

334
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,541
- GEEZ, I FEEL SO EXHAUSTED.

335
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,708
( panting )

336
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,958
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE COMING
ALONG NICELY, AKITSUKI.

337
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,166
YOU EVEN MANAGED TO KEEP
UP WITH THE BEST OF US.

338
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,041
- NOTHING. JUST A
LITTLE MUSCLE PAIN.

340
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,375
- WELL, IT HAS BEEN A WEEK SINCE
YOU JOINED UP, YOU KNOW.

341
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,625
I'LL BET YOU'RE AT THE PEAK
OF YOUR SORENESS.

342
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,208
I CAN GIVE YOU A MASSAGE
IF YOU WANT.

343
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,125
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT IT. I'LL
WORK WONDERS ON YOUR BACK.

344
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,750
- ( exclaiming in pain )

345
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,125
- STOP SQUIRMING.
- CUT IT OUT.

346
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,708
- HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN
ON FOOLING AROUND?

347
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
WE STILL HAVE WORK
TO DO, YOU KNOW.

348
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,916
- YOU'RE NOT CALLING ME LAZY,
ARE YOU, ASAHINA?

349
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,166
- SO WHAT IF I AM?

350
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,375
- OKAY, I'M NOT GREAT YET,
BUT I'M WORKING HARD.

351
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,791
- HEY! AKITSUKI AND HASHIBA,
GET OVER HERE,

352
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,083
WE'RE ABOUT TO START WITH
THE TWO-HUNDRED METER INTERVALS.

353
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,291
- BE RIGHT THERE.

354
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,458
IF SHE'S JUST GOING TO PICK
FIGHTS WITH ME ALL THE TIME...

355
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,833
THEN WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ME
JOINING THE TEAM?

356
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,416
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU
MIGHT HAVE BEEN

357
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,208
A LITTLE HARD ON HIM, SUZUKA?

358
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,458
HE'S REALLY TRYING HIS BEST,
YOU KNOW?

359
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,291
- MAYBE HIS BEST
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

360
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,833
AND YOU SEEM TO BE SLACKING
OFF TOO, MIKI.

361
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,333
- SUZUKA, WHAT'S WRONG?

362
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,500
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
REALLY WEIRD LATELY AND...

363
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,458
- WHAT? NOTHING'S
WRONG WITH ME. I'M FINE.

364
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,041
- WHATEVER YOU SAY THEN...

365
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,875
BUT YOU ALWAYS GET SO
IRRITATED WITH AKITSUKI.

366
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,166
JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
HE'S NOT ALL BAD.

367
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,041
AND HE IS WORKING REALLY HARD.

368
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,750
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND ASAHINA.

369
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,666
I KNOW SHE WASN'T HAPPY
ABOUT ME JOINING THE TEAM.

370
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,791
I THOUGHT THAT IF I WORKED
REALLY HARD, SHE'D COME AROUND.

371
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,250
BUT I'VE BEEN
DOING REALLY WELL,

372
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:13,250
AND SHE'S STILL AS
BITTER AS EVER.

373
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,250
MAN, WHY'S SHE GOTTA
BE SO CUTE?

374
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,958
- HEY, QUIT YOUR
DAYDREAMING, YAMATO.

375
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,125
YOU'RE HOLDING UP THE LINE.

376
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,250
- SORRY.

377
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,833
I'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP
WORKING HARD.

378
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,916
AND HOPE THAT SHE FINALLY
COMES AROUND.

379
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,250
- WHAT A SHOW OFF.

380
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,541
- Miki: AND HE IS
WORKING REALLY HARD...

381
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,333
- WELL HE MAY BE
WORKING HARD NOW,

382
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,125
BUT I'M SURE HE'LL GIVE UP
SOONER OR LATER.

383
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,916
- I FINALLY FINISHED IT.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,500
AND NOW I CAN TAKE
AKITSUKI A CLEAN TOWEL.

385
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,500
- HEY! MANAGER!

386
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,458
WILL YOU BRING US SOME
MORE WATER, PLEASE?

387
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,041
- SURE THING.

388
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,375
- ( whistle blowing )

389
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,000
- Captain: OKAY, OKAY.
WE'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.

390
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,208
EVERYONE BE SURE TO COOL
DOWN BEFORE YOU GO HOME.

391
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,916
- WE'RE FINALLY DONE.
- IT'S TIME TO EAT.

392
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,875
- STOP IT, I SAID THAT
I HAD ENOUGH.

393
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,416
- AND I'M SAYING THAT
WE NEED TO DO THIS PROPERLY.

394
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,791
- HEY, AKITSUKI.
I BROUGHT YOU A TOWEL.

395
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,833
- THANKS, MANAGER.

396
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,291
- Honoka: IT WAS MY PLEASURE.
- Yamato: OH, SORRY.

397
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,833
- ( Honoka and
Yamato laughing )

398
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,083
- I HOPE THAT DIDN'T HURT.
- LAZY.

399
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,041
- ( grunts loudly )

400
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,000
- EXACTLY LIKE YOU SAID.
I PUT IT AT 164.

401
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,958
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SET
THE TOP OF THE BAR TO THE MARK,

402
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,250
NOT THE BOTTOM, YOU IDIOT!

403
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,500
- HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
I'M NOT IN TRACK AND FIELD!

404
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,833
YOU KNOW THAT!

405
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,250
( screaming )

406
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,375
- WHAT HAPPENED?

407
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:12,166
WOW, AMAZING. YOU CAN SEE A
WHOLE CITY FROM UP HERE.

408
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,416
- THERE'S A CITY
DOWN THERE. LOOK.

409
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,250
- WHAT?

410
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,791
- I'M SORRY.

411
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,250
MAYBE I'M WRONG...
ABOUT YAMATO.

412

ABOUT ME THAT YOU DON'T LIKE?

446
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,375
I DON'T GET YOU AT ALL.

DESPISE BEING AROUND YOU.
