- COME ON, YASUNOBU. YOU COULD
AT LEAST TRY TO KEEP UP.

25
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,958
- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAD TO DRAG ME

26
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,250
OUT OF BED AT EIGHT
ON A SUNDAY MORNING.

27
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,291
- 'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA
LIE AROUND MY ROOM ALL DAY

28
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,000
AND BE DEPRESSED. THAT'S WHY.

29
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,583
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO YOUR
TRACK MEET AND LET ME SLEEP?

30
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,958
IT IS TODAY, ISN'T IT?

31
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,666
- THAT'S THE LAST PLACE
I WANNA BE.

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,791
AFTER SHE SAID SUCH
HORRIBLE THINGS TO ME

33
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,875
AND EVEN SLAPPED ME.

34
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,791
I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER
WANT TO SEE ASAHINA AGAIN.

35
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,333
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO
TO THAT KARAOKE PLACE.

36
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,291
- THERE'S NO WAY IT'S OPEN YET.

37
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,500
- I'M TIRED OF BEING
COMPARED TO SOME DEAD GUY.

38
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,666
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,833
- BUT I, I WAS JUST
WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

40
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,958
- Reporter: HE'S HERE.

41
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,375
- OVER HERE!

42
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,875
- ARIMA, OVER HERE.

43
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,375
- Woman: HOW'RE YOU
FEELING TODAY?

44
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,958
- Man: FEEL LIKE BREAKING
ANY RECORDS? ( chuckles )

45
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,125
- WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

46
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,375
- OH, THAT'S
AKITSUKI'S COMPETITION.

47
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,250
EMERSON ARIMA, A SOPHOMORE

48
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,666
AT TOHTO UNIVERSITY
PREPARATORY ACADEMY.

49
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,791
HE'S THIS YEAR'S TOP
HIGH SCHOOL SPRINTER.

50
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,750
IN JUNIOR HIGH, HE WAS
ALWAYS OUTSHONE

51
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,166
BY KAZUKI AT THE
KANAGAWA PREFECTURE.

52
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,666
BUT SINCE HE'S
ENTERED HIGH SCHOOL,

53
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,583
HIS TALENT'S REALLY
BEGUN TO GROW.

54
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,750
- YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF HIM.

55
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,208
- IF KAZUKI WERE STILL ALIVE,

56
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,416
I'M SURE THEY'D BE EACH
OTHER'S STIFFEST COMPETITION.

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,708
- IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT,

58
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,166
TSUDA SENPAI WOULD BE THE
ONE IN THE SPOTLIGHT

59
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,666
INSTEAD OF THAT GUY.

60
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,291
- WELL, YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
HOWEVER, WE'VE GOT AKITSUKI.

61
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,291
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE HIM.

62
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,583
- YOU DON'T HONESTLY THINK
HE'S STILL COMING, DO YOU?

63
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,708
I MEAN, REALLY.
HE'S SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

64
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,666
- WHY DO YOU GET SO ANGRY
EVERY TIME I BRING UP AKITSUKI?

65
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,666
- AND IF SENPAI WERE
STILL ALIVE TODAY,

66
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,958
THERE WOULD BE NO COMPETITION.

67
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,708
HE'D BEAT ARIMA EASILY.
A GUY LIKE ARIMA...

68
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,541
HE'S NOWHERE NEAR THE SAME
LEVEL AS TSUDA SENPAI.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,291
- BE QUIET.
EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU.

70
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,708
- I DON'T CARE WHO'S LISTENING.
- BUT...

71
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,250
- YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,708
SO LET ME PICK A DESTINATION.

73
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,333
- SURE. WAIT, WHERE?

74
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,666
- IF I TOLD YOU NOW,
IT'D RUIN THE SURPRISE.

75
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,750
- ( sighs )

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,458
- YOU BROUGHT ME
TO THE TRACK MEET?

77
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,875
- WELL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME
IF I HAD TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

78
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,625
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

79
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,125
- AND I'M NOT DOING THIS PURELY
OUTTA THE KINDNESS OF MY HEART.

80
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,041
THERE'S A LOTTA HOT GIRLS
IN THERE JUST MILLING ABOUT.

81
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,333
YOU CAN RUN OR NOT,
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

82
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,833
BUT I BET IF YOU DO, YOU'LL BE
A BABE MAGNET, YOU KNOW?

83
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,625
- SHUT UP.

84
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,375
AND I ALL READY TOLD YOU.

85
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,666
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
FOR ME TO EVEN TRY ANYMORE.

86
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,958
- IS THAT SO?

87
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,333
THEN LET'S JUST HANG AROUND
A WHILE.

88
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,000
THERE ARE GIRLS
IN SHORT SHORTS IN THERE.

89
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,250
- HEY, YASUNOBU. LET GO OF ME.

90
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,291
I MEAN IT. I WANT TO GO HOME.

91
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,666
- HEY, THERE'S SUZUKA.

92
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,750
AND WE'RE JUST IN TIME TO SEE
SOME JERK MAKE A MOVE ON HER.

93
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,833
- HELLO THERE.

94
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,500
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, HASN'T IT?

95
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,333
- WHAT? CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

96
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,791
- WOW, BACK OFF! I SEE
YOU'RE STILL THE SAME

97
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,833
AS YOU ALWAYS WERE.

98
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,541
- I'M SORRY,
BUT WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

99
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,875
- YOU WERE ALWAYS WITH TSUDA
DURING PREFECTURAL COMPETITIONS,

100
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,250
WEREN'T YOU?

101
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,375
YOU GUYS SEEMED
TO BE REALLY CLOSE.

102
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,375
I ALWAYS WONDERED
IF YOU WERE DATING.

103
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,625
- MAN, TELL ME THIS ISN'T
PAINFUL FOR YOU TO WATCH.

104
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,375
- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
NOT AT ALL.

105
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,958
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE TO SAY THEN LEAVE ME ALONE.

106
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,083
- NO, I'M NOT DONE
WITH YOU QUITE YET.

107
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,666
I OVERHEARD YOU EARLIER.

108
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,708
I BELIEVE YOU SAID I WASN'T
ON THE SAME LEVEL AS TSUDA.

109
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,458
AND BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
IT REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

110
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,583
- WELL THEN, I GUESS
THAT I'M SORRY.

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

112
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,791
- WELL, THAT WASN'T
MUCH OF AN APOLOGY.

113
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,875
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO ACCEPT THAT.

114
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,125
- YOU SURE ARE PERSISTENT.

115
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,458
YOU'RE JUST ANGRY BECAUSE
IT'S THE TRUTH.

116
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,083
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

117
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,625
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF TSUDA'S ALIVE OR DEAD.

118
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,416
I'M THE NUMBER ONE SPRINTER.

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,291
- IF TSUDA SENPAI WERE ALIVE,
HE COULD BEAT YOU.

120
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,583
- HA. YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

121
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,625
"AW, IF TSUDA WERE ALIVE,
IF TSUDA WERE ALIVE."

122
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,208
WELL, LISTEN UP.
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

123
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,791
BUT YOUR PRECIOUS
TSUDA SENPAI IS DEAD.

124
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,916
SO, AS YOU CAN
CLEARLY SEE, MY DEAR,

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,708
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL THAT
I'M ON A LOWER LEVEL THAN TSUDA.

126
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,416
GIVE ME A BREAK.

127
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,875
- HEY, THAT GIRL'S
TALKING SMACK TO ARIMA.

128
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,958
- WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

129
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,791
- YOU NEED TO WATCH
YOUR MOUTH, LITTLE GIRL.

130
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,875
- APOLOGIZE IN FRONT
OF EVERYONE, NOW.

131
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,458
( chuckles ) MAYBE THEN,
WE'LL FORGIVE YOU.

132
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,750
- LET'S GO. IF WE STEP IN NOW,
WE'LL BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

133
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,458
- SURE.

134
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,541
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME
TO INTERVENE.

135
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,750
NONE AT ALL.

136
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,791
- HEY, HOLD UP.

137
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,375
- YA... YAMATO?

138
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,000
- WHAT'S THIS?
ARE YOU HERE TO APOLOGIZE

139
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,708
ON YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND'S
BEHALF, MR. SPIKY HAIR?

140
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,541
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR, ASAHINA.

141
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,458
- WHAT WAS THAT?

142
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,375
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU AGREE WITH HER.

143
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,583
- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
IF YOU'RE BETTER THAN KAZUKI.

144
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,666
BECAUSE I CAN RUN FASTER
THAN THE TWO OF YOU COMBINED.

145
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,750
- ( gasps )

146
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,541
- HUH?

147
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,083
- LOOK AT THIS STUPID PUNK.

148
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,375
CLEARLY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

149
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,041
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO?

150
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,125
- YOU'RE WRONG.
I DO KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

151
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,625
AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING
TO LOSE TO YOU TODAY.

152
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,625
- MAN, THIS GUY
MUST BE TOTALLY INSANE.

153
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,208
- YEAH, HE'S KIDDING
HIMSELF IF HE THINKS

154
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,000
HE CAN ACTUALLY BEAT ARIMA.

155
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,041
- YAMATO! ARE YOU CRAZY?

156
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,125
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

157
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,041
( sighs ) I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

158
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,208
- HEY, HOLD ON. WE'RE NOT DONE.

159
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,708
- SO, AM I TO UNDERSTAND
WE'LL BE COMPETING LATER

160
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,250
IN THE HUNDRED-METER
DASH? YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE

161
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,916
TO PROVE IF YOU'RE
FASTER THAN ME OR NOT.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,666
( chuckles )
WHAT AN ASS.

163
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,291
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
WERE YOU THINKING, YAMATO?

164
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,750
WHY DID YOU SAY THOSE THINGS?

165
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,333
- BECAUSE I WAS PISSED OFF.

166
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,125
HE'S GOT SUCH A COCKY ATTITUDE.

167
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,208
- YOU DID ALL THAT
BECAUSE YOU WERE UPSET?

168
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,250
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
IF YOU LOSE TO THAT JERK LATER?

169
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,583
OR DID YOU NOT THINK
THAT FAR AHEAD?

170
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,333
- IF I LOSE THEN I SUPPOSE
I'LL OWE THE GUY AN APOLOGY,

171
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,458
WON'T I?

172
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,791
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE SO IMPETUOUS?

173
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,250
YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY
TO THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK.

174
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,708
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, ASAHINA.

175
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,541
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS WIN THE RACE.

176
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,250
I'M SURE I'LL BE
FINE. I JUST NEED TO BORROW

177
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,541
A UNIFORM AND SOME
SPIKES FROM SOMEONE FIRST.

178
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,125
- I'M NOT FINISHED!

179
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,541
I JUST DON'T GET HIM.

180
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,708
ALL THIS AFTER HE SAID
HE WAS QUITTING THE TEAM.

181
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,208
- ( grunts )

182
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,083
- THANKS FOR HELPING ME OUT,
HONOKA. I KNOW YOU MUST BE BUSY.

183
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,791
- OH, NO PROBLEM.
IT IS MY JOB AFTER ALL.

184
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,625
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO COME.

185
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,166
I WAS WORRIED WHEN
YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP

186
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,791
TO PRACTICE FOR THREE DAYS.

187
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,666
- ( chuckles ) SORRY, SORRY.
I HAD A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON.

188
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,833
- THAT'S OKAY.

189
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,541
(thinking) I WAS SCARED
TO GO GET YOU.

190
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,458
BECAUSE I KNEW IF I WAS
TOO PERSISTENT,

191
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,791
YOU'D RESENT ME FOR IT.

192
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,791
- SO YOU CAME AFTER ALL.

193
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,291
- GEEZ, AKITSUKI, YOU SURE
HAVE A LOT OF NERVE.

194
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,166
- WHAT?

195
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,375
- I HEARD YOU PICKED A FIGHT

196
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,916
WITH TOHTO UNIVERSITY'S
ARIMA EMERSON EARLIER.

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,666
- BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

198
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,541
- HE WAS PISSING ME OFF,
SO I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

199
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,875
- LIAR. YOU'RE NOT
THE TYPE TO FIGHT

200
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,583
OVER SOMETHING
THAT INSIGNIFICANT.

201
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,333
- BESIDES, I KNOW TONS OF GUYS
WHO ARE JUST LIKE ARIMA.

202
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,750
THEY'RE ALL BARK AND NO BITE.
BEATING HIM, NO PROBLEM.

203
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,458
- HMM.
- WHAT?

204
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,375
- I'M JUST WONDERING,

205
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,708
DID YOU PICK A FIGHT
BEFORE YOU FOUND OUT

206
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,250
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR OPPONENT?

207
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

208
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,541
- ARIMA EMERSON
FROM TOHTO UNIVERSITY.

209
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,083
HIS BEST TIME FOR
THE HUNDRED METERS

210
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,041
IS TEN POINT FOUR SIX SECONDS.

211
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,958
HE'S CONSIDERED TO BE
THE NUMBER ONE

212
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,416
HIGH SCHOOL SPRINTER THIS YEAR.

213
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,750
- AND HE'S COMPETING
IN THIS TOURNAMENT?

214
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,791
- EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY
ALL THE REPORTERS

215
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,041
AND TV NETWORKS SHOWED UP.

216
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,250
NOW DO YOU WISH
YOU HADN'T PICKED A FIGHT?

217
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,875
- I DIDN'T KNOW HE COULD RUN
THAT FAST.

218
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,166
- ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT YAMATO?

219
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,958
YOU'LL CATCH COLD IF YOU
DON'T PUT YOUR SWEATPANTS ON.

220
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,125
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE HERE TODAY, HATTORI.

221
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,583
- YEAH.

222
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,333
IT SEEMS YAMATO IS GONNA
HAVE A SHOWDOWN WITH SOME GUY,

223
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,791
SO, I THOUGHT I'D STICK AROUND
TO WATCH.

224
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,833
- HE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE
AT WINNING.

225
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,833
THE GUY HE'S
GOING UP AGAINST

226
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,041
IS THE NUMBER ONE HIGH
SCHOOL SPRINTER.

227
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE PICKED
THAT RIDICULOUS FIGHT.

228
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT. YAMATO DOES
TEND TOWARDS THE RIDICULOUS.

229
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,416
ALWAYS ACTING BEFORE HE THINKS,
AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE.

230
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,666
AND NOW HE'S MANAGED
TO PISS OFF JAPAN'S

231
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,791
NUMBER ONE SPRINTER,

232
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,041
AND BECOME THE FOCUS
OF ALL HIS ANGER.

233
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,875
I'D HATE TO BE YAMATO RIGHT NOW.

234
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,666
- THIS IS THE LAST CALL FOR
THE HUNDRED-METER DASH.

235
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,833
ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST NOW
REPORT TO THE STARTING LINE.

236
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,041
- WE SHOULD GO.
THE RACE IS ABOUT TO START.

237
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:09,833
- BUT I...

238
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,291
- COME ON, IT'LL BE FINE.

239
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,416
MAYBE HE'LL EVEN MANAGE

240
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,666
TO PULL OFF AN UPSET AND
SURPRISE EVERYONE.

241
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,833
- IMPOSSIBLE.

242
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,750
- Man: NUMBER THIRTY-SIX,
YAMATO AKITSUKI.

243
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,625
OH, RIGHT HERE.

244
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,333
- HERE'S YOUR CHANCE, SPIKE,
DON'T BLOW IT.

245
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,083
AND WHEN YOU LOSE TO ME,

246
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,583
YOU'D BETTER KNEEL
AND APOLOGIZE.

247
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,541
- Crowd: YOU CAN DO IT, ARIMA.
WE BELIEVE IN YOU.

248
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,916
- YOU SO GOT THIS, DUDE!

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,041
- YEAH, YOU CAN BEAT
COMMANDER HAIRSPRAY!

250
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,208
- LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THIS AUDIENCE.

251
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,750
- Yasunobu: HEY.

252
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,583
I BROUGHT SUZUKA TO WATCH,
SO DON'T EMBARRASS YOURSELF.

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,125
- ASAHINA?

254
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,833
- Referee: JUST ABOUT
READY TO BEGIN.

255
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,541
FIRST HEAT.

256
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,500
MAKE YOUR WAY
TO THE STARTING BLOCKS.

257
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,041
- I BET ARIMA WILL TAKE IT EASY
IN THESE PRELIMINARY ROUNDS

258
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,125
SO HE CAN SAVE ALL HIS
ENERGY FOR THE FINALS.

259
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

260
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,916
- PROBABLY. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
COMPETITION IN THIS RACE ANYWAY.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,833
- YEAH, THIS WILL BE MORE LIKE
A WARM UP FOR HIM THAN ANYTHING.

262
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,291
- LOOK AT THE OTHER SPRINTERS.

263
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,041
NO ONE SEEM TO BE PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO YAMATO.

264
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,708
BUT I GUESS THAT'S NORMAL.
HE'S A COMPLETE UNKNOWN HERE.

265
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,416
- Soichi: AKITSUKI!

266
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,875
EVEN IF YOU FINISH SECOND,

267
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,875
YOU CAN STILL MAKE THE FINALS
DEPENDING ON YOUR TIME.

268
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,250
SO GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT.

269
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,583
- SECOND?

270
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,958
- NOW EVERYBODY
GET ON YOUR MARK.

271
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,958
- HERE GOES.

272
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,458
I'M FACING OFF AGAINST
THE TOP HIGH SCHOOL SPRINTER

273
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,208
IN MY FIRST PRELIMINARY RACE.

274
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,500
- YOU OWN THIS, ARIMA!

275
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,083
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
THOSE OTHER GUYS!

276
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,375
THEY'RE NOTHING! COME ON, ARIMA,
YOU CAN DO IT! YOU CAN BEAT HIM!

277
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,541
- GO FOR IT! YEAH! ARIMA!

278
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,625
- OBVIOUSLY NOBODY
EXPECTS ME TO WIN.

279
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,458
- Yasunobu:
STAY FOCUSED, YAMATO.

280
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,041
- ASAHINA.

281
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,125
- DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

282
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,958
- Arima: A ROCKET STARTER?

283
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,833
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN EVEN IF
YOU DO COP A DEAD GUY'S STYLE.

284
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,291
- I MAY NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BEAT HIM NOW.

285
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,875
- GET SET.

286
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,458
- BUT I CAN'T FORGIVE SOMEONE...

287
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,125
...WHO MAKES ASAHINA CRY.

288
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,458
- ( sighs ) EVEN WITH
THE ROCKET START,

289
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,250
HE DOESN'T STAND A
CHANCE AGAINST ARIMA.

290
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,583
- GEEZ, THEY JUST STARTED

291
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,875
AND ARIMA'S ALL READY
OUT TO A HUGE LEAD.

292
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,875
- HMM, LOOKS LIKE
I'LL EASILY WIN,

293
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,166
EVEN IF I SLOW MY
PACE DOWN A BIT.

294
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,125
- DAMN IT. I CAN'T
CATCH UP TO HIM.

295
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,250
HE'S RIGHT THERE.
I JUST GOTTA PUSH HARDER.

296
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,833
I CAN'T LOSE TO THIS JERK.

297
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,625
- AKITSUKI ISN'T ON THE SAME
LEVEL AS ARIMA QUITE YET.

298
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,333
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY
THOUGHT HE'D FIND A WAY

299
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,333
TO PULL A WIN
OUT OF HIS ASS.

300
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,583
- LOOK AT THAT LOSER!

301
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,875
HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE
SAME LEAGUE AS ARIMA.

302
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,583
HE LOOKS SO DESPERATE.

303
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,166
- HE DOESN'T HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL.

304
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YOU IDIOT? RUN!

305
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,500
- ( all gasps )

306
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,375
- LOOK AT THAT,
THEY'RE NECK AND NECK.

307
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,041
- MAYBE HE WON'T LET ME DOWN.

308
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,166
- STOP SCREWING AROUND, ARIMA.

309
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,583
- TEACH HIM A LESSON.

310
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,083
- I'M NOT TOYING WITH HIM.
THIS GUY REALLY IS FAST.

311
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,083
- ASAHINA GAVE HIM THE BOOST HE
NEEDED TO CATCH UP WITH ARIMA.

312
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,458
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY.

313
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,958
- YOU CAN DO IT, AKITSUKI.
- YOU'VE ALMOST GOT HIM.

314
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,833
- Boy: ARIMA'S REGAINING
HIS LEAD.

315
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,041
- I CAN'T LOSE. NOT TO THIS GUY.

316
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,291
OF ALL PEOPLE,
I CAN'T LOSE TO HIM.

317
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,333
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

318
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,416
I FEEL LIKE MY LEGS
ARE BUCKLING.

319
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,875
I CAN'T RUN ANY FURTHER.

320
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,458
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST PLACE.

321
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,625
- DUDE, YOU REALLY
SCARED US THERE.

322
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,958
- ( all cheering )

323
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,625
- ( panting )

324
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,916
- ( panting )

325
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,750
- HIS PACE WAS TOO QUICK.

326
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,666
HE PUSHED HIMSELF TOO HARD
CHASING ARIMA.

327
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,125
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH EXPERIENCE

328
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,916
AND HE SKIPPED PRACTICE
FOR THREE DAYS.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,166
IT ALL ADDED UP, AND THAT'S WHY
HE COULDN'T WIN TODAY.

330
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,333
- NOW, HE KNOWS
NOT TO MESS WITH ARIMA.

331
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,833
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE,
HE'LL SHUT HIS BIG MOUTH.

332
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

333
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,416
YOU'RE WAITING
FOR YOUR APOLOGY.

334
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,666
- WAIT, YAMATO...

335
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,708
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
- HUH?

336
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,125
YOU'RE ANNOYING ME.

337
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,916
TUCK YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR
LEGS AND GET OUTTA HERE.

338
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,958
- BUT...

339
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,125
- WHAT, DID YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND ME?

340
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,708
I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT
OF MY SIGHT.

341
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,791
- NUMBER ONE SPRINTER, MY ASS!

342
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,916
THIS ISN'T THE LAST
YOU'LL BE SEEING OF ME, JERK.

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,541
I'LL BE BACK. YOU'LL SEE!

344
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,875
- HE RAN AWAY?

345
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,541
- THAT'S THE SIGN OF A TRUE
CHAMPION. ( laughs )

346
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,791
- DAMMIT.

347
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,125
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE MADE ME RUN

348
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,708
SUCH A HARD RACE IN THE PRELIMS.

349
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,916
- MY LEGS HURT.

350
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,416
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

351
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
WHY'D I HAVE TO SCREAM
AT HIM AND THEN RUN AWAY?

352
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,041
I MUST HAVE LOOKED SO PATHETIC.

353
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,625
AND I BET THAT ASAHINA
IS DISAPPOINTED IN ME, TOO.

354
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,833
- ( footsteps approaching )

355
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,916
- ( gasps ) ASAHINA.

356
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,000
I, UM... I'M OKAY.

357
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,500
- LET ME SEE YOUR LEGS.

358
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,041
- WHAT? MY LEGS?

359
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

360
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
WHY IS SHE TAKING CARE
OF ME NOW?

361
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,583
( groans )

362
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,000
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

363
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,791
- DOES THIS MEAN THAT SHE
ISN'T ANGRY WITH ME ANYMORE?

364
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:21,083
SHE WAS CHEERING FOR ME
DURING THE RACE, BUT THEN...

365
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,083
I MADE SUCH A FOOL OF MYSELF
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

366
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,125
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR ME?

367
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,375
- JUST STAY STILL.
- SURE.

368
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,416
- ( Cicadas chirping )

369
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,916
- LISTEN. THE CICADAS ARE OUT.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
EVEN THOUGH
IT'S ONLY JUNE. WEIRD.

371
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,750
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT, AREN'T I?

372
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,166
I RAN MY BIG MOUTH AT ARIMA,
THEN LOST THE RACE.

373
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,666
YOU MUST BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

374
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,000
- IT'S BEEN MUCH
HOTTER THAN USUAL.

375
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,833
MAYBE THE CICADAS CAME OUT EARLY
THINKING IT WAS SUMMER ALREADY.

376
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,041
JUST A THOUGHT.

377
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,041
- OH, YEAH. YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT. ( chuckles )

378
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,375
- OKAY, ALL DONE.

379
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,458
- OH, THANKS, ASAHINA.

380
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,250
- YOU SKIPPED PRACTICE
FOR THREE DAYS.

381
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,125
- HUH?

382
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,041
- THE RACE. THAT'S WHY YOU LOST.

383
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,750
EVEN ATHLETES THAT
PRACTICE EVERY DAY,

384
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,333
SOMETIMES LOSE THEIR BALANCE,
JUST BEFORE THE FINISH LINE.

385
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,875
- YEAH.

386
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,208
- SO, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE

387
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:16,666
YOU SHOW UP TO PRACTICE
TOMORROW. YOU GOT IT?

388
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,875
- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

389
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,375
DOES SHE WANT ME
ON THE TEAM STILL?

390
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,791
WELL, REGARDLESS, I WAS GOING
TO SHOW UP TOMORROW, ANYWAY.

391
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,041
IT SURE IS HOT.
SUMMER'S ALMOST HERE.

YOU SEEM TO BE CLOSE
TO AKITSUKI.

426
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,041
- I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
CALL US CLOSE.

427
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,041
- OH, THEN IS IT OKAY?
