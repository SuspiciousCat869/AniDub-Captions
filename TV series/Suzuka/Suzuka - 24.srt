- Hashiba: THIS IS IT!
I'M FREAKING OUT!

26
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,250
- CALM DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS ABOUT?

27
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,375
- UH, IT'S THE METROPOLITAN?

28
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,541
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW AKITSUKI FEELS RIGHT NOW.

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,791
I WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO COMPETE IN A MEET THIS BIG.

30
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,791
- I GUESS YOU MIGHT KNOW
IF YOU WORKED HARDER, HUH?

31
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,291
- YOU'RE SUCH A PRETENTIOUS
JERK, YOU KNOW THAT?

32
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,750
- OF COURSE I DO.

33
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,083
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME
SO DAMN CHARMING, ISN'T IT?

34
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,708
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,458
- Kinugasa: IT'S ALMOST TIME.

36
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,000
- SURE IS.

37
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,750
- YES!

38
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,250
- THANKS, SEMPAI.
I MEAN, CAPTAIN.

39
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,708
- NICE WORK.

40
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,541
- WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

41
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,875
- I GUESS NEXT IS
THE KANTO CHAMPIONSHIP.

42
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.

43
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,500
- LOOKS LIKE HE'S NEXT.

44
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,083
- IT'S FINALLY HERE.
THE TOKYO METROPOLITAN MEET.

45
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,083
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO
COMPETE AGAINST ARIMA.

46
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,541
FEELING WEAK RIGHT NOW
ISN'T GOING TO HELP ME.

47
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,791
I'VE GOT TO KEEP MY CONFIDENCE
UP. I'M GONNA WIN THIS THING.

48
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,041
THE NEXT TIME
I CONFESS TO ASAHINA,

49
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,166
I'LL BE NUMBER ONE IN JAPAN!

50
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,666
I JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T
REJECT ME AGAIN.

51
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,583
- PLEASE WAIT.

52
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,083
I'M SORRY. I REALLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID

53
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,750
ALL THOSE AWFUL THINGS
TO YOU, YAMATO.

54
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,583
I DIDN'T MEAN IT. PLEASE DON'T
BE SO ANGRY WITH ME.

55
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,291
- I, UM...
- GOOD LUCK AT THE METROPOLITAN!

56
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,083
- MAN, YAMATO SURE HAS COME
A LONG WAY, HASN'T HE?

57
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S COMPETING
IN A MEET LIKE THIS.

58
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,416
- YEAH, I KNOW.

59
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,333
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW THIS IS GONNA TURN OUT.

60
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,833
GOOD LUCK, BUD.

61
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,666
- AKITSUKI!

62
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,625
DID YOU MAKE SURE AND RESPOND
TO THE FIRST CALL TODAY?

63
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,125
- YEAH.
- GOOD.

64
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,708
JUST MAKING SURE. I KNOW HOW
CARELESS YOU CAN BE SOMETIMES.

65
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,750
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

66
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,291
- HOW BORING! FINE.

67
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,458
- SINCE YOU'RE HERE, AKITSUKI,

68
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,000
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR RUNNING STYLE.

69
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,083
- OKAY. I THINK I'VE BEEN
RUNNING THE SAME WAY

70
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,833
I ALWAYS HAVE.

71
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,666
- I SEE. WELL, THEN I GUESS
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

72
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,291
- WAIT, IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

73
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,458
IT'S JUST THAT AT
THIS TOURNAMENT

74
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,791
YOU'LL BE RUNNING THREE TIMES,

75
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,875
PLUS TWICE IN THE FINALS,
ALL IN ONLY TWO DAYS.

76
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,791
DON'T PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD.
- I WON'T.

77
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,666
WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER BE GOING NOW.

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
- ALL RIGHT.

79
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,500
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
- YEAH, THERE IS.

80
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,000
- HIS TIME HASN'T IMPROVED?

81
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,041
- NO, IT HASN'T.
BUT THERE'S MORE.

82
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,625
AKITSUKI'S BEEN
WORKING REALLY HARD

83
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,375
ON IMPROVING HIS RUNNING STYLE.

84
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,875
AND EVEN THOUGH
HIS FORM IS BETTER,

85
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,291
HE STILL HASN'T BEAT HIS
BEST TIME FROM THE LAST MEET.

86
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,958
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.

87
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,125
THE GRAPH SHOWED HE
WAS GETTING BETTER, DIDN'T IT?

88
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,541
- IT JUST SHOWED
HIS SPEED CURVE

89
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,375
WHICH, ON ITS OWN, IS IDEAL.

90
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,666
BUT HE'S BEEN TRYING TO DELAY
REACHING TOP SPEED

91
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,791
SO AS NOT TO WEAR HIMSELF OUT.

92
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,250
THE PROBLEM IS HE MAY BE HOLDING
BACK A LITTLE TOO LONG.

93
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,583
- HE'S LUCKY TO HAVE
THAT PROBLEM.

94
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,416
AT LEAST HE'S NOT TOO SLOW.

95
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,541
MOST ATHLETES STRUGGLE
TO FIND THEIR TOP SPEED

96
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,291
AND HE REACHES HIS TOO SOON.

97
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,958
THAT'S A MISFORTUNE I DON'T
THINK I'D MIND HAVING.

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,916
- ONE THING'S FOR SURE.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,041
NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME
OF THIS RACE IS,

100
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,583
AKITSUKI HAS PROVED HIMSELF
TO BE A NATIONAL LEVEL ATHLETE.

101
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,791
I KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN
ENOUGH TIME FOR HIM TO ACHIEVE

102
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,375
HIS GOALS FOR THIS MEET,
BUT THAT'S NOT A REFLECTION

103
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,666
OF HIS TALENT.

104
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,250
HE TOLD ME HE REALLY
WANTS TO BEAT ARIMA

105
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,583
AND BECOME THE
FASTEST SPRINTER IN JAPAN.

106
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,875
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL HAPPEN.

107
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,250
AT LEAST NOT TODAY
AT THIS COMPETITION.

108
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,666
I STILL BELIEVE IN AKITSUKI

109
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,375
AND I HAVE A FEELING
HE'LL SUCCEED IN THE LONG RUN.

110
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,750
- I'M IMPRESSED!

111
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,666
YOU'RE BECOMING A REAL CAPTAIN,
AREN'T YA, MIYAMOTO?

112
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,791
- ( chuckles ) NOT REALLY.

113
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,166
I JUST HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS.

114
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,083
I ACTUALLY THINK
AKITSUKI HAS SHOWN

115
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,500
MORE POTENTIAL THAN
KAZUKI TSUDA.

116
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,916
- PA: THIS IS THE FINAL CALL FOR
THE MEN'S 100 METER RUN.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,750
WILL ALL PARTICIPANTS
PLEASE COME TO THE TRACK?

118
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,666
- Man: NUMBER 1021, MR. OKAJIMA?
- HERE!

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,625
- NUMBER 136, MR. AKITSUKI?
- HERE!

120
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,541
- NUMBER 910, MR. EMERSON?
- HERE!

121
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,083
- I CERTAINLY HOPE
YOU'VE IMPROVED, FUYUTSUKI.

122
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,916
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,708
- WELL, THIS IS IT.
LITTLE YAMATO'S ABOUT TO RUN!

124
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,125
- YEAH, I'M SO EXCITED FOR HIM!

125
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,750
- Man: RUNNERS, ON YOUR MARKS!

126
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,541
- THIS IS IT. I'VE DONE
EVERYTHING I CAN.

127
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,000
NOW I JUST NEED TO WIN.

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,666
- GET SET!

129
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,708
- I'M GONNA BECOME NUMBER ONE
AT THIS MEET. I HAVE TO.

130
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,625
- ( gun shot )

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,041
- I HAVE TO TELL ASAHINA
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER.

132
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,958
- WELL, HE'S OFF TO
A GOOD START.

133
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
- YEAH, BUT HERE'S
WHERE IT GETS ROUGH.

134
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,458
- OH, NO, HE CAUGHT UP.
NOW WHAT?

135
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
AKITSUKI? RUN!

136
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,791
- WILL HE ACTUALLY DO IT?
IS HE GOING TO BEAT ARIMA?

137
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
- NOT YET.
I CAN'T PUSH JUST YET.

138
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,333
- DUDE, COME ON!

139
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,208
- OH, NO!

140
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,541
- SOMETIMES THESE
THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

141
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,125
- YEAH.

142
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,791
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE HE
FINISHED WITH A SLOWER TIME.

143
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,375
HE ACTUALLY FAILED
THE PRELIMINARY.

144
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,333
- PA: FIRST PLACE IN THE MEN'S
100 METER RUN GOES TO

145
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,958
ARIMA EMERSON!

146
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,041
- ( crowd cheering )

147
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,291
- AKITSUKI!

148
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,666
ABOUT THE RESULTS
OF THE RACE TODAY.

149
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,583
- WELL, I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN.

150
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,291
SEE, MY MIND JUST WENT BLANK.

151
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,083
EVERY TIME ANOTHER RUNNER
PASSED ME, I PANICKED.

152
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,500
THEN THE MORE I PANICKED,
THE SLOWER I RAN.

153
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,250
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

154
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,208
- WELL, THIS IS
MY FAULT, AKITSUKI.

155
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,125
IT'S TOO HARD TO CHANGE
RUNNING STYLES IN TWO WEEKS.

156
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,875
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED YOU.
SO FOR THIS SUMMER,

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,208
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

158
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,708
- IF I WAS RUNNING BY MYSELF,
IT WOULDN'T BE THAT BAD.

159
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,125
BUT, WELL, I'M ON A TEAM.
I FELT PRESSURED.

160
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,083
I DROPPED THE BATON
AND NOW EVERYONE HATES ME.

161
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,000
- YOUR TEAMMATES AREN'T THE TYPE
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

162
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,791
PAST EVENTS THEY CAN'T CHANGE.

163
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,541
THEY'RE PROBABLY TOO BUSY
THINKING ABOUT

164
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,250
THEIR OWN FINAL SCORES
TO HATE YOU.

165
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,791
JUST LET IT GO, AKITSUKI.

166
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,375
START FOCUSING ON THE SUMMER

167
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,000
AND PREPARING YOURSELF
FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

168
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,125
- I'M SORRY.

169
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,708
- Ayano: MIHO, WILL YOU GO GET
YAMATO FOR DINNER?

170
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,125
I DON'T WANNA PUT EVERYTHING
AWAY UNTIL HE'S EATEN.

171
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,291
- WHEN I TOLD HIM BEFORE,
HE SAID HE WASN'T HUNGRY.

172
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,333
- HE'S NOT HUNGRY?

173
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,041
BUT HE HARDLY ATE ANYTHING
THIS MORNING.

174
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,333
I'M GETTING WORRIED ABOUT HIM.
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

175
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,583
- WELL, HE WAS REALLY
DISAPPOINTED

176
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,083
ABOUT LOSING THE RACE YESTERDAY.

177
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,833
HE WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY SERIOUS
ABOUT WINNING.

178
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,875
IT MUST BE A HARD THING
FOR HIM TO DEAL WITH.

179
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,958
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DINNER, AYANO.

180
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,000
- SURE. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT CLEANING UP.

181
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,125
JUST LEAVE THE DISHES
IN THE SINK, OKAY?

182
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,250
- OKAY.

183
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,000
- WELL, SUZUKA SEEMS
TO BE ACTING

184
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,625
A LITTLE STRANGE TODAY, ALSO.

185
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,458
- YEAH, SHE DOES. I BET SHE HAD
ANOTHER FIGHT WITH YAMATO.

186
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,875
RIGHT, GORO?

187
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,291
- HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MAN.

188
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,541
IT'S ONLY YOUR THIRD
TRACK MEET, RIGHT?

189
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,291
- FRONT-RUNNERS DROP OUT
OF THE PRELIMINARIES

190
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,291
ALL THE TIME, AKITSUKI.
I PROMISE.

191
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,666
THE SCORE IS JUST A NUMBER.

192
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,375
IT'S NOTHING TO GET
DEPRESSED OVER.

193
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,625
- UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S
NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

194
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,291
- SEE YA. GOOD LUCK AT
THE METROPOLITAN, YAMATO.

195
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,500
- ( grunts ) I'M SUCH A STUPID,
PATHETIC, LOSER IDIOT!

196
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,750
SHE WAS ROOTING FOR ME
AND I LOST!

197
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,458
SHE MUST BE SO DISAPPOINTED!

198
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,625
THERE'S NO WAY I'LL EVER
BE ABLE TO TELL HER

199
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,208
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER NOW.
I'M TOO ASHAMED!

200
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,458
- ( doorbell rings )

201
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,166
- WHO'S THAT? OH, DAMN IT.

202
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,833
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

203
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,875
ASAHINA? YOU OKAY?

204
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,916
- DO YOU MIND IF I COME IN?

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,208
- NO. BUT IT'S KINDA MESSY.
- THAT'S FINE.

206
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
I JUST NEED TO USE YOUR KITCHEN.

207
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,250
- USE THE KITCHEN?

208
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,791
- YEAH. I BOUGHT THESE EGGS
ON SALE.

209
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,333
BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH
FOR JUST ME.

210
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,916
I THOUGHT I'D BOIL THEM.

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,541
I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY. EVEN IF
YOU'RE NOT YOU BETTER EAT SOME.

212
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,208
THERE ARE TONS!

213
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,625
- OKAY. BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
BOIL ALL OF THEM?

214
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,916
- BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM.

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,291
- OH. WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
MAKE THEM IN YOUR KITCHEN

216
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,000
AND THEN BRING THEM OVER?

217
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,458
- WELL, I NEED TO SAVE MONEY
ON MY GAS BILL.

218
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,666
AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY
DIRTY DISHES IN HERE?

219
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,083
DON'T YOU EVER WASH THEM?
LOOK AT ALL THIS!

220
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:54,208
- SORRY. BY THE WAY, I DON'T
HAVE A MICROWAVE HERE, EITHER.

221
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,916
- I DON'T NEED ONE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, YAMATO.

222
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,166
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THAT, YOU KNOW.

223
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,083
- I KNOW. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- WELL, THANKS.

224
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,375
- OKAY, WHY ARE YOU JUST
STANDING THERE LIKE THAT?

225
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,083
GO SIT DOWN.

226
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,000
- WHY DID SHE COME HERE?

227
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,750
AND WHY IS SHE MAKING ME
BOILED EGGS ALL OF A SUDDEN?

228
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:37,875
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALT?
- YEAH, IT'S ON THE TOP SHELF.

229
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,375
OH, WELL. I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
HER NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY.

230
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,833
- BY THE WAY...

231
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,333
I'VE BEEN JUMPING
FOR THREE YEARS

232
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,875
AND HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH

233
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,250
DURING THE REGIONAL MEETS.

234
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,791
I WOULD ALWAYS START TO
THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS

235
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,208
THAT WERE BOTHERING ME.

236
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,000
PLUS, THE PRESSURE WAS JUST
TOO MUCH SOMETIMES.

237
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,833
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ALL THIS? I DON'T GET IT.

238
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,833
- OH, GREAT! YOU MADE ME LOSE
MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT, YAMATO.

239
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,250
THANKS!

240
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,875
AS I WAS SAYING, I CONTINUED TO
WORK HARD AND NEVER GAVE UP.

241
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,083
BECAUSE OF THAT, I WAS ABLE TO
SET AN AMAZING RECORD

242
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,958
DURING THE LAST MEET
IN JUNIOR HIGH.

243
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,416
THEN I QUALIFIED FOR NATIONALS
AND EVENTUALLY GOT SCOUTED.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,375
WELL, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,
I AM PRETTY TALENTED, AREN'T I?

245
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,125
- CAN IT BE? DID ASAHINA COME
OVER HERE JUST TO CHEER ME UP?

246
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,125
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

247
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,375
EVERY TIME SOMETHING BAD HAS
HAPPENED TO ME...

248
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,833
- ( inaudible )

249
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,791
- WHAT IS IT?

250
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,125
- THANK YOU
FOR WORRYING ABOUT ME.

251
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,916
IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO COME
OVER HERE AND CHEER ME UP.

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,208
- THAT IS NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT!

253
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,958
I ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT TOO MANY
EGGS. I TOLD YOU THAT!

254
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,583
DON'T MAKE IT
SOMETHING IT'S NOT!

255
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,291
- I SEE.

256
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,375
- WHY ARE YOU
GRINNING LIKE THAT?

257
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,083
- UH... WELL, I'M NOT.

258
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,333
- RIGHT! I'M GOING HOME.

259
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,958
MAKE SURE YOU TURN THE GAS OFF
WHEN THEY'RE DONE COOKING.

260
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,625
GOOD NIGHT.
YOU'RE SO WEIRD, YAMATO.

261
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,125
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I STILL LIKE HER.

262
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,500
DON'T LEAVE YET.
I STILL LIKE YOU, ASAHINA!

263
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,416
IF I HAD WON THAT
MEET YESTERDAY,

264
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,583
I WAS GOING TO TELL
YOU THAT.

265
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,833
I WANTED TO TELL
YOU EVERYTHING.

266
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,250
- WHY ARE YOU SAYING ALL THIS?
STOP IT.

267
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,250
- LOOK, I KNOW.

268
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,333
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO ANSWER ME NOW.

269
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,750
I'M GOING TO PRACTICE HARDER.

270
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,958
I MEAN IT. I'M GONNA
KEEP PRACTICING.

271
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,583
I'M GONNA RUN FASTER THAN I
EVER HAVE BEFORE. YOU'LL SEE.

272
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,250
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

273
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,958
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ME NOW,

274
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,083
WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK
FROM NATIONALS.

275
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,916
- JUST WAIT UNTIL I WIN
THE NEXT MEET, ASAHINA.

276
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,583
THEN YOU CAN GIVE ME
YOUR ANSWER.

277
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,250
- WITH THE GOLD MEDAL,
OF COURSE.

278
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,375
- JUST STOP IT!

279
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,541
- WHAT IS IT? DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG?

280
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,500
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,041
- ASAHINA, WAIT!
COME BACK HERE! PLEASE!

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,833
AGAIN... REJECTED...

283
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,000
AND SHE TOLD ME TO "STOP IT!"
LAST TIME SHE JUST SAID "SORRY."

284
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,541
AND THIS TIME SHE SHUT ME UP
WITH "STOP IT!"

285
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,125
I CAN'T BELIEVE HER.

286
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,916
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING
ANYMORE! NOTHING ELSE MATTERS!

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,583
- ( doorbell rings )

288
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,833
- ASAHINA?

289
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,666
MIHO?

290
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,208
- YAMATO, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOUR EYES ARE ALL RED!

291
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,583
ARE YOU OKAY?

292
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,833
- I'M FINE. I WAS JUST SLEEPING.
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

293
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,333
- WELL, I JUST WENT TO
SUZUKA'S ROOM

294
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,250
TO SEE IF SHE WOULD HELP ME
WITH MY HOMEWORK

295
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,750
AND SHE WASN'T THERE.
THAT'S NOT LIKE HER.

296
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,416
SHE'S USUALLY HOME AT NIGHT.

297
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,083
SO I'M A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

298
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,000
I CAME HERE TO SEE IF SHE
MIGHT'VE BEEN VISITING YOU.

299
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,125
- NO, SHE'S NOT HERE.
BUT DON'T WORRY,

300
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,583
I BET SHE'S OUT DOING
SOME LATE NIGHT SHOPPING.

301
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,375
MAYBE SHE JUST
NEEDED A NEW BOOK?

302
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,625
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE ISN'T A KID ANYMORE.

303
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,208
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

304
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,708
MAYBE MEGUMI CAN HELP ME WITH
HOMEWORK. I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU.

305
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,458
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S OKAY. GOODNIGHT.

306
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,000
SHE'S BEEN GONE
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR NOW.

307
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,166
I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE DOESN'T NEED

308
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,541
TO THAT MUCH TIME
LOOK FOR BOOKS.

309
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,666
- TV: ANOTHER HOME RUN.

310
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,291
HE'S ALREADY HAD A FEW
HOME RUNS TODAY.

311
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:04,375
WILL HE DECIDE HOW THIS GAME
IS WON? CAN HE DO IT?

312
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,708
- I GUESS IT'S NONE OF
MY BUSINESS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

313
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,958
IT'S ALREADY PAST NINE.
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

314
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,375
ASAHINA, WHAT IS GOING ON?

315
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,583
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

316
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,041
- I GUESS...

317
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,250
I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE I TOLD
HER HOW I FELT ABOUT HER.

318
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,541
- Hashiba: (on phone ) SUZUKA?

319
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,791
NO, SHE DIDN'T COME HERE. WHY?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

320
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,541
- IT'S BEEN OVER TWO HOURS
SINCE SHE'S BEEN GONE.

321
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,333
THE REASON'S NOT IMPORTANT.

322
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,416
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF SHE WENT OVER TO YOUR PLACE

323
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,333
TO TALK OR SOMETHING.

324
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,375
- OH, SO YOU GUYS
GOT IN A FIGHT.

325
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,000
- NO. JUST FORGET IT.
I'LL LOOK FOR HER MYSELF.

326
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,041
LATER.
- WAIT! DON'T HANG UP!

327
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,250
GIVE ME JUST A FEW MINUTES.
I'LL HELP YOU LOOK FOR HER.

328
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,666
- YOU WILL?

329
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,333
- TWO PAIRS OF EYES
ARE BETTER THAN ONE, RIGHT?

330
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,750
WONDERFUL! NOW I GET TO SWEAT
AFTER I JUST TOOK A BATH.

331
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,375
SO I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

332
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,166
- I'M SORRY. I'LL MAKE IT UP
TO YOU, I SWEAR.

333
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,416
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

334
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,333
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL IF
I FIND HER, OKAY?

335
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,458
- OKAY. THANK YOU!

336
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,541
- STUPID!

337
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,541
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

338
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,750
YOU CAN'T DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE
I CONFESSED MY FEELINGS TO YOU!

339
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,000

OKAY? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

357
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,333
- Yamato: IT'S ASAHINA!
SHE DISAPPEARED.

358
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,500
I CAN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE.

359
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,916
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

360
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,875
- Honoka: ASAHINA WAS HERE
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,375
- Yamato: WHERE? WHICH
WAY DID SHE GO? TELL ME!
