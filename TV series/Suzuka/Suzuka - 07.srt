- ( buzzing )

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,583
- ARE YOU COMING, YAMATO?
THE BATH'S GETTING COLD.

28
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,083
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

29
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THERE, ANYWAY?

30
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,500
HEY!

31
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,083
SAY SOMETHING!

32
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,333
FREAKING PATHETIC.

33
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,708
- ( bell chiming )

34
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,791
- LET'S GO. THEY MIGHT HAVE
THE PARADE AFTER ALL.

35
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,541
- YEAH. SURE.

36
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,041
I REALLY LIKE YOU, ASAHINA.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,333
I... I WANT TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND, ASAHINA.

38
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,000
- SO THEN YOU'RE SERIOUS?

39
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,083
I'M SORRY.

40
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,625
- I DON'T THINK THINGS WILL
EVER BE THE SAME BETWEEN US.

41
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,333
- Yasunobu: YAMATO.

00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,541
WHAT'S UP?

43
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,583
- NOTHING.

44
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,750
- YOU GOT ANY PLANS TONIGHT?

45
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,375
- WHY DO YOU ASK?

46
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,291
- I'M GOING TO THIS PARTY LATER,
BUT I DON'T WANNA SHOW UP ALONE.

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,041
I FIGURE
YOU'RE BETTER THAN NOTHING.

48
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,791
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

49
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,500
- MM...

50
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,708
- AW, COME ON, MAN.

51
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,916
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU TO
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
YOU MIGHT EVEN MANAGE
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

53
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,125
NO, THANKS.

54
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,125
SORRY.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,291
- I SEE.

56
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,791
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU OUT.

57
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,458
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT ON, MAN.

58
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,083
- THANKS.

59
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,458
- I GET IT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

60
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,166
( door opens )

61
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,583
( door closes )

62
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,083
- WHY'D I HAVE TO TELL HER
HOW I FELT?

63
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,291
( sighs )

64
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,958
- HEY, MOM, I THOUGHT SUZUKA
WAS GONNA EAT WITH US TONIGHT.

65
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,583
- SHE TOLD ME EARLIER
SHE WAS GOING TO GRAB

66
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,833
A BITE WITH SOME TRACK FRIENDS.

67
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,125
- OH.

68
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,833
HEY, YAMATO.

69
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,250
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER
THE PROMISE YOU MADE?

70
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,125
- Yamato: PROMISE?
- YEAH.

71
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,750
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE KIDS
YOU PROMISED THAT YOU'D MARRY ME

72
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,791
ONCE WE GOT OLDER,

73
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,083
AND THAT WE'D BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

74
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,708
DON'T TELL ME YOU FORGOT.

75
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,500
- I REMEMBER THE DAY
YOU MADE THAT PROMISE.

76
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,291
- MIHO WAS ONLY IN KINDERGARTEN.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

77
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,000
- YEAH, BUT THE WAY
I REMEMBER IT,

78
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,958
I WAS FORCED INTO SAYING THAT.

79
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,166
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
- WHAT?

80
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,875
- BUT OKAY,
I WON'T HOLD YOU TO IT.

81
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,958
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU DO END UP ALONE.

82
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,083
AND THEN I GUESS YOU CAN STILL
MARRY ME IF YOU WANT.

83
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,500
- WHAT MADE YOU
THINK OF THAT, MIHO?

84
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,583
- OH, NOTHING.
IT JUST CROSSED MY MIND.

85
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,125
- ( laughing ) OH, I SEE.

86
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,500
SHE'S BEING EXTRA NICE 'CAUSE
SHE KNOWS I GOT REJECTED.

87
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,958
- I FORGOT.

88
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,375
I WANNA CHANGE MY WEDDING
DRESS AT LEAST TEN TIMES.

89
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,125
- WE BETTER START SAVING
OUR MONEY NOW, I GUESS!

90
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,916
- I'M NOT KIDDING, MOM!

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,041
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
- ( laughing )

92
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,875
I GUESS THEY THINK
I REALLY NEED CHEERING UP.

93
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,791
I WONDER IF SHE'LL EVER EAT
WITH US AGAIN?

94
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,291
OH, HEY, ASAHINA.

95
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,375
I GUESS IT'S HARD FOR HER
TO TALK TO ME.

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,541
- GEEZ, I FEEL
LIKE CRYING AGAIN.

97
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,041
- ( doorbell ringing )

98
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,416
- COULD IT BE?

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,208
ASAHINA, I'M GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO STOP BY... OH.

100
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,750
- GOOD EVENING! I
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND US

101
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,916
STOPPING BY TO CHEER
YOU UP SOME.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,125
- AW, HELL.

103
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,625
- AW, WHAT'S WRONG, YAMATO,
YOU NOT FEELING SO HOT?

104
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,625
'CAUSE WE CAN
RAISE YOUR SPIRITS, TOTALLY.

105
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,750
YOU SHOULD JUST FORGET
ABOUT LITTLE SUZUKA.

106
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,000
- SHUT UP! WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT IT ANYWAY?

107
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:32,041
- I COULD JUST TELL JUST BY
LOOKING AT YOU. GET OFF, SHOES.

108
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,000
LET'S DRINK.
- GO HOME.

109
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,541
- BUT IF I WENT HOME,

110
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,333
I COULDN'T WATCH THE DESPERATION
ON YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE FACE.

111
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,916
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S
MORE ENTERTAINING

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,958
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

113
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,958
- PLEASE, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

114
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,708
- NOW IN ORDER TO CELEBRATE
YOUR FIRST REJECTION AS A MAN,

115
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,166
WE'RE GOING TO PARTY TONIGHT.

116
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,166
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MEGUMI?
- YEP.

117
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,875
POOR YAMATO.

118
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,291
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

119
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,625
- IT LOOKS LIKE I'M DOING BETTER
THAN YOU ARE.

120
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,416
AWW. IT'S OKAY.

121
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,958
YOU CAN CRY ON MY SHOULDER
IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO.

122
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,291
- MEGUMI. I CAN'T BREATHE.

123
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,166
- WHAT'S THAT?

124
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,666
YOU MEN ARE ALL THE SAME.

125
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,416
YOU ALWAYS DUMP ME AS SOON
AS YOU GET TIRED OF MY BOOBS.

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,833
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

127
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,083
( cryingly ) I HATE MEN!

128
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,291
- AW, NOW I FEEL
LIKE CRYING AGAIN.

129
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,500
- OKAY, WHO WANTS A HANGOVER?

130
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
( giggling )

131
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,666
- ( clock ticking )

132
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,666
- I GUESS MEGUMI
REACHED HER LIMIT EARLY.

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,458
MAN, TALK ABOUT A BORE,
AM I RIGHT?

134
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,500
GEEZ, ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT
THERE AND STARE AT THE FLOOR?

135
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,125
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
MUCH FUN EITHER.

136
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,291
- SHUT UP.

137
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,250
- I DON'T REALLY BLAME SUZUKA...

138
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,000
I THINK I'D REJECT YOU TOO
IF YOU'RE GONNA ACT LIKE THAT.

139
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,750
LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO YOU, YAMATO.

140
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,875
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MEN THAT ARE NICE

141
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,166
AND MEN THAT ARE SUBMISSIVE.

142
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,375
- YEAH?

143
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,000
- AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

144
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,666
THE GUYS THAT HAVE
NO CONFIDENCE

145
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,041
ARE THE WORST.

146
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,666
UP WE GO.

147
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,708
- YOU IDIOT,
YOU'RE GONNA FALL OFF.

148
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,208
- ( Yuka screaming )

149
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,625
- YUKA! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

150
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,750
SAY SOMETHING.

151
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,750
- ( chuckling )
I TOTALLY GOTCHA.

152
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,333
- NOT FUNNY, YOU REALLY
SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THERE.

153
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:42,541
- OH, LIGHTEN UP, YAMATO. NOW
GET OVER HERE, IT'S A NICE VIEW.

154
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,583
AND DON'T FORGET THE WINE.

155
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,708
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

156
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,875
- DRINKS ALWAYS TASTE BETTER
WHEN PAIRED WITH A GREAT VIEW.

157
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,416
- HOW DO YOU DO IT, YUKA?
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO HAPPY.

158
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,458
- HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

159
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,583
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD HER
IF I KNEW I'D SUFFER THIS MUCH.

160
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,666
- YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S HAVING A HARD TIME.

161
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,750
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN ANY BETTER FOR YOU

162
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,416
TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS
FROM SUZUKA, NEVER CONFESS,

163
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,833
AND THEN WATCH HER FALL IN LOVE
WITH SOME OTHER GUY?

164
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,125
- OF COURSE NOT. THAT'S WORSE.

165
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,541
- UH-HUH. I GUESS WE'RE BOTH
WOUNDED PRETTY BADLY THEN,

166
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,166
AREN'T WE?

167
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,291
- WHAT?

168
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,750
- OKAY, SO BACK WHEN I WAS
A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL,

169
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,041
I HAD THIS CRUSH
ON AN OLDER STUDENT.

170
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,708
BUT I CONFESSED MY FEELINGS
AND GOT SHOT DOWN.

171
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,625
- REALLY? YOU GOT REJECTED?

172
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,875
- I WAS REALLY
SIMPLE, PLAIN-LOOKING,

173
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,416
AND PRETTY SHY, TOO.

174
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,166
I HAD A HARD TIME SAYING WHAT
I WAS THINKING AND FEELING.

175
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,000
YOU WERE SHY?
AND PLAIN-LOOKING? YEAH.

176
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,041
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

177
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,916
- NO, IT'S TRUE.

178
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,166
- NO WAY!

179
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,041
BUT WHY HAVE YOU SAVED
THAT PICTURE ALL THESE YEARS?

180
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,791
- HALF AS A JOKE,
BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE MYSELF.

181
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,666
JUST REMINDS ME
HOW I USED TO BE.

182
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,875
FOR THREE YEARS
I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM AT ALL.

183
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,875
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED, YOU KNOW?

184
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,541
AND I DECIDED
I DON'T REALLY LIKE REGRETS.

185
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,416
SO WHEN I GOT INTO COLLEGE
I STARTED CHANGING

186
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,083
THE WAY I DRESSED,
THE WAY I ACTED,

187
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,625
TO FEEL MORE CONFIDENT
IN MYSELF.

188
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,041
I WANTED TO BREAK
OUT OF MY SHELL,

189
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,250
AND START ALL OVER.

190
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,333
( sighs ) IT TOOK TIME.
AND ALTHOUGH I CONFESSED AGAIN

191
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,958
AND AGAIN, IT NEVER WORKED.

192
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,083
- AGAIN AND AGAIN? YOU DIDN'T
GIVE UP AFTER HE REJECTED YOU?

193
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,458
- WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M TOTALLY
IN LOVE WITH THE GUY.

194
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,583
AFTER HE GRADUATED,
HIS JOB PROMOTED HIM

195
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,875
AND HE TRANSFERRED
TO THE UNITED STATES.

196
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,625
I'VE TRIED TO FORGET
ABOUT HIM AND MOVE ON,

197
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,333
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO DO IT.

198
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,541
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY,
I STILL LOVE HIM.

199
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,666
OH, COME ON.

200
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,250
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO
GET ALL DEPRESSED ABOUT IT.

201
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,916
- BUT I... I THINK
THAT WE'RE REALLY SIMILAR.

202
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,833
- SIMILAR?

203
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,500
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME! ME AND MR.

204
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,291
LOW SELF-ESTEEM?
WE'RE NOTHING ALIKE.

205
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,125
I AM GETTING MORE
GORGEOUS BY THE MINUTE,

206
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,250
AND I WILL WIN MY MAN OVER
SOMEDAY. JUST WATCH!

207
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,291
- AMAZING.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,041
- I THINK I HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

209
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,708
HEY! DO YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON

210
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,000
I'VE EVER TOLD THAT
STORY TO? AND IF YOU EVER TELL

211
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:24,041
ANYBODY ELSE, YOU'RE DEAD
MEAT. YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

212
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,083
- OKAY, I WON'T. GEEZ.

213
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,375
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER
AFTER ONE HEARTBREAK.

214
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,125
I CAME TO TOKYO
TO START HIGH SCHOOL

215
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,208
EXPECTING CHANGES IN MY LIFE.

216
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,958
BUT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
IF I JUST WAIT AROUND.

217
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,916
( shouting )
I LIKE ASAHINA!

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,083
- WHAT?

219
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,041
- Yamato: I'LL NEVER GIVE UP!

220
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,500
- HMM. MAYBE THERE'S HOPE
FOR HIM YET.

221
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,833
- IDIOT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

222
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,416
- IF WAITING WON'T
CHANGE ANYTHING,

223
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,875
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO
CHANGE THINGS MYSELF.

224
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,666
ASAHINA!

225
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,375
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

226
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,666
- UM, FINE I GUESS.

227
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,333
- YOU SURE ARE LEAVING EARLY.

228
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,958
ARE YOU GOING TO PRACTICE?

229
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,500
- YEAH.

230
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,791
- I... I WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M
OKAY WITH EVERYTHING. SO...

231
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,208
SO DON'T FEEL BAD.

232
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,708
I'M STILL THE SAME OLD YAMATO
I ALWAYS WAS

233
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,291
AND WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS,
CAN'T WE? RIGHT?

234
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,250
- YEAH, SURE.

235
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,833
- ( chuckling awkwardly )

236
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,416
- I GOTTA GET GOING.

237
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,083
- I UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LATE.

238
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,875
- I'LL SEE YOU IN CLASS LATER.

239
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,000
- BYE.

240
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,375
I STILL HAVE A CHANCE.

241
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,125
- HEY, THERE, AKITSUKI,
HOW'S IT GOING?

242
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,291
- IT'S BEEN A PRETTY GOOD DAY
SO FAR.

243
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
YOU'RE THE GUY
FROM THE TRACK TEAM, AREN'T YOU?

244
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,958
- NAME'S MIYAMOTO. HEY,
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU

245
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,708
IF YOU HAD THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT JOINING UP.

246
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,000
CHANGED YOUR MIND?

247
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,625
WE COULD REALLY USE YOU
ON THE TEAM, YOU KNOW.

248
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,000
THERE'S STILL A SPOT OPEN
FOR YOU, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT.

249
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,750
- I SEE.

250
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,333
- YOU'VE GOT TALENT.

251
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,875
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST
LET IT GO TO WASTE.

252
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,666
YOU SHOULD THINK SERIOUSLY
ABOUT JOINING THE TRACK TEAM.

253
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,416
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE
ME AN ANSWER NOW,

254
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,000
BUT TRY TO LET ME
KNOW SOON, OKAY?

255
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,625
- OKAY, I WILL.

256
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,916
- ( bell chiming )

257
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,958
- WHAT'S THAT? YOU'RE GONNA
JOIN THE TRACK TEAM?

258
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,625
- YEP.

259
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,916
- WHY DO YOU WANNA
GO AND DO THAT, DUDE?

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,125
TRACK ISN'T YOUR THING.

261
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,125
- WELL, MAYBE IT ISN'T,
BUT IF I JOIN THE TRACK TEAM,

262
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,125
I'LL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES
TO HANG OUT WITH ASAHINA.

263
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,750
- WELL, YOU MIGHT BE
RIGHT THERE.

264
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,791
- IT'S JUST THAT I WANT
TO BE AROUND HER

265
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,416
AS MUCH AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

266
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,833
- ( sighs )

267
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,000
BUT IF YOU DO THIS
IT'LL MAKE YOU SEEM DESPERATE.

268
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,458
THEN SHE'LL WANT TO BE
WITH YOU EVEN LESS

269
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,666
THAN SHE DOES NOW.

270
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,208
- Suzuka: WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

271
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,833
- HEY, SUZUKA. WHAT'S UP?

272
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,875
- HEY, GUESS WHAT? I THINK I'M
GONNA JOIN THE TRACK TEAM.

273
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,041
THAT WAY WE'LL HAVE MORE
TIME TO HANG OUT TOGETHER

274
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,750
AFTER SCHOOL
THAN EVER BEFORE.

275
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,166
- ARE YOU...
ARE YOU SERIOUS, YAMATO?

276
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,458
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT TRACK?

277
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,916
- OF COURSE I AM.

278
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,416
- BECAUSE BEING ON
THE TEAM TAKES A LOT

279
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,916
OF HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT.

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,041
WE'RE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO
IMPROVE OURSELVES BY ONE SECOND,

281
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,750
BY ONE CENTIMETER.

282
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,041
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT, YAMATO?

283
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,750
- I THINK SO. AND YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

284
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,416
- YOU THINK SO?

285
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,750
YOU NEED TO BE SURE! YOU HAVE TO
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

286
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,875
( shouting )OR YOU'LL SERIOUSLY
MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF

287
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,791
IF YOU JOIN AND THEN QUIT
WHEN IT GETS TOO HARD!

288
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,166
-WAY TO GO.

289
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,458
- WHY'D SHE HAVE TO BE SO MAD
AT ME?

290
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,916
- BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON HER.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,041
ONE MORE STEP,
AND YOU'RE IN STALKER LAND.

292
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

293
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOU BETTER TAKE A STEP

294
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,000
BACK BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

295
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,375
- BUT I WAS TRYING TO
MAKE THINGS BETTER

296
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,958
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

297
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,333
- YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

298
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,708
- YOU THINK SO?

299
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,875
- YEAH, YOU LOOK DESPERATE,

300
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,875
AND WOMEN DEFINITELY
DON'T LIKE TO SEE THAT.

301
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

302
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,416
- I GUESS SO.

303
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,833
- SUZUKA THINKS YOU'RE
ONLY JOINING BECAUSE OF HER,

304
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,000
AND THAT
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.

305
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,750
- ( groaning )

306
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,958
- SO IF YOU JOIN, YOU BETTER BE
DOING IT FOR YOUR OWN REASONS,

307
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,375
AND NOT FOR SUZUKA,
OR YOU'LL LOSE HER RESPECT.

308
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,666
AND YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT,
'CAUSE THEN IT'S OVER.

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,000
- BUT I AM TAKING THIS
DECISION SERIOUSLY.

310
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,541
-WHATEVER YOU SAY.

311
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:59,291
I'M JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO
YOU HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT IT.

312
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,750
SO, DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THE WORKOUT?

313
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,375
THOSE GUYS ON THE TRACK TEAM
ARE IN TOP PHYSICAL CONDITION,

314
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,541
YOU KNOW.

315
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,333
WELL, I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO
MAKE UP YOUR MIND FOR YOURSELF.

316
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,625
BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT,

317
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,708
DON'T MAKE THIS
DECISION ON A WHIM.

318
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,458
- I GOT IT. THANKS.

319
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,291
- ( starter's gunshot )

320
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,000
- HEY, AKITSUKI.

321
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,458
- OH, HEY, HONOKA.

322
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,208
- THE TRACK TEAM?
- MM-HMM.

323
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,791
- WHY'D YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT?

324
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,708
- OH... UM... I...

325
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,083
I DON'T KNOW.

326
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
IF I'M GOING TO DO IT.

327
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,458
BOTH ASAHINA AND YASUNOBU

328
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,375
TRIED TO TALK ME
OUT OF JOINING UP.

329
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
- OH, I SEE.

330
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,041
I DON'T REALLY THINK

331
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,833
THAT YOU SHOULD JOIN
THE TRACK TEAM EITHER.

332
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,500
- HUH?

333
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,666
- BECAUSE...

334
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,041
THEN WE'D HAVE EVEN LESS TIME
TO SPEND TOGETHER.

335
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,458
WELL, THE PRACTICES
SEEM TO BE PRETTY RIGOROUS,

336
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,958
AT LEAST FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN.

337
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,083
I'M SURE YOU COULD GET WORN OUT
PRETTY QUICKLY, YOU KNOW.

338
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,166
- UM... YEAH,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

339
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,625
( sighs )

340
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,041
MAYBE I REALLY
SHOULDN'T TRY OUT.

341
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,000
- HMM. I THINK
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

342
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,458
- IT COULD BE.

343
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,625
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO MAKE IT ON THE TEAM.

344
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,291
I DON'T WANT TO
EMBARRASS MYSELF.

345
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,625
I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND.

346
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,833
THIS IS GREAT. I WAS SO
HUNGRY ALL DAY TODAY,

347
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,250
I THOUGHT I WOULD STARVE.

348
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,375
IT'S SO HARD TO TALK TO HER
NOW THAT SHE'S REJECTED ME.

349
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,208
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE, SUZUKA?

350
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,541
- NO, THANKS. I DON'T THINK
I COULD EAT ANOTHER BITE.

351
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,541
- HEY, ASAHINA?

352
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,791
- WHAT?
- NOTHING, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

353
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,875
- DINNER WAS DELICIOUS.

354
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,625
- WHAT? YOU HAVEN'T APOLOGIZED
TO SUZUKA YET?

355
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,041
- NO.

356
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,375
- YOU HURT HER FEELINGS WHEN
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA

357
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,916
JOIN THE TEAM LIKE IT
WAS NO BIG DEAL.

358
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THE LONGER YOU WAIT,

359
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,583
THE HARDER IT'S
GONNA BE TO SAY IT.

360
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,250
- SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.

361
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,625
JUST HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO APOLOGIZE TO HER?

362
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,791
- ( sighs )

363
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,125
YOU REALLY ARE
HOPELESS, AREN'T YOU?

364
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,375
LOOK, I CAN HELP YOU SMOOTH
THIS ONE OUT, OKAY?

365
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,916
IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE.
I'M TIRED OF YOU MOPING

366
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,958
AROUND ALL THE TIME.

367
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,708
THERE'S A TRACK
MEETING AFTER SCHOOL.

368
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,375
I THINK MAYBE YOU AND I SHOULD
SHOW UP TO IT.

369
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,250
- Soichi: IT'S OPEN.

370
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,375
- IT'S JUST ME.

371
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,375
- WHAT'S UP? YOU KNOW YOU'RE
EARLY FOR THE MEETING,

372
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:36,958
DON'T YOU?

373
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,041
- HUH?

374
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,458
I THOUGHT IT STARTED AT 3:00.

375
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,250
- NO, THE LAST MEETING
STARTED AT 3:00,

376
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,750
BUT TODAY'S STARTS AT 3:30.

377
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,375
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT.

378
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,416
- SO WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON
OVER THERE?

379
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,333
- OH, I WAS JUST DOING
A LITTLE RESEARCH.

380
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,666
I WAS CHECKING OUT AKITSUKI
AND FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING

381
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,791
ABOUT THAT RELAY RACE
HE TOLD YOU ABOUT.

382
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,500
GIVE ME JUST A SECOND.

383
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY WROTE

384
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,500
AN ARTICLE ABOUT THAT RACE.

385
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,750
THE REPORT SAYS
HIS TEAM DID COME IN LAST,

386
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,291
BUT THEN IT GOES ON TO
SAY THAT THE ANCHOR

387
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,083
REALLY PUT
UP QUITE A FIGHT.

388
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,958
-HUH. IS THAT SO?

389
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,041
- ASAHINA, HE SHOULD JOIN.

390
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,291
HE'D BE A GREAT
ASSET TO THE TEAM.

391
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,708
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK SO?

392
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

393
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,791
- WHAT'S WRONG? ARE YOU TWO
IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING?

394
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,500
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

395
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,416
- I SEE.
- ( knock on door )

396
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,958
- YOU CAN COME IN.

397
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,291
- HERE WE ARE.

398
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,166
- HEY, HATTORI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

399
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,250
- OH, HI, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

400
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,166
- SO, AKITSUKI, DOES THIS
MEAN YOU'VE MADE A DECISION

401
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,500
ABOUT JOINING THE TEAM?

402
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,208
- SORRY, DUDE, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE

403
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,375
TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

404
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,375
YAMATO'S GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY TO SUZUKA.

405
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,541
- ME?

406
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,750
- GO ON.
- OKAY.

407
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,583
I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

408
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,041
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.

409
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,541
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

410
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,583
I GUESS I DON'T COMPLETELY KNOW
WHAT I'M GETTING MYSELF INTO,

411
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,333
BUT I WANT TO BE WITH ASAHINA.

412
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,208
I'VE DECIDED I WANT TO JOIN
THE TEAM! SIGN ME UP.

413
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,291

- Yamato: ASAHINA'S THE
STAR OF THE TRACK TEAM.

447
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,333
SHE'S SO MUCH MORE
TALENTED THAN ME.

448
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,541
HOW DID I EVER HOPE
TO IMPRESS HER?

449
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,125
IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE HARDER
I TRY TO GET CLOSE TO HER,

450
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,833
THE FURTHER I PUSH HER AWAY.
