THE INTER-HIGH MEET

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,208
IS BEING HELD IN HIROSHIMA.

27
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,333
IT FEELS LIKE GOING HOME AGAIN.
PRETTY COOL.

28
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,875
- AKITSUKI!

29
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,333
I'M RETIRING AFTER
THIS COMPETITION,

30
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,916
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
IT MEANS YOU BETTER DO

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,458
YOUR BEST OUT THERE,
YOU HEAR ME?

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,541
- YEAH, I, OKAY, I'LL TRY.

33
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,000
- TRYING'S NOT ENOUGH!
YOU'RE COMPETING NEXT YEAR!

34
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,458
YOU'VE GOTTA FEEL IT IN YOUR
GUT! ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME!

35
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,125
SO, WE'VE GOTTA GET YOU ON
A SPECIAL TRAINING PROGRAM

36
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,208
RIGHT WHEN WE GET THERE. NOW...

37
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,541
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
- I NEED TO GET SOME JUICE!

38
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,541
- AKITSUKI, GET BACK HERE! HEY!

39
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,416
- I WON'T LAST IF I HANG OUT
WITH HIM FOR VERY LONG.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,916
HEY, ASAHINA! DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,541
I'M GONNA GET SOME JUICE.

42
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,291
- NO, I'M NOT THIRSTY. THANKS.

43
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,958
- OKAY, WELL YOU MUST
BE HUNGRY THEN?

44
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,666
SOMETHING FROM
THE DINING CART?

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,125
- NO THANKS. PLEASE
DON'T TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW!

46
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,208
I REALLY NEED TO
CONCENTRATE. SORRY.

47
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,583
- OH, OKAY.

48
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,958
EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
ASAHINA'S BEEN SO COLD

49
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,833
AND DISTANT TOWARDS ME.

50
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,875
- AKITSUKI...
- HEY, DON'T FALL!

51
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,041
- YAMATO DOESN'T LOOK ANY
BETTER FROM THAT ANGLE.

52
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,208
- UH, WHAT?

53
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,500
WHAT'RE YOU DOING
HERE, ANYWAY?

54
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,916
YOU DON'T EVEN BELONG TO
THE TRACK AND FIELD CLUB.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,750
- I CAME TO SUPPORT THE
ATHLETES, THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

56
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,916
ANYONE WHO WANTED
TO COME WATCH

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,541
JUST NEEDED TO
INFORM THE SCHOOL.

58
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,000
BESIDES, I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO OVER SUMMER BREAK.

59
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,541
HEY, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

60
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,916
IF YOU LIKE YAMATO SO MUCH,

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,083
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL
HIM HOW YOU FEEL?

62
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,125
- THIS IS GETTING OLD.
- DON'T BE SO LOUD.

63
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,541
SOMEONE WILL
HEAR YOU!

64
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,083
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH

65
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,500
FOR ME TO TELL ASAHINA
THAT I LIKED AKITSUKI.

66
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,541
I CAN'T SAY IT AGAIN.

67
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,666
ESPECIALLY TO HIM.

68
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,541
- LOOK, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS
AND I REALLY DON'T CARE,

69
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,708
BUT IF YOU SLACK OFF YOU
MIGHT LOSE HIM TO SOMEONE

70
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,208
MORE AGGRESSIVE, YA KNOW?

71
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,666
- AGGRESSIVE?

72
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,500
- I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT
WAY ABOUT HIM...

73
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,583
- YAMATO.

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,791
- ASAHINA SAID SHE DIDN'T
LIKE HIM LIKE THAT.

75
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,708
BUT...

76
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,458
- OH, MAN! YOU'VE
GOTTA BE KIDDING.

77
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,250
THEY SERIOUSLY EXPECT
US TO SLEEP IN THIS DUMP?

78
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,291
THOSE WHO ARE COMPETING
NEED TO REST UP

79
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,750
AND PREPARE YOURSELVES
FOR PRACTICE.

80
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,083
- YOU GOT IT!
- All: GOT IT?

81
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,458
- THIS IS PROBABLY
NOT THE BEST TIME

82
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,875
TO ASK IF SHE'D LIKE
TO GO FOR A WALK.

83
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,625
- AKITSUKI SEEMS LIKE
HE'S A LITTLE UPSET.

84
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,375
I WONDER IF HE'S OKAY.

85
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,208
- HEY, YAMATO!
LET'S GO EXPLORING!

86
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,250
YOU CAN SHOW ME WHERE
ALL THE GIRLS HANG OUT!

87
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,125
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW
MY WAY AROUND HERE.

88
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,541
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

89
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,250
- ON MY OWN? WAIT A SEC!
YOU USED TO LIVE HERE, DUDE!

90
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,541
- JUST BECAUSE
I'M NOT COMPETING

91
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,500
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE
OTHER THINGS TO DO.

92
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,208
- C'MON, MOVE IT!

93
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,375
- SNAILS MOVE FASTER
THAN YOU DO, MAN!

94
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,208
- I'M SO SORRY!

95
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,666
- Yamato: IT, IT'S
THAT ARIMA GUY.

96
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,916
HI. HOW ARE YA? SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF HIROSHIMA?

97
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,583
- DO YOU KNOW HIM, ARIMA SENPAI?

98
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,000
- NOPE. NEVER SEEN
HIM IN MY LIFE.

99
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,250
- SO THOSE ARE INTER-HIGH
ATHLETES. WOW.

100
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,541
- NO THANKS. PLEASE DON'T
TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW.

101
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,250
I REALLY NEED TO
CONCENTRATE. SORRY.

102
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,500
- ARIMA AND ASAHINA ARE
ALIKE IN MANY WAYS...

103
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,375
AND THEY'RE BOTH SO
DIFFERENT FROM ME.

104
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,541
- HEY, AKITSUKI, WHAT ARE YOU
DAYDREAMING ABOUT?

105
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,125
- OH. HEY!

106
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,958
- SO AFTER DINNER, WE'RE
ALL GONNA LIGHT FIREWORKS

107
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,500
IF YOU WANNA JOIN US.

108
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,375
YA KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.

109
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,500
- OH, UH, NO THANK YOU.

110
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,541
THE CAPTAIN TOLD TO ME PRACTICE,
SO YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

111
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,083
- WAIT, AKITSUKI!

112
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,916
OH, WELL.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,375
- ( clock chiming )

114
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,791
- ( chattering )

115
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,583
- YOU MEAN YAMATO?

116
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,958
- YEAH, HIM. HE JUST SEEMS
REALLY DEPRESSED LATELY.

117
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,291
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

118
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,666
HIS TIME HASN'T BEEN
IMPROVING THAT MUCH EITHER.

119
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,583
I FIGURED HE'D BE MORE
ADVANCED BY NOW.

120
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,083
I WONDER IF THE STRESS
OF BEING HERE

121
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,083
AT INTER- HIGH IS
TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

122
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,250
- I DON'T THINK SO.

123
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,583
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
HIM TO IMPROVE

124
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,833
AFTER JUST ONE OR TWO
MONTHS OF PRACTICE. RIGHT?

125
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,375
- RIGHT. AND I THINK HE'D LOVE
TO HEAR THAT RIGHT NOW.

126
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,916
IN FACT, I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE THE ONE TO TELL HIM.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,250
- WHAT FOR?
WHY SHOULD I TELL HIM?

128
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,208
- BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
LIKE BEST FRIENDS.

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,333
- NO. I WOULDN'T SAY
THAT WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

130
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,041
- OKAY. WHATEVER.

131
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,166
WELL, YOUR FRIEND IS PRACTICING
ALONE AFTER DINNER.

132
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,625
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PRACTICE TOO. OKAY?

133
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,416
- NO, IT'S COOL. HE CAN PRACTICE
WITHOUT ME HOLDING HIS HAND.

134
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,458
- SUZUKA!

135
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,916
- ( grunts )

136
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,375
( panting )

137
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,041
DAMN! MY TIME HASN'T
IMPROVED AT ALL!

138
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,916
TIME FOR A BREAK.
I'M EXHAUSTED!

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,208
WHAT KIND OF AN IDIOT
DOES THIS TO THEMSELVES?

140
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,000
I'M NOT EVEN COMPETING TOMORROW.

141
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

142
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,833
- HEY. YOU OKAY?

143
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,916
- UH, HEY, HONOKA. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,541
- IT'S LATE. YOU'VE BEEN
PRACTICING A LONG TIME.

145
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,375
I THOUGHT I'D CHECK ON YOU.

146
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,125
- ACTUALLY, I'VE JUST
BEEN WORKING HARD

147
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,875
FOR THE PAST FEW MINUTES.

148
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,541
- YEAH HIM. HE JUST
SEEMS REALLY DEPRESSED LATELY.

149
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,958
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

150
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,000
HIS TIME HASN'T BEEN IMPROVING
THAT MUCH, EITHER.

151
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,458
- Suzuka: MAYBE I SHOULD
TALK TO HIM.

152
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,333
- WELL SINCE I'M HERE,
DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

153
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,000
- NO, PLEASE.

154
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,500
- POOR AKITSUKI.
HE LOOKS SO SAD.

155
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,166
- DINNER WAS REALLY GOOD
TONIGHT. DIDN'T YOU THINK SO?

156
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE TWO
WHOLE BOWLS OF MISO SOUP.

157
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,708
I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FAT!

158
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,333
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ALRIGHT.

159
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:10,208
- AKITSUKI, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- HUH?

160
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,666
- YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE YOURSELF.
DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

161
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,833
- IT'S NOTHING. JUST NOT
VERY CONFIDENT LATELY.

162
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,625
- WHY'S THAT?

163
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,750
- WHEN I FIRST JOINED TRACK AND
FIELD, EVERYONE MADE SUCH A BIG

164
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,250
DEAL ABOUT HOW
FAST I COULD RUN.

165
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,958
AND THEN I LOST AT THE
REGIONAL AND MADE A FOOL

166
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,250
OUT OF MYSELF IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE.

167
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,166
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
DECIDED TO TAG ALONG

168
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,958
AFTER NOT MAKING THE
INTER-HIGH TEAM.

169
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,250
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
HERE. WHAT'S THE POINT?

170
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,166
- PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

171
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,541
- THE CAPTAIN EXPECTS
SO MUCH OF ME,

172
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,666
BUT I'M JUST NOT THAT GOOD YET.

173
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,958
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

174
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,958
INTER-HIGH TRACK AND FIELD
ATHLETES ARE ON AN ADVANCED

175
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,000
LEVEL THAT I'M JUST
NOT READY FOR.

176
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,250
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I
COULD EVER LIVE UP TO THAT.

177
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,208
- OF COURSE YOU WILL.

178
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,625
I THINK YOU'RE JUST AS
TALENTED AS THEY ARE.

179
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,625
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
FAST YOU ALREADY WERE

180
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,833
WHEN YOU FIRST JOINED
TRACK AND FIELD.

181
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
THAT TRAINING THE CAPTAIN PUT
YOU THROUGH LOOKED INTENSE.

182
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,916
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
GOT THROUGH IT.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,333
YOU'RE AMAZING, AKITSUKI.

184
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,625
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT YOU'LL BE NUMBER ONE

185
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,291
ON THE TEAM NEXT YEAR!

186
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,416
- THANKS A LOT!
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER!

187
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,166
- GOOD, I'M GLAD.

188
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,791
IT FEELS GREAT TO JUST
SIT NEXT TO HIM.

189
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,375
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME HAPPY,
FOR NOW.

190
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,000
- ( gate opens )

191
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,416
- HMM? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

192
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,916
- NO!

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,166
PLEASE DON'T TURN AROUND!

194
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,416
DON'T STOP LOOKING AT ME!

195
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,250
- FOR A MOMENT, I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT'D HAPPENED TO ME.

196
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,416
AND NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

197
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,208
I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

198
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,833
EXCEPT THAT HONOKA'S
LIPS WERE VERY SOFT.

199
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,375
- AKITSUKI...

200
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,250
- ( gasps )

201
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,083
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'LL
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

202
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,625
- HONOKA! WAIT!

203
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,958
- HI, HONOKA.

204
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,041
- ( sighs ) WHY WOULD SHE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO SUDDENLY?

205
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

206
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,708
I DID IT. I KISSED SOMEONE.

207
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,541
HONOKA AND I KISSED.

208
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,500
- HELLO? ARE YOU DEAF?
- ( gasps ) UH...

209
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,875
DON'T DO THAT!

210
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,250
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU,
JEEZ, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

211
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,500
DID YOU FINISH PRACTICING?

212
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:23,125
- UH, YEAH
A WHILE AGO ER...

213
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,250
I, I MEAN, I JUST GOT DONE!

214
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,541
WHY AM I SO NERVOUS
AROUND HER?

215
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,458
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S MY
GIRLFRIEND OR ANYTHING.

216
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,875
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T STRESS
SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR TIME.

217
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,291
- WHO SAYS I'M STRESSING
OUT ABOUT IT?

218
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,083
- NO ONE. YOU JUST SEEMED DOWN,
BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

219
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,166
- WELL, I'M FINE.

220
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
- ALL RIGHT. WELL YOU GUYS
BETTER NOT FORGET

221
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,750
TO CHEER FOR ME TOMORROW.
IT'S MY FIRST INTER-HIGH

222
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,041
COMPETITION, SO I'M KINDA
NERVOUS.

223
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,125
- TOMORROW? WHAT'S GOING ON?

224
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,291
- THE INTER-HIGH COMPETITION.
I JUST TOLD YOU.

225
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,500
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

226
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,375
SO YOU CAME ALL THE WAY DOWN
HERE JUST TO TELL ME THAT?

227
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,000
- WELL, SORTA, YEAH...
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

228
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,750
- YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S...
THAT'S GREAT.

229
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,708
- WELL, IT'S BEEN SWELL, YAMATO.
TRY NOT TO SLEEP IN TOMORROW.

230
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,375
- HEY, WAIT! ASAHINA!

231
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,375
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
JUST TRACK AND FIELD?

232
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,958
I STILL LIKE ASAHINA.

233
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,083
MY FEELINGS FOR HER HAVEN'T
CHANGED, BUT...

234
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,375
HONOKA...

235
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,708
DOES THAT COUNT?

236
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,500
I THINK THAT WAS
MY FIRST KISS.

237
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,458
- ( crowd cheering )

238
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,416
- ( grunting )

239
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,625
- ( cheering )

240
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,250
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'LL
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

241
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,583
- THAT COULD MEAN SO
MANY THINGS. I WONDER.

242
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,083
ASAHINA'S UP.

243
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:08,750
UGH! WHY CAN'T I FOCUS?
I'M SUCH A STUPID IDIOT!

244
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,000
I PROMISED ASAHINA
I'D CHEER HER ON.

245
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,583
SHE MUST BE SO
NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.

246
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,625
- IS THIS SEAT TAKEN? AKITSUKI?

247
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,708
- HONOKA... NO, IT'S NOT.
YOU CAN SIT THERE.

248
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,666
- WELL, THANK YOU.

249
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,291
- I JUST KISSED THOSE
LIPS LAST NIGHT.

250
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,208
UM... HI... UM...

251
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,666
- SORRY, ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
I WASN'T THINKING.

252
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,125
- IT'S COOL.

253
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,083
- ( all cheering )

254
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,250
- WHAT THE...
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

255
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,375
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHAT JUST
HAPPENED?" WEREN'T YOU WATCHING?

256
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,166
ASAHINA JUST WON THIRD PLACE!

257
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,458
- OH, WOW.

258
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,500
- ONE HUNDRED AND
SEVENTY-THREE CENTIMETERS.

259
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,583
- THAT'S A NEW PERSONAL
RECORD FOR HER.

260
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,791
- INCREDIBLE!

261
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,625
LOOK AT ALL THE
REPORTERS AROUND HER!

262
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,958
- ( chattering )

263
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,791
- A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-
THREE CENTIMETERS.

264
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,208
THAT WAS HER UNOFFICIAL
NEW RECORD THE FIRST TIME

265
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,833
THE TWO OF US PRACTICED
TOGETHER THAT DAY.

266
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,833
AND NOW IT'S OFFICIAL.

267
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,791
ASAHINA IS SUCH AN AMAZING GIRL,
NOT TO MENTION VERY CUTE.

268
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,916
AFTER THIS, EVERYONE WILL
BE PAYING ATTENTION TO HER.

269
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,041
SHE'S MOVING IN A DIRECTION THAT
IS SO FAR BEYOND MY REACH.

270
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,208
AT THIS POINT, I'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO CATCH UP TO HER.

271
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,333
AND I'LL BE ALL ALONE.

272
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,833
- AKITSUKI...

273
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,333
- Woman: HEY, WE'VE GOTTA SET
UP THE PLATES!

274
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,416
YEAH, BRING 'EM IN!
BRING 'EM IN.

275
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,708
- YOU KEEP PUSHING
THOSE CHAIRS IN.

276
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,333
- MAN, THIS IS PAIN. WHY DO I
HAVE TO HELP WITH THIS STUFF?

277
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,500
I'M NOT EVEN ON THE TEAM.

278
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,208
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A
FRESHMAN, SWEETIE.

279
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,458
NOW STOP BEING SO LAZY.

280
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,250
HOLD THAT CORNER UP FOR ME.

281
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,333
- THANKS.
- NO PROB. UGH...

282
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,000
SO MUCH FOR PICKING UP GIRLS.
WHERE THE HECK IS YAMATO?

283
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,041
THAT JERK. THIS IS
SUCH A WASTE OF TIME.

284
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,958
- HEY! I SAID HOLD IT UP!
YOU'RE MAKING IT UNEVEN!

285
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:37,041
- HERE WE GO...
- Boy: SAKURAI! OVER HERE!

286
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,125
- COMING!

287
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,958
- Boy: CAN YOU BRING
ME A SNACK, TOO?

288
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,875
- SURE THING!

289
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,916
- Yamato: HONOKA IS
SUCH A HARD WORKER.

290
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,625
UNTIL THAT NIGHT, I JUST THOUGHT
OF HER AS A GOOD FRIEND.

291
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,333
BUT...

292
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,625
HER LIPS WERE SO SOFT...

293
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,166
- YOU'RE BLUSHING
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

294
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,458
- WHAT? NO I'M NOT. SHUT UP!

295
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,625
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE HANGING A
BANNER OR SOMETHING?

296
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,500
- I REALIZED, I WAS LOOKING FOR
HER WHEN I WALKED IN THE ROOM.

297
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,750
I WAS LOOKING FOR HONOKA.

298
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,583
- EVERYONE DID A
GOOD JOB TODAY.

299
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,416
BUT, YOU SHOULD
NEVER BE SATISFIED.

300
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,041
CHEERS, TO THE FUTURE OF THE
AOBA TRACK AND FIELD CLUB

301
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,375
AND TO ASAHINA'S THIRD
PLACE WIN TODAY!

302
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,416
- All: CHEERS!

303
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,166
- ALRIGHT!

304
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,916
- OH, MY GOSH,
LOOK AT THAT!

305
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,166
- COME ON, DRINK UP, SUZUKA.
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

306
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,666
- THANK YOU!

307
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,666
- OH, MY GOSH, I SAW YOU ON TV
YESTERDAY! DID YOU SEE IT?

308
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,708
THEY CALLED YOU THE
"HEROINE OF HIGH JUMP"

309
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,416
- YOU'LL BE SCOUTED
BY UNIVERSITIES!

310
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,708
- I BET YOU'LL GET AWESOME
SPONSORS, TOO!

311
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,791
- HEY. AKITSUKI! WHERE ARE
YOU? GET OVER HERE, NOW!

312
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,583
HASHIBA, WHERE'D AKITSUKI GO?

313
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,583
- I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS HERE
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

314
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:02,291
- THAT KID'S REALLY STARTING
TO BECOME A PAIN.

315
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,500
I HOPE HE INTENDS TO
WORK HARDER NEXT YEAR

316
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,416
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T CUTTING IT.

317
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,666
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GO AND LOOK FOR HIM?

318
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,708
WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK!

319
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,875
- SURE...

320
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,500
- ( sighs ) WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH ME? I DON'T GET IT.

321
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,083
JUST THE OTHER DAY I WAS
TOTALLY INTO ASAHINA,

322
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,791
AND NOW, I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HONOKA.

323
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,458
AND WHAT FOR?

324
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,708
JUST BECAUSE WE HELD HANDS?

325
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,375
OR IS IT BECAUSE...
SHE KISSED ME?

326
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,875
IS IT OKAY TO BE THINKING
ABOUT HER SO MUCH?

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,458
- THERE YOU ARE!
- HEY, HONOKA.

328
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,833
- YOU JUST DISAPPEARED.
I GOT WORRIED,

329
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,833
SO I CAME LOOKING FOR YOU.

330
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,458
- WELL, YA FOUND ME.
- MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

331
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,916
- OH LOOK, CARP!
- YEAH...

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,208
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT...

333
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,583
- LOOK HOW CUTE THEY ARE!

334
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,416
AND THEY'RE NOT AFRAID
OF US, EITHER!

335
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,666
- WOULDN'T IT BE FUN TO
FEED THEM SOMETIME?

336
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,708
- YEAH, IT WOULD.

337
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,875
I FEEL DIFFERENT WITH HER
THAN I DO WITH ASAHINA.

338
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,041
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND
OF HAPPINESS.

339
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,875
LIKE, I CAN RELAX
WHEN I'M WITH HER.

340
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,166
- IT'S COLD!

341
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,583
- HEY. YOU'RE OKAY NOW.
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

342
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,708
- THANKS.

343
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,166
- HONOKA, I...

344
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,083
- WAIT. JUST HOLD ON, OKAY?
- NO...

345
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,625
- I, UM, SORRY.

346
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:06,458
- NO, I'M SORRY. I UNDERSTAND.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...

347
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,750
I KNOW I'M NOT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, SO...

348
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,250
- AND AT THAT MOMENT, ALL I
COULD THINK ABOUT WAS...

349
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,208
HOW SWEET SHE LOOKED.

350
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,500
- AKITSUKI!

351
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,958
WHOA! NO WAY!

352
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,625
