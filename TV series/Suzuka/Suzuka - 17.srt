- SO, YOU GUYS MADE UP AND
YOU STILL HAVEN'T DONE IT?

26
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,708
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? WHY DO
YOU TWO KEEP PUTTING IT OFF?

27
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,416
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT,

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,958
HONOKA AND I REALLY DON'T
WANNA RUSH THINGS.

29
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,666
- SURE YOU DON'T.
LOOK, IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,041
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET ANY.

31
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,583
COME ON! YOU KNOW HOW GIRLS
ARE ALWAYS WAITING FOR

32
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,250
THE RIGHT PLACE AND
THE RIGHT TIME?

33
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,416
WELL, IT DOESN'T EXIST.
YOU HAVE TO CREATE IT.

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,708
- LOOK, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,041
- JUST LISTEN!

36
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,333
- NO, YOU LISTEN! WE'RE
GOING AT OUR OWN PACE.

37
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,750
WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP!

38
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,166
- WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE
EXCITING LUNCHTIME CONVERSATION.

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,916
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?
AM I ALLOWED TO KNOW?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,416
- YEAH. YOU'RE A GIRL.
MAYBE YOU CAN TALK TO HIM.

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,291
- HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,916
- YAMATO WANTED TO
GET IT ON WITH SAKURAI

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,208
SO HE FORCED HIMSELF ON HER.

44
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,875
- WHAT? NO I DIDN'T!

45
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,833
- UH...

46
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,250
- I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO
HIM THAT THE ATMOSPHERE

47
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,000
HAS TO BE RIGHT
FOR SEX, YA KNOW?

48
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,125
SOMETHING EXCITING
LIKE A HALLWAY.

49
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,791
- ( grunting )

50
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,750
- YOU ARE SUCH A
DISGUSTING CREEP!

51
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,000
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

52
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,750
- OW! OW! OW! OW! QUIT!
OW! STOP HITTING ME! OW!

53
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,458
- YOU LITTLE PERVERT!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,583
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

55
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
ALL YOU THINK ABOUT IS SEX!

56
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,875
- THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'RE THE
ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THAT!

57
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,875
- COME ON, AKITSUKI! LET'S GO!
STUPIDITY'S CONTAGIOUS!

58
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,708
- YAMATO AND I AREN'T DONE
TALKING, YET!

59
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,916
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. PLEASE!

60
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,166
- Soichi: OK, GUYS, WE'RE DONE.

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,708
- ( Yamato grunting )

62
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,708
- HEY, AKITSUKI. GOOD WORK
TODAY. THAT LOOKS HEAVY.

63
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,166
YOU CAN REALLY LIFT THAT MUCH?

64
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,750
- WELL, SURE.
IT'S PRETTY EASY NOW.

65
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,541
- Kinugasa: IT LOOKS
EASY ENOUGH.

66
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,041
- GREAT. IT'S OUR FORMER
CAPTAIN AGAIN.

67
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,166
- OKAY.

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,750
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BUILD UP A LOT MORE MUSCLE

69
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,416
THAN THIS AS A SPRINTER.

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
I THINK WE NEED TO ADD ANOTHER
THREE SETS TO YOUR ROUTINE.

71
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,583
- WHAT? NO WAY!

72
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,583
- HUH? WHAT WAS THAT?

73
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,000
- AH! I SAID I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO
IT, OKAY? PLEASE LET ME DO IT.

74
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,708
- YOU GOT IT!
- I'M BEGGING YOU!

75
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,791
- ALL RIGHT, YOU BETTER
WORK HARD NOW.

76
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,125
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

77
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,000
- UM, AKITSUKI?

78
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,291
I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
TODAY SO I CAN'T STAY.

79
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,500
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

80
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,291
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

81
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,875
IF YOU NEED TO GO, GO AHEAD.

82
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,458
- IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE.
I BET YOU DIDN'T BRING

83
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,291
YOUR UMBRELLA TODAY, DID YOU?

84
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,833
- WELL, NO. BUT IT'S NOT
RAINING THAT HARD.

85
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,833
IF I NEED TO, I CAN ALWAYS CALL
MIHO TO COME BRING ME ONE.

86
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,083
- OKAY.

87
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,208
- Miki: SUZUKA!

88
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,375
YOU READY?

89
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,833
- YEAH. LET'S GO.

90
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,833
- HEY, SUZUKA. DO YOU WANNA
STOP BY THE CAFE WITH ME?

91
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,166
IT'S CHESTNUT SEASON AND
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

92
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
MONT BLANCS AND
CHESTNUT CAKES ARE OUT.

93
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,500
DOESN'T THAT SOUND GOOD?

94
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,000
- NO, THANKS. NOT TODAY.

95
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,291
OH GREAT. THAT'S RIGHT.

96
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,708
I FORGOT I LEFT MY CELL
PHONE IN THE CLASSROOM.

97
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,916
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO GET IT.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,833
YOU CAN GO AHEAD IF
YOU NEED TO, MIKI.

99
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,333
- OH NO, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T MIND WAITING FOR YOU.

100
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,833
CAKES DON'T TASTE AS GOOD
WHEN I EAT THEM ALONE, ANYWAY.

101
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,708
- YEAH, BUT I ALREADY TOLD
YOU I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE

102
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,250
CAKE RIGHT NOW, REMEMBER?

103
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,250
- OH STOP. THIS IS THE ONLY
TIME YOU CAN HAVE THEM!

104
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,958
- ( grunting )

105
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,666
- ALL RIGHT, JUST TWO MORE SETS.

106
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,333
- DON'T GIVE UP!

107
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,791
- I'M NOT.

108
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,291
THIS IS SO AWKWARD.

109
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,041
- Miki: WHAT?
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

110
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,125
THAT YOUR PHONE HAS BEEN IN
YOUR BAG THIS WHOLE TIME?

111
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,375
- THAT'S RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

112
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,041
I DIDN'T REALIZE I HADN'T
ALREADY CHECKED IT.

113
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,291
- YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
TO LOSE YOUR FOCUS.

114
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,000
BUT NEVER MIND, I'M GLAD YOU
FOUND IT. LET'S GO EAT, 'KAY?

115
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,833
- WELL...

116
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,750
I CAN'T. I FORGOT I
HAVE TO WRITE A REPORT.

117
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,583
IT'S DUE TODAY, SO...

118
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,833
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

119
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,125
- NOPE. I REALLY NEED TO
FINISH IT BEFORE I GO.

120
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,083
- OH, COME ON. YOU CAN PUT IT
OFF FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE.

121
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,333
- I CAN'T!
MY TEACHER WILL KILL ME!

122
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,708
- OKAY, OKAY, FINE.
I'LL JUST GO BY MYSELF.

123
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,250
- MAN, I'M SO GLAD THAT'S OVER.

124
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,000
HEY, GUYS. I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVEN'T LEFT YET.

125
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,416
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

126
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,916
- JUST HANGING OUT!

127
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,625
- OH GREAT.
NOW IT'S RAINING HARDER.

128
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,916
OH WELL, I GUESS
I NEED TO CALL MIHO.

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,750
- WAIT, DON'T CALL HER YET.

130
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,125
UM...

131
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,541
- WHAT IS IT?

132
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,541
- WELL, UH...

133
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,833
HERE. YOU CAN BORROW MY UMBRELLA
IF YOU WANT TO, I GUESS.

134
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,083
- OH, THANKS.
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE?

135
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,375
- OH, I'LL BE FINE.

136
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,083
MIKI AND I WERE JUST GOING
SOMEWHERE TOGETHER,

137
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,958
SO SHE'LL LET ME SHARE HERS.

138
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,000
- OKAY.

139
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,708
WELL, THANKS.
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.

140
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,916
- SURE.

141
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,625
- SEE YA!

142
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,041
- UH, SUZUKA?

143
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,833
DO YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR AKITSUKI?

144
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,125
- WHY WOULD YOU
ASK ME THAT QUESTION?

145
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,041
- WELL, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE
ACTED KIND OF STRANGE

146
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,333
EVER SINCE YOU GOT BACK
FROM HIROSHIMA.

147
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,125
AND JUST NOW IT REALLY SEEMED
LIKE YOU WERE WAITING FOR HIM

148
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,250
SO THAT YOU COULD
GO HOME TOGETHER.

149
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,000
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

150
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,958
I JUST... UM...

151
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,041
I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR YAMATO
LIKE THAT. DON'T BE SILLY!

152
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,958
- I SEE. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
YOU FELT THAT WAY.

153
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,416
- LET'S GO, MIKI.

154
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,625
CAKE IS STARTING TO SOUND
REALLY GOOD ALL OF A SUDDEN.

155
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,708
- WELL ALL RIGHT THEN,
EVERYTHING IS ON ME TODAY,

156
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,500
SO EAT AS MUCH CAKE AS YOU WANT!

157
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,083
- MIKI...

158
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,333
- 'KAY?

159
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,708
- OKAY. THANKS.

160
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,583
- ( whistle blowing )

161
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,375
- OKAY! THAT'S IT FOR TODAY!
DON'T FORGET TO COOL DOWN!

162
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,708
- Track Members: OKAY!

163
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,958
-GOD, I'M SO GLAD IT'S OVER!

164
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,333
- HERE YOU GO, AKITSUKI. DO YOU
WANNA GO GET SOMETHING TO DRINK?

165
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,125
- UH, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I DON'T SEE HIM HERE TODAY,

166
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,791
SO WE SHOULD BE FINE.

167
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,333
- ( giggles )

168
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,333
- AKITSUKI AND SAKURAI SEEM TO
BE PRETTY CLOSE THESE DAYS.

169
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,458
- WELL OF COURSE THEY ARE.

170
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,666
THEY HAVE BEEN
DATING FOR A WHILE.

171
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,666
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
ALREADY KNOW THAT.

172
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,458
- WOW.

173
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,750
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

174
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,375
- YEAH. WEIRD, HUH?

175
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,000
- THERE YOU ARE.
LET'S GET GOING, SUZUKA.

176
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,875
- YEAH. 'KAY.

177
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,458
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
WE SHOULD GO DO KARAOKE.

178
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,833
I HOPE THEY HAVE
NANA'S NEW SINGLE ALREADY.

179
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,083
- WHO'S NANA?

180
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,625
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
SHE'S A SINGER! DUH!

181
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,500
- OH, RIGHT.

182
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,291
- I REALLY DON'T GET
KINUGASA SEMPAI.

183
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,666
I MEAN, WHY IS HE ONLY
THAT STRICT WITH ME?

184
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,666
- BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN YOU.

185
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,291
- I GUESS.

186
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,708
- Nana: NANA'S SONGS ARE ONLY
PLAYED IN HIGH QUALITY AUDIO!

187
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,750
( Nana singing )
♪ BABY I'VE BEEN GOING CRAZY ♪

188
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,875
- WOW. THAT'S COOL.

189
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,500
- ♪ I LOVE YOU ♪

190
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,208
♪ YES, I ADORE YOU ♪

191
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,041
- ARE YOU ATTRACTED
TO NANA SHIRAKAWA?

192
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,208
- OH, NO, NOT AT ALL.

193
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,458
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT BUYING

194
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,166
ONE OF THOSE REALLY
COOL MD PLAYERS!

195
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,500
- YOU WERE?

196
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,000
- YEAH. I PROMISE!

197
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,125
BUT THEY'RE SO DARN EXPENSIVE.
I COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

198
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,958
- I SEE.

199
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,041
- Waitress: WELL, HELLO THERE!

200
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,541
HOW ARE YOU, TODAY?

201
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,083
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONOKA?
- HUH?

202
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,875
I NOTICED YOU SEEM A LITTLE
UNEASY TODAY.

203
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,666
- NO. WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE.

204
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,083
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU
A LOT TO A FRIEND OF MINE,

205
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,208
AND SHE REALLY WANTS TO
MEET YOU TODAY.

206
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,250
- WHAT? SHE DOES?

207
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,625
- MMM-HMM. I SENT HER
AN EMAIL AFTER PRACTICE

208
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,041
AND TOLD HER WE GOT OUT EARLY,
SO SHE'S ON HER WAY RIGHT NOW.

209
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,875
- OKAY. THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SO JITTERY.

210
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,166
- I'M SORRY. I KNOW
THIS IS REALLY SUDDEN

211
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,666
AND I DON'T MEAN TO TROUBLE YOU.

212
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,125
PLEASE FORGIVE ME?

213
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,958
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

214
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,041
BUT, UM, DO I LOOK OKAY?

215
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,375
- THERE YOU ARE!

216
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,916
I JUST GOT OUT OF WORK. I HOPE
YOU WEREN'T WAITING TOO LONG!

217
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,916
- OH MY GOSH.

218
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,458
OH MY GOSH!

219
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,208
- SO, THIS IS YOUR BOYFRIEND?
HE'S REALLY CUTE!

220
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,500
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE WEARING A
DISGUISE OR SOMETHING, NANA?

221
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,833
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL!

222
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,708
- NAH, IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE!

223
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,125
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR FRIEND WAS HER?

224
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,083
- SO, ARE YOU SURPRISED?

225
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,750
I'M NANA SHIRAKAWA.
NICE TO MEET YOU!

226
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,125
- UH, YEAH, VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, TOO!

227
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,083
I'M A BIG FAN!
I JUST LOVE YOUR TV SHOW!

228
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,750
- I DON'T HAVE A TV SHOW.

229
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,291
- OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!

230
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,041
- I'M SORRY, I GUESS YOU'RE
A LITTLE STARTLED, HUH?

231
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
- MAYBE A LITTLE.

232
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,916
- OH, MY GOSH. IT'S...
IT REALLY IS HER!

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,833
- EVERYONE'S STARING.

234
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,333
- WELL THEN,
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!

235
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,625
- WOW. SO YOU TWO HAVE BEEN
FRIENDS SINCE JUNIOR HIGH?

236
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,125
- UM, YEAH.

237
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,958
- YEP. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS, RIGHT?

238
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,250
THE OTHER KIDS AT SCHOOL ALWAYS
TREATED ME SO STRANGELY

239
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,166
BECAUSE OF MY CAREER. EVERYONE
ELSE WAS SO AFRAID TO TALK

240
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,541
TO ME, THEY MADE ME FEEL
LIKE SOME KIND OF FREAK.

241
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,208
I KNOW THEY WEREN'T
TRYING TO BE MEAN TO ME,

242
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,541
BUT I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS AT ALL.

243
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,833
- I'M SORRY, I GUESS SHOW
BUSINESS GETS PRETTY ROUGH, HUH?

244
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,916
- MMM-HMM.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,833
ONE DAY, I HAD A REALLY
HORRIBLE TIME AT SCHOOL

246
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,791
AND DESPERATELY
NEEDED A CIGARETTE.

247
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,541
I STOPPED AT THE INARI
SHRINE TO LIGHT UP

248
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,583
ON MY WAY HOME FROM CLASS.

249
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,791
AND THAT'S WHEN
THE SHRINE MAIDEN

250
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,083
WHO WORKED THERE APPROACHED ME.

251
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,666
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T SMOKE.
IT'S REALLY BAD FOR YOU.

252
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,416
- WHAT? JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

253
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,916
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,583
YOU GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL AS ME.
SO, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

255
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM?

256
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,583
- THAT'S WHY I ASKED
WHAT YOUR NAME WAS.

257
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,166
- I THINK SHE INSULTED MY PRIDE
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

258
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,625
HOW DARE YOU! I DON'T NEED TO
LISTEN TO SOME BOSSY COSPLAYER!

259
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,500
- WHAT? THIS ISN'T A COSPLAY!
I WORK HERE!

260
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,625
HOW RUDE!
NOW GIVE ME YOUR CIGARETTE!

261
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,458
- NO WAY!

262
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,833
SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON I MET

263
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,958
THAT TREATED ME LIKE
A HUMAN BEING.

264
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,125
- IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE,
BELIEVE ME!

265
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,583
- BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE
HAD BECOME BEST FRIENDS,

266
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,541
AND IT'S BEEN THAT
WAY EVER SINCE.

267
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,833
- YEAH, I REMEMBER.

268
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,708
- SO LISTEN, YAMATO,

269
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,666
AS HONOKA'S BEST FRIEND,
I HAVE A FEW THINGS I WANNA SAY.

270
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,250
- HUH? YOU DO?

271
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,541
- THIS GIRL HAS HARDLY ANY
EXPERIENCE WITH GUYS AT ALL.

272
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,583
SHE BARELY EVEN KNOWS
WHAT DATING MEANS.

273
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,291
- I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR!

274
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,708
- SO DON'T GO AROUND
TRYING TO FORCE YOURSELF

275
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,583
ON HER. IT'S NOT COOL!

276
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,000
TRY BEING MORE GENTLE
FROM NOW ON, OKAY?

277
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,083
- STOP IT NANA, SERIOUSLY.

278
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,666
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THOSE
KINDS OF THINGS TO HIM.

279
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,625
- HONOKA! YOU NEED TO
STOP LETTING PEOPLE

280
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,291
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU!

281
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,000
HEY! JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

282
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,708
- TO THE RESTROOM!

283
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,166
- YEAH RIGHT. SHE ALWAYS RUNS
OFF WHEN SHE GETS EMBARRASSED.

284
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,416
- I'M KIND OF EMBARRASSED, TOO.

285
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,458
- OH WELL. YOU SHOULD SING
SOMETHING WHILE WE'RE WAITING!

286
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,083
- ME?

287
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,416
- SINCE WE'RE HERE,
DO YOU MIND IF I PRACTICE

288
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,583
SINGING A FEW SONGS?
THERE ARE SOME I WANNA TRY,

289
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,083
BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE CONFIDENCE YET.

290
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:29,500
- ♪ THE CARP, THE CARP,
THE CARP OF HIROSHIMA ♪

291
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,500
- Nana: WHAT SONG IS THAT?

292
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,625
- ♪ MARCHING ON,
TOWARDS A VICTORY ♪

293
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,291

295
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

296
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,958
- HELLO.

297
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,041
- YOU ARE SUCH A JERK!

298
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,625
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN DATING
HONOKA FOR A MONTH

299
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,916
AND ALREADY YOU'RE
CHEATING ON HER!

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,541
- NO. HEY! NO I'M NOT.

301
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,708
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

302
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,958
- SUZUKA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

303
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,250
- YAMATO'S CHEATING!

304
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,375
- THAT'S NANA.

305
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:11,166
WAIT JUST A MINUTE! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE WITH HER, AKITSUKI?

306
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,625
- UM, WELL, I'M NOT WITH...

307
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
ARE YOU DATING THREE GIRLS?

308
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,166
- NO!

309
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,958
- WELL THEN, YOU'VE GOT
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO!

310
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,750
- IF I COULD GET A WORD IN, I...

311
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,000
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

312
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,916
ARE YOU REALLY GOING
OUT WITH NANA?

313
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,250
- NO! I'M NOT!
- OH REALLY?

314
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,125
- WOW. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

315
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,000
- OKAY. SO YOU GUYS ARE
ALL FRIENDS FROM TRACK.

316
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,750
I WAS SO CONFUSED!

317
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,250
- ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT
HONOKA WOULD BE GOOD FRIENDS

318
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,708
WITH A CELEBRITY!

319
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,583
- UH. OH.

320
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,666
- SORRY.

321
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,541
- IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY 'BOUT IT.

322
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,666
- WELL, SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE,

323
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,125
WHY DON'T WE SING
SOMETHING TOGETHER?

324
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,125
I THINK THAT'D BE
FUN, DON'T YOU?

325
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,291
- OH ABSOLUTELY!
I'M GONNA GO TELL THEM

326
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,291
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE
STAYING LONGER.

327
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,125
- GREAT! COME ON YOU GUYS,
HAVE A SEAT!

328
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,791
- I NEED TO MAKE ROOM FOR MIKI
WHEN SHE COMES BACK.

329
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,125
- UM, AKITSUKI. ER, THERE'S
ROOM OVER HERE IF YOU WANT.

330
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,458
- OKAY, THANKS.

331
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,875
- YOU READY? THIS ONE'S OFF
MY LATEST ALBUM, OKAY?

332
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,000

333
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,166

334
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,333
- WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE
ACTUALLY HAVE THE REAL SINGER

335
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,583

336
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,416

340
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,333
SO AKITSUKI, ARE YOU GONNA SING?

341
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,791
- NO, I'M OKAY.

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,666
- YAMATO, DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU ONLY KNOW

343
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,583
HOW TO SING BASEBALL SONGS?

344
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,000
WELL I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU SING
ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE.

345
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,875
ARE YOU TONE-DEAF OR SOMETHING?

346
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,541
- I CAN SING.
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

347
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,750
- UM. JUST DO
YOUR BEST, AKITSUKI.

348
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,583
- I'M NOT JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND LET HER CALL ME TONE-DEAF.

349
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,041
WHERE IS IT?

350
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,416
HERE IT IS.

351
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,166
- Suzuka: YAMATO, YOU CAN'T SING
THAT. THAT'S THE ONE I PICKED.

352
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,833
- IT IS?

353
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,166
OH SHOOT. WELL,

354
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,875
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO PICK
ANOTHER ONE THEN.

355
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,375
- OH, JUST MAKE IT
A DUET AND SING!

356
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,416
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS WE COULD DO THAT.

357
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,250
- YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?
I'M OKAY WITH IT.

358
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,208
- HERE'S THE MICROPHONE!
NOW TRY YOUR BEST

359
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,916
NOT TO SING OFF-KEY, ALL RIGHT?

360
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,458
- SHUT UP!
JUST TRY NOT TO DIE OF SHOCK.

361
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,791
- ( music playing )

362
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
OH, NO!
THAT'S NOT THE SONG I WANTED!

363
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,958
SO YOU'RE SINGING
SOLO AFTER ALL!

364
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,166
- OH. THAT'S COOL.

365
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,958
- YEAH. SORRY 'BOUT THAT.
THE NUMBERS LOOK A LOT ALIKE.

366
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,291
- UH, AKITSUKI,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

367
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,083
- I SWORE I WASN'T GOING
TO DO ANYTHING

368
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,666
TO HURT HONOKA'S
FEELINGS ANYMORE.

369
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,208
- MAN! I SANG SO MUCH!

370
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,416
- THAT WAS FUN!

371
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,125
- WELL, SUZUKA AND I STILL
HAVE STUFF TO DO

372
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,375
BEFORE WE HAVE TO GO HOME.

373
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,666
- OKAY.

374
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,500
- WE DEFINITELY NEED TO
GET TOGETHER AGAIN SOON.

375
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,541
- SOUNDS GOOD.

376
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,041
- LATER. BE CAREFUL.

377
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,375
- SEE YA.

378
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,583
- WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD GO, TOO.

379
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,291
- YEAH. NANA?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

380
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,541
- WELL, UH, YOU GUYS DON'T
MIND IF I WALK HOME WITH YOU

381
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,291
SO I CAN CATCH UP WITH HONOKA?
BESIDES, SOMEONE NEEDS

382
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,666
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T TRY
TO DO ANYTHING TO HER AGAIN!

383
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,125
- HUH? BUT I...

384
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,416
- WELL ALL RIGHT THEN,
THIS IS IT.

385
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,583
THANK YOU FOR WALKING ME
ALL THE WAY HOME, NANA.

386
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,583
- IT WAS MY PLEASURE. REALLY.

387
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,875
IT WAS SO GREAT GETTING
TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

388
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,583
BUT I NEED TO GRAB A CAB
AND HEAD HOME.

389
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,125
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I UNDERSTAND. AKITSUKI,

390
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,250
YOU BE SAFE GOING HOME! BYE!

391
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,833
- BYE. SEE YA.

392
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,583
- GIVE ME A CALL LATER, OKAY?

393
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:12,041
- YOU'RE REALLY GOOD TO HER,
YAMATO. SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

394
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,000
I'VE HAD MY EYE ON YOU
ALL DAY TODAY.

395
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,666
PRETTY TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU'RE A GOOD KID.

396
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,666
IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND A KIND AND
RELIABLE BOYFRIEND, BELIEVE ME.

397
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,375
SO I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR HONOKA.

398
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,458
- OH NO, I'M THE LUCKY ONE HERE.

399
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,416
HONOKA'S SUCH A GOOD PERSON,
NOT TO MENTION A GREAT COOK!

400
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,083
I DON'T DESERVE SOMEONE
AS SWEET AS HER.

401
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,166
SHE'S AMAZING. SO I'M
TRYING TO WORK HARDER

402
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,375
AT BEING A BETTER
BOYFRIEND FOR HER.

403
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,416
I WANNA DO EVERYTHING
PERFECTLY. SHE DESERVES IT.

404
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,708
I DON'T EVER WANNA DO ANYTHING
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

405
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
- ARE YOU STUPID? SERIOUSLY.

406
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,916
- HUH?

407
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,458
- SO, YOU WANT TO BE A BETTER
BOYFRIEND FOR HER SO YOU

408
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,875
"WON'T HURT HER FEELINGS?"

409
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,708
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

410
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,500
- JUST A MINUTE!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

411
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,458
YOU JUST GOT DONE TELLING ME
WHAT A GREAT GUY I AM

412
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,750
A SECOND AGO!

413
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,291
- AT KARAOKE, DID YOU JUST
STOP SINGING WITH SUZUKA

414
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,833
SO YOU COULD AVOID HURTING
HONOKA'S FEELINGS?

415
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,500
- WELL, YEAH.

416
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,208
- SO YOU DECIDED TO REACH OVER
AND HOLD HER HAND.

417
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,000
IS THIS WHAT YOU MEAN BY BEING
A BETTER BOYFRIEND TO HER?

418
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,875
THE ONLY THING YOU THINK ABOUT
IS HOW SHE REACTS TO YOU.

419
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,875
- OH PLEASE TELL ME WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE DONE!

420
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,291
SHOULD I HAVE JUST
SUNG WITH ASAHINA

421
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,958
AND IGNORED HONOKA ALL NIGHT?

422
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,125
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
YOU THINK ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

423
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,083
IS MAKE SMALL,
SUPERFICIAL GESTURES

424
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
AND THAT MAKES YOU A GOOD GUY?

425
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,541
WELL, IT'S THAT LOGIC
THAT MAKES YOU AN IDIOT!

426
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,333
- OH. IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

427
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,500
WELL GUESS WHAT?

428
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,166
CALLING SOMEONE AN IDIOT
MAKES YOU AN IDIOT!

429
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,750
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN SHOW BIZ?

430
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,166
FREAK!

431
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,208
- ( sighs )

432
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,333
IRRESPONSIBLE, NAME CALLING,
AND A QUICK TEMPER?

433
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,083
YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE KID.

434
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,333
IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

435
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,291
- EXCUSE ME?

436
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,583
- NO WONDER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
HAVE TO PUT ON AN ACT

437
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,583
IN FRONT OF HONOKA!
I BET THIS IDEAL BOYFRIEND

438
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,333
THING IS QUITE
A STRETCH FOR YOU, HUH?

439
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,291
- WHAT? I'M NOT ACTING AROUND
HER! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

440
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,333
AND I'M NOT BEING INSINCERE!

441
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,958
- IS THAT SO? BECAUSE
IT ALWAYS LOOKS

442
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,375
LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD
TO ME. EVEN NOW.

443
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,666
- WELL, I'M NOT.

444
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,083
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

445
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,125
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT KINDS
OF THINGS HONOKA LIKES?

446
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,333
WHAT ARE HER HOBBIES?

447
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,375
CAN YOU EVEN TELL ME
WHEN HER BIRTHDAY IS?

448
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,666
- WELL...

449
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,041
NO, I CAN'T. I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

450
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,875
- YEAH. YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE
HONOKA AT ALL, DO YOU?

451
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,000
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO SHE IS, YAMATO!

452
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,041
THE ONLY REASON YOU WANNA
BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND TO HER

453
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,291
IS SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF,

454
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,750
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

455
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,375
LISTEN, YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T
WANNA HURT HONOKA'S FEELINGS.

456
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,750
WELL, YOU ARE HURTING
HER BY DATING HER

457
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,791
WITH THAT THOUGHTLESS
ATTITUDE.

458
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,500
- SHE'S RIGHT.

459
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,833
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
HONOKA AS A PERSON.

460
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,125
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TRYING TO
GET TO KNOW HER BETTER.

461
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,625
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

462
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,416
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
HER BOYFRIEND.

463
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,291
- IT'S SEPTEMBER 16TH.

464
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,000
HER BIRTHDAY,
IT'S THREE DAYS FROM TODAY.

465
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,250
THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A
WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO GET

466
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,125
HER A PRESENT, SO
YOU BETTER HURRY.

467
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,375
YAMATO, I'M NOT TRYING TO
BREAK YOU GUYS UP OR ANYTHING,

468
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,000
BUT THIS IS MY BEST FRIEND,
TRY LOOKING AT HER.

469
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,041
I WANT YOU TO SEE HER
FOR THE PERSON SHE IS.

470
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,833
STOP WORRYING SO MUCH
ABOUT BEING PERFECT

471
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,666
AND REALLY GET TO KNOW HER.

472
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,875
- RIGHT. THANKS.

473
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,291
- WELL, THAT'S REALLY ALL I
WANTED TO SAY. SEE YA.

474
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,583
- YEAH.

475
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,833
I NEED TO GET TO KNOW HONOKA.
I NEED TO LOOK AT HER.

476

HONOKA'S BIRTHDAY
IS IN TWO DAYS.

499
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,125
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO GET HER.
WHERE SHOULD I GO?

500
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,625
I HATE SHOPPING.

00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,250
HEY, ASAHINA,
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP ME?

502
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,041
- HUH?
- NOTHING. NEVER MIND.
