- WELL GOOD MORNING, YAMATO!
- OH, GOOD MORNING, AUNT AYANO.

26
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,125
HOW ARE YOU?

27
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,333
- GREAT. DO YOU HAVE TIME
TO EAT SOME BREAKFAST?

28
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,333
- I CAN'T, I'M RUNNING LATE,
BUT THANKS.

29
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,041
- ALL RIGHT. WELL HAVE A
GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL

30
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,916
AND PLEASE MAKE SURE
YOU EAT PLENTY FOR LUNCH, OKAY?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,666
- OKAY, WELL, I BETTER
GET GOING NOW.

32
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,083
- WHERE'S SAKURAI? OH, NO.

33
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,791
- IT'S SAD, SHE USED TO COME BY
TO MEET HIM EVERY MORNING.

34
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,333
- THIS FEELS DIFFERENT.

35
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,416
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE
WALKED TO SCHOOL ALONE.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,625
- AKITSUKI!

37
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,583
- IT REALLY HAPPENED.
WE BROKE UP.

38
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,458
- ( clock chiming )

39
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,791
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

40
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,833
( panting ) I WALKED TOO
SLOW AND NOW I'M LATE!

41
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,583
UH, HONOKA!

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,625
- GOOD MORNING.

43
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,500
- UH, GOOD MORNING.

44
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,958
- SO, UH...

45
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,500
- I THINK CLASS IS
ABOUT TO START!

46
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,125
- ( clock chiming )

47
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,291
- Yasunobu: WOW,
YOU GUYS BROKE UP?

48
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,458
- UM, YEAH.

49
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,041
- WHAT'D I TELL YA, MAN?

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,791
I GAVE YOU THE BEST ADVICE
YOU COULD EVER ASK FOR,

51
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,833
FREE OF CHARGE,

52
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,541
AND YOU JUST DIDN'T LISTEN,
DID YOU?

53
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,166
- I KNOW, AND YOU WERE
COMPLETELY RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

54
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
- HUH?

55
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,875
- Yamato: HONOKA WAS SUCH A
PATIENT AND GIVING PERSON.

56
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,583
SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

57
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,291
THE ONLY THING
I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

58
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,166
WAS THE WAY I FELT AND
WHAT I WANTED.

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,208
I WAS SUCH AN AWFUL BOYFRIEND.

60
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,333
- HEY, COME ON! DON'T BEAT
YOURSELF UP LIKE THAT.

61
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,458
LOOK, I'M SURE THERE ARE
PLENTY OF THINGS SAKURAI DID

62
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,291
THAT SHE'S REGRETTING NOW, TOO.

63
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,458
- NO WAY.
THIS WHOLE MESS IS MY FAULT!

64
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,208
- DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC, DUDE.

65
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,666
NO ONE'S EVER "RIGHT", "WRONG"
OR "AT FAULT" IN RELATIONSHIPS.

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,000
IN THIS CASE, I JUST THINK
YOU AND SAKURAI

67
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,666
ARE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,458
I GOT IT! WE NEED
TO HAVE A PARTY, MAN!

69
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,041
I'LL INVITE TONS OF HOT CHICKS

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,041
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND ONE
THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU,

71
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,458
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

72
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,833
- NO THANKS. I'M JUST NOT
IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW.

73
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,916
- I SEE.
- Miki: HEY! AKITSUKI!

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,500
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO DOWN?

75
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,708
- WELL IF IT ISN'T THE
NOSIEST GIRL IN THE SCHOOL.

76
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,041
- I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU, AM I?

77
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,500
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

78
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,875
I BET SOMEONE GOT A ZERO ON
THEIR CHEMISTRY TEST,

79
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,791
DIDN'T THEY?

80
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,458
WELL, DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT
GOING TO GO TELLING EVERYONE.

81
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:25,250
BESIDES, GUESS WHAT I GOT
ON MINE? TWENTY! A TWENTY!

82
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:30,166
- UH, NO. IT'S NOT THAT.
- OH, COME ON! IT'S OKAY!

83
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
YOU'RE DUMBER THAN I THOUGHT!

84
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,666
- JUST STAY OUT OF IT, JERK!

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,000
THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU!

86
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,500
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!
YOU INTERRUPTED US!

87
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,791
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU!

88
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,208
- OH, YOU WERE TALKING DIRTY,
WEREN'T YOU?

89
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,625
- OH, PLEASE. WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AM, SOME KIND OF PERVERT? HUH?

90
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,625
- I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE A PERVERT!

91
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,166
- I DARE YOU TO SAY
THAT AGAIN, SLUG TRAIL.

92
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,083
- HEY! WAIT!

93
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,625
- JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE, NOSEY.

94
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,166
- I'M NOT NOSEY! I JUST WANNA
KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.

95
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,625
- OH REALLY?

96
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,208
- MMM-HMM. TOTALLY. SPILL IT.

97
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,875
- YEAH RIGHT. IN YOUR DREAMS.

98
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,875
- ( grunting )
YOU'RE SUCH A JERK!

99
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,541
- Yasunobu: OW! OW! OW!
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

100
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,333
- ( whistle blowing )

101
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,000
- Kinugasa: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET STARTED!

102
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,958
- All: YES, SIR!

103
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,291
- HEY, MANAGER!
BRING ME A TOWEL!

104
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,416
- ME TOO, PLEASE!

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,208
- SHE'S NOT HERE TODAY.
- HUH? WHY NOT?

106
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,541
- HEY AKITSUKI!

107
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,166
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY
SAKURAI ISN'T HERE TODAY?

108
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,000
- UH, I, NO, SIR.

109
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,166
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE SHE IS, SERIOUSLY?

110
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,291
- BUT SHE IS YOUR
GIRLFRIEND, ISN'T SHE?

111
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,916
WHY WOULDN'T SHE TELL YOU?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,666
- WELL, NO.
WE BROKE UP YESTERDAY.

113
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,833
- WHAT?
- All: YOU BROKE UP?

114
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,333
- UH, YEAH.

115
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SO THAT'S
WHY SAKURAI ISN'T HERE!

116
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,250
- SO SHE JUST DOESN'T
WANNA BE AROUND YOU?

117
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,791
- REALLY, SWEET!

118
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,000
- THAT'S GREAT.

119
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,791
AND JUST BEFORE THE FALL
ROOKIE COMPETITION.

120
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,833
- OH NO. I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT THAT.

121
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,375
AND SHE'S BEEN SUCH
A BIG HELP TO US.

122
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,208
- THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

123
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,125
- YOU'RE THE REASON OUR
MANAGER'S NOT HERE!

124
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,250
THANKS A LOT!

125
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,291
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE
DOING THE WASH

126
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,000
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
NOW, AKITSUKI!

127
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,541
- Boy: AW, THIS IS GREAT.
JUST WHAT WE NEED.

128
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,625
- BUT WAIT...

129
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,208
- OH, NO. AKITSUKI AND
SAKURAI BROKE UP.

130
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,666
- Suzuka: THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

131
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,666
- I KINDA FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

132
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,500
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO
BLAME HIM FOR EVERYTHING.

133
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,375
- WELL, IT'S HIS FAULT.

134
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,541
WHATEVER. MIKI, ARE
YOU GONNA STRETCH OR NOT?

135
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,166
- ( gasping )
SUZUKA! OW! THAT HURTS!

136
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,875
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH! SUZUKA!

137
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,166
- MAN, THEY WERE SO MEAN TO YOU!

138
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,958
I'M SURE YOU TWO
HAD YOUR REASONS.

139
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,208
I'M TOTALLY ON
YOUR SIDE, AKITSUKI.

140
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,666
- ( laughing ) WELL, I THINK
YOU MAY BE THE ONLY ONE.

141
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,208
SO THANKS, KOBAYASHI.

142
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,708
- HEY, DON'T MENTION IT, OKAY?
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

143
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,416
- AND IT'S KOBAYAKAWA!
- OH, SORRY.

144
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,541
- ( laughing )
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!

145
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,666
- THANKS.

146
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,750
- OKAY. I THINK I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

147
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,125
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU
CALLED ME CRYING, THOUGH!

148
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,041
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU!

149
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,500
- Honoka: I'M REALLY SORRY.

150
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,250
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LAY ALL
THIS ON YOU SO SUDDENLY.

151
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,625
- THAT'S OKAY. IT'S MY DAY OFF.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. SERIOUSLY.

152
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,250
- AFTER WE BROKE UP I REALLY
THOUGHT THAT I'D BE OKAY.

153
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,833
BUT THEN WE RAN INTO EACH
OTHER TODAY

154
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,625
AND MY HEART COMPLETELY
SANK, NANA.

155
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,666
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE HAVING REGRETS?

156
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,791
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANTED TO
BREAK UP WITH HIM?

157
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,000
- WELL, NO. I DIDN'T WANT TO.

158
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,083
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I REALLY HAVE
A CHOICE IN THIS SITUATION.

159
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,541
HE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ASAHINA.

160
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,875
- BUT CAN YOU REALLY BE SURE
ABOUT THAT?

161
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,625
I DON'T KNOW. DID HE EVER
ACTUALLY COME OUT AND SAY IT?

162
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,916
THAT HE CARES ABOUT SUZUKA,
LIKE, MORE THAN A FRIEND?

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,666
- NO. HE DIDN'T.

164
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,291
- WELL, THEN?
- WELL, THEN WHAT?

165
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,375
- LISTEN HONOKA, I KNOW YAMATO
HAS HIS ISSUES, BELIEVE ME.

166
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,875
BUT YOU'RE NOT PERFECT EITHER.

167
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,125
DON'T YOU THINK YOUR
INSECURITIES

168
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,750
MAY ALSO BE A PROBLEM?

169
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,416
AM I WRONG?

170
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,208
- I DON'T KNOW.

171
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,291
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH!
NOW JUST LISTEN!

172
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,041
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
ASAHINA WAY TOO MUCH!

173
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,458
WELL, JUST...
IT MEANS YOU'RE WRONG.

174
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,458
AND I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT
ASAHINA ALL THE TIME

175
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,875
AND I HAVE PROOF.

176
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,541
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER
WHEN WE WALK TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

177
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,333
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER
WHEN YOU COOK FOR ME.

178
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,041
AND I HONESTLY WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT HER WHEN I WENT SHOPPING

179
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,583
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

180
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,125
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
- YOU THINK?

181
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,000
- YEAH, THIS IS
PROBABLY MY FAULT.

182
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,666
I'M THE ONE WHO
BROKE UP WITH HIM.

183
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,208
I WOULDN'T HAVE REACTED
THE WAY THAT I DID

184
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,458
IF I WERE MORE CONFIDENT.

185
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,458
I GUESS IT'S MY OWN FAULT
THAT I'M HURTING THIS WAY NOW.

186
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,583
- HONOKA...

187
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,708
IT'LL BE OKAY!

188
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,916
COME ON! YOU'RE A SWEET,
ATTRACTIVE GIRL!

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,500
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
A NEW BOYFRIEND IN NO TIME!

190
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,083
- OH, NANA.

191
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,666
- OH, WHAT? I'M SERIOUS! THERE'S
TONS OF NICE GUYS OUT THERE!

192
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,791
AND I BET SOMEONE
ALREADY LIKES YOU!

193
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,125
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

194
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,583
- Nana: WELL, WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIND OUT THEN!

195
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,041
- ( both laughing )

196
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,666
- I'M SO TIRED, UGH...

197
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,875
- LOOKS LIKE SAKURAI DIDN'T
SHOW UP TODAY, EITHER. OH WELL.

198
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,583
- ALL RIGHT, WAKE UP, LADIES!

199
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,958
IT'S TIME TO START
RUNNING INTERVALS!

200
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,958
- All: OKAY.

201
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,833
- I'M REALLY NOT IN THE
MOOD FOR THIS TODAY.

202
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,375
- YEAH, ME NEITHER, MAN.

203
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,333
- UH...

204
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,041
- HEY! YOU'RE BACK!

205
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,125
- Boy 1: SHE'S BACK!
- Boy 2: HONOKA!

206
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,166
- Boy 3: HEY MANAGER!

207
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,083
- HEY GUYS! I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY!

208
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,583
- SHE'S BACK.

209
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,666
- Soichi: IT'S FINE, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. HAVE A SEAT!

210
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,416
- Boy 1: YEAH, TAKE A REST!

211
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,416
- Boy 2: DO YOU NEED A DRINK?

212
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,875
- Boy 3: I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE BACK!

213
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,500
- Soichi: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET PRACTICE STARTED!

214
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,625
- All: ALL RIGHT!

215
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,458
- Kobayakawa: HERE.

216
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:01,583
- I, I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING
BETTER. - I AM. THANK YOU.

217
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,625
- WELCOME. I, I KNOW
IT'S BEEN HARD,

218
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,750
BUT IF YOU EVER WANNA
TALK, I'M HERE.

219
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,958
- WELL, THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

220
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,166
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
IT'S NOTHING REALLY.

221
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,666
- OKAY. WELL THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT'S BEEN ON MY MIND.

222
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,208
- YEAH, SURE.

223
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,500
- DO YOU THINK IT'S STRANGE TO
WANT TO GO OUT WITH SOMEONE

224
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,666
YOU JUST BROKE UP WITH?

225
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,458
I MEAN, IS THAT NORMAL?

226
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,291
- HUH! WHAT?

227
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,500
- IF WE WERE TO START DATING
AGAIN AT THIS POINT,

228
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,916
WE'D PROBABLY STILL FIGHT
OVER THE SAME THINGS.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,625
BUT IF I TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK
ON MY INSECURITIES,

230
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,625
MAYBE SOMEDAY,
I'LL BE ABLE TO...

231
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,333
I'LL BE ABLE TO CONFESS
MY FEELINGS TO AKITSUKI AGAIN!

232
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,250
- 163 CENTIMETERS! ALL RIGHT!

233
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,666
- ON THE RELAY TEAM?

234
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,000
- THAT'S RIGHT. THE TWO OF YOU
HAD THE FASTEST TIMES

235
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,041
IN THE HUNDRED METER RACE TODAY.

236
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,541
I THINK YOU'D BE A GREAT
ADDITION TO THE TEAM.

237
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,250
- FASTEST? REALLY?
- BUT...

238
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,208
THIS IS ONLY MY FIRST YEAR
IN THE CLUB.

239
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,500
- WE NEED TO FIND THE FASTEST
RUNNERS ON THE TEAM FOR RELAY.

240
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,458
THAT'S AN ORDER, AKITSUKI.
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

241
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,208
- RIGHT! I'LL DO MY BEST!

242
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,666
- HEY, WAY TO GO, AKITSUKI!
- UH, WHAT?

243
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,125
- DO YOUR BEST!

244
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,208
- OKAY. THANKS.

245
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,125
- YEAH, UH, I'M GONNA WORK
REALLY HARD, TOO!

246
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,541
- UH, OKAY. GOOD LUCK, YOU TWO!

247
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,250
- RELAY PRACTICE STARTS RIGHT
AFTER REGULAR PRACTICE.

248
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,041
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO
STAY A LITTLE LATE.

249
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,833
- NO PROB!
- OKAY.

250
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,625
- THE RELAY TEAM?

251
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,291
- I KNOW! IT'S EXCITING,
ISN'T IT? HE'S AMAZING!

252
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,708
- IS HE?

253
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,333
- YA KNOW, I WAS
SO WORRIED ABOUT HIM

254
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,000
AFTER HE BROKE UP WITH SAKURAI.

255
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,000
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
HOW DEPRESSED HE WAS!

256
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,875
- Suzuka: WHATEVER.
I DON'T CARE HOW HE FEELS.

257
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,958
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, SUZUKA?

258
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,375
DID YOU TWO HAVE ANOTHER
FIGHT OR SOMETHING?

259
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,625
- THAT'S NOT IT...
IT'S JUST...

260
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,000
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE AS IGNORANT

261
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,625
AS HE IS. THAT'S ALL.

262
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,041
- IGNORANT, HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

263
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,416
I KNOW HE BROKE UP WITH
SAKURAI, BUT...

264
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,041
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
MAKES HIM IGNORANT.

265
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,291
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE REASON WAS.

266
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,750
- HE DUMPED HER BECAUSE
HE WAS ANNOYED WITH HER.

267
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,875
- WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?
DID HE REALLY MEAN THAT?

268
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,833
- WHY DON'T YOU GO
ASK HIM YOURSELF?

269
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,958
- HE SAID THAT?

270
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,625
- SEE YOU LATER, AKITSUKI!

271
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,500
- OKAY. BYE, KOBAYA... KAWA.

272
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,541
- LISTEN, WE MAY BE PARTNERS
IN RELAY,

273
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,416
BUT YOU'LL NEVER BEAT ME IN
THE HUNDRED METER!

274
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,041
- THAT'S RIGHT! ALSO...

275
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,791
( crying ) DAMN IT!

276
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,750
- NEVER MIND!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM?

277
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,458
- WE NEED TO TALK!

278
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,291
- WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE,
HASHIBA? IT'S SO LATE!

279
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:16,250
- I WAS WAITING FOR YOU!
- HUH?

280
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,083
- SO IS IT TRUE THAT YOU DUMPED
SAKURAI

281
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,958
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
SHE WAS ANNOYING?

282
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:26,250
- OH, GREAT. I BET I KNOW
WHERE YOU HEARD THAT.

283
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,666
- ASAHINA? RIGHT?

284
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,958
- DON'T EVEN TRY TO
BLOW THIS OFF. ANSWER ME!

285
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,416
- OKAY, YES.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

286
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,625
- YOU'RE LYING.

287
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,458
IF SAKURAI WAS SO ANNOYING,
THEN WHY ARE YOU SO DEPRESSED?

288
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,666
AND IF YOU ACTUALLY DUMPED HER
LIKE YOU SAID YOU DID,

289
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,000
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
SHOWN UP TO PRACTICE!

290
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,333
I CAN SEE RIGHT
THROUGH YOU, AKITSUKI!

291
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,875
- I'M NOT LYING!

292
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,250
- SEE YA!
- LISTEN TO ME!

293
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,000
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU ALONE
UNTIL YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

294
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:05,166
- ALL RIGHT, FINE. SHE ACCUSED
ME OF STILL LIKING ASAHINA.

295
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,416
THEN WE HAD A HORRIBLE FIGHT.

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,375
- WHAT? YOU STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR SUZUKA?

297
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,833
- ( clock chiming )

298
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,791
- Yamato: NO. OF COURSE I DON'T.

299
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,250
I THINK I TRIED TOO HARD TO BE
THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND

300
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,583
AND WAS ONLY WORRIED ABOUT
HOW IT MADE ME LOOK.

301
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,666
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
HONOKA'S FEELINGS AT ALL.

302
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,750
I THINK BECAUSE OF THAT,

303
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,833
SHE FIGURED I MUST STILL
BE INTO ASAHINA.

304
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,750
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL SUZUKA THE TRUTH?

305
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,500
- BECAUSE. THAT'S TOO HARD.

306
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,000
I COULDN'T JUST SAY, "WE
BROKE UP BECAUSE OF YOU."

307
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,000
- YEAH, RIGHT. I SEE.

308
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,333
- ANYWAY, DO ME A FAVOR AND
DON'T SPEAK TO ASAHINA

309
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,791
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

310
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,750
SHE'S ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT
THIS ENOUGH AS IT IS.

311
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,250
- AKITSUKI...

312
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,416
OKAY. I WON'T.

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,916
- GREAT THANKS.
I'M GONNA GO HOME NOW.

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,333
- WAIT! DON'T GO YET!
- WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

315
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,958
- YOU HAVE TO BE HUNGRY
AFTER ALL THAT PRACTICE.

316
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,708
LET'S GO EAT SOMETHING
BEFORE WE GO HOME.

317
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,833
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO
TRY THIS PLACE FOR A LONG TIME!

318
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,458
BUT SINCE IT'S ON THE
BASEMENT FLOOR,

319
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,666
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME ALONE.

320
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,625
- I SEE. YOU COULD'VE
JUST ASKED ASAHINA.

321
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,000
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
DRAG ME HERE WITH YOU?

322
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,083
IT'S NOT LIKE I FEEL
COMFORTABLE EITHER. GEEZ!

323
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,708
- ALL RIGHTY. IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S READY TO GO.

324
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,041
SHOULD I TURN IT OVER NOW?

325
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,375
- Yamato: NO, YOU IDIOT!

326
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,708
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
THE BATTER'S STILL RUNNY?

327
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,833
- Miki: BUT ISN'T IT
GOING TO BURN?

328
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,333
- NO. IF YOU FLIP IT TOO MUCH,

329
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,541
THE AIR BUBBLES ESCAPE AND IT
WON'T BE SOFT AND FLUFFY.

330
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,791
- Yamato: LOOK,
DON'T TOUCH IT, OKAY!

331
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,708
- YOU'RE SO ANNOYING! GEEZ!

332
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,041
ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE KANSAI STYLE?

333
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,958
DO YOU THINK A BOY FROM
HIROSHIMA CAN HANDLE THIS?

334
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,791
- I'M A PRO! DON'T CHALLENGE ME!

335
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,791
- Miki: YEAH RIGHT.
GIMME YOUR SPATULA!

336
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,916
- Yamato: NO! WAIT!

337
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,333
DON'T BE STUPID!

338
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,791
- THERE WE GO!
AND IT'S PERFECTLY COOKED!

339
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,833
- QUIT PATTING IT LIKE THAT.
- OH DON'T WORRY, IT'S FINE.

340
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,458
- NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE
GREEN SEAWEED!

341
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,958
- WAIT!

342
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,708
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING! PUT THE SAUCE ON FIRST!

343
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,250
- WHAT, SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE THE PANCAKE POLICE NOW?

344
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,416
- WHAT THE HECK IS
THE PANCAKE POLICE?

345
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,083
- Miki: SO, LET'S EAT, SHALL WE?
WHERE'S THE SAUCE?

346
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,291
- Yamato: HASHIBA!

347
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,958
- AKITSUKI! CAN YOU TELL ME IF
I STILL HAVE GREEN SEAWEED

348
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,083
IN MY TEETH?

349
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,458
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

350
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,375
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD
SUCH BITTER OKONOMIYAKI.

351
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,541
EVEN THE WAITRESS
WAS STARING AT US.

352
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,000
- SERIOUSLY?

353
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,375
- HEY, LISTEN.
- WHAT IS IT NOW?

354
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,583
- NOTHING GOOD WILL EVER COME
FROM STRESSING OUT ABOUT IT.

355
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU KNOW...

356
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,708
WHENEVER YOU HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE
THIS, JUST EAT SOMETHING YUMMY.

357
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,666
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED HOW
MUCH IT CHEERS YOU UP!

358
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,000
- THANK YOU.

359
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,416
SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT ME. THAT'S
WHY SHE TOOK ME OUT TO EAT.

360
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,541
- I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO MAKE YOU WORRY.

361
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,583
- HUH?

362
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,375
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

363
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,375
I THINK HONOKA'S OVER IT AND
SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL.

364
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,666
- BUT I'M...

365
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,791
- Miki: OH, I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

366
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,166
I, UH, I HEARD YOU'VE BEEN
CHOSEN FOR THE RELAY TEAM.

367
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,208
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU GIVE IT YOUR ALL, OKAY?

368
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:42,333
- OH, YEAH. EXCEPT THAT...
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

369
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,875
( sighing )

370
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

371
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,875
- IT'S JUST, I ONLY JOINED
TRACK AND FIELD

372
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,625
BECAUSE ASAHINA WAS IN IT.

373
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,625
AND NOW THAT SHE HATES ME,
ALL THIS FEELS WRONG.

374
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,791
THERE'S REALLY NOT A
GOOD REASON FOR ME TO CONTINUE.

375
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,416
- WELL, UH...

376
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,083
- I FEEL GUILTY SINCE
THERE ARE KIDS

377
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,375
WHO ACTUALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

378
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,125
SO I THINK I SHOULD...
YOU KNOW...

379
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,666
- WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
EVERYONE WAS ANNOYED WITH YOU

380
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,791
WHEN YOU STARTED.

381
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,000
- WHAT?

382
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,291
- YOU JOINED THE TEAM DURING
THE OFF SEASON,

383
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,166
YOU DIDN'T KEEP UP WITH
YOUR PRACTICES

384
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,583
AND YOU STILL GOT A REGULAR
SPOT IN THE COMPETITION

385
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,083
OVER SOME SENIORS!

386
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,000
AND YET, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL.

387
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,750
FOR SOME REASON, I HAVE HIGH
EXPECTATIONS FOR YOU.

388
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,291
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO
AMAZING THINGS.

389
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,375
AND I REALLY THINK THAT
EVERYONE ELSE IS STARTING

390
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,083
TO SEE THE SAME THING AS I DO.

391
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,916
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,750
- IT'S THE TRUTH! AND YOU HAVE
THE RESPONSIBILITY

393
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,458
TO MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS.

394
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,583
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
IN TRACK AND FIELD!

395
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,000
- UM, OKAY.

396
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,625
- SO STOP FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF!

397
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,916
- C'MON, WE'D BETTER GET GOING.
- RIGHT, OKAY.

398
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,875
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU
THAT YOU ARE

399
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,583
AN UNREASONABLY NOSEY PERSON?

400
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,000
- I AM NOT!

401
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:19,375
- WELL THEN, I'M GONNA DO MY
BEST. YOU CONVINCED ME.

402
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,500
- ALL RIGHT!

403
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,791
LISTEN, UH, WHY DON'T WE
GO GET SOME DESSERT

404
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,583
BEFORE WE HEAD HOME?

405
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,416
AND THIS TIME IT'S ON YOU!

406
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,625
- HEY! WASN'T IT ON ME
THE LAST TIME?

407
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,458
- Miki: IS THAT RIGHT?
- Yamato: YES!

408
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,125
- Miki: OKAY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT THEN!

409

THIS IS HASHIBA.

- Yamato: HEY HASHIBA,
HOW'S IT GOING?

428
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,333
- Miki: WELL, I WAS JUST
WONDERING.

429
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,500
WERE YOU ABLE TO MAKE UP
WITH SUZUKA, YET?

430
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,791
- Yamato: UM, NO. NOT EXACTLY.

431
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,666

FIGHTING AGAIN?
