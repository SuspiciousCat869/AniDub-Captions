25
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,666
- WELL, GOOD MORNING, ASAHINA.

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,750
- GOOD MORNING.
I THINK YOU GOT

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,916
SOME STRAY HAIRS
STICKING UPBACK THERE.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,166
- UH...

29
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,916
- BUT I'D SAY THAT'S NORMAL.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,541
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU TODAY?

31
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,083
NOT GET ENOUGH
SLEEP LAST NIGHT?

32
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,750
( sighs )

33
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,208
WHAT'S WITH HER?

34
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,750
- EVERYBODY GRAB A PARTNER
AND START STRETCHING.

35
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,125
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO TODAY

36
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,750
FOR A WHILE. IT'S
P.E. TEST TIME.

37
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,791
- REALLY? DUDE,
DON'T TELL ME

38
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,250
YOU TAKE ALL THIS
NONSENSE SERIOUSLY.

39
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,333
- ( laughing ) NOT REALLY,
BUT I WILL ADMIT

40
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,291
THAT I'M PRETTY
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

41
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,833
BECAUSE BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH,

42
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,500
I ALWAYS SCORED HIGHER IN
P.E. THAN ANYONE ELSE.

43
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,458
I JUST WANNA SEE
HOW I'LL DO HERE.

44
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,083
- WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD GET WARMED UP.

45
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,916
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA
START WITH THEN?

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,333
- HMM.

47
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,041
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW ABOUT THE LONG JUMP?

48
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,333
WE CAN GO OUTSIDE
AND GET SOME FRESH AIR.

49
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,916
- UH, HOW ABOUT WE TRY
THE VERTICAL JUMP INSTEAD?

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,208
THAT WAY,
WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.

51
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,750
- GOOD CALL.
I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK.

52
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,291
- HEY, DON'T GET
THE WRONG IDEA, YASUNOBU.

53
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,333
- WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING
AWFULLY LONELY

54
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,708
WARMING UP HERE ON YOUR OWN.

55
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,750
BETCHA'D HAVE MORE FUN
IF YAMATO AND I JOINED.

56
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,833
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

57
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,583
- YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

58
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,541
- ALL RIGHT! THEY KNOW A GENIUS
WHEN THEY SEE ONE.

59
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,041
- OH, REALLY? WHERE IS HE?

60
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,416
- Yasunobu: ALL RIGHT, ACE.

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,916
WOW US WITH YOUR SKILLS, MR. TOP
ATHLETE FROM JUNIOR HIGH.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,250
- OH! I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GOOD AT ATHLETICS.

63
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,833
- OH, YEAH. YAMATO WAS
QUITE THE ATHLETIC STUD

64
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,125
BACK HOME, WEREN'T YOU, BUD?

65
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,541
RIGHT?

66
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,625
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK "STUD"
MIGHT BE PUSHING IT.

67
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,875
- I HOPE YOU CAN BACK THIS UP,

68
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,833
OR YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A FOOL OF YOURSELF.

69
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,833
YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN,
DO YA?

70
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,083
- HERE I GO.

71
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,958
- I'LL MARK YOUR SCORE DOWN
FOR YOU, OKAY?

72
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,291
- HEY, YOU'RE JUST
KIDDING, RIGHT?

73
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,750
HE'S NOT REALLY A STAR
ATHLETE, IS HE?

74
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,083
- SURE, HE TOLD ME

75
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,458
HE EXCELLED IN EVERYTHING
EXCEPT FOR ONE EVENT.

76
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,916
- WHICH EVENT WAS THAT?

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,083
- I DON'T KNOW. BUT I'LL
FILL YOU IN WHEN I FIND OUT.

78
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,916
WELL, WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH,
I SUPPOSE.

79
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,750
- ( grunting )

80
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,625
- 72.5 CENTIMETERS. GOOD JOB.

81
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,625
- ALL RIGHT! THAT'S
MY NEW PERSONAL BEST.

82
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,041
SEE, I TOLD YOU
THAT I WASN'T HALF BAD.

83
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,250
- WELL, IT WASN'T BAD, BUT WITH
AS MUCH AS YOU BUILT IT UP,

84
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,750
I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING
A LITTLE MORE OUT OF YOU.

85
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,208
- WHAT?

86
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,500
- ( grunting )

87
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,458
- WOW. SUZUKA GOT
84 CENTIMETERS.

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,666
- WHAT? SHE BEAT ME?

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,791
- WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT
FROM THE HIGH JUMP GODDESS?

90
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,000
- I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE BEAT ME.

91
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,833
- HEY, LOOK.
I MADE SUZUKA'S MARK.

92
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,416
- WAY TO GO, HATTORI.
NOT BAD AT ALL.

93
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,000
- HMM.

94
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,833
- ( wind howling )

95
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,041
- ( grunting )

96
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,291
- NICE GOING, SUZUKA!
WHAT AN AMAZING JUMP!

97
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,583
- YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD, TOO.

98
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,291
FULL OF SURPRISES.
I'M IMPRESSED!

99
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,333
YOU SHOULD TRY OUT
FOR THE TRACK TEAM.

100
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,583
- WELL, THANKS, SAKURAI,

101
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,375
BUT I REALLY DON'T
THINK I'M GOOD ENOUGH.

102
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,375
I MEAN, TONS OF OTHER STUDENTS
ARE BETTER ATHLETES THAN I AM.

103
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,375
- I'M SURE THEY ARE.

104
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,458
BUT HE'S NOT ONE OF THEM.

105
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,125
COME ON, AKITSUKI, CHEER UP.
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

106
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS EXPECTING FROM HIM.

107
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,666
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S HORRIBLE OR ANYTHING.

108
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,291
HE'S JUST YOUR AVERAGE GUY HERE.

109
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,166
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT, I GUESS.

110
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,208
- GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
THE COMPETITION'S STIFFER HERE,

111
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,208
AND HE'S JUST STARTED.

112
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,875
HE'LL COME AROUND.

113
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,416
- DON'T GIVE UP. THERE ARE STILL
PLENTY OF EVENTS LEFT.

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,750
- YEAH, BUT WHAT'S THE USE?

115
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,208
COMING UP NEXT
IS THE 50-METER SPRINT.

116
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,250
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

117
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,500
- COME ON. AT LEAST TRY.

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,375
- I WAS THE FASTEST KID
BACK IN MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

119
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,833
THEN, JUST TO SEE HOW I'D DO,

120
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,833
I DECIDED TO ENTER A RELAY
RACE AT THE CITY TOURNAMENT

121
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,458
THE SUMMER BEFORE
MY 7TH GRADE YEAR.

122
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,750
OUR SCHOOL NEVER EVEN
HAD ITS OWN TRACK TEAM.

123
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,458
WE ALMOST DIDN'T FIND
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ENTER.

124
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,916
- REALLY? HOW DID IT TURN OUT?

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,541
- THEY PICKED ME TO RUN
THE ANCHOR POSITION FOR THE TEAM

126
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,333
AND WE CAME IN DEAD LAST
IN THE RACE.

127
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,166
SO SINCE THEN, I'VE NEVER RACED
SHORT DISTANCES.

128
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,458
I WOULD MAKE UP ANY
EXCUSE TO AVOID THEM.

129
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,833
THAT IS, UNTIL TODAY.

130
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,500
- HMM.

131
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,666
- I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I'LL JUST SKIP IT AGAIN.

132
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,166
- YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

133
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,458
- ( sighing )

134
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,458
( groaning )

135
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,583
- I JUST CAN'T BEAR
TO WATCH HIM ANYMORE.

136
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,375
- AW, CUT HIM SOME
SLACK, SUZUKA.

137
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,750
SHOW HIM A LITTLE SUPPORT
AND HE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

138
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,375
- I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE OF THAT.

139
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,833
HE'S RACING AGAINST KOBAYAKAWA.

140
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,708
- HE'S HERE ON
A TRACK SCHOLARSHIP, RIGHT?

141
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,250
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

142
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,875
- RUNNERS, ON YOUR MARK.

143
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,666
- HMM.
- HUH?

144
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,625
- YOU SEE THAT?
IT LOOKS LIKE YAMATO'S

145
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,541
USING THE ROCKET STARTER STANCE.

146
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,083
- HE'S PROBABLY THINKING THAT
IF HE USES BOTH OF HIS LEGS

147
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,625
TO KICK OFF,

148
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,958
IT'LL GIVE HIM AN EXTRA EDGE.
LIKE THAT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

149
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,666
- ALL RIGHT. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE
AT REDEMPTION. DON'T BLOW IT.

150
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,000
- GO, AKITSUKI! YOU CAN DO IT!

151
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,958
- WE'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH.

152
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,750
- GET SET.

153
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,541
- I JUST HAVE TO GIVE IT
ALL I GOT.

154
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,750
- NO WAY.

155
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,125
- ( panting )

156
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,666
- ( wind howling )

157
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,541
- I KNEW HE COULD DO IT.

158
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,833
- 5.93 SECONDS!

159
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,750
- SO, IS THAT LIKE
REALLY GOOD OR SOMETHING?

160
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,583
- OF COURSE THAT'S GOOD.
YOU JUST SET A SCHOOL RECORD.

161
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,458
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

162
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,541
- WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU BEFORE?

163
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,791
- YEAH, DID YOU JUST
TRANSFER IN?

164
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,166
- I TOLD YOU
HE WOULD SURPRISE YOU.

165
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
- WAIT A MINUTE! YOU'RE TELLING
ME YOU KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME?

166
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,041
- WELL, WHENEVER WE WERE KIDS
AND WE GOT IN TROUBLE,

167
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,500
HE NEVER GOT CAUGHT

168
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,041
'CAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS THE
QUICKEST TO MAKE HIS GETAWAY.

169
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,666
- BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT TOURNAMENT

170
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,083
HE TOLD ME ABOUT?

171
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,458
- I DON'T KNOW.

172
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,208
THAT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE
OF THE REST OF THE TEAM.

173
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,500
I'M TELLING YOU,
THE KID'S GOT TALENT.

174
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,666
YOU SAW WHAT HE JUST DID.
HE TOTALLY SMOKED THAT GUY!

175
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,458
- HEY, ASAHINA. I THINK I'VE
FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING

176
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT I'M GOOD AT.

177
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,166
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
ANYONE RUN THAT FAST, AKITSUKI!

178
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,583
- REALLY?

179
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,541
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

180
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,833
- IT WAS PRETTY FAST,
BUT I'VE SEEN FASTER.

181
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,333
LET'S GET GOING, SAKURAI.

182
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,041
WE NEED TO GET OURSELVES A
PLACE AT THE STARTING LINE.

183
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,166
- OH, OKAY.

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,875
- WHAT'S WITH HER?
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

185
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,041
- AND I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER WILL, MY FRIEND.

186
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,750
BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,
I DO THINK YOU IMPRESSED HER.

187
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,166
- WOULD YOU STOP?

188
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,916
THAT'S NOT THE REASON WHY
I DECIDED TO RUN THE RACE.

189
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,208
ASAHINA.

190
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,958
- ( choking )

191
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,041
( coughing )

192
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,875
WHAT'S WRONG?

193
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,708
DO I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY FACE
OR WHAT?

194
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,666
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.

195
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,416
- HEY, YAMATO, I HEARD YOU RAN
AGAINST A KID TODAY

196
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,708
WHO GOT INTO SCHOOL

197
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,583
ON A SPRINTING SCHOLARSHIP,
AND YOU BEAT HIM.

198
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,125
THAT'S SO COOL. I'M IMPRESSED.

199
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,541
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

200
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,416
WELL, I HEARD IT FROM HATTORI.

201
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,291
- ( laughing ) WHAT A BIG MOUTH!

202
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,708
I THINK I WAS MORE SURPRISED
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

203
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,750
I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE
IT HAPPENED, BUT I WON.

204
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,666
- AND GUESS WHAT. HATTORI SAID
HE BROKE THE SCHOOL RECORD.

205
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,458
- OH, REALLY?
IT WAS PRETTY AVERAGE.

206
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,541
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ASAHINA? WHY CAN'T YOU JUST...

207
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,541
- I REALLY SHOULD BE GOING.

208
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,083
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,208
- AH.

210
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,625
GREAT TIMING, ASAHINA.
GOOD MORNING.

211
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,458
- MORNING.

212
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,333
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY TODAY,
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,208
- YEAH, I GUESS.

214
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,416
- HMM.

215
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,000
HEY.

216
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,083
THAT GIRL IS INCREDIBLY STRANGE.

217
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,708
- GOOD MORNING, SUZUKA.

218
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,625
- GOOD MORNING, AYANO.

219
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,166
- THE NEWS SAID IT'S
SUPPOSED TO RAIN LATER.

220
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,000
DID YOU REMEMBER TO BRING AN
UMBRELLA WITH YOU?

221
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,125
- UH-HUH.

222
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,208
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

223
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,416
- ASAHINA, WAIT UP.

224
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,333
- BYE, YAMATO.

225
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,875
- HEY!

226
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,541
- HAVE FUN.

227
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,750
- SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SUZUKA'S BEING WEIRD?

228
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,333
- IT'S THE STRANGEST THING.
I'LL CATCH HER STARING AT ME

229
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,250
AND THEN SHE'LL SAY SOMETHING
RUDE OUT OF NOWHERE.

230
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,916
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,916
- YOU IDIOT.
DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,666
THAT'S THE WAY A GIRL ACTS
WHEN SHE'S IN LOVE.

233
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,083
- IN LOVE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

234
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,625
- AH, YOU KNOW.

235
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,708
LIKE WHEN A GIRL CATCHES YOU
WHEN YOU'RE CHECKING HER OUT.

236
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,333
- I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT
LIKE THAT.

237
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,083
- OF COURSE YOU HADN'T.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

238
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,333
I MAY NOT KNOW MUCH,

239
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,291
BUT I DEFINITELY KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT WOMEN.

240
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,541
- RIGHT.

241
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,250
- AND I KNOW THAT YOU
SCORED A LOT OF POINTS

242
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,375
WITH HER YESTERDAY

243
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,458
WHEN YOU STEPPED UP
AND WON THAT RACE.

244
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,583
SERIOUSLY. I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYONE RUN THAT FAST.

245
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,625
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN. DO YOU
REALLY THINK SHE LIKES ME MORE,

246
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,791
JUST BECAUSE I WON
A STUPID RACE?

247
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,541
- I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE YOU
THAT SHE DOES.

248
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,125
SO, GOOD LUCK, DUDE.

249
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,500
- YOU GUARANTEE IT, HUH?

250
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,208
- ( wind howling )

251
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,500
- ( heavy rain )

252
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,708
- AND THE NEXT STEP IS YOU TAKE
THE SUM OF THE FACTORS OF X

253
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,958
TO THE THIRD AND Y TO THE THIRD.
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

254
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,708
- DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

255
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,666
THAT'S THE WAY A GIRL
ACTS WHEN SHE'S IN LOVE.

256
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,625
- COULD HE BE RIGHT?

257
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,291
DOES SHE REALLY LIKE ME?

258
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,875
- ( chuckling )

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,500
- ( school bell ringing )

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,625
- AW, MAN. I'LL GET SOAKED
WALKING HOME IN THIS DOWNPOUR.

261
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,208
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

262
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,458
IT SURE WOULD BE NICE

263
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,458
IF SOMEONE WOULD LET
ME SHARE THEIR UMBRELLA.

264
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,750
- SUZUKA!

265
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,375
- OH, HEY, MIKI.

266
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,541
- WE CAN'T PRACTICE OUTSIDE
TODAY BECAUSE OF THE RAIN.

267
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,500
WE'LL BE IN THE WEIGHT ROOM.

268
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,083
- I SEE.
THEN WEIGHT TRAINING IT IS.

269
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,916
- NOW WHAT?
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET HOME?

270
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,541
- AKITSUKI?

271
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,375
I GUESS YOU FORGOT
YOUR UMBRELLA?

272
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,833
WELL, I REMEMBERED MINE, SO
NOW WE CAN SHARE.

273
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,291
- OKAY.

274
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,875
- I'M AFRAID IF YOU
WALK HOME IN THE RAIN

275
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,750
YOU MIGHT GET SICK AGAIN.

276
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,625
- UM, THANKS. BUT I, UH,

277
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,666
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
BEFORE I CAN LEAVE.

278
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,458
- THAT'S FINE. I CAN WAIT
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

279
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,833
- NO, THAT'S OKAY. I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU WAIT FOR ME.

280
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,583
MAYBE I'LL JUST STAY HERE
TILL IT STOPS RAINING.

281
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,125
- I KNEW SAKURAI WOULD REMEMBER
TO BRING HER UMBRELLA.

282
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,041
HEY! WHAT WOULD
I DO WITHOUT YOU?

283
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,875
SEE, I'M ON MY WAY TO THIS PARTY
AND YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

284
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,000
I CAN'T SHOW UP
WITH WET CLOTHES.

285
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,541
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

286
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,666
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME
TO THE TRAIN STATION?

287
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT FAR. I PROMISE.

288
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,750
- UM, WELL, UH...

289
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,500
- I'M GONNA BORROW YOUR
FRIEND FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

290
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,833
YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU? LATER.

291
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,416
- LATER.

292
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,916
WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING?

293
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,541
( sighing )

294
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,208
GEEZ, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO LIFT SOME WEIGHTS?

295
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,791
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE NEEDS TO, ANYWAY.

296
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,166
SHE LOOKS PERFECT AS SHE IS NOW.

297
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,416
WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING?

298
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,375
OH, FORGET IT, I'M LEAVING.

299
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,000
I'M TIRED OF WAITING
AROUND FOR HER.

300
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,125
ALL RIGHT, JUST ACT NATURAL.

301
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,500
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY
WHEN I SEE HER?

302
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,291
I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
MY UMBRELLA, ASAHINA.

303
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,458
DO YOU MIND
SHARING YOURS WITH ME?

304
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,875
NO PRESSURE, IT'S UP TO YOU.

305
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,541
( laughing forcefully )

306
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,708
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

307
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,333
MAYBE HE'S A STALKER.

308
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,375
- OR JUST PLAIN CRAZY. DID YOU
HEAR HIM TALKING TO HIMSELF?

309
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,333
- MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO HOME.
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

310
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,500
I COULD WAIT
JUST A LITTLE LONGER, I GUESS.

311
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,291
- YAMATO?

312
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,458
- HELLO, ASAHINA.

313
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,166
- I THOUGHT YOU'D GONE HOME
A LONG TIME AGO.

314
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,083
- NO, IT'S JUST, I WAS HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH MY LOCKER.

315
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,583
- BUT IT'S OPEN.

316
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,791
- WELL, YOU SEE. I JUST GOT IT
TO OPEN UP A SECOND AGO.

317
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,000
( laughing forcefully )

318
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,541
- YOU FORGOT YOUR UMBRELLA
TODAY, DIDN'T YOU?

319
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,083
DO YOU WANNA SHARE MINE WITH ME?

320
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,416
- YEAH. I FORGOT
MY UMBRELLA TODAY.

321
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,833
THINK YOU CAN SHARE
YOURS WITH ME?

322
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,125
'COURSE, IT'S OKAY IF
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO.

323
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,125
( laughing forcefully )

324
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,250
REALLY?

325
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,708
- YEAH.

326
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,333
- ( raining heavily )

327
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,166
- ( wind howling )

328
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,583
- Yamato:
THE WIND'S STRONG TODAY.

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,250
- YEAH.

330
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,958
- IT SURE IS NICE TO TAKE A WALK
IN THE RAIN ONCE IN A WHILE.

331
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,666
- MM-HM.

332
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,666
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
I CAN'T EVER READ THIS GIRL.

333
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,083
WHAT'S SHE THINKING?
MAYBE YASUNOBU WAS WRONG.

334
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,791
- I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

335
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,916
- WHAT?

336
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,875
- YOU... YOU'RE PRETTY FAST.

337
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,958
- YEAH, I GUESS.

338
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,916
- AND I KNOW THAT YOU
SCORED A LOT OF POINTS

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,041
WITH HER YESTERDAY

340
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,916
WHEN YOU STEPPED UP
AND WON THAT RACE.

341
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,375
- THEN AGAIN, MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

342
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,875
I EVEN SURPRISED MYSELF
WHEN I WON.

343
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,250
- HMM.

344
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,583
- ( car revving )

345
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,625
