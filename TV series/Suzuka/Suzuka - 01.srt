- Yamato:
IT TOOK ME SEVEN HOURS TO GET

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,041
FROM THE HIROSHIMA
COUNTRYSIDE TO TOKYO.

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,250
I MADE THE TRIP SO I
COULD START MY FIRST DAY

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,625
OF HIGH SCHOOL AT A NEW PLACE.

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,958
I WAS WALKING BY MY NEW
SCHOOL TO CHECK IT OUT

6
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,333
WHEN I SAW THIS GIRL.

7
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,750
NOT JUST ANY GIRL.
SHE WAS AMAZING.

8
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:44,208
I'D NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE HER.
SHE WAS INCREDIBLE.

- YAMATO, WHAT'S TAKING YOU
SO LONG?

34
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,583
- MIHO, YOU'LL CATCH YOUR DEATH
OUT HERE. WAIT FOR HIM INSIDE.

35
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,291
- I'M TOO NERVOUS. HE SAID HE
WOULD BE HERE AT TWO O'CLOCK.

36
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,041
I HOPE AUNTIE DIDN'T CHANGE HER
MIND AND MAKE HIM STAY HOME.

37
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,625
THAT WOULD JUST SEND YAMATO
INTO A TAILSPIN.

38
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,750
- DON'T YOU WORRY.

39
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,166
MY SISTER SAID HE COULD
COME TO TOKYO

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,458
AS LONG AS HE STAYED WITH US
WHILE HE WAS HERE.

41
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,000
MAYBE HE GOT DISTRACTED,
RIGHT, GORO?

42
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,750
HE'S NOT EXACTLY THE
MOST RESPONSIBLE KID ON EARTH.

43
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,625
- SORRY, I'M LATE. I GOT
DISTRACTED WALKING AROUND.

44
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,666
YAMATO AKITSUKI REPORTING
FOR DUTY AND AT YOUR SERVICE.

45
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,583
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU MADE IT, YAMATO.

46
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,750
BUT YOU REALLY WORRIED
MY PRINCESS.

47
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,750
- OH, SORRY.

48
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,250
- YOU... YOU'RE
SO IRRESPONSIBLE!

49
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
- MIHO, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN!

50
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,458
YOU'VE GOTTA BE IN
THE SEVENTH GRADE BY NOW.

51
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,875
- EIGHTH GRADE.

52
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,333
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK TOO OFTEN
BEFORE YOU TALK, DO YOU?

53
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,291
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU CAUGHT ME THIS TIME.

54
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,500
MY MOM TOLD ME
YOU GUYS RENOVATED,

55
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,791
BUT THIS IS BIGGER
THAN I EXPECTED.

56
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,833
- YEAH. IT'S A NICE CHANGE.

57
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,375
- Ayano: THE BATH AREA
WAS REMODELED

58
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,750
INTO A DAY SPA AS WELL.

59
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,541
- SO THIS IS MY NEW HOME.

60
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,958
THE PLACE WHERE I'LL BE
STARTING A WHOLE NEW LIFE.

61
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,625
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

62
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,666
LETTING ME COME LIVE
WITH YOU, AUNT AYANO.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,875
- STOP ACTING SO FORMAL.
I'M YOUR AUNT.

64
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,916
- ACTUALLY, WHILE I'M HERE,
YOU'RE MY LANDLADY.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,958
- I'M YOUR AUNT FIRST. NOW GET
INSIDE OUT OF THE RAIN.

66
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,250
WE'VE ALREADY SENT YOUR LUGGAGE
TO YOUR ROOM, SO YOU'RE ALL SET.

67
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,458
- YOU GOTTA BE WORN OUT, YAMATO.
COME ON IN AND RELAX.

68
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,708
- OH, OKAY.

69
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,375
- YOUR ROOM IS 301.
IT'S UPSTAIRS.

70
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,458
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX

71
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,166
IS FOR WOMEN ONLY.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,916
- SO DON'T YOU GO MAKING
ANY TROUBLE FOR THEM.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,791
- HEY, I'M NOT A TROUBLEMAKER.

74
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,583
- I THINK YAMATO IS GOING TO
WORK OUT JUST FINE.

75
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,958
BESIDES, WE COULD USE
SOME MALE HELP AROUND THIS PLACE

76
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,125
AND HE'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.

77
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,291
- GIVE ME SOME CREDIT, WILL YA?

78
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,875
I'M GETTING ROOM AND BOARD
PLUS PAY FOR MY SERVICES,

79
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,583
SO I'LL DO THE BEST JOB I CAN
AT WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

80
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,833
EVEN IF IT'S SIMPLE
LIKE CLEANING THE BATH.

81
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,750
- CLEANING THE BATH IS A LOT
HARDER THAN YOU THINK IT IS.

82
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,791
I DON'T THINK
I'D MAKE LIGHT OF IT.

83
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,500
NO SWEAT. I HAVE CONFIDENCE
IN ME AND YOU WILL, TOO.

84
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,666
FINE, SO MAYBE IT'S A BIT
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

85
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,250
BUT THIS PLACE IS HUGE.

86
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,500
THEY'VE GOT JACUZZIS,
THEY'VE GOT SAUNAS.

87
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,791
IT'S TOTALLY HIGH END
AND MODERN.

88
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,916
I BET THIS PLACE FILLS UP
WITH GIRLS FROM THE SCHOOL.

89
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,041
I WONDER IF SHE'LL BE HERE.

90
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,500
- YAMATO, WHY AREN'T
YOU DONE YET?

91
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,125
FOR SUCH A SIMPLE JOB,
YOU SURE ARE TAKING FOREVER.

92
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,583
YOU NEEDED TO BE DONE WITH THIS
LIKE AN HOUR AGO.

93
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,375
- OKAY. I'LL TRY IT LIKE THIS.

94
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,916
NOT BAD FORM, HUH?

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,916
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT
FASTER THAN THAT.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,583
OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE BETTER.

97
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,000
- THEY'RE HERE.
- WHO'S HERE?

98
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,500
- CUSTOMERS! COLLEGE GIRLS
WHO LIVE IN THE COMPLEX

99
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,250
LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
AROUND THEM.

100
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,875
THEY CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS.

101
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,291
- DANGEROUS? HOW?

102
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,250
- GREAT, THEY'RE NOT DONE
CLEANING OUT THE BATH YET.

103
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,666
- HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT?

104
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,500
- ( gasps )

105
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,625
- HEY, I HEARD ABOUT YOU.
AREN'T YOU YAMATO,

106
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,083
THE LANDLADY'S NEPHEW?

107
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,750
- Oh, I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
ALL I'M WEARING IS A TOWEL.

108
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,166
WHAT A BAD FIRST IMPRESSION.

109
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,958
- YOU KNOW, THE LANDLADY
FORGOT TO MENTION TO ME

110
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,541
HOW CUTE YOU ARE.

111
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,208
- ( exclaims )
- NO!

112
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,541
YAMATO, OUT OF THE BATH. NOW.
YOU CAN FINISH LATER.

113
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,208
- ( exclaims )

114
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,916
THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

115
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,875
UH... IT'S NOT...

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,333
IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE!

117
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,166
AS USUAL, MY TIMING
WAS JUST PERFECT.

118
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,666
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR
WISHING SHE'D STOP BY.

119
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,166
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPECIFIC
AS TO WHEN.

120
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,833
GEEZ, SHE MUST THINK
I'M A TOTAL PERV.

121
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,125
( screaming )

122
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,625
- Miho: YAMATO?
- Ayano: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

123
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,208
- UGH! YOU CREEP! GET OUT!

124
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,791
- Miho: THAT'S SUZUKA'S ROOM!

125
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,958
- I THOUGHT I WAS GOING INTO MY
ROOM. I SWEAR! I DIDN'T KNOW!

126
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,541
- WHAT ARE YOU, BLIND?
LOOK AT THE DOORPLATE!

127
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,416
- IT SAYS SUZUKA ASAHINA
RIGHT THERE NEXT TO THE DOOR.

128
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,416
YOUR ROOM IS OVER HERE.
NUMBER 301.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,500
- I JUST MOVED IN SO I'M STILL
GETTING USED TO THIS PLACE.

130
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,416
- YOU'RE SO CARELESS, YAMATO.

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,250
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO MAKE ANY
TROUBLE FOR THESE GIRLS!

132
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,250
- I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, ASAHINA.

133
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,500
NOW, APOLOGIZE
TO THE YOUNG LADY.

134
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,250
- SORRY FOR BARGING IN ON YOU.

135
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,791
I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED

136
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,541
THAT SHE'D BE LIVING RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO ME.

137
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,000
THIS IS ONE EXCELLENT DINNER
YOU COOKED UP, AUNT AYANO.

138
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,625
IF I DIDN'T FEED YOU,

139
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,541
WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND OF GRUEL
YOU'D SHOVEL DOWN YOUR THROAT.

140
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,000
I CAN FEED MYSELF.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M A DOG.

141
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,291
- THAT'S TRUE. AT LEAST A DOG
WOULD KNOW WHICH APARTMENT

142
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,375
HE'S SUPPOSED TO GO TO.

143
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,125
- I TOLD YOU,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

144
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,250
- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
INVITING ME TO DINNER.

145
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,333
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I HAD A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

146
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,458
YOU'RE WELCOME OVER
ANY TIME I'M COOKING, ASAHINA.

147
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,500
- WHY IS IT
YOU'RE SO NICE TO HER,

148
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,458
WHEN YOU TREAT ME
LIKE I'M A FOOL?

149
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,833
- BECAUSE, UNLIKE YOU,
SHE'S GOT THE HOPES

150
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,166
OF ALMOST EVERYONE AROUND HERE

151
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,583
WEIGHING DOWN ON HER.
IT'S GOTTA BE EXHAUSTING.

152
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,333
- ASAHINA'S AN AMAZING TALENT.

153
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,875
SHE'S BEGINNING HER FRESHMAN
YEAR AT AOBA HIGH SCHOOL

154
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,291
JUST LIKE YOU. SHE
GOT SCOUTED LAST YEAR

155
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,416
AND OFFERED A SPOT ON
THE TRACK AND FIELD TEAM.

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,000
WHILE YOU MADE IT IN
AFTER SITTING ON A WAITING LIST.

157
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,583
- SHE WAS SCOUTED?
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

158
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,708
SO THAT'S WHY SHE WAS
PRACTICING ALONE

159
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,208
WHILE EVERYONE WAS ON BREAK.

160
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,250
- MY MONEY IS ON HER MAKING
THE OLYMPIC TEAM SOMETIME SOON.

161
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,000
AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES AROUND,

162
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,083
I'LL TELL EVERYONE SHE USED TO
EAT DINNER AT MY PLACE.

163
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,875
- WELL, I HOPE
I DON'T DISAPPOINT YOU.

164
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,583
- SHE'S SO COOL. ALMOST PERFECT.

165
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,750
THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD BE
THE SAME AGE AS ME.

166
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,583
- Ayano: ASAHINA, DO YOU WANT
ANOTHER BOWL?

167
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,375
- OH, NO THANK YOU. I'M FULL.

168
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,958
- FOR SOMEONE SO ACTIVE,
YOU SURE HAVE A TINY STOMACH.

169
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,250
- NOT ME!

170
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,375
- THE MOVE HASN'T SLOWED DOWN
YOUR APPETITE.

171
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,000
- I'M A GROWING BOY!

172
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,333
SO, YOU WERE SCOUTED. I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT. THAT'S AWESOME.

173
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,375
WHEN I PLAYED BASEBALL IN JUNIOR
HIGH, I COULDN'T CATCH OR HIT.

174
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,750
THE WHOLE TEAM LAUGHED AT ME AND
MADE FUN OF ME ALL THE TIME.

175
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,625
I GOT SO FED UP WITH
IT ONE DAY THAT I TOLD EVERYONE

176
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,083
I'D BUY THEM ALL SODAS
IF I COULDN'T GET A HIT.

177
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,916
AND WHAT DO YA KNOW, I GOT
MY FIRST BASE HIT THAT DAY.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,916
JUST CALL ME LUCKY, I GUESS.
- THAT'S SO LIKE YOU, YAMATO.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,291
- MMM-HMM. IT'S ALL
OR NOTHING WITH YOU.

180
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,416
- WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO
IF YOU STRUCK OUT?

181
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,125
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY THINK I
CONSIDERED FAILURE AN OPTION,

182
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,791
SO I GUESS APOLOGIZE.

183
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,833
- NOTHING GETS UNDER
MY SKIN MORE THAN

184
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,083
IRRESPONSIBLE THINKING.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THANKS AGAIN FOR THE MEAL.

186
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,208
- WHAT THE HECK IS HER PROBLEM?

187
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,416
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO ACT
SO DAMN SERIOUS.

188
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,583
- ( doorbell rings )

189
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,833
- MIHO? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

190
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,375
- SUZUKA, LISTEN. YOU'VE GOT
THIS WHOLE THING WRONG.

191
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,333
PLEASE DON'T HATE YAMATO.

192
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,208
I KNOW HE CAN BE
CLUMSY AND CARELESS

193
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,333
WITH THE THINGS HE SAYS,

194
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,083
BUT HE'S GOT SOME GOOD
QUALITIES, TOO.

195
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,416
HE'S NICE AND FUNNY,
A GOOD COOK, HE LIKES DOGS.

196
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,083
AND IN THE BATH, WHEN HE FELL
ON MEGUMI, IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

197
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,541
SAOTOME HAD BEEN TEASING YAMATO.

198
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,750
AND THAT'S WHEN I JUMPED IN
AND PUSHED HIM OUT OF THE WAY.

199
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,875
- SO THAT'S WHY YOU CAME?
- YEAH.

200
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,333
- YOU LOOK AFTER HIM WELL,
DON'T YOU?

201
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,333
- CALL IT MATERNAL
INSTINCT OR SOMETHING,

202
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,916
BUT I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
LEAVING HIM ALONE.

203
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,958
- THANKS.

204
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,208
- YOU'RE WELCOME. HEY.

205
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,541
WOW, HE'S CUTE.

206
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,083
IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND
OR A TRACK BUDDY?

207
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,041
- WELL, HE'S, UH...

208
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,416
- IT'S GOTTA BE SOMEONE
YOU ADMIRE.

209
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,958
HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE YAMATO,
DOESN'T HE?

210
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,083
- WHAT?

211
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,583
- OH, NOTHING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,000
JUST DON'T HATE YAMATO, OKAY?
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.

213
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,375
SEE YA.

214
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,250
- I DON'T THINK
THEY LOOK ALIKE AT ALL.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,833
- WHAT IS UP WITH ASAHINA?

216
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,166
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG
WITHOUT KNOWING?

217
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,916
OKAY, I DID DO SOMETHING WRONG,
BUT IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,708
I MEAN, I SAID I WAS SORRY.

219
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,291
- ( doorbell rings )

220
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,333
- ( gasps ) I... I WONDER
IF SHE'S COMING TO APOLOGIZE.

221
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,583
I DOUBT IT. THAT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE HER STYLE.

222
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,750
- BOTTOMS UP, YAMATO!

223
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,583
- I DON'T THINK THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA, SAOTOME.

224
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,625
- OH, HE DOESN'T MIND!
- WHAT THE HELL?

225
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,833
- LET'S KICK THIS PARTY
OFF RIGHT!

226
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,291
- Yamato: ARE YOU DRUNK?
- NO!

227
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,500
- 'CAUSE YOU SMELL
LIKE YOU'VE FERMENTED.

228
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,375
- OUCH! WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING, BUDDY! THAT HURT!

229
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,458
- Megumi: SAOTOME, YOU'RE
TALKING TO THE WALL.

230
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,708
COME ON NOW. OKAY?

231
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,000
- SO, YAMUTO, YOU GOT
ANY BOOZE AROUND HERE?

232
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,500
- Megumi:
JUST STOP AND TURN AROUND

233
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,875
AND SIT DOWN BEFORE
YOU FALL DOWN.

234
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,125
- PICK-ME-UP-AND-KNOCK-ME-DOWN,
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.

235
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,416
- OKAY? COME ON.

236
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,083
- NOW DRINK UP, YOU!
- UH, I'M NOT THIRSTY.

237
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,416
- I'M SORRY. I'LL TAKE
HER BACK TO HER ROOM

238
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,958
AS SOON AS SHE CAN
STAND ON HER OWN.

239
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,375
- HOW ABOUT NOW?

240
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,750
- OH, MEG! YOU SPOILSPORT!

241
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,875
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE ANY BOYFRIENDS.

242
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,083
- HEY! STOP IT!

243
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,166
DO YOU MIND NOT AIRING
MY DIRTY LAUNDRY?

244
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,208
- YOU REALLY NEED
A DRINK, SISTER.

245
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,166
- ( Megumi coughs )

246
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,916
- PLEASE DON'T THROW UP.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,875
- THIS BOTTLE IS ALMOST EMPTY.

248
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,458
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING MY STUFF?

249
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,041
- THIS GIRL'S CERTIFIABLE.

250
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,625
- Girl 1: SHOW THAT HIGH SCHOOL
TRACK TEAM WHAT YOU CAN DO!

251
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,583
- Girl 2: WE WISH YOU
ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WORLD!

252
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,791
- Teacher 1: THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

253
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,458
YOU CLEARED 169 CENTIMETERS
ON THAT JUMP!

254
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,541
YOU NOW HOLD THE RECORD FOR
THE HIGHEST JUMP IN KANAGAWA!

255
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,000
- Teacher 2:
YOU THINK WE'RE EXCITED,

256
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,750
YOU SHOULD TALK TO
THE PRINCIPAL!

257
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,083
- Teacher 3: YOU ARE THE PRIDE
OF OUR SCHOOL NOW.

258
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,916
- 169 CENTIMETERS.

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,958
I'VE GOTTEN MORE ATTENTION
SINCE THAT JUMP

260
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,125
THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH.

261
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,125
TO BE HONEST,
IT JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS.

262
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,000
EVERYONE EXPECTS
ME TO DO IT AGAIN,

263
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,750
BUT THIS TIME, JUMP EVEN HIGHER.

264
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,000
EACH TIME, THEY WANT
A LITTLE MORE FROM ME.

265
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,291
- ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME ANYMORE?

266
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,750
- OF COURSE.
EVERY WORD IS SACRED.

267
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,625
- ALL GUYS ARE JUST LIKE YOU.
YOU SMILE AND YOU TALK TO ME

268
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,666
BUT YOU'RE REALLY ONLY GAWKING
AT MY BOOBS.

269
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,916
MY NAME IS MEGUMI MATSUMOTO,
NOT TITS MCGEE, GOT IT!

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,791
- THERE'S NOTHING I LOVE
MORE THAN A DRUNKEN LECTURE.

271
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,000
- PAY ATTENTION!
- I AM!

272
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,833
- I HIT IT, DIDN'T I? YOUR
GAZE IS TRANSFIXED

273
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,375
ON MY BOOBS RIGHT NOW.

274
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,541
- NO , I'M JUST LISTENING.

275
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,750
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A PICTURE?
IT'LL LAST LONGER!

276
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,666
- I DON'T WANNA SEE THOSE!
- YOU'RE JUST A PERVERT!

277
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,250
- I'M STILL TOO HEAVY.

278
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,750
- (Megumi and Saotome snoring )

279
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,166
- FINALLY, THEY
ACTUALLY PASSED OUT.

280
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,666
BUT WHAT DO I DO WITH THEM NOW?

281
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,375
CRAP! IT'S MIDNIGHT.
I GOTTA CLEAN THE BATH.

282
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,916
I BET ASAHINA HEARD EVERY WORD
THAT CAME OUTTA MY ROOM TONIGHT.

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,875
IF SHE DIDN'T HATE ME ALREADY,
I BET SHE DOES NOW.

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,666
COME ON. YOU MEAN
I LEFT THE LIGHTS ON, TOO?

285
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,750
AUNT AYANO'S GONNA BE REALLY
MAD! I AM SO DEAD.

286
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,916
ASAHINA! COME ON,
WAKE UP, ASAHINA!

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,250
OPEN THE DOOR!

288
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,291
OH, GREAT. IT'S STUCK.

289
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,333
ASAHINA! ASAHINA! WAKE UP!

290
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,041
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU IN THERE.
YOU... YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP!

291
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,291
COME ON!

292
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,250
THIS'LL PROBABLY
COME OUT OF MY CHECK.

293
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,375
PLEASE, ASAHINA, WAKE UP!

294
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,916
ASAHINA!

295
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,458
- Ayano: DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

296
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,083
SHE'S JUST DEHYDRATED
AT THIS POINT.

297
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,500
BUT SHE DRANK SOME WATER

298
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,166
AND HER TEMPERATURE HAS
GONE DOWN TO NORMAL.

299
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,375
- OH, GOOD.

300
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,750
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,

301
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,791
RUNNING UP TO ME AND
SCREAMING, "ASAHINA IS DEAD!"

302
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,833
WAS PROBABLY NOT THE
MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

303
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,333
TO APPROACH THE SITUATION.

304
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,916
- SHE DIDN'T RESPOND TO ME
AT ALL AND WHO KNOWS HOW LONG

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,250
SHE WAS TRAPPED
IN THERE. I PANICKED.

306
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,708
- AND NOW I'M PANICKING,
THANKS TO THE SAUNA DOOR

307
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,250
BEING BUSTED OFF ITS HINGES.

308
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,041
- I'M SORRY. I PUSHED AS HARD AS
I COULD BUT IT WOULDN'T BUDGE.

309
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,875
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PULL IT
FROM THE OUTSIDE TO OPEN IT.

310
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,416
- ( laughs ) I MUST HAVE
BEEN TOO FOCUSED

311
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,875
ON GETTING ASAHINA OUT OF THERE.

312
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,750
- I LOVE YOUR DESIRE TO HELP.

313
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,750
IT'S ONE OF YOUR MOST
ENDEARING QUALITIES.

314
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,958
HOW ABOUT I GO
CLEAN THE BATH FOR YOU.

315
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,750
YOU JUST MAKE SURE SHE GETS
SOME WATER IF SHE NEEDS IT.

316
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,875
- OKAY.

317
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,000
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS, ASAHINA.

318
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,958
IF I HAD CLEANED THE BATH
AN HOUR EARLIER YOU'D BE FINE.

319
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,083
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

320
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,875
- I... I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE AWAKE!

321
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,375
- WELL, YOU TALK LOUDER
THAN A TRAIN.

322
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,250
AND WHY DID YOU
KICK IN THE DOOR?

323
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,083
ARE YOU CRAZY OR SOMETHING?

324
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,833
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S CRAZY!

325
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,250
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO
BREAK DOWN THE DOOR

326
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,500
IF YOU HADN'T FALLEN ASLEEP
IN THE SAUNA.

327
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,541
THE INSTRUCTIONS
OUTSIDE THE DOOR SAY

328
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,791
"MAXIMUM TWELVE MINUTES".

329
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,541
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY READING
THEM SOMETIME

330
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,583
INSTEAD OF POINTING FINGERS
AT PEOPLE WHO SAVE YOU!

331
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,166
- YEAH, I READ THEM.

332
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,666
- THEN DO WHAT THEY SAY!

333
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,875
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
COULD'VE HAPPENED TO YOU...

334
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,541
- I'M THE ONE WHO ALMOST DIED,
SO BACK OFF ALREADY!

335
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,208
I KEPT THINKING TO MYSELF
THAT I COULD JUMP HIGHER

336
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,166
IF I COULD JUST LOSE
A FEW EXTRA POUNDS.

337
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,833
YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY?

338
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,458
"GOTTA BEAT YOUR RECORD!"

339
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,625
WELL, 169 CENTIMETERS
ISN'T EASY, NOT FOR ANY ATHLETE.

340
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,583
BUT THEY STILL EXPECT ME
TO JUMP HIGHER.

341
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,750
AND NOW EVERY TIME I
WALK OUT ONTO THAT TRACK,

342
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,625
THE BAR LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN RAISED.

343
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,333
BUT IT'S ALWAYS SET AT EXACTLY
THE SAME HEIGHT.

344
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
169.

345
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,875
I JUST DON'T WANT TO FAIL.
- I HAD NO IDEA.

346
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,958
WELL, LISTEN. I'M DEFINITELY
NOT A TRACK EXPERT

347
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,375
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE
ANY HIGH JUMP EXPERIENCE

348
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:46,958
TO DRAW FROM HERE,
BUT... I DO HAVE A FEELING

349
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,000
THAT IF YOU DID IT ONCE,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN.

350
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,208
- THAT MAKES
NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.

351
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,291
- YOU CONCERN YOURSELF
WAY TOO MUCH WITH WHAT

352
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,250
OTHER PEOPLE THINK
AND SAY, ASAHINA.

353
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,166
YOU KEEP DOING THE HIGH JUMP
BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO YOU, RIGHT?

354
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,458
AND YOU LOVE IT?

355
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,666
- OF COURSE. MORE THAN ANYTHING.

356
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,458
- THEN THE ONLY REASON
YOU SHOULD DO IT

357
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,000
IS BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH.

358
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,500
IF YOU DON'T, YOU'LL END UP
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

359
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,708
- I'M NOT GONNA LOOK LIKE THAT!

360
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,541
- WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE
FEELING BETTER.

361
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,458
SO IT LOOKS LIKE MY JOB HERE
IS FINISHED.

362
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,291
- HEY, WAIT!

363
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,041
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE
WHAT I SAID.

364
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,541
THE LAST THING I NEED IS
PEOPLE KNOWING WHAT SCARES ME.

365
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,583
- I DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE
SOME JUICY TIDBITS

366
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,291
YOU'VE JUST SPILLED.

367
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,541
- YAMATO!

368
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,458
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T TELL A SOUL
WHAT YOU KNOW.

369
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,666
- I PROMISE.

370
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,250
- THANKS. NOW WOULD YOU GET ME
A GLASS OF WATER?

371
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,541
- YEAH, SURE.
- AND ANOTHER TOWEL?

372
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,041
- DON'T PUSH IT.

373
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,916
I THOUGHT SHE WAS ONE
OF THOSE COOL KIDS

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,375
WHO HAS IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

375
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,250
BUT I WAS WAY OFF.

376
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,875
SHE'S GOT HER OWN STACK OF
PROBLEMS LIKE ANYONE ELSE.

377
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,208
I THINK I UNDERSTAND HER
A LITTLE MORE NOW.

378
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:51,375
( yawns ) TELL ME AGAIN
WHAT I'M DOING OUT HERE.

379
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,250
THIS IS YOUR MORNING PRACTICE,
NOT MINE.

380
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,291
- LISTEN, YOU SAID THAT
I COULD JUMP THIS AGAIN,

381
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,500
SO I'M GOING FOR IT.

382
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,791
NOW, ARE YOU GOING TO
BE MAN OF YOUR WORD

383
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,708
AND SHOW ME SOME ENCOURAGEMENT,
OR JUST COMPLAIN?

384
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,333
- I NEVER AGREED TO ANYTHING
THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING.

385
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,166
- GREAT, NOW YOU'RE BREAKING
MORE STUFF!

386
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,750
- SORRY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SET YOUR HEIGHT AT?

387
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,708
- SET THE BAR AT 164 CENTIMETERS
TO START.

388
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,625
- OUI, MADAME.
- AND NOW IT'S CROOKED!

389
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,375
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T SCREW UP

390
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,583
THE SECOND YOU TOUCH IT?!

391
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,833
- WHY I PUT UP WITH THIS,
I DON'T KNOW.

392
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,083
- DONE. YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET OVER?

393
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,000
IT LOOKS HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT.

394
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,625
GOOD LUCK.

395
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,333
- I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M MADE OF!

396
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,625
FOCUS ON IT. YOU'VE CLEARED
THE TOP OF THIS BEFORE.

397
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,666
NOW JUMP!

398
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,458
- AMAZING.

399
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,000
YOU TOUCHED THE BAR,
BUT IT WAS REALLY CLOSE.

400
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,958
WANNA TRY IT AGAIN?

401
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,583
- BUT I...

402
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,291
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
AT THIS HEIGHT.

403
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,791
- AH, EVERYBODY HAS
AN OFF DAY NOW AND THEN.

404
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,458
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

405
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,166
- YEAH, WELL, NOT ME.
I DON'T HAVE OFF DAYS.

406
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,750
- GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

407
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,041
IT COULD BE THAT YOUR BODY'S
STILL WORN OUT FROM YESTERDAY.

408
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,250
- CUT IT OUT, YAMATO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LIE TO ME ABOUT THIS.

409
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:26,166
I SUCK. I CAN'T EVEN CLEAR
A 164 MUCH LESS A 169.

410
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,125
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

411
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,916
HOLD ON! WHEN YOU SET THE BAR,
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

412
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500
- EXACTLY LIKE YOU SAID.
I PUT IT AT 164.

413
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,750
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SET
THE TOP OF THE BAR TO THE MARK,

414
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,625
NOT THE BOTTOM, YOU IDIOT!

415
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,166
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
I'M NOT IN TRACK AND FIELD!

416
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,416
YOU KNOW THAT!

417
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,666
- YOU'RE SO IRRESPONSIBLE
SOMETIMES, YAMATO

418
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,791
YOU SHOULD BE LOCKED UP!

419
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,416
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

420
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,291
I SET A NEW HIGH JUMP RECORD
AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

421
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,291
- 173 CENTIMETERS.

422
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:21,416
THAT UNOFFICIALLY TIES ASAHINA
FOR 12TH PLACE IN THE NATION

423
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,250
AMONG JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

424
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,125
I GOT TO SEE A SIDE OF HER
I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE,

425
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:32,083
TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM
HER USUAL COOL SELF.

426
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,458
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN A
PRETTIER FACE IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

427
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,416
