I STILL LIKE YOU, ASAHINA!

00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,541
LOOK, I KNOW.

27
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,416
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO ANSWER ME NOW.

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,875
I'M GOING TO PRACTICE HARDER.

29
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,375
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

30
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,958
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ME NOW,

31
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,875
WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK
FROM NATIONALS.

32
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,666
- JUST WAIT UNTIL I WIN
THE NEXT MEET, ASAHINA.

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,583
THEN YOU CAN GIVE ME
YOUR ANSWER.

34
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,333
- WITH THE GOLD MEDAL,
OF COURSE.

35
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,583
- JUST STOP IT!

36
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,250
- ASAHINA, WAIT!
COME BACK HERE, PLEASE!

37
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,250
- Hashiba: ( on phone ) SUZUKA?

38
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,166
NO, SHE DIDN'T COME HERE.
WHY? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

39
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,166
- IT'S BEEN OVER TWO HOURS
SINCE SHE'S BEEN GONE.

40
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,875
THE REASON'S NOT IMPORTANT.

41
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,041
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF SHE WENT OVER TO YOUR PLACE

42
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,875
TO TALK OR SOMETHING.

43
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,958
- OH, SO YOU GUYS
GOT IN A FIGHT.

44
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,666
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,166
YOU CAN'T DISAPPEAR JUST BECAUSE
I CONFESSED MY FEELINGS TO YOU!

46
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,916
- Megumi: SUZUKA AND YAMATO
AREN'T IN THEIR ROOMS? REALLY?

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THAT'S WEIRD.
- I KNOW. IT IS.

48
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,958
MY SISTER JUST SENT ME
SOME PEARS.

49
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,250
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT WANNA
COME DOWN AND SHARE THEM.

50
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,333
OH, WELL, I WONDER
WHERE THEY COULD'VE GONE.

51
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,458
IT'S GETTING LATE.
- ( door opens )

52
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,916
- WELL, I HEARD SUZUKA
RUN OUT OF YAMATO'S ROOM

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,250
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
SHE LOOKED PRETTY UPSET.

54
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,083
I GUESS THAT MEANS
THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAIN, HUH?

55
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,583
IF THAT'S TRUE, YAMATO'S
PROBABLY OUT LOOKING FOR SUZUKA!

56
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,916
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,375
YAMATO DID LOOK
A LITTLE DOWN EARLIER.

58
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,083
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO HIM?

59
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,541
- I BET HE THREW HIMSELF AT HER
LIKE A TYPICAL BOY

60
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,958
AND GOT REJECTED.

61
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,791
- WHATEVER! YAMATO WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

62
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,666
MOM, WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?

63
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,916
- JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,708
THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK
WHEN THEY'RE READY.

65
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,541
- YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT. STUFF LIKE
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

66
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,208
- ALL RIGHT. WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I HOPE YOU GIRLS ARE HUNGRY.

67
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,166
- I WONDER IF AKITSUKI'S FEELING
ALL RIGHT TONIGHT.

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,583
NO, HE HAS FEELINGS FOR ASAHINA.

69
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,750
- ASAHINA, WHERE ARE YOU?

70
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,708
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER ME NOW.

71
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,125
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
WAIT TO TELL ME

72
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,666
WHEN I GET BACK FROM NATIONALS?

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,083
OF COURSE, AFTER I'VE
WON THE GOLD MEDAL.

74
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,833
- Suzune: TSUDA? REALLY?

75
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,666
- YEAH. IT'S SO COOL. HE'S GOING
TO THE NATIONALS TOMORROW!

76
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,875
- AND?

77
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,708
- "AND"? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "AND"?

78
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,875
THAT'S AN AMAZING
ACCOMPLISHMENT, SIS!

79
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,250
- WELL, SURE IT IS.

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,000
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS
HIS FIRST TIME GOING.

81
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,791
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

82
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,708
- WELL, UM, IT'S 'CAUSE...

83
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,166
HE'S FAST AND HAS A REALLY
IMPRESSIVE TIME.

84
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,250
AND HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
WIN, SO THAT'S COOL.

85
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,166
- I KNEW I RECOGNIZED THAT LOOK.
YOU LIKE TSUDA, DON'T YOU?

86
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,541
- NO! WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
- I'M JUST KIDDING.

87
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,833
I KNOW YOU WOULD NEVER
GO FOR SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

88
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,916
HE'S SO IMMATURE AND NOT
THE SLIGHTEST BIT ATTRACTIVE!

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,625
- YEAH, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN HE'S RUNNING.

90
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,333
HE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL.

91
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,375
- BUSTED!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

92
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,333
- SUZUKA, JUST ADMIT
THAT YOU LIKE HIM.

93
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,291
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
AT FAKING IT.

94
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,833
HEY, MOM! GUESS WHAT? SUZUKA
JUST SAID THAT SHE LIKED TSUDA!

95
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,666
- NO, I DIDN'T!
IDIOT! I HATE YOU!

96
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,458
- SUZUKA! WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING
OFF TO? IT'S ALMOST DINNER TIME!

97
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,583
- I'M NOT HUNGRY!

98
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,333
I HAVE THE WORST SISTER
IN THE WORLD!

99
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,833
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I'VE
HAD A CRUSH ON YOU SINCE WE MET.

100
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,041
- Suzuka: AFTER HE WINS
THE NATIONALS, HUH?

101
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,041
I GUESS IT'S ABOUT
TIME TO START.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,458
I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT.

103
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,916
I GUESS I CAN JUST
TEASE HIM ABOUT

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,083
HOW NERVOUS AND NERDY
HE SOUNDED THE OTHER DAY.

105
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,125
NEVER MIND, FORGET IT.

106
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,750
- ( phone rings )

107
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,750
- GREAT! I WONDER
WHO THAT COULD BE.

108
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,083
I HOPE IT'S NOT HIM.

109
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,708
HELLO, ASAHINA RESIDENCE.

110
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,750
- HI. THIS IS MIYAMOTO.
MAY I PLEASE SPEAK TO SUZUKA?

111
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,458
- HI, SEMPAI, IT'S ME.
UM, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

112
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,083
- OH, UH, I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

113
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,000
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
YOU HARDLY EVER CALL MY HOUSE.

114
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,458
OH! HOW'S TSUDA SEMPAI
DOING? DID HE WIN?

115
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,791
ARE YOU THERE?

116
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,958
- IT'S ABOUT KAZUKI. HE WAS
KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

117
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,875
THEY WERE GOING
THROUGH AN INTERSECTION

118
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,125
AND A TRUCK HIT THE BUS.

119
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,750
HE'S SUCH AN IDIOT.
HE OVERSLEPT.

120
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,500
IF HE'D JUST MADE IT
TO THE BUS ON TIME,

121
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,666
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO WAIT FOR HIM.

122
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,791
AND THAT TRUCK WOULD
NEVER HAVE HIT HIM.

123
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,291
WHY WASN'T HE FAST ENOUGH?

124
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,458
- ( people sobbing )

125
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,166
- SEMPAI...

126
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,583
WHY?

127
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,416
WHEN I LOOK AT HIS PICTURE,
IT ISN'T PAINFUL FOR ME.

128
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,916
I DON'T FEEL SAD.

129
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,500
EVERYONE IS CRYING AND
COMFORTING EACH OTHER.

130
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,416
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
BE CRYING, TOO.

131
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,791
BUT I DON'T' FEEL ANYTHING.
I HAVEN'T SHED ONE TEAR.

132
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,250
I MUST JUST BE
A VERY HEARTLESS PERSON.

133
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,291
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO, MIYAMOTO?

134
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,375
- SEMPAI,

135
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,416
I'M GONNA GRAB TSUDA SEMPAI'S
THINGS FROM THE CLUB ROOM.

136
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,458
- GOOD IDEA.

137
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,333
- THANKS. THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU TO DO THAT.

138
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,416
- SURE.

139
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,291
- DIDN'T ANYONE EVER
TEACH YOU HOW 

140
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,208
TO KNOCK BEFORE YOU BARGE IN?

141
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,708
- HEY! YOU CAN'T JUST SCRIBBLE
ON THE TABLE LIKE THAT!

142
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,708
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT. IT'S NOT
A SCRIBBLE, IT'S A GOAL!

143
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,791
- YOU'RE GONNA BE IN SO MUCH
TROUBLE WHEN I TELL THE TEACHER!

144
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,375
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU!

145
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,875
I'M WRITING YOUR NAME
ON HERE, TOO.

146
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,791
SO THAT MAKES YOU MY ACCOMPLICE!

147
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,208
- YOU BETTER NOT!
THAT'S A PERMANENT MARKER!

148
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,041
( laughs )

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,833
SEMPAI...

150
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,125
LISTEN, I...

151
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,125
I, UM... I HAVE MY ANSWER.

152
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,333
BUT NOW YOU'RE GONE.
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN

153
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,416
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS!

154
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,041
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
ANSWER YOU NOW!

155
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,166
WHY DO YOU EXPECT
SO MUCH FROM ME SEMPAI?

156
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,916
AND WHY...
WHY DID YOU TELL ME THAT?

157
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,291
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'M JUST
GOING TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

158
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,041
- Honoka's mother: OKAY,
WILL YOU LOCK THE GATE

159
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,875
TO THE SHRINE ON YOUR WAY OUT?

160
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,000
- ALL RIGHT!

161
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,750
HI, ASAHINA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

162
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,708
- THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT THAT
YOU LIVED HERE, HONOKA.

163
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,708
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD GO.

164
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,125
- NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO. REALLY.

165
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,625
BUT, UM, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

166
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,500
- NO, I'M FINE.

167
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,500
- YOU SURE? IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN CRYING.

168
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,875
- NO, IT'S...
SOMETHING WAS IN MY EYE.

169
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,208
- OH, OKAY.

170
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,500
WELL, UM...

171
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,000
THE KANTO CHAMPIONSHIP
IS COMING UP!

172
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,583
- MMM-HMM.
- YOU MUST BE EXCITED.

173
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,250
I HEARD YOU'RE THE ONLY FRESHMAN
GIRL WHO QUALIFIED THIS YEAR.

174
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,791
THAT'S AMAZING!

175
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,625
I REALLY THOUGHT
AKITSUKI WOULD QUALIFY, TOO,

176
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,500
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
HE LOST THE PRELIMINARY.

177
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,208
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN KIND OF
WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

178
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,958
HE SEEMS REALLY
DEPRESSED LATELY.

179
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,833
- SORRY. I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

180
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,083
- WAIT!

181
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,208
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH YOU AND AKITSUKI?

182
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,125
- NO! YAMATO HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS!

183
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,708
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?
- WELL, UH...

184
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,208
IT'S BECAUSE I THINK THAT
YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM.

185
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,708
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I DON'T LIKE HIM LIKE THAT.

186
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,833
YAMATO IS JUST A FRIEND.
NOTHING MORE.

187
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,666
- YOU'RE LYING.

188
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,666
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
ACT LIKE THAT?

189
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,625
- I TOLD YOU.

190
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,583
- YOU ALWAYS AVOID ANSWERING
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

191
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,375
OR JUST LIE ABOUT
THEM COMPLETELY.

192
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,208
I'M SICK OF IT, ASAHINA!

193
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,750
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR
ATTITUDE IS CAUSING NOTHING

194
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,791
BUT HEARTACHE FOR
EVERYONE AROUND YOU?

195
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,875
- AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

196
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,416
THE WAY THAT I ACT IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, HONOKA!

197
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
- YES, IT IS!
YOU'RE HURTING YOUR FRIENDS!

198
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,458
YOU'VE HURT BOTH ME
AND AKITSUKI.

199
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,125
YOU WON'T BE HONEST
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS

200
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,458
AND IT'S MAKING
EVERYTHING COMPLICATED!

201
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,708
I KEEP HOLDING ON BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

202
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,083
I'M CONSTANTLY MAKING A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF BECAUSE OF YOU!

203
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,500
- BUT YOU...
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL!

204
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,083
- THERE'S AN AMAZING GUY
WHO WANTS TO BE WITH YOU!

205
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,375
WHY IS THAT SO HARD
FOR YOU TO ACCEPT?

206
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,500
- WELL, I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE...

207
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,083
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO HAVE SOMEONE YOU LOVE DIE!

208
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,458
- YOU'RE RIGHT, ASAHINA,
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

209
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,916
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE MY HEART BROKEN.

210
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,958
YOU SHOULD GO TO HIM.

211
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,416
HE'S BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME.

212
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,000
HE'S A GREAT GUY AND
HE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

213
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,416
OKAY?

214
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,625
HEY, WAIT!

215
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,916
SO DO YOU.

216
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,250
- ( footsteps approaching )

217
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,458
- HI , AKITSUKI.

218
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,083
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHY WERE YOU RUNNING?

219
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,916
- WELL, I, UH...

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,625
ASAHINA DISAPPEARED
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

221
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,916
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND HER.

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,666
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE SHE COULD BE RIGHT NOW.

223
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,375
- ACTUALLY, SHE WAS JUST HERE
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

224
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,833
- SHE WAS?

225
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,500
- UM, YEAH. ARE YOU FEELING
ANY BETTER, AKITSUKI?

226
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,625
I MEAN, YOU SEEMED
REALLY DEPRESSED...

227
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,500
- WHICH WAY DID SHE GO?
TELL ME, PLEASE!

228
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,958
- HIS HEART BELONGS TO ASAHINA.
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ME.

229
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,041
SHE RAN TOWARD THE PARK.
YOU BETTER HURRY. SHE'S FAST.

230
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,250
- THANKS , HONOKA.

231
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,666
- YOU SHOULD GO TO HIM.
HE'S BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME.

232
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,250
HE'S A GREAT GUY AND
HE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

233
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,541
- I CAN'T DO IT.
I'D RATHER BE ALONE

234
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,458
THAN HAVE TO GO THROUGH
A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE

235
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,041
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

236
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,500
I'D RATHER BE ALONE.

237
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,791
- ( inaudible )

238
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,583
- DON'T LEAVE YET.
I STILL LIKE YOU, ASAHINA!

239
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,958
- I'M SORRY, YAMATO.
I'LL APOLOGIZE TOMORROW

240
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,125
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

241
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,750
WE'LL BE FRIENDS AGAIN,
JUST LIKE WE WERE.

242
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,708
- THERE YOU ARE! FINALLY!

243
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,000
- YAMATO... HI.

244
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,541
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

245
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

246
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,375
WELL, IT'S COLD AND RAINING.

247
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,166
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK HOME.

248
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,458
- ( Suzuka sobs )
- HEY, WAIT! COME BACK HERE!

249
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,625
- DON'T FOLLOW ME!

250
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,333
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND, ASAHINA!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

251
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,541
- IT DOESN'T MATTER!
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

252
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,958
- I CAN'T DO THAT!

253
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,666
- ARE YOU OKAY?

254
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,250
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE RUNNING
IN THOSE SHOES, YOU KNOW.

255
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,500
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
CAN'T YOU GET UP?

256
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,666
WELL, HERE...

257
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,750
- NO! GO AWAY!

258
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,458
WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED
WITH WHAT I DO

259
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,916
AND WHERE I'M GOING, HUH?

260
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,708
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, YAMATO! BACK OFF!

261
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,833
I'M TIRED OF YOU CHASING ME
EVERYWHERE! ARE YOU CRAZY?

262
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:11,541
I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU. I HATE
YOU! I HATE YOU SO MUCH!

263
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,000
I NEVER ASKED YOU TO COME
LOOKING FOR ME, YOU WEIRDO!

264
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,708
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING!

265
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,375
- I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

266
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,375
- JUST STOP IT. IF YOU CONTINUE
TO BE SO NICE TO ME, THEN...

267
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,500
THEN I... I'LL FALL FOR YOU.

268
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,708
- OKAY.

269
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,708
- I DON'T WANT THAT AGAIN!
- HUH? WANT WHAT?

270
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,458
- I DON'T WANNA HURT.

271
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,625
I DON'T WANNA FEEL PAIN
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

272
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,583
- OH, IT'S TSUDA. RIGHT?

273
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,750
- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T GO OUT
WITH ANYONE ELSE EVER AGAIN.

274
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,625
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS IS
NOT THE SAME SITUATION!

275
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,625
YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE
SOMEONE'S WRONG FOR YOU

276
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,750
WITHOUT EVEN GIVING THEM
A CHANCE FIRST!

277
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IT WOULD TURN OUT!

278
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,791
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YAMATO.

279
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,416
YOU THINK IT'S SO EASY BECAUSE
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE!

280
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,833
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!

281
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,666
- DON'T TOUCH ME!
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

282
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,125
- YOU'RE WRONG!

283
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,875
- ( horn honking )

284
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,041
- PLEASE, JUST LISTEN.

285
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,333
I WOULD NEVER EXPECT THIS
TO BE EASY FOR YOU.

286
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,916
- WAIT...

287
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,333
- ( slaps resounding )

288
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,291
- YOU JERK!

289
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,250
- I'M SO SORRY.

290
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,458
- THIS IS SO GOOD!
- YEAH, IT IS!

291
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,833
- YEAH, SO DON'T EAT IT ALL,
YOU GUYS!

292
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,541
SAVE SOME FOR YAMATO
AND SUZUKA.

293
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,708
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE HUNGRY
WHEN THEY GET HOME.

294
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,750
- MIHO, IT'S OKAY. THERE SHOULD
BE PLENTY FOR EVERYONE.

295
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,541
- I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF
THOSE TWO ARE EVER COMING BACK.

296
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,458
- OH, PLEASE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THEM. THEY'RE NOT BABIES.

297
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,125
- I BET THEY MADE UP AND ARE
JUST OUT HAVING A GOOD TIME.

298
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,458
FRIENDSHIPS ARE ALWAYS STRONGER
AFTER A FIGHT.

299
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,666
- THAT'S RIGHT. THEY SAY
"THE GROUND GETS HARDER

300
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,708
"AFTER THE RAIN FALLS." RIGHT?
YOU TELL 'EM, GORO!

301
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,958
- THAT'S OKAY, THEN.

302
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:39,125
- SO THAT'S IT. IT'S OVER AND
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

303
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,458
