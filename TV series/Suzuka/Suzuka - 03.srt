- WELL, AUNT AYANO, I GUESS
IT'S TIME I LEFT FOR SCHOOL.

25
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,250
- DON'T FORGET TO BUTTON UP
YOUR UNIFORM BEFORE YOU GO!

26
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,708
- I WON'T.

27
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,791
( panting )

28
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,791
MY FIRST DAY OF HIGH
SCHOOL'S ALREADY HERE.

29
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,166
- IF YOU DON'T MOVE YOUR TAIL,
WE'LL ALL BE LATE.

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,083
WHICH WOULD BE A FANTASTIC WAY
TO START OFF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

32
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,333
- HEY, ASAHINA, WAIT FOR ME!

33
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,958
I THOUGHT THIS DAY
WOULD NEVER COME.

34
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,791
THE FIRST DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL
ALWAYS FEELS

35
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,208
LIKE A NEW BEGINNING.

36
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,625
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT
THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE

37
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,708
FOR THE BETTER THIS YEAR.

38
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,791
- SO I GUESS YOU'RE IN CLASS C
TOO, YAMATO?

39
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,416
- HEY, SO AM I!
WHAT A COINCIDENCE!

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,416
- YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING, ASAHINA.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
- NOT REALLY.

42
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,791
- "NOT REALLY"?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

43
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,291
GEEZ, ASAHINA.

44
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,375
I FEEL LIKE I NEED A TRANSLATOR
TO TALK TO YOU SOMETIMES.

45
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,583
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SPEAKING
A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE.

46
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,583
- HE MUST BE YAMATO AKITSUKI.

47
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,250
- SHOPPING?

48
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,458
- YEAH. AFTER PRACTICE.

49
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,375
SO, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD COME WITH ME?

50
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,291
- BUT WHY DO YOU NEED ME?

51
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,166
- I HAVE TO PICK UP
A BUNCH OF SPORTS DRINKS

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,375
FOR THE TEAM TOMORROW.

53
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,166
I CAN'T CARRY THEM ALL
MYSELF AND MY FRIEND

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,041
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO
HELP IS ABSENT TODAY.

55
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,666
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,833
- NAH, I'LL GO. I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.

57
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,916
- IT'S SETTLED THEN.
WE CAN LEAVE

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,333
AFTER I GET DONE WITH
PRACTICE THIS AFTERNOON.

59
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,958
- OKAY, THEN. I'LL MEET
YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

60
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,208
I JUST HOPE THIS LITTLE SHOPPING
TRIP DOESN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

61
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,083
- HEY, ASAHINA!

62
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,958
- THIS IS GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN!
WE'RE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO YOU!

63
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,125
- SEE YOU LATER, I GUESS.

64
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,875
- YEAH, LATER.

65
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,291
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TIME
PRACTICE STARTS THIS AFTERNOON?

66
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,708
- OH, IT'S AT 1:00.

67
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,500
- DID THEY SAY IF WE NEEDED
TO BRING ANYTHING?

68
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,583
- I DON'T THINK SO.

69
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,000
- SO, DO YOU HAVE
ANY WEEKEND PLANS?

70
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,625
- SHE'S ALREADY MADE NEW FRIENDS
FROM TRACK AND FIELD.

71
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,000
I WONDER WHY SHE ASKED ME
TO GO WITH HER. WELL, WHATEVER.

72
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,958
- NO WAY.

73
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,541
- I SWEAR, DUDE.
MY UNCLE SAID HE SHOT IT

74
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,375
AND IT JUST KEPT COMING
AFTER HIM, LIKE A ZOMBIE.

75
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,916
- SO, AFTER THAT, I WAS LIKE,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,875
"WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT!"

77
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,958
AND THEN HE TOOK ME SHOPPING.

78
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,250
- I REALLY FEEL LIKE
I DON'T BELONG.

79
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,666
EVERYONE ELSE
IS MAKING FRIENDS ALREADY.

80
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,458
- BUT I'VE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE.

81
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,750
- TRUST ME, IT'LL BE FUN.

82
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,083
- ALL RIGHT.

83
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,458
- NO, REALLY.

84
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,000
THAT'S WHY THEY TALK ABOUT
BREAKING UP ALL THE TIME.

85
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,958
- WOW. THAT MAKES SENSE.

86
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,416
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

87
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,166
I DON'T THINK I'D BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY.

88
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,916
- WHERE'S ASAHINA? EVEN YASUNOBU
HAS HIS OWN GROUP OF FRIENDS.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,583
I DON'T FIT IN ANYWHERE.
LOOKS LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED.

90
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,583
I'M DESTINED TO BE A LONER.

91
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,458
- EXCUSE ME. AKITSUKI?

92
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,916
- HUH?

93
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,958
- UM, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT I SHOULD COME SAY HELLO.

94
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,750
- OH, WELL, HELLO.

95
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,583
- YOU... YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU?

96
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,458
IT'S OKAY,
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO.

97
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,958
OH... I'M SORRY, I NEVER
INTRODUCED MYSELF, DID I?

98
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,625
I'M HONOKA. HONOKA SAKURAI.

99
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,833
- HMM.

100
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,208
HONOKA?

101
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,125
- ( indistinct conversation )

102
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,041
- I DON'T THINK I TOLD YAMATO
WHERE TO MEET ME.

103
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,916
WHO IS HE TALKING TO?

104
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,458
- OH. HER NAME'S HONOKA SAKURAI.

105
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,541
- SO YOU KNOW HER? WHO IS SHE?

106
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,125
- SHE WENT TO THE SAME
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

107
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,125
THAT I DID. CUTE, HUH?

108
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,500
BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS THE SHY ONE,

109
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,375
SO IT'S WEIRD TO SEE
HER TALKING TO A GUY.

110
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,458
SHE MUST REALLY WANT
YAMATO. LOOK AT HER.

111
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,916
SHE'S HITTING ON HIM!

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,750
- YEAH, BUT HOW DO THEY
KNOW EACH OTHER?

113
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,958
- I HAVE NO IDEA. I'M
JUST GLAD HE'S NOT BEING

114
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,500
AN ANTISOCIAL FREAK.

115
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,541
I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT
HIM FOR A WHILE THERE.

116
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,958
BUT SAKURAI'S A NICE GIRL.

117
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,791
HOPEFULLY, SHE CAN
LOOSEN HIM UP.

118
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,875
MAYBE THEY'RE MAKING PLANS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

119
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,375
WHICH REMINDS ME, WHAT DO YOU
GOT GOING ON LATER, SUZUKA?

120
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,500
SUZUKA? ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

121
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,125
- ALL RIGHT EVERYONE,
FIND YOUR SEATS.

122
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,666
- TALK TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

123
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,583
- OH. OKAY.

124
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,625
- I'M SORRY.
- HONOKA.

125
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,625
HONOKA SAKURAI.

126
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,000
WHO IS SHE?
SHE SEEMS TO KNOW ME.

127
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,041
OH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET ASAHINA.

128
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,166
HEY, ASAHINA, IS THERE SOMEWHERE
SPECIFIC YOU'D LIKE ME

129
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,541
TO WAIT FOR YOU?

130
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,833
- UM. AKITSUKI, EXCUSE ME.
- HUH?

131
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,166
WHAT'S UP?

132
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,083
SORRY, WOULD YOU MIND IF I...

133
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,500
ASAHINA, WAIT!
AREN'T WE GOING SHOPPING?

134
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,958
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WHERE TO MEET YOU AFTER SCHOOL!

135
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,666
- NEVER MIND. I'M IN A HURRY

136
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,666
SO I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA GO BY MYSELF.

137
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,916
- BUT I...

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
- JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

139
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,375
- HOLD ON!

140
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,791
ASAHINA, JUST WAIT!

141
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,875
- WHAT THE HECK'S YOUR PROBLEM?
MAKE UP YOUR FREAKIN' MIND!

142
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,041
- SO, UM... WAS THAT GIRL...

143
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,958
ASAHINA, WAS SHE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

144
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,916
- UH... NO. SHE'S JUST A FRIEND.
I'M NOT GOING OUT WITH ANYONE.

145
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,125
- "JUST A FRIEND".

146
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,250
- YOU KNOW, ALL DAY I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO REMEMBER

147
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,625
WHERE I'VE MET YOU
BEFORE, HONOKA.

148
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,416
BUT TO BE HONEST,
I'M DRAWING A BLANK.

149
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,041
- IT WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

150
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,833
I MET YOU AT INARI SHRINE.
IT'S MY FAMILY'S SHRINE.

151
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,375
YOU VISIT THERE OFTEN.

152
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,291
- YEAH, I WAS JUST THERE!
I LOVE THAT PLACE!

153
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,583
WAIT, YOUR FAMILY
RUNS THAT SHRINE?

154
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,875
- DOES THAT MEAN YOU LIVE THERE?
- ( clanging )

155
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,833
- YES. ONE DAY I BROKE A BELL
AS I WAS PLAYING WITH IT.

156
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,416
NO. WHAT DO I DO? DAD'S GONNA
BE SO MAD WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

157
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,458
- LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE NOW.

158
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,250
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING

159
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,333
YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING
WITH, DO YOU?

160
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,458
- I... I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

161
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,000
I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE

162
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,333
GOING TO TELL MY DAD
THAT I BROKE THE BELL...

163
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,833
BUT INSTEAD...

164
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,791
- PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I'LL FIX IT FOR YOU.

165
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,000
IT'S JUST A LITTLE DENT.

166
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,041
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIX IT?

167
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,166
- DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL SEE.

168
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,208
- IT'S PERFECT.

169
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,833
- NOW, LISTEN. THIS'LL BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET, OKAY?

170
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,250
- OH, OKAY. THANK YOU.

171
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,250
I WON'T TELL ANYONE. I PROMISE.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
AND I'VE ALWAYS KEPT OUR SECRET.

173
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE THAT GIRL?

174
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,125
- I WAS WORRIED
THAT YOU'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

175
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,958
- IT'S MY FAVORITE PLACE
TO VISIT.

176
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,291
I LIKE TO EAT CROQUETTES THERE
EVERY TIME I GO.

177
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,125
- ( she giggles )

178
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,958
I NOTICED THAT.

179
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,041
ACTUALLY, I'VE SEEN YOU THERE
MANY TIMES EATING CROQUETTES.

180
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,666
BUT I NEVER HAD THE COURAGE
TO TALK TO YOU BEFORE.

181
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,875
SO, I WAS WONDERING.
ARE CROQUETTES YOUR FAVORITE?

182
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,583
- IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE CROQUETTES.

183
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,666
I'LL EAT ANYTHING
IF IT TASTES GOOD.

184
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,583
- ME TOO. HAVE YOU EATEN
AT THE NEW OKONOMIYAKI

185
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,500
RESTAURANT ACROSS
FROM THE TRAIN STATION?

186
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,666
- ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T.

187
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,666
BUT I'D LOVE TO GO
SOME TIME. SOUNDS GOOD.

188
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,250
- REALLY?

189
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,125
MAYBE...

190
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,375
WE...

191
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,583
COULD...

192
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,125
GO THERE...

193
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,375
TONIGHT...

194
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,708
IF YOU WANT.

195
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,000
- UM... TONIGHT?

196
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,541
- OH, OH, NO. IT'S OKAY
IF YOU CAN'T GO.

197
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,916
I JUST THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU AND I MIGHT...

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,750
- UH...

199
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,208
- NEVER MIND.

200
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,333
I'M IN A HURRY SO I THINK I'M
JUST GONNA GO BY MYSELF.

201
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,291
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT GIRL.

202
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,041
AFTER THE WAY SHE
TREATED ME TODAY,

203
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,166
WHY SHOULD I WAIT FOR HER?

204
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,000
( laughing )

205
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,583
- GOOD, LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT.

206
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,250
- ( indistinct conversation )

207
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,875
- ( whistle blowing )

208
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,375
- PRACTICE SURE WAS LONG TODAY.

209
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,833
- HEY, YOU SAID THAT

210
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,875
YOU'RE GOING TO THE GROCERY
STORE LATER TODAY, RIGHT?

211
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,375
WE NEED ENERGY DRINKS.
DON'T FORGET, OKAY?

212
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,583
- RIGHT.

213
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,791
I GUESS I'M ON MY OWN.

214
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,041
I'LL HAVE TO MAKE TWO
TRIPS TO CARRY EVERYTHING.

215
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,875
I WISH YAMATO WOULD'VE COME
TO HELP ME.

216
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,166
- MAYBE THEY'RE MAKING PLANS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

217
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,291
- HE CAN BE SUCH A LITTLE FLAKE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I BOTHER.

218
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,625
- ( sneezing )

219
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,458
- ( she runs over )

220
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,166
- AND JUST HOW LONG
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME

221
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,375
TO WAIT FOR YOU TODAY?

222
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,000
YOU CAN BE SO INCONSIDERATE!

223
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,833
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT. YOU
WAITED FOR ME? FOR FIVE HOURS?

224
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,541
- WELL, I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE,

225
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:34,125
BUT I DECIDED I WOULD WAIT
AROUND AND GIVE YOU A HAND.

226
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,666
( sneezing )

227
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,583
- ( water splashing )

228
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,208
- YAMATO AKITSUKI.

229
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,458
- WOW, I'M REALLY SORRY, HONOKA,
BUT I ALREADY PROMISED ASAHINA

230
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,583
THAT I'D GO SHOPPING
WITH HER TODAY.

231
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,458
MAYBE YOU AND I COULD GO OUT
TO EAT TOGETHER

232
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,541
SOME OTHER TIME
WHEN I'M NOT SO BUSY.

233
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,791
- HE'S SWEET. ALWAYS THINKING
OF HIS FRIENDS FIRST.

234
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,583
- YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

235
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,375
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
REALLY WAITED FIVE HOURS.

236
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,750
- HUH? WHAT?

237
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,583
( angrily ) JUST WHO DO YOU
THINK I DID THAT FOR?

238
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,333
YOU KNOW, SOME
GRATITUDE WOULD BE NICE.

239
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,625
I WAITED OUT
IN THE FREEZING COLD!

240
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,041
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?
ASAHINA!

241
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,625
- HAVE A GOOD DAY, AKITSUKI.

242
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,041
- DID I MENTION THAT I'M

243
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,041
IN THIS MESS BECAUSE I WAS
TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOR?

244
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,375
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT
THAT I'M SICK.

245
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,916
- NO, IT ISN'T.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,041
I DON'T REMEMBER EVER TELLING
YOU TO WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE.

247
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,166
DON'T BLAME ME FOR YOUR IDIOCY.

248
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,375
- IDIOCY?

249
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,250
- YOU SHOULD REALLY
TRY TO GET SOME REST.

250
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,666
I ALREADY CALLED THE SCHOOL
AND TOLD THEM YOU'D BE OUT.

251
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,750
- IF YOU PUSH YOURSELF,
IT'LL ONLY GET WORSE, YOU KNOW.

252
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,875
- I THINK
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF NOW.

253
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,708
I DON'T PLAN ON STICKING AROUND
AND CATCHING WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

254
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,416
- HEY, WAIT! ( coughing )

255
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,291
- GOODNESS. COME HERE AND TAKE
YOUR MEDICINE, YAMATO.

256
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,000
- YEAH, YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO DIE OR SOMETHING.

257
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,500
- PLEASE SAY "HERE" WHEN I CALL
YOUR NAME.

258
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,208
LOOKS LIKE AKITSUKI'S SICK TODAY
AND WON'T BE IN. ASAHINA?

259
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,333
- HERE.

260
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,500
- INOUE?

261
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,833
- HERE.

262
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:42,541
- AKITSUKI WON'T BE IN TODAY?
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

263
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,125
- MAN, IT'S ONLY THE SECOND DAY
OF SCHOOL

264
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,916
AND ALREADY YAMATO'S
STARTED SKIPPING CLASSES.

265
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,541
- HMM.

266
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,291
- HEY, SUZUKA.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

267
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,666
I TOTALLY FORGOT THAT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING YOU

268
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,875
WITH THE SHOPPING.

269
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,625
DID YOU MANAGE OKAY
ALL BY YOURSELF?

270
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,083
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

271
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,291
I FOUND SOMEONE ELSE TO HELP
ME SO IT WORKED OUT FINE.

272
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,125
- OH, GOOD. WHO WENT WITH YOU?

273
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,708
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I ENDED UP CARRYING

274
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,541
ALMOST EVERYTHING ANYWAY.

275
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,000
- OH, REALLY?

276
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,916
- ( coughing )

277
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:33,458
- I THINK I'M GETTING WORSE.
A LOT OF GOOD THIS REST DID ME.

278
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,666
- I'M SO SORRY, I HAVE SOME
ERRANDS I NEED TO RUN TODAY,

279
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,166
SO I WON'T BE HERE.

280
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,791
BUT, MIHO SHOULD BE BACK
AROUND 5:00.

281
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,500
- OH, MAN, A BIG BOWL OF SOUP

282
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,000
SURE WOULD TASTE PRETTY
GOOD RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

283
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,666
HEY, GORO,
COULD YOU MAKE ME SOME?

284
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,166
- ( mewing )

285
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,625
- MAYBE ASAHINA WILL BE BACK
FROM SCHOOL BEFORE LONG.

286
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,458
- ( doorbell ringing )

287
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,666
- WHO IS IT? ASAHINA?!

288
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,416
- WHAT'S UP, BRO?

289
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,375
- ( groaning )

290
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,916
NOT MUCH. HEY.

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,541
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU. ONE
MORE TIME. WHAT'S UP, BRO?

292
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,541
- GO AWAY.
YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT WORSE.

293
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:18,333
- NO, I'M NOT. I BROUGHT YOU A
TREAT TO HELP YOU FEEL BETTER.

294
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:22,875
- ARE YOU OKAY? UM...
CAN I HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING?

295
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,000
- HONOKA?

296
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,958
- SHE REALLY WANTED TO
GIVE YOU A CHECK UP, MAN.

297
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,916
SHE JUST KEPT BEGGING
ME TO BRING HER BY.

298
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,625
- WHAT? THAT'S NOT TRUE,
AKITSUKI! I WAS JUST...

299
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,916
- IT'S FINE, WHATEVER.
THREE'S A CROWD, I UNDERSTAND.

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,791
I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS
TO DO ANYWAY.

301
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,083
DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

302
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,666
- ( groaning )

303
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,208
- OH... ARE YOU OKAY?

304
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,625
ARE YOU HURT ANYWHERE?

305
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,625
I'M SORRY TO BARGE
IN AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

306
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,541
- IT'S OKAY.
I COULD USE THE COMPANY.

307
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,708
- SO THIS IS YOUR ROOM.

308
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,041
AW, WHAT A SWEET KITTY.

309
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,208
- SORRY THE PLACE
IS SUCH A MESS.

310
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,208
- DON'T WORRY, IT'S FINE.

311
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,583
- THANKS FOR COMING BY.

312
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,583
I WAS STARTING TO FEEL A
BIT LONELY HERE BY MYSELF.

313
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,416
YOU KNOW, ASAHINA
HASN'T EVEN COME TO VISIT ME.

314
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,291
AND SHE LIVES RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

315
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,541
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT ASAHINA LIVED HERE, TOO.

316
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,041
THAT'S RIGHT.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU BEFORE?

317
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,166
THIS IS MY AUNT AYANO'S COMPLEX.

318
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
- OH, I SEE.

319
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,958
NO WONDER THEY'RE SO CLOSE.

320
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:32,000
HEY, YOU HUNGRY? IF YOU WANT ME
TO, I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING.

321
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,625
- IT'S OKAY. I WOULDN'T WANT TO
CAUSE YOU TO GO TO ANY TROUBLE.

322
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,791
- OH, NO TROUBLE.
AND YOU NEED TO EAT

323
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,333
TO KEEP YOUR STRENGTH
UP, YOU KNOW.

324
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,000
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME SOUP.

325
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,291
- THAT WOULD HIT THE SPOT.

326
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,833
- LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.

327
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,375
I PROMISE I'LL COOK YOU
UP SOMETHING DELICIOUS.

328
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,708
- BUT I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANY GROCERIES.

329
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,541
- THAT'S FINE.
I LIVE CLOSE BY.

330
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,208
I'LL JUST GO AND PICK
SOME THINGS UP.

331
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,208
I'LL HAVE TO WORK HARD

332
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,875
IF I WANT TO BE AS CLOSE
TO HIM AS ASAHINA.

333
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,500
ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT
THEY LIVE IN THE SAME BUILDING.

334
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,125
OH, ASAHINA. HI THERE.

335
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,833
I WONDER IF SHE'S HERE
TO SEE AKITSUKI.

336
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,708
- HELLO, SAKURAI.
SO, HOW IS HE FEELING TODAY?

337
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:23,166
- OKAY. UM, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
MAKE HIM SOMETHING TO EAT.

338
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,291
- I SEE. WELL, THEN TELL HIM

339
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,833
I SAID THAT I HOPE
HE FEELS BETTER.

340
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,875
- BUT WAIT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
STAY AND SAY HI TO HIM?

341
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,833
- I CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE OF
GETTING SICK RIGHT NOW.

342
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,958
- OKAY.

343
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,666
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT AS CLOSE
AS I THOUGHT THEY WERE.

344
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,583
- ( Akitsuki coughing )

345
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,333
- OH, GOODNESS. THAT COUGH
OF HIS SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

346
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,750
I REALLY NEED TO GET HOME QUICK

347
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,416
SO I CAN GET STARTED
ON HIS DINNER.

348
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,583
- ( groaning )

349
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,000
- MMM. THAT WAS
TOTALLY DELICIOUS.

350
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,416
- COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF.

351
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,375
- UH... THANKS.

352
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,250
- HEY, WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO COOK LIKE THAT?

353
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,041
YOU GOTTA TEACH ME, HONOKA.

354
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,291
- MM-HM. THAT'S SOME OF THE
BEST SOUP I'VE EVER TASTED.

355
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,666
- HEY, HONOKA. WHERE'S MINE?

356
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,541
- I'M SORRY BUT I'M AFRAID
THEY'VE EATEN IT ALL.

357
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,166
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO EAT ANYWAY, YAMATO.

358
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,833
DON'T THEY ALWAYS SAY
YOU SHOULD STARVE A COLD?

359
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
- I THINK SO.

360
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,500
- WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

361
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,875
YOU'RE MAKING
ME FEEL WORSE.

362
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,583
- AWW. DON'T WORRY, YAMATO.

363
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,791
I'VE GOT JUST THE THING TO GET
RID OF THAT COLD OF YOURS.

364
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,666
NOW. YOU MAY FEEL
A LITTLE PRICK.

365
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,208
- ( screaming )

366
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,458
- ( gasping )

367
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,041
- ( laughing )

368
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,541
- GET AWAY FROM ME.

369
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,833
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING WITH THAT THING?

370
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,833
- OKAY, NO NEEDLES.

371
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,791
WE'LL USE THIS.

372
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,208
NOW, TAKE OFF THOSE CLOTHES.

373
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,625
- ( screaming )

374
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,125
- HATTORI, GET OVER HERE
AND GRAB HIS LEGS, QUICK.

375
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,333
- SURE THING.
- GET OFF OF ME!

376
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,916
- Hattori: DUDE, RELAX.
THINK OF YOUR HEALTH.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,500
- THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF NOISE
FROM UPSTAIRS.

378
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,625
- I THINK HATTORI AND SAOTOME
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO STOP BY

379
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,833
AND VISIT HIM TONIGHT.

380
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,625
AND SAKURAI IS PROBABLY
UP THERE, TOO.

381
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,958
- I WONDER IF I SHOULD
LEAVE HIS DINNER HERE?

382
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,375
I'M SURE HE'LL GET BY JUST FINE.
I SAW SAKURAI EARLIER,

383
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,250
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
GONNA MAKE HIM DINNER.

384
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,291
- OH! THAT'S AWFULLY NICE
OF HER.

385
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,958
GET DOWN, GORO!

386
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,000
- AW, GORO JUST WANTS TO HELP US
CLEAN UP. ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

387
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,833
- ( mewing )

388
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,416
- ( Akitsuki coughing )

389
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,791
FINALLY, SOME PEACE AND QUIET.

390
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,875
( stomach growling )

391
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:38,000
BUT I'M STARVING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

392
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,208
ASAHINA DIDN'T EVEN
COME BY TO MAKE SURE

393
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,708
THAT I WAS ALL RIGHT TONIGHT.

394
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,791
DID I MENTION THAT
I'M IN THIS MESS

395
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,541
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO DO YOU A FAVOR?

396
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,250
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

397
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,416
WHERE DO I FIND THE ON BUTTON?

398
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,166
- DAMN IT. I'M STARVING.
AND TIRED.

399
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,666
ASAHINA, WHERE CAN YOU BE?

400
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,041
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU GUYS
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

401
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,583
OH, ASAHINA.

402
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,291
- HEY. YOU FEELING BETTER?

403
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,958
- ( sighing )

404
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,916
- NOT COMPLETELY.
BUT IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,250
- THAT'S GOOD. I'M SURE
THAT YOUR COLD WILL PASS

406
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,875
IN NO TIME AT ALL.

407
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,541
HERE.

408
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,125
- WHAT'S THAT?

409
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,583
- I HAD SOME SPARE TIME, SO I
MADE YOU SOME HARD-BOILED EGGS.

410
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,416
BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE ALREADY FULL
FROM ALL THE FOOD SAKURAI MADE.

411
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,291
- REALLY. YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

412
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,125
THANKS, ASAHINA!
I THOUGHT I'D STARVE TO DEATH.

413
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,125
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HUNGRY.

414
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,500
- IF YOU WERE SO HUNGRY,

415
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,708
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST ASK ME
TO BRING YOU SOMETHING?

416
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,083
- WHAT'S THIS?
- LEMON JUICE WITH HONEY.

417
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,083
BUT WITHOUT THE HONEY.

418
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,208
- IT'S SOUR.
- I KIND OF RAN OUT OF HONEY.

419
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,500
- SO IT'S JUST LEMON JUICE THEN?

420
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,125
- SORRY. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DRINK IT.

421
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,833
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

422
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,541
I'M STARVING. I'M SO HUNGRY I'LL
TAKE ANYTHING AT THIS POINT.

423
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,583
EVEN THOUGH THIS DRINK
IS THE MOST SOUR THING

424
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,416
I'VE EVER TASTED IN
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

425
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,416
- DRINK UP, THEN.

426
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,375
- MAYBE BEING SICK
ISN'T ALL BAD.

427
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,833
SOUR.

428
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,166
IS THERE ANYTHING
I SHOULD KNOW

429
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,625
ABOUT THE HARD-BOILED
EGGS BEFORE I TAKE A BITE?

430
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,541
- NOPE, THEY'RE JUST NORMAL
HARD-BOILED EGGS.

431
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,291
OF COURSE,
I MADE THEM IN THE MICROWAVE.

432
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,125
- ( screaming )

433
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,875
- WHAT HAPPENED?

434
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,458
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T USE
THE MICROWAVE FOR EVERYTHING.

435
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,625
- BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK
JUST FINE.

436
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,625
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE
IT WORKED JUST FINE?

437
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,333
