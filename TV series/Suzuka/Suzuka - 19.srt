- Yasunobu: SHE RETURNED YOUR
BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

25
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,125
- Yamato: YEAH.
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

26
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,208
AT FIRST SHE WASN'T UPSET THAT
I'D ASKED ASAHINA TO GO WITH ME.

27
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,291
THEN SHE CHANGED HER MIND.
ALL I SAID WAS THAT SHE WAS

28
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,125
AN ANNOYING PERSON
TO GO SHOPPING WITH.

29
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,416
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,333
- YOU REALLY THINK SHE
WASN'T UPSET FROM THE START

31
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,708
THAT SUZUKA WAS THERE?

32
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,958
- YEAH.
- THERE'S NO WAY, MAN.

33
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,500
IT WAS JUST EASIER
FOR HER TO FAKE IT AT FIRST.

34
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
- FAKE WHAT?

35
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,791
- THERE'S NO WAY SAKURAI
WOULD EVER BE OKAY WITH YOU

36
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,375
HANGING OUT WITH SUZUKA.

37
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,375
IT WOULD'VE BEEN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT IF YOU'D'VE ASKED

38
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,166
HASHIBA OR YUKA TO GO WITH YOU.

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,500
- WAIT JUST A MINUTE!

40
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,125
THERE'S NOTHING'S GOING ON
BETWEEN ASAHINA AND ME!

41
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,791
- YEAH, BUT YA USED TO HAVE
PRETTY STRONG FEELINGS FOR HER,

42
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,250
AND TO SAKURAI,
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

43
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,208
- AW, GREAT.

44
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,541
- BUT DESPITE ALL THAT,

45
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,333
SHE WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE
PRESENT AT FIRST.

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,041
YOU NEED TO LEARN
WHEN TO STOP.

47
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,666
YOU KEPT GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT YOUR DAY WITH SUZUKA.

48
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,500
- I KNOW YOU DON'T. YOU JUST
BROUGHT HER WITH YOU TO HELP

49
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,541
PICK OUT THE PERFECT
PRESENT FOR ME, RIGHT?

50
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,041
- THAT WAS PRETTY CARELESS.

51
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,291
YA KNOW, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
I SEE WITH THIS SITUATION

52
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,291
IS THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT
ALL ABOUT YOU.

53
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,791
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

54
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,583
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO FIND
THE RIGHT GIFT FOR HER!

55
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,791
I WENT EVERYWHERE AND DIDN'T
STOP UNTIL I FOUND

56
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,083
THE ONE I LIKED.

57
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,916
IT WASN'T EASY, BELIEVE ME!

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,750
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
WHEN I SAY YOU'RE JUST

59
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,333
THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

60
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,583
LOOK, NO MATTER HOW YOU DEFEND
IT, THE FACT IS, SHE'S UPSET.

61
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,916
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO HER
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST
GONNA GET WORSE.

63
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,125
- HEY, SHUT UP, ALRIGHT!
I'M DONE TAKING ADVICE FROM YOU!

64
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,916
- EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER TOLD ME
JUST MESSES THINGS UP!

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,375
- YAMATO!

66
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,125
- I CAN HANDLE ALL THIS MYSELF.
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

67
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,500
- ALL RIGHT. JUST DON'T
FORGET TO APOLOGIZE.

68
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,625
- SHUT UP.

69
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,000
- Soichi: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S START WARMING UP!

70
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,458
- All: ALL RIGHT!

71
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,833
- WOULD IT BE BETTER TO
APOLOGIZE NOW

72
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,833
OR TRY TO TALK TO HER LATER?

73
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,541
THERE SHE IS!

74
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,625
HONOKA! HI! CAN I TALK
TO YOU? JUST FOR A MINUTE?

75
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,291
UH, HONOKA, PLEASE WAIT!

76
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,125
LISTEN, ABOUT YESTERDAY...
I, UM...

77
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:17,416
- I'M SORRY. I DON'T WANT TO
TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW, AKITSUKI.

78
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,583
- BUT WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND?
CAN'T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME?

79
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,833
- NO, I CAN'T.

80
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,541
- Kobayakawa: YO, MANAGER.
WILL YOU KEEP MY TIME FOR ME?

81
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,750
- SURE THING!

82
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,041
- ASAHINA? WHAT'RE
YOU DOING HERE? IT'S LATE.

83
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:13,000
- UH, HI. ABOUT HONOKA.
WERE YOU ABLE TO MAKE UP?

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,500
- WELL, NO.

85
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,625
ACTUALLY, SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
EVEN WANNA TALK TO ME.

86
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,208
THE MAIN REASON
I WANTED TO TALK

87
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,625
WAS SO THAT I COULD APOLOGIZE.

88
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,125
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

89
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,625
- I'M SORRY.

90
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,750
- HOLD ON, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ARE YOU SORRY FOR?

91
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:36,083
- BECAUSE I SHOULD'VE NEVER
AGREED TO GO SHOPPING WITH YOU.

92
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,041
IT'S ALL MY FAULT
THE TWO OF YOU ARE FIGHTING.

93
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,541
- ASAHINA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

94
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,875
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I ASKED YOU TO COME.

95
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,166
AND I'M GLAD I DID.
YOU WERE A BIG HELP TO ME.

96
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,625
- YEAH, BUT...

97
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,875
- IT'S JUST LIKE
YASUNOBU TOLD ME.

98
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,208
THIS IS MY FAULT
FOR NOT THINKING

99
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,875
ABOUT HONOKA'S FEELINGS.

100
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,166
SO DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

101
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,625
- OKAY. NOW WHAT?
- HUH?

102
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,083
- WELL, UM, SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
WANNA TALK TO YOU AT ALL, RIGHT?

103
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,541
- OH, YEAH, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

104
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,750
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE SHE WAS
THAT UPSET WITH ME TILL TODAY.

105
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:16,375
AW, MAN. I HOPE SHE DOESN'T
HATE ME NOW. YA KNOW?

106
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,083
- I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

107
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,916
EVEN IF SHE'S SAYING SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK TO YOU,

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,916
I KNOW SHE DOES.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,250
AND IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO HER

110
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,916
IF YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO
TRY. BELIEVE ME.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,208
- YOU THINK SO?

112
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,833
- I DO. SHE'D APPRECIATE
IT. TRUST ME.

113
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,458
- WOW! REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?
- I'M POSITIVE.

114
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,791
JUST KEEP TRYING TO TALK TO HER,

115
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,833
SERIOUSLY. I MEAN EVEN IF
IT'S JUST ON THE PHONE.

116
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,166
AND DON'T GIVE UP.

117
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,083
- OKAY. I CAN HANDLE THAT.
THANKS, ASAHINA.

118
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,916
THANK YOU FOR WORRYING ABOUT ME.

119
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,833
- NO PROBLEM. I HOPE
EVERYTHING WORKS OUT.

120
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,791
- ( busy tone )

121
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,583
- Honoka: YEAH, I SEE.

122
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,916
- Nana: I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS,

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
AT LEAST AT FIRST.

124
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,708
BUT I THINK THAT'S IT.
I HONESTLY BELIEVE IT WAS JUST

125
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,916
ABOUT YOUR PRESENT.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,250
HE ONLY WANTED YOUR
BIRTHDAY TO BE PERFECT.

127
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,458
PLUS, IT'S YAMATO.
HE'S NOT EXACTLY A GENIUS.

128
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,208
I THINK HE JUST WANTED
ANOTHER GIRL'S OPINION

129
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,250
AND HE ASKED SUZUKA
WITHOUT THINKING.

130
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,458
I DOUBT IT'S ANYTHING MORE.

131
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,666
- BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM, NANA.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,625
- I COULD TELL BY THE WAY
HE LOOKED AT HER.

133
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,708
HE STILL HAS FEELINGS
FOR ASAHINA

134
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,458
- ( busy tone )

135
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,916
- WELL, THAT'S KINDA STRANGE.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,666
HER LINE'S BEEN
BUSY FOR A WHILE.

137
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,583
- OH, NANA. I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY WE'RE STILL DATING.

138
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,375
- ( busy tone )

139
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,458
- MMM-HMM. THEY MATCH. SEE?

140
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,083
NOW WE'LL ALWAYS BE CONNECTED.

141
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,708
- HMM...

142
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,041
- Suzuka: EVEN IF SHE'S SAYING
SHE DOESN'T WANNA TALK TO YOU,

143
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,583
I KNOW SHE DOES.

144
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,958
AND IT WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO HER

145
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,166
IF YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO
TRY. BELIEVE ME.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,291
- SHE'S RIGHT.

147
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,000
I HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

148
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,958
I DON'T WANT THINGS
TO STAY THE WAY THEY ARE!

149
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,583
- THERE YOU ARE. HEY, DINNER'S
READY. ARE YOU GONNA EAT?

150
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,541
- LATER! I'M GOING OUT
FOR A BIT!

151
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,458
- WHAT? I SEE.
HE HASN'T GIVEN IT TO HER, YET.

152
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,666
- ( panting )

153
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,208
- Honoka: I'M SORRY.

154
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,541
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO
YOU RIGHT NOW, AKITSUKI.

155
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,875
- I CAN'T JUST STAND HERE
THINKING ABOUT IT.

156
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

157
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,250
- ( bell rings )

158
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,458
- Honoka: COMING!

159
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,333
( gasps )

160
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,291
- HI! HOW ARE YOU?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

161
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,125
I, I MEAN, IT'S LATE.

162
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,708
- WELL, I KEPT CALLING
AND THE LINE WAS BUSY.

163
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,791
TAKE THIS. UH, PLEASE?

164
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,000
I JUST REALLY WANT
YOU TO HAVE IT, OKAY?

165
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,500
- I TOLD YOU. I DON'T WANT THAT.

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,083
- SO, UM, IF THAT'S ALL YOU
WANTED, THEN PLEASE GO!

167
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,291
- WAIT! JUST LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

168
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,125
I REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS A LOT.

169
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,958
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY AND
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING NICE!

170
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,916
SO WHY ARE YOU SO MAD AT ME?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL!

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,791
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO
ME, THEN JUST SAY IT, OKAY!

172
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,791
THIS ISN'T FAIR, HONOKA!

173
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,083
- NO, IT'S NOT.

174
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,333
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT ME
TO ACCEPT THAT GIFT FROM YOU

175
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,250
WHEN ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW MUCH FUN YOU HAD

176
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,416
SHOPPING FOR
IT WITH ASAHINA?

177
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,166
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
I HAVE TERRIBLE TASTE.

178
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,708
I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
WHERE TO GO AND WHAT KINDS

179
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,458
OF THINGS GIRLS EVEN LIKE.

180
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,875
- THEN YOU COULD'VE ASKED
ANYONE ELSE TO GO WITH YOU!

181
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,250
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO ASK HER?

182
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,583
JUST TELL ME!

183
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,208
WAS IT BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO SPEND TIME WITH HER?

184
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,166
- NO! IT WASN'T LIKE THAT!
- OF COURSE IT WAS!

185
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,916
I CAN TELL EVEN IF
YOU DON'T SAY IT!

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,625
YOU ALWAYS HAVE
ASAHINA ON YOUR MIND

187
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,708
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL, AKITSUKI.

188
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,000
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT,

189
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,250
BUT I CAN TELL JUST BY
LOOKING AT YOU!

190
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,583
SHE'S THE ONE YOU WANT
TO BE WITH. JUST ADMIT IT.

191
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,666
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME.

192
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,500
- ALRIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH!
NOW JUST LISTEN!

193
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,916
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ASAHINA
WAY TOO MUCH!

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,750
- IS THAT SO?
- HEY! JUST WAIT!

195
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,875
HONOKA, PLEASE STOP!

196
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,000
- LET GO.

197
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,916
- Honoka: YOU ALWAYS HAVE
ASAHINA ON YOUR MIND

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,583
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL, AKITSUKI!

199
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,125
- Yamato: MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

200
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,333
BUT THEN AGAIN, MAYBE THAT'S
JUST THE WAY IT LOOKS TO HER.

201
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,458
I HAVE BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME WITH ASAHINA,

202
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,708
BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

203
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,625
I GUESS IT DIDN'T
LOOK THAT WAY TO HONOKA.

204
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,958
MAYBE SHE THOUGHT
EVERY TIME I WAS WITH ASAHINA,

205
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,791
I WAS HOPING
FOR SOMETHING DEEPER.

206
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,833
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH ASAHINA

207
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,250
WAS HURTING HONOKA.

208
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,416
- I THINK, THIS IS
ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS

209
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,791
THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET WORSE
IF WE KEEP DATING.

210
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,083
LIKE A CYCLE.

211
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,166
SO, WE SHOULD PROBABLY BREAK UP.

212
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,833
- YEAH, I GUESS.

213
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,000
- ( sighs ) OKAY.

214
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,125
- YOU JERK.
- HUH?

215
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,666
- THEN WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF ASKING ME OUT

216
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,125
IN THE FIRST PLACE? IDIOT!

217
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,541
- I'M SORRY.

218
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,250
- I HOPE YOU DIDN'T FEEL
OBLIGATED TO GO OUT WITH ME

219
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,833
BECAUSE I KISSED YOU.

220
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,625
- NO, I DIDN'T.

221
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,708
- THEN WHY WERE
YOU EVEN WITH ME?

222
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY CUTE.

223
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,916
- HUH?

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,125
- I LOOKED AT YOU AND THOUGHT
YOU WERE REALLY SWEET.

225
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,458
IN THAT MOMENT.

226
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,458
- THAT MOMENT? WHAT IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

227
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,083
- WELL, JUST,
IT MEANS YOU'RE WRONG.

228
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
AND I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT
ASAHINA ALL THE TIME

229
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,333
AND I HAVE PROOF.

230
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,875
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER WHEN
WE WALK TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

231
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,000
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER
WHEN YOU COOK FOR ME.

232
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,500
AND I HONESTLY WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT HER WHEN I WENT SHOPPING

233
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,625
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

234
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,375
SURE SHE WAS THERE.

235
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,458
BUT THE ONLY THING
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE WHOLE DAY

236
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,750
WAS WHETHER OR NOT
YOU WERE GOING TO LIKE IT.

237
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,416
- SO, WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME ALL OF THIS NOW?

238
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,041
- BECAUSE I DO LIKE YOU.

239
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,458
AND I DON'T WANT TO BREAK UP
WITH YOU LIKE THIS.

240
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:51,833
- NO. I DON'T EITHER.
CAN I PLEASE HAVE MY PRESENT?

241
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,375
- OF COURSE YOU CAN. WHY NOW?

242
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,916
- BECAUSE...

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,625
IT'LL BE A NICE REMINDER THAT
YOU AND I WERE IN LOVE ONCE,

244
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,625
EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

245
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,583
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THINKING OF ME.

246
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,250
I'M SURE IT'S WONDERFUL.

247
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,666
( chuckles )

248
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,375
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

249
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,125
HONOKA, MAYBE WE...

250
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,166
- THANKS AGAIN FOR
THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.

251
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,916
BYE, AKITSUKI.

252
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,000
- BYE, HONOKA.

253
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,916
- BYE, AKITSUKI.

254
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,125
- OH, YAMATO! YOU'RE BACK!

255
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,416
- YEAH, I'M HERE.

256
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,125
- SO DID YOU GIVE SAKURAI
HER PRESENT?

257
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,791
WHAT DID
SHE THINK OF IT?

258
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,458
- I GAVE IT TO HER.

259
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,500
- ARE YOU COMING TO DINNER?
- NOT TONIGHT.

260
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,250
- YAMATO...

261
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,166
- Honoka: YOU ALWAYS HAVE
ASAHINA ON YOUR MIND

262
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,125
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL, AKITSUKI!

263
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,541
- Yamato: IS THAT TRUE?

264
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,000
I HAVE NO IDEA.

265
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,333
I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT ASAHINA ANYMORE.

266
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,750
- WELCOME HOME, YAMATO!
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

267
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,041
- SORRY, WE LET OURSELVES IN.

268
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,416
- DON'T YOU REALIZE
IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT, YAMATO?

269
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,708
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
TO BE OUT THIS LATE.

270
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,833
- I DON'T TAKE LECTURES
FROM TRESPASSERS.

271
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,791
- I'M SORRY, YAMATO.

272
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,083
BLAME SAOTOME. SHE'S THE ONE
WHO DRAGGED ME OVER HERE.

273
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,458
- Yamato: IT'S ALRIGHT.
I'M USED TO IT BY NOW.

274
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:51,333
- WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU LOOK
ALL DEPRESSED. IT'S SO NOT CUTE.

275
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,333
COME OVER HERE AND HAVE A DRINK!

276
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,916
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,375
- UH-OH. DID YOU HAVE A FIGHT
WITH HONOKA OR SOMETHING?

278
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,625
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.
WE BROKE UP.

279
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,750
- BUT WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

280
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,291
- DID SHE BREAK UP WITH YOU?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

281
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,500
- GOSH, YOU GUYS ARE SO NOSEY!

282
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:18,125
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO DUMPED
WHO. THAT'S NOT THE POINT HERE.

283
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,750
- WHAT ARE YOU,
FREAKING CRAZY?

284
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,541
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BROKE
UP WITH A GIRL LIKE HER!

285
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,500
UGH. WHAT A WASTE.

286
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,291
- YEAH, I KNOW.

287
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,750
- DO YOU REALLY, YAMATO?

288
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,750
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'VE THROWN AWAY?

289
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,708
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
TO FIND ANOTHER GIRL LIKE THAT.

290
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,375
I MEAN LET'S FACE IT.

291
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,500
YOU'RE NOT THE CUTEST
GUY IN THE WORLD.

292
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,666
AND YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
A MILLIONAIRE EITHER.

293
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,791
I'D CERTAINLY NEVER DATE YOU.

294
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,833
- ( sighs )

295
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,041
- Yuka: AW, DID I JUST
BREAK YOUR HEART?

296
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,625
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO CRY.

297
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,916
- Megumi: SAOTOME, STOP MAKING
FUN OF HIM. THAT'S NOT NICE!

298
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,708
- Yuka: WELL, WHAT KIND OF FACE
IS THAT? HE LOOKS PATHETIC!

299
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,333
- Yamato: BECAUSE I JUST
BROKE UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

300
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,791
LEAVE ME ALONE!

301
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,750
- Miho: I'M STARTING TO WONDER
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED

302
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,500
BETWEEN SAKURAI AND YAMATO.

303
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,541
- WELL, IT IS RARE FOR HIM
TO SKIP DINNER THIS MUCH,

304
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,583
THAT'S FOR SURE.

305
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,625
- I WONDER IF IT'S
BECAUSE HE GOT DUMPED.

306
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,416
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

307
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,166
- ( purring )

308
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,083
- BUT LET'S NOT BOTHER HIM
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

309
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,916
- ( sighs ) ALRIGHT.

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,541
- WHADDAYA MEAN SHE RETURNED
YOUR BIRTHDAY GIFT?

311
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,750
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

312
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,583
- I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE MAKING
IT SOUND A LOT WORSE

313
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,750
THAN IT WAS.

314
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,166
- WELL, JUST WHO DOES
SHE THINK SHE IS!

315
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,541
BOYS NEVER GIVE ME PRESENTS!

316
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,041
I'VE NEVER GOT ANYTHING
FROM ANYONE SINCE I WAS BORN!

317
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,541
( crying )

318
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,416
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

319
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,083
- I THINK YOU DRANK
TOO MUCH. YOU OKAY?

320
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,708
- I HATE BIRTHDAYS!
THEY'RE EVIL!

321
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,583
I WISH THEY WOULD
DISAPPEAR FOREVER!

322
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,750
- ( howling )

323
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,875
- ALRIGHT. I THINK WE
NEED TO GO HOME NOW.

324
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,833
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU
DID THE RIGHT THING.

325
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,458
I'M GLAD YOU JUST LET IT HAPPEN
AND DIDN'T FORCE ANYTHING.

326
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,875
- UH...

327
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,708
- I THINK BREAKING UP WITH HER
WAS THE MOST HONEST THING

328
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,916
YOU COULD'VE DONE.

329
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,625
IT WOULD'VE BEEN STUPID
TO TRY TO CONTINUE

330
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,416
THIS CHARADE OF A RELATIONSHIP.

331
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,166
ANYWAY, WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT
SOMEONE ELSE'S LOVE LIFE?

332
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,291
WELL, 'NIGHT!

333
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,583
- ( door closes )

334
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,791
- SHE'S RIGHT.
WE DID DO THE RIGHT THING.

335
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,833
- ( door bell rings )

336
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,250
- Suzuka: YAMATO, ARE YOU THERE?
- ASAHINA!

337
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,041
- Suzuka: HEY! CAN I
TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

338
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,000
- YEAH, SURE!
THE DOOR'S OPEN.

339
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,083
- I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING.
THEY WERE PRETTY LOUD.

340
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,541
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU
BROKE UP WITH HONOKA?

341
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,166
- MMM-HMM.

342
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,083
- HOW COME? SHE WOULDN'T
FORGIVE YOU

343
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,750
EVEN AFTER YOU APOLOGIZED?

344
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,458
SORRY. WAS IT ME?

345
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,750
- Honoka: HOW CAN YOU EXPECT ME
TO ACCEPT THAT GIFT FROM YOU,

346
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,750
WHEN ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW MUCH FUN YOU HAD

347
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,750
SHOPPING FOR IT WITH ASAHINA?

348
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,291
- I THOUGHT SO.

349
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,875
SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU BECAUSE
WE WENT SHOPPING TOGETHER.

350
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,875
- I DUMPED HER.

351
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,625
I JUST. I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

352
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,541
- WHY? WHADDAYA MEAN?

353
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,583
- I MEAN SHE COULD BE
SO ANNOYING SOMETIMES.

354
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,750
I GOT SICK OF IT,
SO I DUMPED HER.

355
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,208
- ANNOYING? WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

356
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,583
- YA KNOW, WE JUST NEVER GOT
ALONG IN THE FIRST PLACE.

357
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,166
REALLY.

358
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,666
AND SHE WAS ALWAYS COMING OVER
IN THE MORNINGS BEFORE SCHOOL.

359
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,125
- YAMATO! YOU CAN'T BE
SERIOUS! DO YOU MEAN THAT?

360
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,708
- EVERY SINGLE WORD OF IT.

361
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,125
- I SEE.

362
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,041
YAMATO, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW INVESTED HONOKA WAS

363
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,583
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP?

364
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:51,625
- OH, YEAH I DO. AND THAT IS
EXACTLY WHY I DUMPED HER.

365
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,750
SHE WAS INSANE.
I'M SO GLAD WE BROKE UP.

366
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,625
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

367
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,083
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

368
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,916
YOU'RE SUCH A JERK.

369
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,666
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

370
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,916
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
I EVER WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE

371
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
AS HEARTLESS AS HIM.

372
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,250
SO STUPID!
