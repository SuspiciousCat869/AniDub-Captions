- THANKS FOR BREAKFAST, AYANO.

26
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,708
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

27
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:53,291
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
OH, YOU DON'T NEED TO CLEAN UP.

28
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,916
- OH, OKAY.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,875
WELL THEN, I GUESS I'M OFF
TO MORNING PRACTICE.

30
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,333
- DON'T YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF IT?

31
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,583
I MEAN, YOU'RE AT THE TRACK
ALL THE TIME.

32
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,416
- WELL, TOMORROW
IS THE SCHOOL ANNIVERSARY,

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,583
SO I'LL AT LEAST
GET ONE DAY OFF TO REST.

34
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,958
- HAVE A GOOD DAY, SUZUKA.
DON'T WORK TOO HARD.

35
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,458
- THANKS. LATER.

36
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,625
( door opens )

37
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,291
- WORKAHOLIC.
- ( door closes )

38
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,583
- IT'S 7:30
ON A BEAUTIFUL FRIDAY MORNING.

39
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,166
LET'S LOOK AT TODAY'S HOROSCOPE.

40
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,750
- I DIDN'T KNOW WE GOT THE DAY
OFF FOR THE SCHOOL ANNIVERSARY.

41
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,791
MAYBE ASAHINA AND I CAN GO OUT
TOGETHER. DO SOMETHING.

42
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,291
UNLESS SHE'S ALREADY
MADE PLANS FOR THE DAY.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,125
MAYBE I'LL TAKE HER OUT
FOR SOME KARAOKE.

44
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,208
THEN AGAIN, KARAOKE
DOESN'T REALLY SEEM

45
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,375
LIKE ASAHINA'S THING.

46
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,083
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN GO
TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK.

47
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,375
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

48
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,791
BUT IF I ASK HER OUT
TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK,

49
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,083
I RUN THE RISK OF
MAKING HER THINK

50
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,416
THAT I'M COMING ON
WAY TOO STRONG.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,041
WHY ARE THESE THINGS
SO DIFFICULT?

52
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,250
- ( doorbell rings )

53
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,666
- WHO'S THAT?

54
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,041
- GOOD MORNING. I'M HERE ON
BEHALF OF THE MAIASA NEWSPAPER.

55
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,583
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START
A SUBSCRIPTION?

56
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,000
IF YOU SIGN UP WITH US TODAY,

57
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,833
WE'RE OFFERING TWO COMPLIMENTARY
PASSES TO FANTASYLAND.

58
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,750
THESE ARE THE LAST TWO TICKETS.
ARE YOU INTERESTED?

59
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,375
THEY'RE ONLY GOOD
THROUGH TOMORROW.

60
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,416
- THIS IS PERFECT!

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,208
SIGN ME UP! AND HAND OVER
THOSE TICKETS, PLEASE.

62
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,375
THEY'RE MINE.

63
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,750
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

64
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,666
YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL
START TOMORROW MORNING.

65
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,333
- ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL.

66
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

67
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,375
THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEMS
JUST FELL INTO MY LAP.

68
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,166
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT FOR ME TO DO.

69
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,166
BUT HOW DO I ASK HER?
WHY AM I SO AWKWARD?

70
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,541
I KNOW! THAT'S IT!
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

71
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,166
( chuckling to himself )

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,375
MAYBE I CAN JUST LEAVE THEM
WHERE SHE'LL NOTICE.

73
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,250
THAT WAY, SHE'LL ASK ME
ABOUT THEM. BRILLIANT!

74
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,541
- ( bell dinging )

75
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,583
- ( panting )

76
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,500
SHE DIDN'T NOTICE.

77
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,250
I SUPPOSE SHE WAS JUST
WAY TOO BUSY TODAY.

78
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,291
( sighs )

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,583
ALL RIGHT, I THINK
I'M GOING TO SAY IT.

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,541
MAYBE I CAN TELL HER
BEFORE WE EAT DINNER,

81
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,208
LIKE WHEN SHE GETS HOME
FROM PRACTICE.

82
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,125
- ( doorbell ringing )

83
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,375
HEY, ARE YOU HOME?
- UH, ASAHINA?

84
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,791
- ( doorbell ringing
repeatedly )

85
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,625
HEY, YOUR AUNT SAID
IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR DINNER.

86
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,000
- OH. OKAY. UM, I...

87
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,166
- WHAT'S UP?
YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL?

88
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:20,041
- I'M FINE. IT'S NOTHING,
NEVER MIND.

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,958
I PRACTICED THIS
SO MANY TIMES IN MY HEAD.

90
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,291
WHY CAN'T I JUST
SAY IT OUT LOUD?

91
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,750
UH...

92
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,125
- FOOD'S GETTING COLD.

93
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,416
- HEY, WAIT.

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,125
( sighs ) I'M SUCH A COWARD.

95
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,708
- ( dog barking )

96
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,208
- THERE'S NO WAY I
WAS GONNA ASK HER

97
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,166
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE AT DINNER.

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,375
MAYBE I'LL STOP BY
HER ROOM LATER.

99
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,041
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

100
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,333
- I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
BE DRINKING OUT HERE, SAOTOME.

101
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,708
- I'VE BEEN WAITING,
MY YA-MA-TO.

102
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,208
- GREAT. JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

103
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,916
- WHAT'S THIS?

104
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,791
WHERE DID YOU GET FREE PASSES
TO FANTASYLAND?

105
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,708
NO WAY!

106
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,041
YOU'VE GOT TWO PASSES.

107
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,375
YOU WERE GONNA ASK
SUZUKA TO GO, WEREN'T YOU?

108
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,000
- NO, I WASN'T.

109
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,083
- GREAT, THEN I'LL GO WITH YOU.

110
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,041
( chuckles ) JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT I'M FREE

111
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,625
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

112
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,166
WE'LL GO TOGETHER,
IT'LL BE A BLAST.

113
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,833
- NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
GIVE 'EM BACK.

114
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,791
- MEGUMI, CATCH!

115
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,000
- STOP IT! THEY'RE MINE!

116
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,541
- THAT HURTS.
- SORRY.

117
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,250
- CALM DOWN THERE, SPORT.
WE'RE JUST HAVING A LITTLE FUN.

118
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,250
- THEN GIVE THOSE BACK.

119
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,583
THEY'RE MY ONLY HOPE
WITH ASAHINA.

120
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,958
- HOW PATHETIC!
ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

121
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,625
- JUST GIVE THE
TICKETS BACK TO HIM.

122
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,708
MAYBE THAT'LL MAKE
HIM GET OFF OF ME.

123
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,375
- MAYBE.

124
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,333
- SERIOUSLY, YOUR KNEE IS
CRUSHING MY LEG. CAN YOU GET UP?

125
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,708
- ( purring )

126
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,541
( mewing )

127
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,458
- OH, MY GOODNESS,
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,541
- GORO! WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING?

129
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,250
MY LAST HOPE, DOWN THE DRAIN.

130
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,500
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
PAY FOR THOSE, RIGHT?

131
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,791
- DON'T BLAME ME.
BLAME THE STUPID CAT.

132
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,583
I'M NOT PAYIN' FOR NOTHIN'.

133
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,125
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
YES, YOU ARE.

134
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,458
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
A DIME OUTTA ME,

135
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,125
AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

136
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,000
'CAUSE I HAVE GOT THE GOODS
ON YOU, BUDDY. BLACKMAIL.

137
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,041
- WELL, THAT'S THE END OF IT.

138
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,125
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN ASK HER OUT NOW.

139
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:04,791
EVERY TIME I TRY, ALL MY PLANS
KEEP BLOWING UP IN MY FACE.

140
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,125
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO REPLACE THE TICKETS.

141
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,208
- ( footsteps approaching )

142
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,791
HEY. I'M GOING TO THE STORE.

143
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,708
WOULD YOU MIND MOVING OVER
A BIT SO I CAN GET BY?

144
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,916
- YEAH, SURE.

145
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,500
I CAN'T ASK HER NOW.

146
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,750
- OH, THERE'S A NEWSPAPER
IN YOUR DOOR.

147
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,333
I JUST NOTICED IT
AS I WAS COMING DOWN.

148
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,750
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A SUBSCRIPTION.

149
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,541
- YEAH.

150
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,041
A REALLY PUSHY
SALESWOMAN CAME BY.

151
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,958
SHE SIGNED ME UP FOR A MONTH.

152
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,041
- OH, YEAH, SHE CAME BY MY PLACE
TOO AND I TURNED HER DOWN.

153
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,958
SHE DID GIVE ME TWO FREE TICKETS
TO FANTASYLAND, THOUGH.

154
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,208
- (gasps )

155
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,541
ARE YOU KIDDING?

156
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,958
- NO, SHE JUST GAVE THEM TO ME.
PRETTY WEIRD, HUH?

157
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,000
- SHE WOULD'VE
GIVEN ME THE TICKETS

158
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,791
WITHOUT THE
SUBSCRIPTION. DAMN IT.

159
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,875
- AND EVEN THOUGH
THE TICKETS WERE FREE,

160
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,333
I WOULD SURE FEEL
PRETTY WASTEFUL

161
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,625
IF I JUST THREW THEM AWAY.

162
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,666
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- NOTHING. I'M FINE.

163
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,625
I JUST GOTTA BE CALM.
BE SMOOTH.

164
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,791
NOT TOO SERIOUS.
BUT NOT TOO JOKING EITHER.

165
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,083
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

166
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,666
JUST DO IT. THIS IS MY CHANCE.
I GOTTA TAKE IT.

167
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:21,916
WELL, I GUESS I COULD GO
WITH YOU IF YOU WANTED ME TO.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,208
OH, CRAP! I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT!

169
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,250
MY HEART FEELS LIKE
IT'S IN MY STOMACH.

170
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,625
I... WAS...

171
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,541
JUST... KIDDING.

172
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,875
- YOU CAN BE SUCH A CHILD.

173
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,625
- WHAT?

174
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,000
- IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH ME,
YOU SHOULD JUST SAY SO.

175
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,291
- I... UM...

176
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:48,166
- WHATEVER. I CAN GO WITH YOU
IF YOU WANT.

177
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,708
I DO HAVE THE DAY OFF TOMORROW

178
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,000
AND I DON'T WANNA JUST SIT
AROUND THE HOUSE ALL BY MYSELF.

179
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,458
WHAT'S WRONG?
DON'T YOU WANNA GO?

180
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,583
- UH... SURE.

181
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,875
I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO GO.

182
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,541
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

183
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,416
I'LL SEE YOU
EARLY IN THE MORNING.

184
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,750
THAT IS IF YOU DON'T
SLEEP IN TOO LATE.

185
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,000
- OH, I WON'T.

186
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,125
I DID IT. I DID IT!

187
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,083
I DID IT!

188
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,250
- ( mewing )

189
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,625
- ( raining heavily )

190
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,916
- MAN, THIS SUCKS.
WHY'D IT HAVE TO RAIN TODAY?

191
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,541
- HOW AWFUL. THE PARADE
WILL PROBABLY BE CANCELED.

192
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,708
- WELL, CHEER UP, ASAHINA.

193
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,708
AT LEAST ALL THE INDOOR
RIDES ARE STILL OPEN, RIGHT?

194
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,250
- BUT THAT'S NO FUN.
ALL THE INDOOR RIDES

195
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,291
ARE FOR LITTLE KIDS, YAMATO.

196
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:08,625
- MAYBE. BUT FOR NOW,
HOW ABOUT WE CHECK THAT OUT?

197
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,166
- "THE FLYING DOLPHIN."

198
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,833
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BLAST.

199
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

200
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,708
- ( indistinct conversation )

201
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,916
- TODAY ISN'T TURNING OUT
AS I'D HOPED.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,083
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

203
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,583
- Male staff: MOVE UP, PLEASE.
DON'T HOLD UP THE LINE.

204
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,000
- HEY, YAMATO, WAKE UP!
- HUH?

205
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,250
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I WANNA GO HOME AFTER THIS.

206
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,541
- I WOULDN'T HAVE COME
IF I HAD KNOWN

207
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,166
IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS.

208
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,750
WHY IS SHE IN SUCH A BAD MOOD?

209
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,750
THIS SHOULD NOT BE
AN INDOOR RIDE!

210
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,625
- WOW, AMAZING. YOU CAN SEE
A WHOLE CITY FROM UP HERE.

211
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,666
- HUH?

212
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,083
- THERE'S A CITY
DOWN THERE, LOOK!

213
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,625
- WHAT?
- CITY!

214
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,333
- WHAT?

215
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,375
I GUESS I UNDERESTIMATED
THE INTENSITY

216
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,625
OF INDOOR RIDES THESE DAYS.

217
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,500
MAN, I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE A HEART ATTACK IN THERE.

218
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,000
I GUESS IT WAS FUN, THOUGH.

219
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,875
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S STILL ANGRY.

220
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,541
SHE'LL PROBABLY WANT
TO LEAVE NOW.

221
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,333
- LOOK AT THIS.
( laughs )

222
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,500
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
IS PRICELESS.

223
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:49,500
- WHAT? WELL, I COULDN'T
HELP IT! IT WAS SCARY!

224
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,208
WHY DID THERE HAVE TO BE
A CAMERA ON THE RIDE?

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,250
- WELL THEN. I GUESS
IT'S ON TO THE NEXT RIDE.

226
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,000
- UM, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED TO GO HOME?

227
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,250
- NO WAY. I'M FINALLY
STARTING TO HAVE FUN.

228
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,916
- ( chuckles ) ALL RIGHT!

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,416
YOU WANNA HIT
ALL THE INDOOR RIDES THEN?

230
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,958
- ( chuckles )
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT?

231
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,333
- ( groaning )

232
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,291
- WELL, THEN.

233
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,875
I GUESS WE COULD GO,

234
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,333
BUT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF
RIDES WE HAVEN'T BEEN ON.

235
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,541
- I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT.

236
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,500
I NEVER KNEW THAT THIS PLACE
WAS SO ENORMOUS.

237
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,083
IT'S A WHOLE CITY UNTO ITSELF.

238
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,541
- DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU'VE
ALREADY WORN YOURSELF OUT.

239
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,166
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

240
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,833
I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME YET.

241
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,458
YOU CAN SIT HERE IF YOU WANT,
BUT I'M GOING SHOPPING.

242
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,958
- BUT CAN'T WE JUST
RELAX HERE A BIT LONGER?

243
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:51,000
- NO. NOW COME ON, THE STORE'S
ONLY OPEN FOR A FEW MORE HOURS.

244
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

245
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,000
SHE CAN BE SO BOSSY. AND BOY,
DOES SHE LOVE TO SHOP.

246
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,875
YOU ENJOYED FANTASYLAND
A LOT MORE

247
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,208
THAN YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD,
DIDN'T YOU, ASAHINA?

248
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,041
- UH... WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

249
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,958
- OH, NOTHING.
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

250
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,375
- WELL, COME ON, LET'S GO.
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

251
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,000
THIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS ENDS UP

252
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,958
EVERY TIME I GO
OUT WITH ASAHINA.

253
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,291
THESE LOOK PRETTY TASTY,
DON'T THEY?

254
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,208
- NO. THEY'RE TOO BLAND
AND DRY FOR ME.

255
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,875
- SHE DRAGS ME ALL OVER
THE PLACE ASKING MY OPINION,

256
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,250
BUT SHE NEVER TAKES IT.

257
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,416
- THIS LOOKS JUST LIKE GORO.

258
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,916
FAT AND UGLY. ( chuckles )

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,166
- I GUESS I'LL ALWAYS
JUST BE HER FRIEND.

260
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,875
- ( gasps )

261
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,750
LOOK, YAMATO.
IT STOPPED RAINING.

262
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,791
- AH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

263
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,958
I WISH IT COULD HAVE
STOPPED EARLIER.

264
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,291
- LET'S GO. THEY MIGHT
HAVE THE PARADE AFTER ALL.

265
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,625
- YEAH. SURE.

266
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,250
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
- UH-HUH.

267
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,333
SHE'S STILL HOLDING MY HAND.

268
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,166
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

269
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,583
THE MORE I'M AROUND HER,
THE MORE I LIKE HER.

270
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,291
MAYBE THINGS SHOULD STAY
JUST AS THEY ARE NOW.

271
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,583
IF I TELL HER
HOW I REALLY FEEL,

272
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,875
IT COULD DESTROY
THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE.

273
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,916
I WISH WE COULD JUST
STAND HERE FOREVER.

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,541
I DON'T WANT THIS MOMENT
TO EVER END.

275
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,541
I, UH...

276
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,833
I REALLY LIKE YOU, ASAHINA.

277
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,708
- TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.

278
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,500
YOU'RE SETTING ME UP FOR
A PRACTICAL JOKE, AREN'T YOU?

279
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,625
- MM...
- AM I RIGHT?

280
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,250
- NO, I... I DON'T KNOW.

281
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,375
THIS IS HORRIBLE.
WHAT AM I DOING?

282
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,916
I CAN PLAY THIS OFF AS A JOKE.

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,083
IF I DO, MAYBE THINGS
WILL STAY THE SAME, BUT...

284
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,958
IT'S NOT A JOKE!
I'M BEING COMPLETELY SERIOUS.

285
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,708
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU FOREVER.

286
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,791
BUT I... I...

287
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,375
I WANT TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND, ASAHINA.

288
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,833
- I... I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT TO SAY.

289
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,583
WE HAVEN'T EVEN KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR VERY LONG.

290
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,375
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

291
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,833
- SO, THEN, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

292
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,291
I'M SORRY.

293
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,375
- ( fireworks exploding )

294
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,791
- ( chuckles awkwardly )
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

295
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,041
YOU JUST PRETEND
I NEVER SAID IT.

296
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,875
WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS,
CAN'T WE?

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,541
- I'M NOT SURE.

298
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,291
- WE SHOULD HEAD BACK THEN.

299
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,250
YOU'VE GOT
AN EARLY PRACTICE TOMORROW.

300
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,000
- YAMATO, WAIT. I'LL TAKE THAT.

301
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,916
- I... DON'T MIND.
I'LL CARRY IT.

302
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,875
- BUT YOU... DON'T HAVE TO.

303
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,583
- WELL, OKAY.

304
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,333
- WELL, GOOD NIGHT THEN.

305
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,166
- GOOD NIGHT THEN.
- ( door opens )

306
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,458
- I BLEW IT.

307
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,125
- WELCOME BACK.
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

308
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,125
- HMM.

309
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,083
I THOUGHT I LOCKED THE DOOR.

310
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,875
- SO, I SEE YOU GOT
A NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTION.

311
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,958
- YEAH, SO?

312
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,083
- I BET YOU JUST LOOK AT THE TV
SCHEDULES AND THE SPORTS.

313
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,458
I'M RIGHT, AREN'T I?

314
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,916
- SHUT UP.

315
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:20,333
SO TONIGHT I, UH, WENT TO THE
AMUSEMENT PARK WITH ASAHINA.

316
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,041
- COOL.

317
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:22,875
- WHEN I FINALLY WORKED
UP THE NERVE

318
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,833
TO ASK HER TO GO WITH ME,

319
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,041
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?

320
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,166
- NO, WHAT?

321
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,208
- "I CAN GO WITH YOU
IF YOU WANT."

322
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,500
PLEASE...

323
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,541
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST
SAY SHE WANTED TO GO

324
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,041
INSTEAD OF BEING SO DIFFICULT?

325
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,000
WHEN WE GOT THERE,
IT STARTED RAINING

326
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,000
AND SHE ACTED LIKE I CAUSED
THE PARADE TO BE CANCELED.

327
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,291
LIKE I HAVE CONTROL OF THE RAIN.

328
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,250
SO, THEN SHE DECIDED SHE'D HAD
ENOUGH AND WANTED TO GO HOME,

329
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,000
BUT ONLY AFTER WE RODE
AN INDOOR ROLLER COASTER.

330
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,541
I THOUGHT, "WHAT'S THE POINT?
LET'S JUST LEAVE NOW."

331
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,416
THEN AFTER THE ROLLER
COASTER, SHE'S LIKE,

332
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,375
"LET'S GO RIDE MORE
RIDES, YAMATO!"

333
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,708
WHATEVER.

334
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,916
OH, AND THEN SHE
MADE ME FOLLOW HER

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,875
ALL OVER THE PLACE SHOPPING.
JUST LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES.

336
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,000
AND WHEN THE RAIN
FINALLY STOPPED,

337
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,500
SHE WANTED TO GO SEE THE PARADE.

338
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,083
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT PARADES, ANYWAY?

339
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,833
JUST A BUNCH OF UGLY COSTUMES
AND GAUDY FLOATS.

340
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,083
BUT SHE SAID IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

341
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,458
( sobbing )

342
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,541
- WELL, I GOTTA GO.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

343
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,166
OH, YEAH. I, UH, GOT THESE
AT THE TRAIN STATION.

344
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,666
YOU CAN HAVE 'EM.

345
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,583
LATER, MAN. DON'T FORGET
TO LOCK THE DOOR.

346
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,333
( door opens and closes )

347
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,416
- I DON'T NEED THESE.

348
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,875
( sobbing ) I DON'T NEED 'EM,
YOU IDIOT.

349
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,125
- WELL, HANG IN THERE.

350
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,750
- Man on television:
UH-OH. LOOKS LIKE SHE'S IN

351
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,000
A BIT OF TROUBLE NOW.
OH, BUT SHE'S GONNA TRY IT.

352
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,791
HERE SHE GOES.

353
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,166
I DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS
ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE IT, FOLKS.

354
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,708
YES, THERE SHE GOES.

355
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,958
- ( crying )
I CAN'T STOP. I CAN'T.

356
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

357
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,958
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

358
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,666
