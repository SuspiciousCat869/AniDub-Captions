26
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,333
AS ANY MORE THAN JUST A FRIEND.

27
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,000
BUT THE GIRL WHO IS STANDING
IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW

28
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,916
IS DEFINITELY, WITHOUT A
DOUBT, MORE BEAUTIFUL

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,583
THAN ANYONE ELSE I CAN THINK OF.

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,791
- Honoka: IS THIS OKAY?

31
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,125
I MEAN, I KNOW WE'RE NOT...
YOU KNOW.

32
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,833
- Yamato: BUT WE SHOULD!
BE MY GIRLFRIEND!

33
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,125
WOW. THAT WAS PROBABLY
TOO FORWARD, HUH? I'M SORRY.

34
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,541
- Honoka: NO. IT WAS NICE.

35
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,500
YOU'VE MADE ME SO HAPPY.

36
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,333
FINALLY, HE FEELS THE SAME WAY.

37
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,041
- WELL GOOD. I'M GLAD.

38
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,333
- YIKES!

39
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,291
OH, MY GOSH! DID I
REALLY JUST SEE THAT?

40
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,875
- THIS IS SO RELAXING!

41
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,500
- THIS PLACE IS SO WARM.
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

42
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,958
- IT'S SO NICE NOT TO FEEL
WORN OUT AFTER PRACTICE.

43
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,500
- YEAH, REALLY.

44
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,291
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

45
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,458
WOULD IT HELP OR JUST
MAKE THINGS WORSE

46
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,791
IF I TELL HER WHAT I SAW?

47
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,875
- I'M HAVING SUCH A WONDERFUL
TIME! AREN'T YOU?

48
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,958
AND MY SKIN FEELS SO SMOOTH!
I LOVE HOT SPRINGS.

49
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,541
- SUZUKA, CAN WE TALK?

50
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,333
- ALRIGHT! AN OPEN-AIR BATH!

51
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,166
- ( screams happily )

52
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,458
- ( water splashes )

53
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,041
- UGH! SERIOUSLY. GROW UP.

54
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,000
- MY GOODNESS, HE SEEMS HAPPIER.

55
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,875
- BUT STILL, THAT DOESN'T
GIVE HIM THE RIGHT

56
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,250
TO BE SO OBNOXIOUS
WHILE TAKING A BATH.

57
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,958
- THIS IS SO HARD.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

58
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,416
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T TELL HER.

59
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,666
AAH! THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING!

60
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,875
- ( insects chirping )

61
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,750
- HEY.

62
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,833
YOU SEEM UNUSUALLY
RELAXED THIS MORNING.

63
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,958
- YEAH. THE SENIORS ARE GOING
BACK HOME TODAY.

64
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,250
INTER-HIGH IS FINALLY OVER.

65
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,875
EVEN THOUGH WE STILL
HAVE TRAINING.

66
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,458
BUT THAT DOESN'T START
'TIL THIS AFTERNOON, SO...

67
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,166
WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

68
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,208
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE LEAVING.
- I CANNOT RETURN

69
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,083
A FAILURE. I NEED TO GET AT
LEAST ONE GIRL'S NUMBER.

70
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,208
- I SEE.

71
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,666
- Suzuka: YAMATO!

72
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,791
OH GOOD. HERE YOU ARE. I WANNA
GO SHOPPING. COME ON.

73
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,458
DON'T YOU WANT SOME SOUVENIRS?

74
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,875
- YOU'RE FREE, RIGHT?
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YA.

75
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,000
- UH, I'M SORRY. I'M ACTUALLY
KINDA TIRED. I THINK I'LL PASS.

76
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,875
- DON'T BE SUCH A JERK! IT'S
NOT GONNA TAKE THAT LONG!

77
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,000
- I'M SORRY.

78
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,041
- OKAY FINE! I'LL JUST
GO WITH MIKI.

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,000
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
YOU OKAY?

80
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,208
- I'M FINE.

81
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,833
- REALLY? ALRIGHT,
NEVER MIND THEN.

82
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,375
SO, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANNA TELL ME?

83
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,666
- NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE'S NOT, OKAY?

84
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,333
- OKAY.

85
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,625
- SUZUKA, WAIT UP!

86
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,750
AREN'T YOU BROKE, YET?

87
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,166
- JUST ONE MORE STORE.

88
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,500
- WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

89
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,416
I CAN UNDERSTAND WANTING TO GET
MOMIJI BEAN JAM CAKES.

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,000
BUT WHY PUYOMAN?

91
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,666
- IT'S A HIROSHIMA SPECIALTY.

92
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
DON'T KNOW THAT.

93
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,583
- SORRY, I CAN'T KEEP UP. THIS
IS NEVER GONNA END, IS IT?

94
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,125
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA BUY MORE?

95
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,458
- HEY, WHADDAYA THINK?
THE SHIRT.

96
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,458
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING
YAMATO WOULD WEAR?

97
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,583
OH, BUT IT'S A MEDIUM.

98
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,958
THAT FIGURES. HIS SHOULDERS ARE
SURPRISINGLY WIDER THAN THIS.

99
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,708
- SUZUKA...

100
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,208
- I'M NOT GONNA BUY IT FOR HIM
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

101
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,875
THAT CREEP DIDN'T EVEN
WANNA COME WITH ME.

102
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,833
WHY SHOULD I DO ANYTHING
NICE FOR HIM?

103
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,541
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

104
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,625
- WELL, WHAT THEN?

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,541
- WELL, AKITSUKI

106
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,750
AND SAKURAI ARE
SEEING EACH OTHER.

107
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,250
I OVERHEARD THEM TALKING
YESTERDAY BY THE POND.

108
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,083
- THAT'S GREAT.

109
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,791
- ( wind howling )

110
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,416
- ( panting )

111
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,375
- GOOD WORK TODAY, AKITSUKI!

112
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,083
- OH, THANK YOU!

113
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,375
- THANKS!

114
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,875
- HEY! CAN I GET A TOWEL PLEASE?

115
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,958
- ABSOLUTELY!

116
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,583
- IT'S LATE. I'M SORRY
FOR GETTING YOU OUT.

117
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,916
YOU MUST BE REALLY
TIRED FROM PRACTICE.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,125
- NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M
PRETTY USED TO IT.

119
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,291
- THAT'S COOL.
- YEAH.

120
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,125
- I JUST... I REALLY WANTED SOME
TIME ALONE WITH YOU TONIGHT.

121
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,958
LOOK, THE MOON.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

122
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,166
- YEAH, IT IS.

123
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,000
- AKITSUKI, CAN I
TELL YOU SOMETHING?

124
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,291
SINCE WE'RE ALREADY
SEEING EACH OTHER,

125
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,208
I GUESS IT'S OKAY TO SAY THIS.

126
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,250
REMEMBER WHEN WE MET?

127
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,791
AFTER YOU HELPED
ME FIX THAT BELL,

128
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,750
I WOULD WAIT FOR YOU
TO RETURN EVERY YEAR,

129
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,375
AND THEN I WOULD SECRETLY
WATCH YOU UNTIL YOU LEFT.

130
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,166
I KNOW IT SOUNDS KIND OF WEIRD,

131
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,125
BUT I ALWAYS DREAMT ABOUT
HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE

132
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,125
IF THE TWO OF US COULD
TALK TOGETHER LIKE THIS.

133
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,541
SO WHEN I FOUND OUT YOU WERE
TAKING THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAM,

134
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,208
I WAS SO SURPRISED.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!

135
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,333
WHEN WE ENDED UP
IN THE SAME CLASS,

136
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,000
I'D BEEN THINKING ABOUT
YOU FOR SO LONG

137
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,083
THAT I JUST TALKED TO YOU
LIKE YOU KNEW ME, TOO.

138
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,583
- OH. THAT MAKES SENSE NOW.

139
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,666
YEAH, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU
UNTIL YOU MENTIONED THE SHRINE.

140
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,791
- I BET YOU THOUGHT I
WAS KIND OF WEIRD, HUH?

141
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
- WELL, KIND OF.

142
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,916
- I KNEW IT.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,916
- WHAT? NO! I WAS JUST
KIDDING! IT WAS A JOKE!

144
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,458
- THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

145
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,083
I ONLY JOINED THE TRACK
TEAM BECAUSE YOU JOINED.

146
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,500
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,416
- YEAH I WANTED TO BE AROUND
YOU AS MUCH AS I COULD.

148
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,458
BECAUSE...

149
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,541
I REALLY LIKED YOU.

150
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:19,458
OH AKITSUKI, I WISH MOMENTS LIKE
THESE COULD GO ON FOREVER!

151
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,791
- REALLY? YOU DO? I FEEL
THE SAME WAY, ACTUALLY.

152
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,125
- I'M GLAD.

153
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,500
- IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THIS
FEELING COULD LAST FOREVER.

154
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,833
- ( birds chirping )

155
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,333
- YOU'RE STILL HERE, HATTORI?

156
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,791
- YEAH, I GUESS I AM.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

157
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,250
- NO, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM,
IT'S JUST WEIRD...

158
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,916
I MEAN YOU'RE NOT
EVEN IN TRACK.

159
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,125
- WHATEVER. WHAT DO YOU CARE?

160
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,958
YAMATO SEEMS TO BE
DOING WELL FOR HIMSELF.

161
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,833
I SURE WISH I COULD
SCORE LIKE THAT.

162
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,416
I GUESS HE'S REALLY HITTING
IT OFF WITH SAKURAI.

163
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,166
GOOD FOR HIM.

164
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
- YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?

165
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,958
- YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

166
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,666
YOU'D THINK WE WERE
FRIENDS OR SOMETHING.

167
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,833
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
STOP HIM, SMART ASS?

168
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,625
DON'T YOU THINK
HE'S BEING A JERK?

169
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,375
ALL THIS TIME HE'S BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH HE LIKES SUZUKA

170
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,500
AND NOW HE'S DATING SAKURAI
RANDOMLY? THAT'S STUPID.

171
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,458
- IT HAPPENS.

172
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,000
PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

173
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,708
- WHAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT.

174
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,416
HE'S NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT
HOW SUZUKA MIGHT FEEL.

175
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,708
- WHAT ABOUT THEM?

176
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,500
WHAT ABOUT HOW SAKURAI
AND YAMATO FEEL, HUH?

177
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,750
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,
SAKURAI'S LIKED YAMATO

178
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,875
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

179
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,750
DON'T YOU THINK SHE'D BE A
LITTLE UPSET IF THEY SPLIT UP?

180
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,458
- I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.

181
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,833
- I'VE LEARNED THAT THERE AREN'T
ANY RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS

182
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,708
WHEN IT COMES TO WHO YOU LOVE.

183
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,666
IF WE'RE NOT INVOLVED, I THINK
WE SHOULD JUST LET IT ALONE.

184
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,791
- BUT, HEY!

185
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,291
- ( upbeat music playing )

186
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,500
- SET...

187
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,791
ALRIGHT! THAT'S
ALL FOR TODAY!

188
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,208
- All: GO TEAM!

189
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,708
- THIS IS CRAZY! WHY AM I THE
ONLY ONE WITH A SPECIAL PROGRAM?

190
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,833
- ( groans )

191
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,208
- MAN THIS REALLY SUCKS!

192
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,875
PLEASE LET ME FINISH EARLY
SO THAT I CAN GO HOME!

193
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,958
- HEY, SLACKER.

194
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,458
- ASAHINA...

195
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,166
- GREAT JOB. YOUR
FORM'S GOTTEN LAZY.

196
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA IMPROVE
YOUR TIME LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW.

197
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,875
- YEAH. I KNOW.

198
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,208
- OH, REALLY?

199
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,291
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW
MANY TIMES I TELL YOU.

200
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,666
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.
YOU REALLY NEED TO SHAPE UP.

201
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,666
- I KNOW I DO, OKAY!

202
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,416
- HEY.

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,625
- NOW WHAT? AM I SITTING WRONG?

204
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,875
- NO. IT'S NOT THAT. IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU'RE DATING HONOKA?

205
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,875
- OH, WELL, I...

206
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,333
YEAH. WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER.

207
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,833
- WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

208
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,125
- HUH?

209
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,500
- YEAH, I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D
ACTUALLY HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

210
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,833
SO I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED.

211
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,583
BUT GOOD FOR YOU. JUST
DON'T SCREW IT UP, OKAY?

212
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,791
- YEAH, OKAY.

213
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
- SO HAVE YOU DONE IT, YET?

214
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,375
STRETCHING. WHAT DID
YOU THINK I MEANT?

215
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,708
I'LL PUSH FOR YOU.

216
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,375
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

217
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,708
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE FOUND OUT
ABOUT HONOKA AND I GOING OUT,

218
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,500
BUT EVEN THOUGH SHE KNOWS,

219
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,291
ASAHINA IS STILL HER
NORMAL SELF.

220
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,291
- MAN, YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN DOING THIS RIGHT.

221
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,458
-SHUT UP! GEEZ!

222
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,083
SHE'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

223
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,000
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

224
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,750
- SUZUKA? YOU'RE STILL UP?
IT'S LATE.

225
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,791
- I KNOW.

226
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,875
- YOU NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP.

227
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,958
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO TOKYO TOMORROW.

228
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,500
- OKAY.

229
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,541
- THAT'S IT.
TRAINING CAMP IS OVER.

230
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,750
- MAN, THAT'S STRANGE.

231
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,916
- SO WHERE EXACTLY IS THIS
OKONOMIYAKI RESTAURANT?

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,125
- IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE
JUST WALKING IN CIRCLES.

233
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,000
- WE'RE NOT. JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE, OKAY?

234
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,666
- MAN, I DON'T CARE
WHERE WE EAT.

235
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,166
EVERYTHING HERE TASTES
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ANYWAY.

236
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,708
- NO IT DOESN'T, SHUT UP!

237
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,125
THERE'S A SUBTLE
DIFFERENCE IN TASTE

238
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,500
DEPENDING ON WHICH
RESTAURANT YOU GO TO.

239
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,666
- YOU WANT US TO TRUST YOU

240
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,666
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE GUIDEBOOK?

241
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,250
- AKITSUKI, JUST TAKE YOUR
TIME, OKAY? YOU'LL FIND ONE.

242
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,125
- THANKS. CAPTAIN,
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

243
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,666
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WANTED TO GO TO

244
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,125
THE "BEST OKONOMIYAKI
RESTAURANT IN HIROSHIMA."

245
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,791
- HEY, HEY! DON'T YOU
BLAME THIS ON ME!

246
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,000
- I JUST HOPE
WE GET TO EAT

247
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,291
BEFORE IT'S TIME FOR
US TO HEAD BACK HOME.

248
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,791
- I'M STARVING!

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,041
- THERE YOU ARE!

250
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,125
HERE YOU GO.

251
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,708
SO, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH US

252
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,958
NOT GOING WITH
THE GUYS' GROUP?

253
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,041
- YEAH, I'M SURE. THEY WOULD'VE
BEEN TOO NOISY ANYWAY.

254
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:16,125
- I KNEW IT. YOU'RE TIRED. YOU
DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH LAST NIGHT?

255
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,708
ARE YOU OKAY? WERE YOU
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING?

256
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,375
- NOT REALLY.
BUT, THE MOON WAS PRETTY.

257
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,291
- THIS SUCKS!

258
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,708
- HEY, AKITSUKI. WOULD
YOU MIND EXPLAINING WHY

259
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,250
I CAME ALL THE WAY
OUT TO HIROSHIMA

260
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,708
TO EAT RAMEN NOODLES?

261
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,250
- I'M SORRY, OKAY? I DIDN'T
MEAN TO RUIN YOUR STAY.

262
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,791
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT
ALL THE RESTAURANTS

263
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,583
WERE SO FULL WE COULDN'T GET IN.

264
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,833
- WELL, I THOUGHT THE FOOD WE
HAD WAS DELICIOUS, AKITSUKI!

265
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,625
- THANKS, HONOKA.

266
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,916
- OH! I ALMOST FORGOT!

267
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,833
I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

268
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,541
- DO YOU PUT THAT
ON A CELL PHONE?

269
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,625
- THEY MATCH. SEE?

270
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,291
- HEY, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
THANKS A LOT, HONOKA.

271
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,916
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING UP THERE?

272
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,166
THIS SUCKS. MY PICK UP SCORE
FOR THIS TRIP IS ZERO.

273
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,375
GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HAVING
SUCH A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,458
- Announcer: NOZOMI,
DEPARTING AT 19:30

275
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:30,041
WILL BE THE LAST
TRAIN FOR TOKYO.

276
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:35,333
- LISTEN UP! IS EVERYONE ON
BOARD? IS THERE ANYONE MISSING?

277
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,750
- I'M GOING TO THE
RESTROOM. BE BACK.

278
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:39,833
- OKAY.

279
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
- HATTORI, WHERE'S AKITSUKI?

280
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,416
- Uh, I THINK HE SAID HE
WAS GONNA GET

281
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
SOME JUICE OR SOMETHING.

282
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,375
- THAT FIGURES.

283
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,458
WOULD IT'VE BEEN SO DIFFICULT
FOR HIM TO STAY WITH THE GROUP?

284
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,708
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN SO EXPENSIVE
TO GET THIS ON THE TRAIN.

285
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,458
STUDENTS COULD NEVER AFFORD IT.

286
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,708
EVEN SO, I GOT EVERYONE'S DRINK
ORDER. AM I GENEROUS OR WHAT?

287
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,750
- YAMATO?

288
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,208
- ASAHINA! HOW ARE...

289
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,916
- OH, MY GOSH! WHAT'RE
YOU DOING OUT HERE?

290
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,708
- I'M SORRY!

291
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,375
- OH GREAT. GEEZ! IF WE DON'T
GET BACK ON THE TRAIN SOON,

292
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,458
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET BACK HOME!

293
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,875
- ( train bell rings )

294
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,500
- SO YOU BETTER HURRY IT UP!

295
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,500
- WHAT'S TAKING HER SO LONG?

296
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,083
DID SHE FALL ASLEEP IN THE
RESTROOM OR SOMETHING?

297
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,208
- WHAT THE...

298
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,041
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

299
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,875
OH, MY GOSH, YOU TOTALLY
MISSED THE TRAIN!

300
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,333
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO THE RESTROOM!

301
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,875
- WHAT NOW?

302
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,708
- WHAT?

303
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,791
- BUT I SAW BOTH OF
'EM GET ON THE TRAIN!

304
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,083
- YEAH. BUT THEN THEY GOT
OFF AGAIN AND MISSED IT.

305
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,416
- AW, MAN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?

306
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,583
OKAY. CAN YOU TRY CALLING
ASAHINA ON HER CELL PHONE?

307
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,708
- SURE.

308
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,208
-WHY IS AKITSUKI WITH ASAHINA?

309
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,208

I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,583
THERE MAY BE SOME LATE NIGHT
BUSES DEPARTING SOON

334
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,166
IF YOU WANNA TRY
THE BUS STATION.

- YEAH, I'M SORRY
THEY'RE ALL FULL.

336

THEY FILL UP EARLY
DURING THIS SEASON,

337
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,416

TO MAKE A RESERVATION.

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY'RE ALL FULL?

339
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,958
WHAT IF WE WAIT FOR
SOMEONE TO CANCEL?

340
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,000
- YOU CAN DO THAT I SUPPOSE.

341
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,125
BUT THAT'S THE CANCELLATION
LINE OVER THERE

342
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN WAITING FOR A WHILE.

343
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,500
- I SEE. THEY TOLD ME THE
SAME THING OVER HERE.

344
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,750
ALRIGHT. WELL, I'LL DISCUSS
THIS WITH THE TEACHER

345
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,416
AND GET BACK TO YOU. DON'T GO
WANDERING AROUND TOO MUCH.

346
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,041
TALK TO YOU LATER. BYE.

347
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,875

348
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,541

350
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,041
