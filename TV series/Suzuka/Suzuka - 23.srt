- Yamato: I'M NOT GOING
TO HOLD BACK ANYMORE.

26
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,000
I'M GONNA BE THE NUMBER ONE
SPRINTER IN JAPAN!

27
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,458
JUST YOU WAIT!

28
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,625
- WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE
ACTING ALL DEPRESSED?

29
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,916
SHOULDN'T YOU BE CELEBRATING?
YOU'VE BEEN NAMED NUMBER ONE

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,125
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

31
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,375
- I'M NOT ANYMORE.

32
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,583
LOOK.

33
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,916
- ( papers rustling )

34
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,416
- SECOND PLACE?

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,583
- MY TIME WAS 10.68.

36
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,375
EMERSON'S WAS 10.50.

37
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,375
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT BASTARD
PULLED AWAY FROM ME SO EASILY.

38
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,833
- MAYBE HE JUST...

39
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,791
WELL, YOU DID PLACE SECOND,
YOU KNOW. DON'T FORGET,

40
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,750
YOU STILL QUALIFY FOR
THE METROPOLITAN MEET.

41
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,791
- SECOND OR THIRD PLACE
MEANS NOTHING TO ME!

42
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,458
I JUST...

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,208
I WANT TO WIN FIRST PLACE!

44
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,791
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

45
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,541
WHY IS HE SO SERIOUS
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

46
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,375
- YEAH!

47
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,958
- AKITSUKI! YOU GOT A MINUTE?
- HUH?

48
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,416
- YOU SAID YOU FELT LIKE YOU
WERE LOSING YOUR TOP SPEED

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,333
TOWARD THE SECOND HALF OF
THE HUNDRED-METER RUN,

50
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,458
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- UH, YEAH.

51
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,750
- I DID SOME RESEARCH
TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHY.

52
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,250
- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
- HMM.

53
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,625
WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?

54
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,458
- IT SHOWS THE STATS
FOR YOU AND ARIMA

55
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,291
AT TWENTY-METER CHECKPOINTS.

56
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,166
THE RED LINE IS YOU.

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,666
THE BLUE CURVE IS ARIMA

58
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,583
AND THE BLACK IS FOR THE NUMBER
ONE SPRINTER IN THE WORLD.

59
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,166
EVEN THOUGH THE TIMES
ARE DIFFERENT,

60
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,000
THE CURVE IS PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME.

61
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,291
ACCORDING TO THAT GRAPH,
ARIMA'S RUNNING STYLE

62
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,625
GIVES HIM THE POTENTIAL
TO BECOME NUMBER ONE.

63
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,083
- IN THE WORLD?

64
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,125
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE RED CURVE, WHICH IS YOU,

65
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,875
SHOWS THAT YOUR TOP SPEED IS
ALMOST THE SAME AS ARIMA'S.

66
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,708
BUT SINCE YOU REACH IT
EARLIER IN THE RACE,

67
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,583
YOU TEND TO LOSE SPEED
AS THE FINISH LINE GETS CLOSER.

68
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,416
- OH. OKAY, I GET IT.

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,041
SO I JUST NEED TO EXTEND THE
TIME THAT I RUN AT TOP SPEED.

70
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,750
THAT SHOULD BE EASY,
SHOULDN'T IT?

71
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,708
- WELL, NO, NOT EXACTLY.

72
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,250
IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

73
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,583
THE LONGEST A HUMAN CAN RUN
AT TOP SPEED IS SIX SECONDS.

74
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,000
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT I'M NEVER

75
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,625
GOING TO BE ABLE
TO BEAT THIS GUY?

76
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,833
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

77
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,500
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T INCREASE
THE TIME YOU STAY AT TOP SPEED,

78
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,875
YOU CAN TRAIN TO REACH YOUR PEAK
LATER IN THE RACE.

79
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,416
IF YOU CONTROL YOUR UPPER BODY
IN THE FIRST HALF,

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,375
AND THEN TAKE
YOUR TIME ACCELERATING,

81
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,541
IT MAY HELP YOU NOT TO TURN UP
THE SPEED SO SOON.

82
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,500
- IF I DO ALL THAT,
WILL I BE ABLE TO INCREASE

83
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,083
MY OVERALL SPEED?
- WELL, YES, MOST LIKELY.

84
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,125
SPEED IS ONE THING,

85
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,166
BUT CHANGING YOUR RUNNING STYLE
MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT.

86
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,333
- ( men panting )

87
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,750
WE DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF TIME

88
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,750
BEFORE THE METROPOLITAN MEET.

89
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,125
I THINK IT MAY BE BEST JUST TO
LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE.

90
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,250
- NO, I CAN DO IT.

91
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,833
- ALL RIGHT.

92
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,791
THEN I'LL START WORKING
ON YOUR NEW TRAINING REGIMEN

93
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,666
AND YOU CAN BEGIN TODAY.

94
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,125
SO I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU AFTER
YOU FINISH YOUR INTERVALS THEN.

95
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,583
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP!

96
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,083
ALL RIGHT!

97
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,500
ASAHINA!

98
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,375
I FIGURED OUT THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION I ASKED YOU!

99
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,833
- OH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

100
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,583
- WHEN I TOLD YOU I LOST
MY SPEED IN THE SECOND HALF

101
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,000
OF THE HUNDRED-METER RUN?
- YEAH.

102
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,958
I THINK I REMEMBER
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

103
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,625
I FIGURED OUT THAT IT ALL HAD TO
DO WITH MY RUNNING STYLE.

104
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,291
If I JUST MAKE A FEW
SMALL CHANGES,

105
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,750
I'LL BE ABLE TO GO EVEN FASTER.

106
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,875
- IS THAT SO?

107
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,458
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
RIGHT TO ME.

108
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,458
- WELL, IT'S TRUE, ASAHINA.
MIYAMOTO SEMPAI TOLD ME SO.

109
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,625
- EVEN SO...

110
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,041
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE METROPOLITAN.

111
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,416
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S SMART
TO CHANGE YOUR RUNNING STYLE

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,041
AT THIS POINT?

113
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,666
BESIDES, YOU NEED
A LOT MORE PRACTICE

114
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,458
THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON, YAMATO.

115
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,291
I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT.

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,458
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

117
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,541
YOU'RE SO WEIRD.

118
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,083
HEY...

119
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,833
- JUST SHUT UP!
LEAVE ME ALONE, YOU IDIOT!

120
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,000
RUN WHICHEVER WAY YOU LIKE!

121
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,000
THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH ME!

122
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,666
- HEY! ASAHINA, WAIT!

123
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,291
GEEZ... WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

124
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,750
- ( grunting )

125
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,875
- AH!

126
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,666
- IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S
WORKING HARD.

127
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,750
- SET!

128
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,208
GO!

129
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,458
- Kinugasa: ALL RIGHT!
THREE MINUTE BREAK!

130
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,083
- ( panting )

131
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,166
THIS... SUCKS!

132
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,666
- HOLD ON! TOWEL?
- Kinugasa: HEY THERE, AKITSUKI!

133
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,250
YOUR STAMINA IS PATHETIC!

134
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,250
YOU CAN'T ALREADY BE WORN OUT
FROM THAT WUSSY TRAINING!

135
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,458
AND DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT THAT
LITTLE GIRLIE STUNT YOU PULLED

136
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,708
IN THE RELAY!
YOU ALMOST KILLED US!

137
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,875
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR YOU
THAT THE TEAM STILL QUALIFIED

138
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,958
FOR THE METROPOLITAN!

139
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,208
- WILL YOU LET GO, PLEASE?
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

140
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,000
- WELL, AT LEAST HE MANAGED TO
PASS THE BATON, RIGHT, AKITSUKI?

141
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,916
- UH, YEAH.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,166
- I'M SURE I HAD A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT.

143
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,833
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

144
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,458
- UH... HEH.

145
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,250
- OH, NOTHING REALLY.

146
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,250
- Yamato: IF I'M GOING TO BEAT
ARIMA IN THE RELAY RACE,

147
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,041
I HAVE TO CHANGE
MY RUNNING STYLE.

148
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,000
- Hashiba: THAT'S RIGHT!

149
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,208
- Kinugasa: WELL, THEN YOU NEED
TO PRACTICE MORE, DON'T YA?

150
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,333
- Yamato: YES, SIR!

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,208
( laughing )

152
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,833
- ( bird squawking )

153
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,583
I WONDER IF AKITSUKI HAS BEEN
PRACTICING THIS WHOLE TIME.

154
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,708
- ( Yamato panting )

155
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,958
- 11.23 SECONDS!

156
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,083
- DAMN IT!

157
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,833
JUST GREAT!

158
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,208
MY TIME ISN'T
IMPROVING AT ALL.

159
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,708
- WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

160
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,833
DO YOU REALIZE HOW LONG
YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING OUT HERE?

161
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,375
I THINK WE
BETTER STOP NOW.

162
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,875
- NO, LET ME JUST RUN IT
ONE MORE TIME. PLEASE?

163
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,375
- WELL...

164
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,541
OKAY, I GUESS ONE MORE
TIME WON'T HURT.

165
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,375
- THANKS. I'M SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

166
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,375
I JUST DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE
I CAN TURN TO.

167
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY APOLOGIZING
BECAUSE YOU ASKED FOR HELP?

168
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,500
- YEAH. I GUESS SO.

169
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,666
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS IT.
THE LAST ROUND.

170
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,916
- ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,625
- I SEEMS LIKE I'M TALKING TO
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON.

172
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,791
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUY

173
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,291
WHO COULD NEVER
HOLD ON TO THE BATON?

174
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,708
- I DON'T KNOW.

175
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,583
I DON'T FEEL DIFFERENT. MAYBE
IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE A GOAL NOW.

176
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,791
- A GOAL?

177
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,458
- YEAH.

178
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,458
I'M DETERMINED TO BEAT ARIMA

179
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,750
AND BECOME NUMBER ONE IN JAPAN.

180
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,333
- WELL, GREAT! I THINK
YOU CAN DO IT.

181
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,875
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN YOU.

182
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,208
WHAT I DON'T GET IS
WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM.

183
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,583
WHY NOW?

184
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,375
- I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

185
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,291
- YOU STILL LIKE SUZUKA,
DON'T YOU?

186
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,083
AM I RIGHT?

187
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,166
- YEAH.

188
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,458
AND I PLAN TO TELL HER
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL

189
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,916
AFTER I BECOME THE NUMBER ONE
SPRINTER IN JAPAN.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
- HUH?

191
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,250
BECOMING NUMBER ONE
ISN'T GONNA CHANGE

192
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,708
HOW SUZUKA FEELS ABOUT YOU.

193
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,041
SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU
BECAUSE OF HOW FAST YOU CAN RUN.

194
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,083
- I KNOW THAT.

195
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,166
I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT
ASAHINA WAS SUPERFICIAL.

196
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,333
IT WOULD JUST HELP ME FEEL
MORE CONFIDENT, THAT'S ALL.

197
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:51,375
I FEEL LIKE I WON'T BE SATISFIED
WITH MYSELF IF I CAN'T DO IT.

198
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,791
I'M TIRED OF NOT FEELING WORTHY.
I WANNA BE HER EQUAL.

199
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,916
- I SEE.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,666
WELL THEN, I DON'T
WANNA BE INVOLVED.

201
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,250
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING
I'VE EVER HEARD YOU SAY.

202
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,958
- HASHIBA.

203
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,041
- YOU SHOULD PAY ME BACK
FOR ALL THE TROUBLE.

204
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,750
TAKE ME TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

205
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,208
- ABSOLUTELY!

206
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,250
HOW 'BOUT WE GO TO THE
OKONOMIYAKI PLACE AFTER THIS?

207
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
- NOPE! SOMETHING
MORE EXPENSIVE.

208
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,083
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO TO ME?

209
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,166
- YAKINIKU!
- YAKINIKU?

210
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,416
- COME ON! WHO DOESN'T LIKE
KOREAN BARBEQUE?

211
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,666
- OKAY, FINE.

212
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,125
- SO AKITSUKI IS DOING
ALL OF THIS FOR ASAHINA.

213
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,958
- DO YOU THINK YAMATO IS STILL
OUT THERE PRACTICING?

214
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,541
- HE SAID THE COMPETITION
WAS COMING UP SOON.

215
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,291
SO I GUESS HE IS.

216
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,583
- IT'S SO UNUSUAL TO SEE HIM
WORKING THIS HARD FOR ANYTHING.

217
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,083
I THINK I WANNA DO SOMETHING
NICE TO SUPPORT HIM.

218
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,416
- ME, TOO.

219
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,125
I THINK I'LL MAKE
SOMETHING DELICIOUS FOR HIM

220
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,916
TO EAT BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,125
WHAT DO YOU THINK, SUZUKA?

222
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,791
- AH... SURE.

223
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,375
- I WONDER WHAT HE WOULD LIKE.

224
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,833
- DON'T YOU THINK HE'D WANT
SOMETHING RICH AND HEARTY?

225
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,125
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR DINNER.

226
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,625
- OH, DID YOU GET ENOUGH TO EAT?

227
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,583
- ( water running )

228
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,416
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM?

229
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,583
- I JUST... I WANNA BE THE
NUMBER ONE SPRINTER IN JAPAN!

230
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,083
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,875
- Honoka: NANA? IT'S ME.

232
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,250
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
I KNOW YOU MUST BE REALLY BUSY.

233
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,625
ARE YOU WORKING?
DID I CATCH YOU AT A BAD TIME?

234
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,500
- UH-HUH, NOT AT ALL.

235
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,958
IS SOMETHING WRONG, HONOKA?

236
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,625
- KINDA. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

237
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,125
- OF COURSE.

238
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,541
IS THIS ABOUT YAMATO?

239
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,416
- YEAH.

240
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,083
- I'M COMING OVER
TO SEE YOU, OKAY?

241
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,166
- I'M SO SORRY.
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.

242
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,708
- STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT.

243
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,500
THIS WAS ON MY WAY BACK
HOME ANYWAY.

244
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,166
BESIDES, I'VE BEEN
SO BUSY LATELY

245
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,500
THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T
HAD A CHANCE TO CATCH UP.

246
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,208
I'VE GOTTA SAY, I'VE BEEN A
LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOU, HON.

247
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,083
OH, HONOKA, WHY AREN'T YOU
OVER HIM YET?

248
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,625
- THE THING IS...

249
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,708
I WAS...

250
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,583
I WAS REALLY WORKING ON
BUILDING MY CONFIDENCE

251
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,958
SO THAT I COULD EVENTUALLY
ASK HIM OUT AGAIN.

252
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,833
HE'S PRACTICING SO MUCH.

253
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,041
AND NOW I KNOW WHY.

254
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,333
HE'S DOING IT ALL
TO IMPRESS ASAHINA.

255
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,916
AND WHAT IF IT'S NOT
JUST ONE-SIDED?

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,458
WHAT IF SHE LIKES HIM, TOO?

257
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,166
THEN THAT WOULD MEAN THAT
EVERYTHING I'M TRYING TO DO

258
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,333
IS A WASTE OF TIME,
AND THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ME

259
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,125
IN HIS HEART.

260
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,000
- SO JUST FORGET ABOUT HIM.

261
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,250
YOU DON'T WANNA BE WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S TOO STUPID TO REALIZE

262
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,375
HOW AMAZING YOU ARE.

263
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,916
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,666
THIS JUST MEANS YOU CAN ACTUALLY
FIND A REAL BOYFRIEND. OKAY?

265
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,083
- THANKS, NANA.

266
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,958
- Yasunobu: YOU'RE REALLY
WORKING HARD THESE DAYS.

267
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,083
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE

268
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,583
THE NUMBER ONE SPRINTER
IN THE COUNTRY

269
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,958
BUT YOU'RE PRACTICING
FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT!

270
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,875
- YEAH, I KNOW.

271
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,333
- EVEN THOUGH I THINK
YOUR MOTIVATION

272
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,708
IS SERIOUSLY MISPLACED,

273
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,166
I GOTTA TELL YA, I'M IMPRESSED.

274
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,958
- THANKS, MAN.
I'M DOIN' EVERYTHING I CAN.

275
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,833
I SWEAR. NOTHING IS GOING
TO STOP ME

276
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,458
FROM BECOMING NUMBER ONE.

277
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,333
- HAH!

278
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,458
- AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALL TALK AND NO ACTION.

279
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,833
WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T BLOW IT, OKAY?

280
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,083
- YEAH.

281
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,208
- Kinugasa: ONE MORE!

282
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,041
RUN LIKE YOU MEAN IT, AKITSUKI!

283
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,250
TIME!

284
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,083
TAKE A THREE
MINUTE BREAK!

285
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,500
- ( gasping )

286
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,166
I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER.

287
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,916
- HEY, AKITSUKI, CAN I HAVE
A MINUTE WITH YOU?

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,250
- SURE.
- I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THIS.

289
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,791
IT'S A GRAPH OF YOUR RUNNING
PATTERN OVER THE LAST WEEK.

290
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,333
- HUH?

291
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,791
- BUT THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY
SHOWS YOUR TIME FROM YESTERDAY.

292
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,208
- IT'S MY RUNNING FORM,
ISN'T IT?

293
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,708
I'M GONNA KEEP WORKING ON IT.

294
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,333
- OH, NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN. LOOK.

295
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,750
YOUR TIME COULD STILL USE
SOME WORK

296
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,250
AND THAT WILL COME
WITH PRACTICE.

297
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,416
BUT THE SHAPE OF YOUR CURVE

298
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,083
IS STARTING TO LOOK VERY
MUCH LIKE ARIMA'S.

299
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,083
- IT IS?

300
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,916
- YEAH. WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING
IS WORKING.

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,541
SO KEEP IT UP, AND I'M SURE
YOU'LL DO WELL AT THE MEET.

302
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,625
- I'LL BE THE BEST.
JUST YOU WAIT!

303
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,000
- ( chuckling )

304
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,625
WELL, DON'T WORK YOURSELF
TOO HARD.

305
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,750
- OKAY.

306
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,250
ASAHINA!

307
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,083
GET THIS!

308
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,375
MIYAMOTO SEMPAI JUST TOLD ME

309
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,041
THAT MY RUNNING STYLE
IS IMPROVING!

310
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,208
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

311
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,083
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

312
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,791
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE IMPROVING
DURING PRACTICE

313
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,875
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL PERFORM
THE SAME WAY DURING THE RACE.

314
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,000
- BUT...

315
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

316
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,000
- I'M SURE YOU'RE GREAT.

317
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,583
I'M JUST SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T BE
OVERCONFIDENT AT THIS POINT.

318
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,916
- HEY, WAIT JUST A MINUTE!

319
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,458
WHAT IS UP WITH HER?

320
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,666
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

321
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,958
WHO DOES SHE THINK
I'M DOING ALL THIS FOR?

322
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,791
DOESN'T SHE GET IT?

323
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,583
- BECOMING NUMBER ONE
ISN'T GONNA CHANGE

324
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,125
HOW SUZUKA FEELS ABOUT YOU.

325
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,500
SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU BECAUSE OF
HOW FAST YOU CAN RUN.

326
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,750
- I KNOW THAT.

327
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,625
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT
THIS RIGHT NOW.

328
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,208
I HAVE TO FOCUS ON PRACTICING.
I HAVE TO WIN!

329
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,916
- Soichi: ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE ALL DONE FOR TODAY!

330
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,750
- Crowd: YEAH!

331
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,833
- MAN, I AM GLAD
THAT'S OVER WITH!

332
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,291
- YEAH. TELL ME ABOUT IT.
LET'S GO GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT.

333
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,791
- AKITSUKI, YOU WANNA GRAB
SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE YOU GO?

334
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,583
IT'LL BE MY TREAT, OKAY?

335
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,750
- THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, BUT I
THINK I'M GOING TO STAY HERE

336
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,125
AND RUN A LITTLE MORE.
- ALL RIGHT.

337
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,458
WELL, YOU KNOW THE MEET
ISN'T TOO FAR AWAY.

338
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,125
I DON'T WANT YOU TO INJURE
YOURSELF BY PRACTICING TOO MUCH.

339
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,250
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

340
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,708
- SEE YA!
- GOOD JOB TODAY!

341
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,833
WELL, GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO START RUNNING!

342
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,333
YOU'RE PRACTICING BY YOURSELF
TODAY, ASAHINA?

343
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,875
I'M SURE YOU'LL DO GREAT.

344
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,833
- HEY... YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE TIME

345
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,041
MAKING CHEERFUL CONVERSATION.

346
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,666
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP YOU
DURING THE RACE.

347
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,250
YOU RECENTLY CHANGED
YOUR RUNNING STYLE.

348
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,500
IF YOU SLACK OFF NOW,

349
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,916
YOU'RE JUST GONNA RETURN
TO YOUR SAME OLD WAYS.

350
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,083
- OH, OKAY.

351
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,708
GREAT. WHAT DID I DO NOW.
I DON'T GET IT.

352
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,750
- ( bell tolling )

353
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,541
DAMN IT!
I AM SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW!

354
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,708
WHY THE HELL
DOES SHE ALWAYS THINK

355
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,166
SHE CAN TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?

356
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,416
I HAVE TO FOCUS!

357
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,000
- HEY!

358
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,125
- YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME?
- YOU NEED TO GO HOME.

359
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,500
YOU SHOULDN'T PRACTICE
THIS LONG.

360
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,833
RUNNING LIKE THIS JUST HAS
THE OPPOSITE EFFECT, YOU KNOW.

361
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,541
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
WEAR YOURSELF OUT.

362
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,750
DON'T BE STUPID.
- AHH!

363
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,541
WHAT? I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING, OKAY?

364
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,666
- OH, DO YOU REALLY?

365
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,416
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

366
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,666
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

367
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,000
WHEN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
SERIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING?

368
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,000
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.

369
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,916
WHY DO YOU HATE ME
SO MUCH, ASAHINA?

370
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,625
SHE JUST SAYS
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

371
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,958
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHY I'M WORKING SO HARD.

372
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,208
I'VE HAD IT.
I'M GOIN' HOME.

373
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,541
- WAIT! YAMATO!
DON'T LEAVE YET!

374
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,416
HEY! COME BACK!

375
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,708
PLEASE WAIT.

376
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,958
I'M SORRY.

377
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,666
I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ALL THOSE AWFUL THINGS

378
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,833
TO YOU, YAMATO.

379
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,208
I DIDN'T MEAN IT. PLEASE DON'T
BE SO ANGRY WITH ME.

380
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,583
- WELL... I, UM...

381
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,833
I'M NOT ALL THAT
ANGRY WITH YOU.

382
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,083
- SO, ARE WE OKAY?

383
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,916
- YEAH. SURE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

384
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,083
UH, ASAHINA?

385
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,125
- GOOD LUCK AT THE METROPOLITAN!

386
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,375
- HOLD ON!

387
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,791
"GOOD LUCK," HUH? THANKS.

388
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,500
I KNOW YOU STILL DON'T SEE IT...

389
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,125
BUT I'M ABOUT TO BE
THE FASTEST IN THE COUNTRY!

390
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,666
- ( birds chirping )

391
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,958
- ( humming a tune )

392
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,583
( chuckles ) LOOKS DELICIOUS!

393
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,416
- Hashiba: THIS IS IT!
I'M FREAKING OUT!

394
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,625
- CALM DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS ABOUT?

395
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,708
- UH, IT'S THE METROPOLITAN?

396
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,916
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW AKITSUKI FEELS RIGHT NOW.

397
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,166
I WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
COMPETE IN A MEET THIS BIG.

398
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,000
- I GUESS YOU MIGHT KNOW
IF YOU WORKED HARDER, HUH?

399
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,625
- YOU'RE SUCH A PRETENTIOUS
JERK, YOU KNOW THAT?

400
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,083
- OF COURSE I DO.

401
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,291
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME
SO DAMN CHARMING, ISN'T IT?

402
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,041
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

403
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,291
- Kinugasa: IT'S ALMOST TIME.

404
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,708
- SURE IS.

405
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,416
- YES!

406
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,666
