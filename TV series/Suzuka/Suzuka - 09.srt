- Yamato: MY MOUTH IS SO DRY
I CAN BARELY SWALLOW.

26
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,041
I NEVER KNEW
IT WOULD BE THIS HARD.

27
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,333
MAYBE ASAHINA
WAS RIGHT ABOUT ME.

28
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,000
MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED WHAT
IT TOOK TO BE ON THE TEAM,

29
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,833
I DON'T KNOW.

30
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,750
SHE WORKS OUT THIS
HARD EVERY DAY

31
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,875
AND THEN SHE SEEMS TO
BE TOTALLY FINE AFTERWARDS.

32
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,416
HUH? ASAHINA?
SHE'S STILL PRACTICING?

33
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING.

34
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,250
I'M TRYING TO IMPRESS
HER WHEN SHE'S

35
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,083
THE STAR OF THE TRACK TEAM.

36
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,583
I WISH I COULD JUST BE
MYSELF AROUND HER.

37
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,583
BUT SHE ALWAYS MAKES ME
SO NERVOUS.

38
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:28,875
I FEEL LIKE THE CLOSER I GET TO
HER, THE FARTHER SHE SLIPS AWAY.

39
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,083
( sighs )

40
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,583
- ( door unlocks )

41
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,708
- HERE SHE COMES.

42
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,041
OH! ASAHINA!

43
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,083
YOU MUST BE LEAVING FOR
SCHOOL EARLY THIS MORNING?

44
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,833
- YEAH.

45
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,375
- WELL, WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME
COMPANY DURING THE WALK?

46
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,083
- I WANNA WALK ALONE.

47
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,708
- FINE.

48
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,416
( sighs )

49
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,750
WHAT DID I DO TO MAKE HER
DESPISE ME SO MUCH?

50
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,791
I'M TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

51
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,833
- WE'RE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO
IMPROVE OURSELVES BY ONE SECOND,

52
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,541
BY ONE CENTIMETER.

53
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,583
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE IT, YAMATO?

54
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,458
- I JUST HAVE TO STICK THIS
OUT AND PROVE TO HER

55
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,083
THAT I'M SERIOUS.

56
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,625
- YOUR BUILD IS MORE ATHLETIC
THAN I EXPECTED, AKITSUKI.

57
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,916
A NICE SURPRISE.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,666
- UH, HASHIBA, WHAT KIND OF
OUTFIT ARE YOU WEARING?

59
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,416
I MEAN, YOU'RE PRACTICALLY NUDE!

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,875
- ( exclaims ) THIS IS THE
UNIFORM FOR SPRINTERS!

61
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,500
- SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW.

62
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,333
- AND IT'S NOT NICE TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT A GIRL'S WEARING.

63
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,000
WE'RE SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT.

64
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,916
- I SAID SORRY. SO WHY ARE YOU
WEARING THAT TODAY?

65
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,333
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT YOU
WEREN'T ON THE TEAM WHEN WE HAD

66
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,833
THE MEETING AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

67
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,208
TODAY'S THE DAY THAT WE
DECIDE THE ENTRANTS FOR

68
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,041
THE TOKYO METROPOLITAN
TOURNAMENT IN TWO WEEKS.

69
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,375
- SO THAT'S WHY I WAS TOLD TO
BRING MY UNIFORM AND SPIKES.

70
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:31,750
- YEP, EXACTLY. ANYWAY, GOOD
LUCK WITH EVERYTHING TODAY.

71
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,250
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

72
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,750
THE MEN'S SHORT DISTANCE HAS
A LOT OF STIFF COMPETITION.

73
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,708
- THANKS.

74
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,625
GOOD LUCK, RIGHT.

75
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,500
- ( gunshot )

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,458
- ( beeping )

77
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,291
- ELEVEN POINT
THREE NINE SECONDS.

78
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,125
- ELEVEN POINT
EIGHTY-EIGHT SECONDS.

79
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,333
- YES!

80
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,541
( panting )

81
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,666
- EVERYONE'S SO TENSE.
I GOTTA TRY TO STAY LOOSE

82
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,750
AND NOT LET IT GET TO ME.

83
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,291
- Soichi: WHAT'S
WRONG, AKITSUKI?

84
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,083
- MIYAMOTO SENPAI.
- YOU LOOK A BIT DOWN.

85
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,750
- EVERYONE'S COMING IN AT
JUST OVER ELEVEN SECONDS.

86
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,416
I GUESS I'M WORRIED
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

87
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,666
- OH, YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

88
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,541
I'M SURE YOU CAN
COMPETE AT THEIR LEVEL.

89
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,375
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

90
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,833
- ABSOLUTELY.
- GET SET.

91
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,916
- YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING
REALLY HARD THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,458
- ( gunshot )

93
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,166
- SO QUIT WORRYING ABOUT IT!
I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

94
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,125
- THANKS.

95
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,750
- NEXT, AKITSUKI AND KOBAYAKAWA.

96
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,708
- GO AND GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

97
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,291
- I HAVE TO DO WELL.

98
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,708
I CAN'T MAKE A FOOL OUT OF
MYSELF IN FRONT OF ASAHINA.

99
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,166
- YOU CAN DO IT, I
HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

100
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,916
- OH, THANKS.

101
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,083
- HUH? HE'S
A ROCKET STARTER? INTERESTING.

102
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,583
- YEAH.

103
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,125
AND HE GOT A GREAT TIME WHEN HE
USED THAT TECHNIQUE BEFORE.

104
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,458
- I SEE.

105
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,375
- ALL RIGHT. NOW, ON YOUR MARKS.
- LET'S GO.

106
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,416
( smirks )

107
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,375
- GREAT, SHE'S WATCHING.
NOW I HAVE TO DO WELL.

108
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,666
- SET.

109
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,666
- EVEN I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
WHO CAN RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,041
- YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE YOU CAN COMPETE

111
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,083
AT THEIR LEVEL, AKITSUKI.

112
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,041
- I DON'T KNOW IF
THEY'RE RIGHT ABOUT ME.

113
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,416
THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE SO HIGH.

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,916
- ( gunshot )

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,250
- I CAN'T TAKE IT!

116
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,791
- WHOA, AKITSUKI'S REALLY FAST.

117
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,791
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.
I HAD NO IDEA.

118
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,541
- HE'S STILL RIGHT BEHIND ME.

119
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,458
A HUNDRED METERS SEEMS SO FAR.
MY LEGS ARE GIVING OUT ON ME.

120
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,958
JUST A BIT FURTHER. I CAN'T LOSE
THIS HERE AT THE END.

121
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,166
- ( beeping )

122
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,541
- TEN POINT NINE EIGHT SECONDS!

123
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,750
- WHAT? THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
- IT IS. I SWEAR.

124
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,500
- WOW. THAT WAS AMAZING.

125
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,916
- I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
JUST BROKEN MY PREVIOUS RECORD.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,666
- WHOA!

127
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,166
- YOU SURE FOUND US AN AMAZING
ROOKIE THERE, MIYAMOTO.

128
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,791
- I KNOW.

129
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,916
BUT I NEVER EXPECTED HIM

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,208
TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR
THIS GOOD SO SOON.

131
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,083
HE'S ALREADY FINISHING
IN THE TEN-SECOND RANGE.

132
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,708
- AKITSUKI, REMINDS YOU OF
SOMEONE, DOESN'T HE?

133
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,958
- YES, I HAD NOTICED
THE RESEMBLANCE.

134
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,916
AND I THINK ASAHINA
SEES IT, TOO.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,833
- WAY TO GO, GRACE.
- ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?

136
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,916
- ( laughs )

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,708
- CONGRATULATIONS, AKITSUKI.
YOU HAD THE BEST TIME.

138
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,916
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE TOURNAMENT.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,333
- MAN, TODAY FELT GOOD.

140
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,875
MAYBE ASAHINA WILL GIVE
ME MORE CREDIT.

141
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,208
ASAHINA.

142
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,375
HEY, DID YOU HEAR?

143
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,500
I RAN THE HUNDRED METERS
IN UNDER ELEVEN SECONDS?

144
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,916
I HAD THE BEST TIME
OUTTA MY GROUP.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,625
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

146
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,541
- SURE.

147
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,500
- I WAS HOPING
FOR A BETTER REACTION.

148
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,583
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO
DO? I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

149
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,416
- I AM . I AM HAPPY FOR YOU.

150
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
- OH, I SEE.

151
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,291
- THEN WHY? WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SO COLD TO ME?

152
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,875
I EVEN GOT PICKED AS
THE TOP SPRINTER

153
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,875
FOR THE METROPOLITAN TOURNAMENT.

154
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,875
- YEAH, I HEARD.

155
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,541
- COULD YOU BE LESS EXCITED?

156
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,291
- SORRY, I THINK I'D BETTER
BE GETTING HOME NOW.

157
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:23,291
- WHA... HEY, WOULD YOU
JUST WAIT A MINUTE?

158
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,666
- JUST TELL ME WHAT IT IS
ABOUT ME THAT YOU DON'T LIKE.

159
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,458
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

160
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,125
- LET GO OF ME. THAT HURTS.

161
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:44,000
- IT'S JUST SOMETIMES,
I DESPISE BEING AROUND YOU.

162
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,166
AND I, I DON'T KNOW WHY,
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

163
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,375
- DESPISES YOU? THAT'S HARSH.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,916
- YEAH. I KNOW. HARSH.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,458
- I FEEL FOR YA.

166
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,833
DESPISE IS A STRONG WORD TO BE
THROWIN' AROUND. REALLY STRONG.

167
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,375
- YEAH.

168
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,250
- BUT AT LEAST SHE FEELS
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

169
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,875
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT INDIFFERENT.

170
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,208
BEING DESPISED IS MUCH BETTER
THAN JUST BEING TOLERATED.

171
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,375
- OH, REALLY?

172
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,416
- LOVE AND HATE ARE
VERY CLOSE EMOTIONS.

173
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,458
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
TURN IT AROUND.

174
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,250
- YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

175
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,083
- Miki: WHAT'S WITH
THE GLOOMY MOOD?

176
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,416
YOU GUYS ARE
ALWAYS SO SERIOUS?

177
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,791
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD?

178
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,958
- HASHIBA! NO, NOTHING'S WRONG.

179
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,958
- WELL, ACTUALLY, YAMATO LIKES
SUZUKA BUT SHE TOLD HIM

180
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,000
THAT SHE DESPISES
BEING AROUND HIM.

181
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,833
- WHAT?
- DON'T TELL HER THAT.

182
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,333
- I THOUGHT WE COULD USE
A WOMAN'S OPINION ON THE MATTER.

183
00:10:56,416 --> 00:11:00,041
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU
OUT HERE, MAN. TRUST ME.

184
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,166
- HMM, I SEE.

185
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,416
AKITSUKI LIKES SUZUKA,
BUT SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM.

186
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,250
AND I LIKE AKITSUKI, BUT HE'S SO
PREOCCUPIED WITH LIKING SUZUKA

187
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,583
THAT HE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME
THE TIME OF DAY.

188
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,791
- WHAT?

189
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:16,041
- WHO CARES ABOUT YOU?
THIS IS ABOUT HIM!

190
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,458
ANNOYING.

191
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,625
- WHAT? SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
- YOU SHUT YOURS.

192
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,208
PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE YOU
A LOT BETTER IF YOU DID.

193
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,166
- OH, THAT'S ORIGINAL.

194
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,750
- COULD WE GET BACK
TO ME, PLEASE?

195
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,666
- OH, RIGHT, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

196
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,791
NOW BACK TO THE PROBLEM AT HAND.
HERE'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT.

197
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,166
IF SHE REALLY HATES
YOU THAT MUCH

198
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,375
THEN THERE'S NO POINT IN YOU

199
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,791
STAYING ON WITH
THE TRACK TEAM.

200
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,708
- WELL, MAYBE.

201
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,916
- YOU GOT INTO THIS WHOLE THING
TO MAKE HER LIKE YOU MORE.

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,625
AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT WORKING.

203
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,541
- THAT'S HORRIBLE ADVICE, JERK.

204
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,291
HE CAN RUN THE HUNDRED METERS
IN THE TEN-SECOND RANGE!

205
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,500
HE'S GOT TALENT.

206
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,458
- I'M JUST SAYING, HE
DIDN'T HAVE ANY INTEREST

207
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,208
IN TRACK AND FIELD
TO BEGIN WITH.

208
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,333
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF HE'S GREAT AT TRACK.

209
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,625
IF SUZUKA HATES HIM, THEN
ALL HIS SUCCESS IS MEANINGLESS.

210
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,750
- LISTEN TO ME.

211
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,166
IF HE QUIT NOW IT WOULD
ONLY MAKE SUZUKA HATE HIM

212
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,166
EVEN MORE THAN SHE ALREADY DOES.

213
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,875
TRUST ME. SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

214
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,083
- YOU THINK?

215
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,666
- OF COURSE. DON'T
LISTEN TO THIS SLACKER,

216
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,333
HIS ADVICE WILL ONLY GET
YOU INTO MORE TROUBLE.

217
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,041
- WHO'RE YOU CALLING
A SLACKER, DORK?

218
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,291
- WHY, YOU OF COURSE.

219
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,625
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY CLUBS,
YOU JUST HANG AROUND.

220
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,041
- BACK OFF PSYCHO,
I HAVE MY OWN GOALS!

221
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,791
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT KIND OF SPRINTER

222
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,416
GROWS HER HAIR THAT LONG?

223
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,583
- I WEAR IT LONG BECAUSE
AN ATHLETE I ADMIRE

224
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,083
WEARS HERS THIS WAY.

225
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,083
AND ANYWAY, LIKE
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!

226
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,500
BUTTON UP YOUR SHIRT!
WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO ATTRACT?

227
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,041
- IT'S BECAUSE I'M HOT,
SLUG TRAIL.

228
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,833
- WELL, YOU LOOK SLOPPY.
- NOT AS SLOPPY AS YOUR HAIR!

229
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,250
- I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO
QUIT THE TEAM, GUYS.

230
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,208
I'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE TO DO, SO
I MIGHT AS WELL STICK WITH IT.

231
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,500
I'LL JUST HAVE TO HANG IN THERE
AND HOPE THAT I CAN MANAGE

232
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,458
TO IMPRESS ASAHINA AGAIN.

233
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,750
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.
- I HOPE YOU'RE SURE.

234
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,583
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

235
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,625
- WE WERE JUST TRYING TO GIVE
YAMATO SOME ADVICE.

236
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,000
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.
LISTEN. CAN YOU HELP US OUT?

237
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,083
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT HATTORI'S SHIRT?

238
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,916
HE SHOULD BUTTON IT, RIGHT?

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,208
- I...

240
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,000
- IT'S MY ONLY CHOICE.
I HAVE TO STICK WITH IT.

241
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,416
IF I KEEP GETTING BETTER
AND BETTER,

242
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,708
MAYBE ASAHINA WILL COME AROUND.

243
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,666
( grunting )

244
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,416
- THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. YOU'RE
LIFTING A LOT OF WEIGHT THERE.

245
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,875
YOU EVER CONSIDERED
TRYING THE SHOT PUT?

246
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,625
- NO THANKS. I THINK
I'LL STICK TO SPRINTING.

247
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,250
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE
HOW WEIGHT TRAINING

248
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,125
IS GOING TO MAKE ME
RUN ANY FASTER.

249
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,750
- JUST TRUST ME.

250
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,791
WEIGHT TRAINING WILL HELP YOU
DEVELOP THAT EXPLOSIVE ENERGY

251
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,791
THAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
IN A SHORT RACE.

252
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,083
THE STRONGER YOU ARE
THE FASTER YOU'LL BE.

253
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,875
- I SEE.

254
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,583
THEN I THINK I'LL DO A BIT
MORE TRAINING BY MYSELF

255
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,750
BEFORE I LEAVE.

256
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,708
- ALL RIGHT. JUST
DON'T OVERDO IT.

257
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,875
- SURE.

258
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,291
- HEY, AKITSUKI,

259
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,458
YOU MIND IF WE STAY AND
WORK OUT WITH YOU SOME MORE?

260
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,875
IT'LL RUIN OUR REPUTATION
IF A FRESHMAN STAYS LATER

261
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,416
THAN US UPPERCLASSMEN,
YOU KNOW.

262
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,625
- AND WE DON'T WANT THAT!
- THAT'S RIGHT.

263
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,916
- THERE'S NO WAY
I'M LEAVING YET.

264
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,666
- QUITE A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE
AROUND HERE, HUH?

265
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,208
- I SUPPOSE SO.

266
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,916
- AKITSUKI'S REALLY BEEN RAISING
EVERYONE'S SPIRITS.

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,833
HIS PRESENCE ON THE TEAM
HAS WORKED WONDERS FOR EVERYONE.

268
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,583
- LET'S GO AHEAD AND ADD
FIVE POUNDS TO EACH SIDE.

269
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,625
- YOU SURE YOU CAN HANDLE IT?
- YEAH. SURE.

270
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,583
- IT REMINDS ME OF THE WAY
THINGS USED TO BE...

271
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,125
BEFORE.

272
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,708
YOU SEE IT, DON'T YOU?

273
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,916
AKITSUKI. HE LOOKS
JUST LIKE KAZUKI.

274
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,541
OH, HEY. WAIT. ASAHINA.

275
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,541
- SORRY. I HAVE TO GET
BACK TO PRACTICE.

276
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,208
I HAVE A LOT TO WORK ON TODAY.

277
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,916
- OH. FINE.

278
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,916
( grunting )

279
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,125
( breathing heavily )

280
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,333
- WHAT'S WRONG, SUZUKA?

281
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,708
THAT HEIGHT ISN'T USUALLY
A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

282
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,500
ARE YOU NOT FEELING WELL?

283
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,416
- I'M FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

284
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,875
- OKAY. BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT,

285
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,708
YOU KNOW I'M HERE.

286
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,208
- SORRY, BUT I NEED
SOME TIME TO MYSELF.

287
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,416
- YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING

288
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,583
ABOUT AKITSUKI, HAVEN'T YOU?

289
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,958
- NO. I JUST NEED
TO GET SOME REST.

290
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,333
- I SEE.

291
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,250
- I FEEL TERRIBLE.

292
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,250
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

293
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,375
- YOU SEE IT, DON'T
YOU? AKITSUKI.

294
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,208
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE KAZUKI.

295
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,875
- NO, HE DOESN'T!

296
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,333
THEY'RE NOTHING ALIKE.

297
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,125
- ( whistle blowing )

298
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,250
- Captain: THAT'S IT FOR TODAY!

299
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,458
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE DONE!
- OH, MAN. I'M BEAT.

300
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,250
- I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE
COMPLETELY RESTED UP

301
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,083
FOR THE TOURNAMENT THIS WEEKEND.

302
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,208
- SO NO PRACTICE TOMORROW.
- All: YES!

303
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,833
- THEN THAT MEANS WE HAVE
A WHOLE DAY OFF TOMORROW.

304
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,166
- A DAY OFF, HUH?

305
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,750
I'VE GOTTA TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS

306
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,625
AND FIX THINGS WITH ASAHINA.

307
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,041
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO DO THAT.

308
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,583
MAYBE WE COULD GO SHOPPING
FOR AUNT AYANO.

309
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,375
BUT I DOUBT SHE WOULD
GO WITH ME, THOUGH.

310
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,291
SHE HAS BEEN ACTING PRETTY COLD.

311
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,250
I'LL ASK HER ANYWAY, EVEN
THOUGH I KNOW SHE'LL SAY NO.

312
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,250
- Soichi: YOU'RE LEAVING?

313
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,958
- WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

314
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,458
- THE COMPETITION'S SOON.

315
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,333
SO I'M THINKING OF GOING HOME
THIS WEEKEND TO YOKOHAMA.

316
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,375
- YOKOHAMA?
- OH, AND TO KAZUKI.

317
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,833
- YEAH. IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE GONE HOME TO SEE HIM.

318
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,250
- KAZUKI?

319
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,625
- BE SURE TO PAY HIM MY RESPECTS
AND HAVE A SAFE TRIP.

320
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,250
- SURE.

321
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,333
- WHO'S KAZUKI?

322
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,458
- KAZUKI?
MAYBE IT'S HER BROTHER.

323
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,208
NAH.

324
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,125
SHE WOULDN'T MAKE THAT LONG TRIP
JUST TO SEE HER BROTHER.

325
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,708
MAYBE IT'S A GUY SHE USED
TO DATE, OR HAD A CRUSH ON.

326
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,708
( sighs ) EITHER WAY, IT'S
GOTTA BE SOMEONE SHE LIKES.

327
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,875
I'VE NEVER HEARD HER MENTION
ANY BOYS BEFORE.

328
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,666
BUT SHE MUST'VE HAD
A BOYFRIEND IN YOKOHAMA.

329
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,958
AND TOMORROW SHE'S USING HER
DAY OFF TO GO BACK AND SEE HIM.

330
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,083
OR HE COULD JUST BE A FRIEND.

331
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,458
BUT I DOUBT IT.

332
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,833
- YEAH. IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE GONE HOME TO SEE HIM.

333
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,208
I'M SORRY.

334
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,875
OR YOU'LL SERIOUSLY MAKE
A FOOL OF YOURSELF IF YOU JOIN

335
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
AND THEN QUIT WHEN IT
GETS TOO HARD.

336
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,750
SOMETIMES, I JUST DESPISE
BEING AROUND YOU.

337
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,083
- ASAHINA'S SAID
SOME MEAN THINGS BEFORE.

338
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,166
BUT NOTHING HURTS LIKE THIS.

339
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,000
LIKE KNOWING THAT SHE'S GOING
TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE.

340
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,125
- GOOD MORNING.
- WELL, GOOD MORNING, YAMATO.

341
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:11,166
- Ayano: DID YOU NOT SLEEP WELL?
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD, YAMATO.

342
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,916
- OH, I'M FINE.

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,375
I DIDN'T GET A WINK
OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

344
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,166
I COULDN'T GET ASAHINA
OFF MY MIND.

345
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,708
- HERE, HAVE SOME TEA.
- OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MIHO.

346
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,958
- WHERE'S ASAHINA? HAS SHE
NOT WOKEN UP YET THIS MORNING?

347
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,291
- NO, SHE ALREADY ATE,
AND THEN LEFT JUST A MINUTE AGO.

348
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,791
- SHE APPARENTLY NEEDED TO DO
SOMETHING BACK HOME.

349
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,500
- OH, I SEE.

350
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,458
- SO SHE DID GO SEE
THIS KAZUKI AFTER ALL.

351
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:55,000
I BET ASAHINA'S ARRIVING IN
YOKOHAMA RIGHT ABOUT NOW, GORO.

352
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,416
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

353
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,750
- ( meows )

354
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,500
- I NEVER UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

355
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,833
GORO, WAIT. WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING? GET BACK HERE.

356
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
- ( meows )

357
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,000
- HEY, STOP IT.
I SAID GET BACK HERE.

358
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,625
- ( meows )

359
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,333
- YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
THAT'S ASAHINA'S ROOM. WAIT!

360
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,416
( grunting )

361
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,791
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU,
YOU STUPID CAT?

362
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,833
( exclaims )

363
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,916
IS THAT HIM?

364
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,333
- OH, AND TO KAZUKI.

365
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:43,000
- YEAH. IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE SEEN HIM.

366
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,000
- ( heart beating )

367
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,208
- SO, THAT'S THE GUY.

368
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,500
THE GUY THAT ASAHINA LIKES.

369
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,125
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

370
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,375
- SEE YOU LATER.

371
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,791
- I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, YAMATO.

372
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,291
- I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

373
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,333
- ( train whistling )

374
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,500
- I DON'T KNOW WHY...
BUT I JUST HAVE TO GO.
