- ASAHINA AND AKITSUKI
DIDN'T GET ON THE TRAIN?

26
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:43,750
- NO. THEY DID. BUT THEN
THEY GOT OFF AGAIN.

27
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,333
- WHY IS AKITSUKI, WITH ASAHINA?

28
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,250
- WHAT DO WE DO
NOW? THIS SUCKS.

29
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,208
- I WISH I HAD ANSWERS FOR YOU.

30
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,958
- ASAHINA, I'M SORRY,
I KNOW THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

31
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,791
- NO KIDDING. SO HOW DO
YOU PLAN TO MAKE UP FOR THIS?

32
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:31,875
- OH. I KNOW! KARAOKE!
OR A RESTAURANT!

33
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,833
WE CAN KILL TIME
TILL THE MORNING...

34
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,000
AND THEN HEAD BACK ON
THE BULLET TRAIN!

35
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,041
- I GUESS.

36
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,458
- ALRIGHT, GREAT! IT'LL BE FUN!
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE

37
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,833
TO BORROW SOME MONEY, THOUGH?

38
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,916
I ONLY HAVE ABOUT 600 YEN ON ME.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,416
- THAT'S MORE THAN I HAVE.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,583
I DON'T HAVE MY PURSE WITH ME.

41
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,750
IT'S STILL ON THE TRAIN,
IN CASE YOU FORGOT.

42
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,041

CARP OF HIROSHIMA! ♪

44
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,416
OH, NO WHAT'S GOING ON OVER
HERE? IS THIS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE?

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,708
- NO! IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT!

46
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,958
- I KNOW THAT LOOK! YOU
JUST GOT CAUGHT CHEATING!

47
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,416
HEY THERE, GIRLIE!

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,708
YOU KNOW, CHEATING IS LIKE A
STATUS SYMBOL FOR US GUYS.

49
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,708
WE CAN'T HELP IT!
YOU SHOULD FORGIVE HIM

50
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,500
FOR ONE OR TWO FLINGS.

51
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,500
BESIDES, I CAN TELL THAT SHE'S
THE FAVORITE OF THEM ALL, RIGHT?

52
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,041
( chuckles ) RIGHT?

53
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,250
- YOUR BREATH.

54
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,750
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A
LITTLE HOTEL OVER THERE.

55
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,916
WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE IT UP TO HER?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,416
- WHAT! WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,625
- ( man chuckling )

58
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,416
- COME ON! CUT IT OUT!

59
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,791
STOP HARASSING THESE
POOR KIDS ALREADY!

60
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,750
- I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT, MAN!

61
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,458
- WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

62
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,666
NOT LIKE WE HAVE ANY MONEY
TO GO TO A HOTEL. OH, WELL!

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,375
- I WOULDN'T GO IF WE DID!

64
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:02,208
- WHAT? ME EITHER! I MEAN...
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

65
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,333
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
ELSE, IDIOT.

66
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:08,791
WAIT. ASAHINA! I ALMOST
FORGOT! MY PARENTS LIVE HERE!

67
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,625
I BET MY DAD WOULD
LEND US SOME MONEY!

68
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,416
THAT WAY, YOU COULD STAY AT ONE
OF THE BUSINESS HOTELS AROUND

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,916
HERE AND I COULD STAY AT HOME
WITH MY PARENTS.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,250
THEN WE CAN GO HOME
TOMORROW MORNING.

71
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,166
- THAT WOULD BE OKAY.
BUT YOUR PARENTS...

72
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,875
- YOU DON'T THINK THEY'D
MIND, WOULD THEY?

73
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,708
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!

74
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,041
BUT CAN I BORROW YOUR
CELL PHONE FOR A MINUTE?

75
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,500
I'M PRETTY SURE I LEFT
MINE ON THE TRAIN.

76
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,583
- SURE.

77
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,500
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO
CALL OVER THERE, THOUGH.

78
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,375
- WHAT FOR?
- JUST BECAUSE.

79
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,375
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOUR REACTION
WHEN YOU HEAR MY DIALECT.

80
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:53,041
- SO, NO WORD FROM THEM I GUESS?
- NO.

81
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,125
- WE'RE SAVED!
HE'S ON HIS WAY RIGHT NOW.

82
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,541
- REALLY? THAT'S AWESOME!
ALRIGHT, WELL,

83
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,000
I'LL LET THE CAPTAIN KNOW.

84
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,916
HE'S PROBABLY
WORRIED ABOUT US.

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,708
- YEAH. GOOD CALL.

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,250
- ( cell phone rings )

87
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,458
- OH! LOOK! HERE THEY ARE!
- GOOD.

88
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,916
- HEY, MIKI. IT'S SUZUKA. CAN I
TALK TO THE CAPTAIN FOR A SEC?

89
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,250
CAPTAIN? YEAH, WE'RE OKAY...

90
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,291
YAMATO'S FAMILY LIVES HERE
AND HIS DAD'S ON HIS WAY

91
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,833
TO COME GET US.

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,750
- HERE.
- FOR ME?

93
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,875
OH, GREAT. HE'S PROBABLY
ANGRY WITH ME.

94
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,750
- HELLO?
- Honoka: AKITSUKI?

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,291
- Yamato: HONOKA, HI!

96
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,375
- I HEARD YOU DIDN'T
MAKE IT ON THE TRAIN

97
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,750
AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

98
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,000
- WELL, EVERYTHING'S FINE. MY
DAD'S ON HIS WAY TO PICK US UP.

99
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,833
- OH. OKAY. GOOD.
THAT'S GREAT...

100
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,875
I'M GLAD.

101
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,166
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
- WHAT?

102
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,625
- DON'T WORRY. I'LL BE
STAYING THERE BY MYSELF.

103
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,958
IT'LL BE OKAY. I PROMISE.

104
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:29,291
- YEAH. OKAY. THANK YOU.

105
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,958
- OKAY, WELL. I GUESS I'LL CALL
YOU WHEN I GET HOME THEN?

106
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,625
OKAY? BYE.

107
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,208
- HERE. THANK YOU!
- MMM-HMM.

108
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:51,875
SO... WHAT WAS THE
CONFESSION LIKE?

109
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,083
DID YOU TELL HER THAT
YOU LIKED HER FIRST?

110
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,208
- WELL...

111
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,166
YEAH. IT'S TRUE.

112
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,500
- WELL GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU MUST REALLY LIKE HER.

113
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:10,416
- I DO, BUT, NOT FOR THE
REASONS YOU WOULD THINK.

114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,333
I MEAN, SHE'S EXTREMELY
BEAUTIFUL, AND,

115
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,333
KIND AND CONSIDERATE
AND THOUGHTFUL...

116
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,000
BUT THE BEST THING ABOUT HER
IS THAT SHE JUST HAS THIS

117
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,333
AMAZING ABILITY TO PUT
MY HEART AT EASE SOMEHOW.

118
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,500
- I GET IT!

119
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,708
- HUH?

120
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,333
HEY! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
ASKING QUESTIONS, ASAHINA!

121
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:35,166
- I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE ENTIRE
LOVE SAGA! YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

122
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,291
- ALL RIGHT! THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE! WHAT'S WRONG?

123
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,166
- WILL YOU PLEASE
LOWER YOUR VOICE?

124
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,916
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
YOURSELF.

125
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,750
- Yamato: AFTER THAT,

126
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,333
THERE WAS THIS UNCOMFORTABLE,
AWKWARD FEELING BETWEEN US.

127
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,833
SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD FOR THE
NEXT HOUR AND A HALF.

128
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,541
WE JUST SAT IN SILENCE.

129
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,875
UNTIL FINALLY MY DAD SHOWED UP.

130
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,583
- HE'S HERE!

131
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,625
FINALLY. HI, DAD.

132
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,666
( grunts )

133
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,083
- YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!
SO WAS THAT JUICE YOU BOUGHT

134
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,625
WORTH MISSING THE TRAIN?

135
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,875
- I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD
TO COME ALL THE WAY OUT

136
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,416
HERE LIKE THIS FOR US.

137
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,416
- DON'T MENTION IT.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL.

138
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,541
I'M SURE IT'S ALL YAMATO'S
FAULT, ANYWAY. COME ON.

139
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,875
GET IN THE CAR.

140
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,833
- HUH? THE CAR? BUT THERE'S
A HOTEL RIGHT THERE?

141
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,166
- SHUT UP, YAMATO.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

142
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,666
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE
LETTING A GIRL

143
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,625
STAY ALONE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS!

144
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,125
I'LL BRING YOU GUYS BACK
SOMETIME TOMORROW.

145
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,250
ARE YOU ALRIGHT WITH STAYING
AT OUR PLACE TONIGHT?

146
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,708
- SURE.
- NO WAIT! WE CAN'T DO THAT!

147
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,166
- IS THE BACK SEAT OKAY WITH
YOU? I'M SORRY IT'S A BIT MESSY.

148
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,625
- UH...
- DAD! LISTEN TO ME!

149
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,166
- YAMATO, I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.
JUST SHUT UP AND GET IN THE CAR,

150
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,500
UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU HERE. GEEZ!

151
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,625
- BUT, DAD, WAIT!

152
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,250
SO THAT MEANS ASAHINA IS
STAYING AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT?

153
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,416
- ( Dad yawning )

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,708
I'M SO TIRED. I CAN'T
BELIEVE I HAD TO MAKE A THREE

155
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,625
HOUR ROUND TRIP
BECAUSE OF YAMATO.

156
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,583
- Suzuka: I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

157
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,291
- Dad: OH, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
SUZUKA. RIGHT, MOM?

158
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,875
- Grandmother: YAMATO! EAT UP!
YOU'RE SKIN AND BONES!

159
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,291
- MAKE SURE YOU GET
PLENTY TO EAT, SUZUKA?

160
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,416
- OH, THANKS!

161
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,791
- DAD, I THINK THOSE
ARE MY CHOPSTICKS.

162
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,666
- YAMATO, DO YOU WANT
ANOTHER BOWL?

163
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,416
- GRANDMA, DON'T FORCE FEED
HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT IT.

164
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,375
- MIKO. WANT
THE REST? HERE.

165
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,125
- WHAT THE HECK IS
GOING ON HERE?

166
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,166
- THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YAMATO,
YOU COULDN'T GET ON THE TRAIN

167
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,291
BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY
FOOLING AROUND AS USUAL, RIGHT?

168
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,500
- GOODNESS, YAMATO. HOW COULD
YOU? SEE, THIS IS WHY I SAID

169
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,291
YOU SHOULD JUST GO TO SCHOOL
IN HIROSHIMA. NOT TOKYO?

170
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,666
- DON'T BE SO HARD
ON HIM, KOTONO!

171
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,166
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME
IN SUCH A LONG TIME.

172
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,791
- YEAH, IT'S KINDA SAD. TOKYO
HASN'T CHANGED YOU AT ALL.

173
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,000
- YOU'RE STILL A DORK.
- DORK.

174
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,833
- YEP, THIS IS MY
FAMILY ALRIGHT...

175
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,250
WHERE I GREW UP FOR
SIXTEEN YEARS.

176
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,541
BUT THE ONLY REASON I FEEL SO

177
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,833
UNCOMFORTABLE AND
AWKWARD IS BECAUSE...

178
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,500
ASAHINA IS SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

179
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,416
- Dad: SUZUKA, TRY THIS
SEA SLUG. IT'S DELICIOUS!

180
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,458
- OKAY. I'VE NEVER HAD THEM.
- DAD, DON'T MAKE HER EAT THAT.

181
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,916
SO, THE TRAIN, IT'S KINDA
FAR AWAY. SO...

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,458
WE NEED TO LEAVE EARLY
TO MAKE IT ON TIME.

183
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,333
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY I WON'T BE
ABLE TO TAKE YOU UNTIL I GET OFF

184
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,291
OF WORK TODAY. BUT IF
TRAFFIC ISN'T TOO BAD,

185
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,250
WE CAN LEAVE BY FOUR AND STILL
MAKE IT THERE BY SIX-THIRTY.

186
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,083
- OH NO! YOU'RE GOING
BACK SO SOON, YAMATO?

187
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,958
BUT YOU JUST GOT HERE YESTERDAY.

188
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,666
CAN'T THE TWO OF
YOU JUST STAY A LITTLE LONGER?

189
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,875
- I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT I THINK
ASAHINA HAS TO GET BACK.

190
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,083
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
I FEEL LIKE I'M ASKING

191
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,833
TOO MUCH OF ALL OF YOU.

192
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,458
- OH, DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT IT, MY DEAR.

193
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,958
THIS IS ALL YAMATO'S
FAULT ANYWAY.

194
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,291
- TOTALLY. IT'S ALL HIS FAULT
FOR DROPPING THE JUICE CANS.

195
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,708
- RIGHT, MIKO?

196
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,291
- ( meows )

197
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,291
- GEE, THANKS A LOT, YOU GUYS.
- WELL I GUESS I'M OFF TO WORK.

198
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,291
YOU GUYS KILL SOME TIME.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER ON TONIGHT.

199
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,375
- OKAY.

200
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,041
- Mom: WELL, YAMATO,
I'M GOING SHOPPING.

201
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,125
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE KORO
FOR A WALK WHILE I'M GONE.

202
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,250
- OKAY.

203
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:45,666
- HEY. SO...
- WHAT IS IT?

204
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,541
- YOU MUST BE REALLY BORED HERE.

205
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,208
I CAN SHOW YOU AROUND
IF YOU'D LIKE?

206
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,375
- NO THANKS. I KIND OF
WANT TO BE ALONE.

207
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,250
- ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN, WE HAVE
A LOT OF TIME TO KILL TODAY.

208
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,375
I'M WALKING THE
DOG ANYWAY, SO...

209
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,625
- IT WAS NICE OF YOUR SISTER TO
LET ME BORROW SOME CLOTHES.

210
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,916
I WANNA DO SOMETHING FOR HER
WHEN SHE GETS HOME.

211
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,916
- OKAY. GOOD IDEA.

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,625
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY,

213
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,541
JUST LEAVE ME
ALONE, ALRIGHT?

214
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,708
- FINE...

215
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,125
JEEZ, I WAS TRYING
TO THINK OF HER TOO.

216
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,500
I MEAN, OKAY. I KNOW IT'S MY
FAULT THAT SHE ENDED UP HERE IN

217
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,708
THE FIRST PLACE, BUT SHE DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE SO MEAN...

218
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,500
KORO! YOUR MASTER'S TALKING TO
YOU, SO YOU SHOULD LISTEN!

219
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,833
HMM...

220
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,958
- ( wind blowing )

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,333
- THERE'S NO WAY ASAHINA
CAN ENJOY HERSELF

222
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,916
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,833
THERE'S NOTHING
EXCITING ABOUT IT.

224
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:15,250
HEY, ASAHINA! WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SEE THE FIREFLIES?

225
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,875
REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM.

226
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,916
THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM BY
THAT RIVER IN THE EVENING.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,583
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

228
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,083
SO, IF YOU WANT, WE COULD
STAY ONE MORE NIGHT

229
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,416
AND YOU COULD SEE THEM
BEFORE YOU GO HOME?

230
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,333
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU I
WANTED TO BE ALONE?

231
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,208
- WHAT THE HECK IS
WRONG WITH YOU?

232
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,208
YOU BEEN SO IRRITABLE
SINCE YESTERDAY!

233
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,541
YOU'RE JUST IMPOSSIBLE!

234
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,833
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
IMPOSSIBLE, YAMATO.

235
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,291
- HUH?

236
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,291
- SAYING, "LET'S STAY ONE MORE
NIGHT AND SEE FIREFLIES"

237
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,458
WHAT EXACTLY ARE
YOU TRYING TO PULL?

238
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,458
- ( gasps )

239
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,041
- I THINK WE BOTH KNOW I'M NOT
THE ONE YOU WANNA BE HERE WITH.

240
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,541
- I SEE. SO ASAHINA IS TRYING
TO THINK ABOUT HONOKA.

241
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,791
- CAN YOU JUST GO, PLEASE?

242
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,000
- YEAH. WE GOT TO MY
PLACE LAST NIGHT.

243
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,416
- Honoka: OKAY.
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

244
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,291
- YEAH. I AM. I GUESS.

245
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,750
LISTEN, HONOKA. I HAVE
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

246
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,916
MY DAD WAS REALLY
PUSHY AND INSISTED

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,250
THAT ASAHINA STAY WITH US.

248
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,625
BUT, THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE
COMING BACK TODAY!

249
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,875
DON'T WORRY. I DON'T HAVE ANY
FEELINGS FOR HER OR ANYTHING.

250
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,416
- YEAH, I KNOW.

251
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,750
- HUH? I THOUGHT YOU'D BE UPSET.

252
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,666
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
JUST THE TWO OF YOU.

253
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,375
YOUR FAMILY'S THERE TOO RIGHT?

254
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,333
- YEAH.

255
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,333
- THEN THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

256
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,333
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

257
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,708
- UH...

258
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,791
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT!

259
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:11,083
NO REALLY! REALLY, I PROMISE!
WE'LL BE LEAVING HERE IN A BIT.

260
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,333
OKAY, I'LL EMAIL YOU
WHEN I GET HOME.

261
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,166
YEAH. BYE.

262
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,416
ASAHINA! DAD SHOULD BE
GETTING BACK SOON,

263
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,125
SO LET'S GET READY TO GO, OKAY?

264
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,125
HEY, DID YOU HEAR ME?

265
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,041
- LISTEN... I CHANGED MY MIND.

266
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,416
DO YOU THINK IT'D BE
ALL RIGHT IF I STAYED

267
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,708
ONE MORE NIGHT AFTER ALL?

268
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,416
- YEAH, BUT WHY?
- I WANNA SEE THE FIREFLIES.

269
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,791
- UH, SURE.

270
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,000
OKAY.

271
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,458
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?
SHE'S SO CONFUSING.

272
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,208
- SAYING "LET'S STAY ONE MORE
NIGHT AND SEE FIREFLIES."

273
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,666
WHAT, EXACTLY, ARE YOU
TRYING TO PULL?

274
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,708
- AFTER ALL THAT SHE CHANGES HER
MIND? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!

275
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,708
I TOLD HONOKA THAT I'D
BE BACK BY TONIGHT, TOO.

276
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,750
- SO, WHERE ARE THEY?
- OVER BY THE BRIDGE THERE.

277
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,291
- THERE SHOULD BE A LOT
BY THE RIVER.

278
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,416
- REALLY?

279
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,666
C'MON, LET'S HURRY THEN!

280
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,000
- CAREFUL! DON'T RUN,
IT'S DANGEROUS!

281
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,208
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

282
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,875
SO, YOU'RE SPEECHLESS.
I KNEW YOU'D LIKE THEM!

283
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,625
- I KNEW IT.

284
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,000
NO FIREFLIES.

285
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,791
- HUH...

286
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,500
THAT'S STRANGE! WHAT HAPPENED?

287
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,458
THERE'RE USUALLY TONS OF THEM
OUT HERE IN THE SUMMER. REALLY!

288
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,500
ALL FLYING AND
GLOWING AND...

289
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,500
I'M SO SORRY. I KNOW
THAT YOU STAYED HERE

290
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,250
ONE MORE DAY JUST TO SEE THEM.

291
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,833
- OH, DON'T WORRY. IT'S OKAY.

292
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,583
I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

293
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,291
- GREAT. THAT FIGURES.

294
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,666
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
WHEN I DON'T NEED THEM,

295
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,375
BUT WHEN I ACTUALLY WANNA
SHOW THEM TO SOMEONE...

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,500
THIS HAPPENS.

297
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,666
- SO YOU CAME HERE
WITH SOMEONE BEFORE?

298
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,583
- YEAH. WHEN I WAS
IN JUNIOR HIGH,

299
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,708
I ASKED A GIRL I LIKED
TO COME HERE WITH ME.

300
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,500
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
NICE TO CONFESS TO HER

301
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,708
WITH ALL THE FIREFLIES
SURROUNDING US.

302
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,666
- YEAH? THEN WHAT?

303
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,375
- WELL, OF COURSE,
WHEN WE GET THERE,

304
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,916
NOT ONLY ARE THERE NO FIREFLIES,

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
BUT IT STARTS TO RAIN!

306
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,500
EVERYTHING I'D PLANNED
TO DO AND SAY WAS RUINED.

307
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,458
BUT I GOT DESPERATE AND
CONFESSED ANYWAY.

308
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,125
AND TO TOP IT OFF...
I WAS REJECTED.

309
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,041
- ( laughs )

310
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,291
- WHAT? THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

311
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,583
- IT'S HILARIOUS! I COULD
TOTALLY PICTURE YOU

312
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,875
IN MY MIND. THAT'S
JUST LIKE YOU!

313
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,166
- WHAT'S JUST LIKE ME?

314
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,125
- YOU'RE THE SAME
IN EVERY SITUATION.

315
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,416
YOU CAN'T SUCCEED WHEN
IT REALLY MATTERS.

316
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,750
- SHUT UP! I'M BEING COMPLETELY
SERIOUS HERE! I'M NOT TRYING TO

317
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,958
MAKE YOU LAUGH AT ALL
RIGHT NOW, ASAHINA!

318
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,666
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT,
BELIEVE ME.

319
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,708
BUT THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT FUNNIER.

320
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,125
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T
CONFESSED TO SOMEONE

321
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,875
WITH THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE.

322
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,041
- HUH? IT REALLY DOESN'T
TAKE MUCH FOR YOU

323
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,583
TO LIKE SOMEONE, DOES IT?

324
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,666
SEEMS LIKE YOU
CONFESS TO EVERYONE.

325
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,416
- ( gasps )

326
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,916
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I CONFESSED TO YOU!

327
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,208
WELL, Y'KNOW.

328
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,166
HEY, LOOK OVER THERE! I KNEW IT

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,041
- SO, NOW YOU HAVE ME CURIOUS...

330
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,375
HOW WERE YOU PLANNING TO CONFESS
TO THAT GIRL YOU LIKED?

331
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,958
KNOWING YOU, YOU MUST'VE
PRACTICED. C'MON, WE'VE GOT

332
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,041
EVERYTHING HERE! "A CONFESSION,
BY YAMATO AKITSUKI!"

333
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,375
- WHAT?! ARE YOU CRAZY
OR SOMETHING?

334
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,750
YOU WANT ME TO ACT
IT OUT FOR YOU?

335
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,958
- YEAH, WHY? WHAT
ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

336
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,041
I JUST WANNA SEE HOW YOU
WOULD'VE DONE IT. C'MON!

337
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,500
- IS SHE THREATENING ME NOW?

338
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING ME
DO THIS. YOU'RE INSANE.

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,291
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

340
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,250
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE
OF THESE THINGS BEFORE?

341
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,875
IT'S CALLED A BELLFLOWER.

342
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,791
I'VE LIKED YOU SINCE YOU
FIRST CAME TO OUR SCHOOL!

343
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,750
WOULD YOU PLEASE GO
OUT WITH ME?

344
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
OR, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

345
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,250
- YEAH.

346
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,375
I'LL GO OUT WITH YOU.

347
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,916
- WHAT? STOP MAKING
FUN OF ME, ASAHINA!

348
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,958
- I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU
THIS TIME. I'M BEING SERIOUS.

349
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,041
GOTCHA!

350
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,000
YOU TOTALLY FELL FOR IT!

351
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,916
LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE ALL RED!
DON'T TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY.

352
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,625
- WHAT? I KNEW YOU WERE JOKING!

353
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,875
- FIREFLIES! I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM

354
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,000
AROUND US RIGHT NOW. MY EYES
MUST JUST NOW BE ADJUSTING.

355
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,500
- RIGHT. THERE'S NO WAY ASAHINA

356
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,958
WOULD EVER SAY ANYTHING
LIKE THAT AND MEAN IT.
