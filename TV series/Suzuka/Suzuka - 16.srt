26
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,791
- Ayano: WELL,
GOOD MORNING, HONOKA!

27
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE SO EARLY?

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,333
- OH, GOOD MORNING.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

29
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,208
- ( cat meows )

30
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,708
- SO... AKITSUKI'S NOT...

31
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,416
- NOPE. HE AND SUZUKA
AREN'T BACK YET. SORRY.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,041
-BUT HE TOLD ME THEY WERE
COMING BACK YESTERDAY!

33
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,958
- ABOUT THAT...

34
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,041
IT SEEMS THEY HAD
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO,

35
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,291
SO THEY'LL BE BACK
AROUND NOON TODAY.

36
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,791
- OH. I SEE.

37
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,583
- I BET THOSE TWO GOT TOGETHER
OR SOMETHING

38
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,833
AND THEY JUST DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

39
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,708
IF SO, I SAY IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR
WAITING TOO LONG

40
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,916
TO TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,958
- I HONESTLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

42
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,041
- OH, REALLY?
WELL, THEN I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

43
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,916
THAT "SHY, PASSIVE" THING
IS GETTING OLD.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,666
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
YAMATO WILL DRIFT AWAY.

45
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,250
- WE'RE ALREADY DATING!

46
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,208
AND THAT MEANS HE'S NOT
"DRIFTING" ANYWHERE.

47
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,791
- YEAH, I'LL GO OUT WITH YOU.

48
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,000
I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU
THIS TIME. I'M BEING SERIOUS.

49
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY
TOOK HER SERIOUSLY FOR A MOMENT!

50
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,291
- WHAT?
- WHAT? NOTHING... NEVER MIND.

51
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,875
UH, ARE YOU THIRSTY OR HUNGRY?
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

52
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,208
- NO. BUT, THANKS.

53
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,250
- NO PROBLEM!

54
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,083
- RIGHT.

55
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,875
- WHY AM I STILL
SO NERVOUS AROUND HER?

56
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,666
THE ONLY REASON SHE STAYED
WAS TO SEE THE FIREFLIES.

57
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,250
Yamato: IT'S LUNCH TIME ALREADY!

58
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,583
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO RIGHT NOW

59
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,041
WE SHOULD GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

60
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,333
- I DON'T KNOW. I'M KINDA
WORRIED ABOUT MY LUGGAGE...

61
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,583
I THINK I'M GONNA GO BY THE
SCHOOL AND SEE IF IT'S THERE.

62
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,083
- ACTUALLY, IT'S ALL
TAKEN CARE OF.

63
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,833
I TALKED TO AUNT AYANO YESTERDAY
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT

64
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,208
THE CAPTAIN ALREADY CAME BY
TO DROP OFF OUR LUGGAGE.

65
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,958
- HE DID? THAT'S AWESOME.

66
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,875
- YEAH, SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
LET'S GO EAT. YOU MUST BE ST...

67
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,125
HONOKA?

68
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,291
- AKITSUKI!

69
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

70
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,541
- YOUR AUNT TOLD ME
THAT YOU AND ASAHINA

71
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,625
WOULD BE BACK AROUND NOON TODAY.

72
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,625
SO, I THOUGHT I'D...

73
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,208
- YOU'VE BEEN HERE
THE ENTIRE TIME?

74
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,416
WELL, UM... DO YOU WANNA GET
SOMETHING TO EAT WITH US?

75
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,250
- ACTUALLY, I REALLY NEED
TO GET HOME. LATER.

76
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,583
-WAIT... ASAHINA!

77
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,875
- ABOUT THE MONEY,
I'LL PAY YOU BACK SOON, OKAY?

78
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,291
- 'KAY. COOL. WELL, THERE'S NO
RUSH. JUST WHENEVER YOU CAN.

79
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,541
- I BET THOSE TWO GOT
TOGETHER OR SOMETHING

80
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,875
AND THEY JUST DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

81
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,375
- HEY, IS EVERYTHING
OKAY WITH YOU, HONOKA?

82
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,791
- UM. YEAH. FINE. I JUST THOUGHT
I'D HELP YOU WITH YOUR LUGGAGE.

83
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,583
- WELL, THIS IS ALL I HAVE.

84
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,041
- UH. OKAY, THEN. I'LL CARRY IT
FOR YOU. I'M SURE YOU'RE TIRED.

85
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,416
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT HEAVY.

86
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,750
I PROMISE.

87
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,833
- 'KAY... IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

88
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:08,875
LET'S GO.

89
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,666
- WERE YOU WORRIED?
TELL ME.

90
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,375
- WAS I WORRIED ABOUT WHAT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

91
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,916
- NEVER MIND.
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,166
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
MIGHT'VE BEEN WORRIED

93
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,041
ABOUT ASAHINA AND ME.

94
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,375
THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

95
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,416
BECAUSE I'M ALREADY
WITH THE GIRL THAT I LIKE.

96
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,083
UH... HEY. I DIDN'T SAY
SOMETHING WRONG, DID I?

97
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,833
- NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU'VE JUST
NEVER SAID YOU LIKED ME.

98
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,041
- WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

99
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,375
- UNTIL NOW, I'VE BEEN SO
WORRIED THAT MAYBE

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,583
I LIKED YOU MORE THAN
YOU LIKED ME...

101
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,583
OR MAYBE YOU
DIDN'T LIKE ME AT ALL.

102
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,333
- I'M SORRY.

103
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,875
HONOKA'S BEEN SO KIND AND
THOUGHTFUL THIS WHOLE TIME...

104
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,291
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE NEVER TOLD
HER I LIKED HER UNTIL NOW.

105
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,750
- OH, MY GOSH, I'M SORRY!
I DON'T WANNA EMBARRASS YOU

106
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,541
BY DOING THIS IN PUBLIC.

107
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,750
I'M GLAD I CAME. I JUST
NEEDED TO SEE YOUR FACE

108
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,625
TO KNOW HOW YOU FELT.
IT'S OKAY NOW.

109
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,041
- I DON'T CARE WHAT ASAHINA
THINKS OF ME ANYMORE.

110
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,583
GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU CAME, TOO.

111
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,333
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
BECAUSE THIS IS THE GIRL I LIKE.

112
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,250
I'M SORRY.
DID I EMBARRASS YOU?

113
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,000
- NOT AT ALL.
YOU'VE MADE ME HAPPY.

114
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,458
Honoka: GOOD MORNING, AKITSUKI!

115
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,041
- Yamato: GOOD MORNING TO YOU!

116
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,750
- Honoka: CAN YOU BELIEVE IT'S
ALREADY THE SECOND SEMESTER?

117
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,833
- I KNOW. I JUST REALIZED WE
WERE SO BUSY WITH PRACTICE

118
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,000
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO GO OUT AT ALL.

119
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,166
- ( she sighs)

120
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,875
- THANKS SO MUCH FOR
ALL YOUR HELP THIS SUMMER.

121
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,250
I COULDN'T HAVE FINISHED
ALL MY ASSIGNMENTS WITHOUT YOU.

122
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,291
- GLAD TO HELP!

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,041
- WHAT THE...

124
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,666
- THERE REALLY SHOULD
BE A LAW AGAINST

125
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,208
BEING SO HAPPY THIS EARLY.

126
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,625
- NOW, WAS THAT REALLY
NECESSARY? YOU SCARED ME!

127
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,166
- GOOD MORNING!

128
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,583
- WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT?

129
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,166
- HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

130
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,791
- MORNING, AUNT AYANO.

131
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,875
- YAMATO, I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

132
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,708
I HAVE A LOT OF ERRANDS
TO RUN TODAY,

133
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,500
SO I DON'T THINK I'LL BE
BACK IN TIME TO MAKE

134
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,916
YOU GUYS ANY DINNER.
MIHO'S GOING TO EAT

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,083
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE TONIGHT
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE OKAY?

136
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,750
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT
A PROBLEM AT ALL.

137
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,125
I CAN MAKE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF.

138
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,750
- OKAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

139
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,916
- NAH. IT'S FINE.
I'LL SEE YA LATER.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,041
- HAVE A GOOD DAY!

141
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,166
- THANKS. YOU TOO!

142
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,041
- OKAY, THAT'S REALLY GONNA
GET OLD. THEY'RE TOO CHIPPER.

143
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,125
- I THINK IT'S SWEET.

144
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,041
- ( bell tolls )

145
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:06,583
- SO SPILL IT. I WANT DETAILS.
'BOUT SAKURAI. GOOD KISSER?

146
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,666
- WHAT THE... HOW DID YOU
EVEN KNOW WE WERE DATING?

147
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,125
WHO TOLD YOU?

148
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,458
- IT WAS OBVIOUS. I KNEW YOU
GUYS WERE SECRETLY MEETING

149
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,750
AT NIGHT DURING CAMP.

150
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,041
- THAT'S JUST GREAT. I THINK
EVERYONE AT THE APARTMENTS

151
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,541
KNOWS ABOUT US TOO.

152
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,458
- YOU'RE NOT THAT DIFFICULT
TO FIGURE OUT.

153
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,000
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE
HAVING A GREAT TIME

154
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,750
HOLDING HANDS AND PLAYING HOUSE.

155
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,416
LOTS OF WHOLESOME
FAMILY FUN.

156
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,250
- PLAYING HOUSE? WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN, HUH?

157
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,583
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW,
WE KISSED BEFORE WE DATED!

158
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,041
- WHAT? YOU ALREADY KISSED HER?
WELL WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!

159
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,791
MY LITTLE YAMATO'S ALL GROWN UP!

160
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,416
- SHUT UP!
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

161
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,083
- SO, WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

162
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,750
DID YOU GUYS DO IT YET?

163
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,541
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THAT'S GROSS!

164
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,583
- YOU'RE GROSS!
NOT TO MENTION STUPID!

165
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,416
- YOU'RE THE STUPID ONE HERE.

166
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,458
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KISSED HER,

167
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,583
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
GONE ANY FARTHER.

168
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,583
- BECAUSE I'M NOT
A PERVERT LIKE YOU!

169
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,416
- OH, YEAH? WELL AT THE RATE
YOU'RE GOING,

170
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,583
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF

171
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,750
BACK TO "FRIEND STATUS"
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

172
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,541
- REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

173
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,291
- I KNOW SO.

174
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,500
IF A GIRL IS KISSING
YOU IT MEANS SHE

175
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,000
WANTS YOU TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP

176
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,250
AND YOU'RE A FREAK
IF YOU DON'T!

177
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,666
- A FREAK? I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT.

178
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,000
I REALLY DON'T THINK HONOKA
IS THAT KIND OF PERSON.

179
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,041
- THEN INVITE HER
TO YOUR ROOM AND FIND OUT!

180
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,750
- WHAT?

181
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,291
- HONESTLY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVEN'T HAD HER OVER

182
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,750
THERE BEFORE!

183
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,958
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF
HAVING YOUR OWN PLACE, MAN!

184
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,291
IF A SINGLE GIRL GOES TO A
SINGLE GUY'S PLACE,

185
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,875
SHE WANTS ONE THING.

186
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,666
- WANTS WHAT?

187
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,958
- ( chuckles )

188
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,291
- ( gasps )

189
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,958
- AND THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS WHAT DATING IS ALL ABOUT.

190
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,416
- HEY, HONOKA, IT'S ME! DO
YOU WANNA COME OVER

191
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
TO MY PLACE IN A BIT?
I'M ALL BY MYSELF.

192
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,083
I KNOW! MAYBE I CAN RENT
SOME MOVIES AND ASK HER

193
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,583
IF SHE WANTS TO WATCH THEM!
SEEMS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE

194
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,958
A LOT MORE
APPEALING TO HER.

195
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,833
SOMETHING ROMANTIC MAYBE,
OR A HORROR MOVIE?

196
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,416
YEAH! THAT WAY WHEN
SHE GETS SCARED,

197
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,583
SHE'LL HUG ME AND
THAT'LL LEAD TO...

198
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
- ( groans )

199
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,041
- WHAT AM I SAYING?
I CAN'T DO THAT TO HER.

200
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,833
UGH. I FORGOT AUNT AYANO IS OUT
SO THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT.

201
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,000
I CAN JUST GRAB SOMETHING FROM
THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

202
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,500
MAYBE I CAN FIND
SOME CROQUETTES.

203
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,708
- ( doorbell rings )

204
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:27,166
- COULD IT BE ASAHINA?

205
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,625
NO WAY.

206
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,833
IT'S PROBABLY THE DRUNKEN
DUO OR THAT NEWSPAPER GIRL.

207
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,500
HONOKA!

208
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,916
- GOOD EVENING!

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,208
- HEY. IT'S REALLY LATE.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY WITH YOU?

210
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,083
- I'M FINE. I WAS THINKING,
I KNOW YOUR AUNT'S OUT

211
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,083
AND I WAS WORRIED THAT YOU
HADN'T EATEN ANYTHING,

212
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,083
SO I BROUGHT THIS.

213
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,083
- REALLY? YOU BROUGHT ME
DINNER? WOW!

214
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:59,416
- WELL. NO. NOT EXACTLY,
BUT I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING.

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,583
OH, UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU'VE ALREADY EATEN!

216
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,083
- NO, NOT AT ALL!
I HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING!

217
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,833
- OKAY. WELL THEN I'LL...

218
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,166
- COOK ME SOMETHING?
I MEAN, PLEASE?

219
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,791
PLEASE COOK
ME SOMETHING.

220
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,958
- I WILL. BUT I'M NOT
A CHEF OR ANYTHING.

221
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,166
- THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.
I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE

222
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,500
TO GRAB A BENTO FROM THE
CONVENIENCE STORE.

223
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,416
- REALLY? WELL THEN
I'M COMING IN!

224
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HONOKA IS
COOKING FOR ME IN MY ROOM!

225
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,833
SHE'S WEARING AN APRON
AND EVERYTHING!

226
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,375
JUST FOR ME.
SHE'S SUCH A SWEET GIRL.

227
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
- ( he gasps )

228
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,083
- I'M SORRY. IT'S GOING
TO TAKE A WHILE.

229
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,791
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO WATCH TV.

230
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,916
- OKAY. COOL.

231
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,916
WOW, THIS IS GREAT! IT FEELS
LIKE WE'RE LIVING TOGETHER!

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,583
- IF A SINGLE GIRL GOES
TO A SINGLE GUY'S PLACE,

233
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,166
SHE WANTS ONE THING.

234
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,875
- OH, MY GOSH! SO THE FACT THAT
SHE CAME OVER HERE MUST MEAN...

235
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,041
- AKITSUKI, WHERE DO YOU
KEEP YOUR SOY SAUCE?

236
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,125
UH... WHAT'S THE MATTER?

237
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,583
- OH, NOTHING. UH, THE SOY
SAUCE IS IN THE TOP CABINET.

238
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,583
YOU CAN'T MISS IT.

239
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,875
- O... OKAY.

240
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,458
- MAYBE HE WAS WRONG.
MAYBE IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

241
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,375
HONOKA WAS JUST
WORRIED ABOUT ME

242
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,583
AND CAME OVER TO MAKE ME
DINNER. NOTHING MORE.

243
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,208
- AND THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS WHAT DATING IS ALL ABOUT.

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
- OH, MAN!

245
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,750
- AKITSUKI!

246
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,791
- UH, YEAH. WHAT IS IT?
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

247
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,875
- YEAH. THE SALT?

248
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,416
- AH, YES. THE SALT IS
HERE IN MY HAND.

249
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,583
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

250
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,208
- IF A SINGLE GIRL GOES TO A
SINGLE GUY'S PLACE,

251
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,083
SHE WANTS ONE THING.

252
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,166
- ARE YOU OKAY?

253
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,416
- OH, YEAH! I'M FINE!

254
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,791
- WELL?

255
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,541
- MM, IT'S DELICIOUS!
REALLY, REALLY GOOD!

256
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,708
HONOKA, YOU'RE LIKE AN
IRON CHEF IN A DRESS!

257
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,583
- THANK YOU.

258
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,166
- MAN, I FEEL LIKE I INHALED THE
ENTIRE MEAL! ALRIGHT, LAST BITE.

259
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,583
- HERE. OPEN. COME ON!

260
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,625
- OH. CUTE. OKAY.

261
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,916
- WAS THAT OKAY?
DID YOU GET ENOUGH TO EAT?

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,291
- OH, YEAH. I'M VERY FULL.
THANK YOU.

263
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,583
- WELL GOOD.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

264
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,666
- I NEVER EXPECTED THAT I'D EAT
THIS WELL WHEN MY AUNT WAS AWAY.

265
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,875
THAT'S FOR SURE.

266
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,750
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING OVER, HONOKA.

267
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,875
THAT'S RIGHT.
AUNT AYANO'S NOT HERE.

268
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,208
ASAHINA.

269
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,458
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO FOR DINNER?

270
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,541
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL KNOW HOW TO
COOK SOMETHING ON HER OWN.

271
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,625
- YOU OKAY, AKITSUKI?
WHAT'RE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

272
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
- UH... WELL... YOU KNOW...

273
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,791
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE SUCH
AN AMAZING COOK!

274
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,166
- AW! THAT'S SWEET.

275
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,875
WELL, I'LL GO WASH
THE DISHES THEN, OKAY?

276
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,791
- WHAT THE HECK AM I THINKING?

277
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,083
WHY SHOULD I CARE
WHAT ASAHINA DOES?

278
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,666
SHE DOESN'T MATTER
TO ME ANYMORE!

279
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,000
- HEY. WAIT!
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

280
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,333
AKITSUKI, ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?

281
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,500
YOU'RE REALLY SCARING
ME RIGHT NOW.

282
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,416
WAIT!

283
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,458
- HONOKA'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

284
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,875
- WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PLEASE STOP! I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

285
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,958
TALK TO ME! PLEASE!

286
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,333
- I, UM...

287
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,416
- AKITSUKI.

288
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,583
- HONOKA'S THE ONE
I'M DATING NOW!

289
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,541
- NO!

290
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,166
YOU'RE SCARING ME
RIGHT NOW. SO...

291
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,916
- HONOKA, PLEASE WAIT!

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,958
- HONOKA?

293
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,166
- ASAHINA!

294
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

295
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,375
- IT'S NOTHING.
JUST NEVER MIND.

296
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,291
- IT'S NOT "NOTHING."
I'M SURE YOU SAID

297
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,250
SOMETHING STUPID AND
STARTED A FIGHT.

298
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,083
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW
TO HANDLE YOURSELF

299
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,666
AROUND GIRLS, DO YOU?

300
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,250
AND NOW HONOKA'S CRYING
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

301
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,083
- THIS IS REALLY NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS. PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE.

302
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,958
- HEY! COME BACK!

303
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,083
- EVERYONE'S PACE
IS SLOWING DOWN!

304
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,125
- JUST HANG IN THERE! UNLESS
YOU WANT TO RUN ANOTHER LAP!

305
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,166
- HEY! MANAGER!
BRING THE DRINKS!

306
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,541
- SAVE YOUR BREATH. I DON'T
THINK SHE'S HERE TODAY, MAN.

307
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,208
- I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED?
MAYBE SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL?

308
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,250
- WHO KNOWS?

309
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,791
- IT'S BECAUSE OF
WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT.

310
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,791
WHY DID I HAVE TO THINK OF
ASAHINA AT THAT MOMENT?

311
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,791
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

312
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,833
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT
I STILL HAVE FEELINGS

313
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,333
FOR HER SOMEHOW?

314
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,958
EVEN IF I DO, I CAN'T USE HONOKA
TO TRY TO GET PAST IT.

315
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,333
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR
HURTING HER LIKE THAT.

316
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,625
- YOU'RE SCARING ME
RIGHT NOW. SO...

317
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,708
- I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO HER.
EVEN IF IT'S TOO LATE.

318
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:55,916
OKAY, I'M HERE.
BUT WHAT DO I SAY TO HER?

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,541
SHE MIGHT NOT EVEN LISTEN
TO ME AT THIS POINT.

320
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,000
- ( footsteps )

321
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,375
- HONOKA, HI.

322
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,583
WAIT! HOLD ON!

323
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,250
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT!

324
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,708
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU HATE ME

325
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,375
AND NEVER WANNA SEE
ME AGAIN! BUT...

326
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,208
- NO! IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT!

327
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,041
I DON'T... I DON'T
HATE YOU AT ALL.

328
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,791
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT I EVER COULD.

329
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,791
BUT AFTER WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

330
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,166
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO ACT AROUND YOU.

331
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,458
IT FEELS A LITTLE
AWKWARD, BECAUSE...

332
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,916
WELL, IT'S SILLY, BUT IT
WOULD'VE BEEN MY FIRST TIME.

333
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,458
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

334
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:57,083
- YOU... YOU PROBABLY
HATE ME NOW, DON'T YOU?

335
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,416
- NO! WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,041
THERE'S NO WAY!
I DON'T HATE YOU!

337
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,583
I... I'M THE ONE
WHO'S AT FAULT HERE, HONOKA!

338
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,958
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS SUCH
AN AGGRESSIVE JERK TO YOU.

339
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,208
PLUS, I... WELL, UH...

340
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:21,083
- THERE YOU ARE. THAT'S THE
FACE OF THE AKITSUKI I KNOW.

341
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,250
I WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU
PUSHED ME AROUND LIKE THAT.

342
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,583
IF YOU HAD THAT
LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

343
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,250
WHAT? WAIT! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
I DON'T MEAN LIKE THAT!

344
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,041
AND EVEN IF I DO, WE REALLY
SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT

345
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,083
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN
TOGETHER THAT LONG! RIGHT?

346
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,833
- OH RIGHT! I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

347
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,125
I MEAN I DO, BUT...

348
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,833
WE'RE TOTALLY
ON THE SAME PAGE.

349
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,041
WELL, UM...

350
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:49,333
I... I REALLY... I HOPE YOU CAN
COOK FOR ME AGAIN SOMETIME,

351
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,791
I GUESS.

352
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,291
- 'KAY.

353
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
- SO, I'M GONNA GO HOME NOW.

354
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,125
- OH, RIGHT!

355
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,541
- I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW.

356
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,791
- OKAY. CAN I STOP BY
SO WE CAN GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER?

357
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,000
- OH. SURE!

358
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:20,041
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE TONIGHT.

359
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,500
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

360
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,958
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
TO HURT HONOKA EVER AGAIN!

361
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,625
HEY, ASAHINA. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE SO LATE?

362
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:49,500
- OH. WELL, I JUST GOT HOME. NOT
THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

363
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,666
- OH REALLY? IT LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE DAYDREAMING TO ME.

364
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,333
- WELL, ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

365
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,750
WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO
PATCH THINGS UP WITH HONOKA?

366
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,291
- YEAH, SORT OF.

367
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,583
- OH. I SEE.
WELL THAT'S GREAT.

368
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,291
REALLY! GOOD FOR YOU!

369
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,500
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

370
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,791
WELL, THANKS I GUESS. LOOK,
I THINK IT'S TIME TO EAT...

371
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,500
HURRY AND CHANGE
SO WE CAN GO DOWN. 'KAY?

372
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,666
- OH! WAIT!

373
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,291
WHAT AM I DOING? UGH!

374
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,541

391
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,125
- I'M NOT LIKE THAT!
I REALLY CARE ABOUT HONOKA!

392
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,166
SHE'S CUTE AND KIND
AND THOUGHTFUL

393
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,000
AND I KNOW I DON'T
REALLY DESERVE HER!

394
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,125
BUT I'M DOING MY BEST
TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND

395
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,833
BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA
HURT HER FEELINGS.
