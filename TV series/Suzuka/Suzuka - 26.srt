00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,291
THEN I... I'LL FALL FOR YOU.

27
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,458
I DON'T WANNA HURT.

28
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,041
I DON'T WANNA FEEL PAIN
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

29
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:02,208
- OH. IT'S TSUDA, RIGHT?

30
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,958
- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T GO OUT
WITH ANYONE ELSE EVER AGAIN.

31
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:13,250
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS IS NOT THE SAME SITUATION.

32
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,416
YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE
SOMEONE'S WRONG FOR YOU

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,291
WITHOUT EVEN GIVING THEM
A CHANCE FIRST.

34
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,791
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IT WOULD TURN OUT.

35
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,750
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YAMATO.

36
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,208
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE.
IT'S NOT EASY!

37
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,416
- ( horn honking )

38
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,125
- PLEASE, JUST LISTEN.

39
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,166
I WOULD NEVER EXPECT THIS
TO BE EASY FOR YOU.

40
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,125
- YOU JERK!

41
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,416
- I'M SO SORRY.

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,833
- BUT WHY?

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,750
( sobs )

44
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,541
WHY DID HE DO THAT?
IS HE STUPID?

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,333
IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

46
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,166
WHY, SENPAI?

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,166
WHY ME?

48
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,000
I DON'T GET IT.

49
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,208
- SO YOU FOUND HER, MADE HER MAD
AND SHE RAN OFF AGAIN?

50
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,458
- YEAH. BUT I THINK
EVERYTHING IS OKAY NOW.

51
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,333
HER LIGHT'S ON SO SHE'S
PROBABLY BACK IN HER ROOM.

52
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,583
- ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING
IS NOT OKAY.

53
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,125
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I WAS OUT LOOKING FOR HER?

54
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,791
I GOT COMPLETELY SOAKED.

55
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,958
- I'M SORRY.

56
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,333
- IT'S OKAY. THE POINT
IS YOU FOUND HER.

57
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
I CAN GO HOME AND SLEEP NOW.
GOOD NIGHT.

58
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,375
- ( sighs ) EVERYONE'S
MAD AT ME. GREAT.

59
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,875
- YOU JERK!

60
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,458
- ( sighs ) YEAH. SHE'S RIGHT.

61
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,875
I AM A JERK.

62
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,833
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO HER.

63
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,166
- ( sobs )

64
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,041
- REALLY? SHE SLAPPED YOU
THAT MANY TIMES?

65
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,291
- YEAH.

66
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,958
- MAN, THAT SUCKS
'CAUSE SHE'S STRONG. WOW.

67
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,625
AND SHE'S STILL
IGNORING YOU EVEN

68
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,083
AFTER YOU APOLOGIZED TO HER.

69
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,208
- NO, I DIDN'T APOLOGIZE TO HER.

70
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
- HUH, WHY NOT?

71
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,125
- IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,
I GUESS.

72
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,916
- WHAT DOESN'T "FEEL RIGHT"
TO YOU?

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,708
- WELL, I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE I
SAID ANYTHING WRONG LAST NIGHT.

74
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,958
- I DON'T WANNA HURT.

75
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,583
I DON'T WANNA FEEL PAIN
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

76
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,250
- NOW THAT'S WRONG. DWELLING
ON THE PAST THAT WAY

77
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,333
WON'T HELP HER AT ALL.

78
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,291
- I'LL AGREE WITH YOU THERE.

79
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,583
- THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW

80
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,833
IF I APOLOGIZE TO HER IT'S
LIKE I SUPPORT THAT.

81
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,541
- ALL RIGHT, THIS MAY
SEEM HARSH, BUT,

82
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,083
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S
TIME YOU GAVE UP

83
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,333
ON THIS WHOLE SUZUKA
THING, ANYWAY?

84
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,958
- WHAT? WHY?

85
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,666
- BECAUSE WHEN YOU TOLD
HER THAT YOU LIKED HER,

86
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,833
SHE DIDN'T JUST REJECT
YOU, SHE GOT ANGRY.

87
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,791
THAT MEANS TSUDA MEANT MORE
TO HER THAN SHE EVER LET ON.

88
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,375
HE'S STILL ALIVE IN HER HEART.
HE'S IDEALIZED IN HER MIND.

89
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,750
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG TIME
BEFORE SHE GETS OVER IT.

90
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,833
- HMM.

91
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,708
HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT. NO MATTER
WHAT I DO OR HOW HARD I WORK,

92
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,750
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO REPLACE TSUDA.

93
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,750
BUT IF I GIVE UP NOW...

94
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,208
- ( gun shot)

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,500
- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T GO OUT
WITH ANYONE ELSE EVER AGAIN.

96
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,958
- BUT IF I LET HER
HAVE HER WAY...

97
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,416
THAT MEANS EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE...

98
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,833
- I'M GONNA BE NUMBER ONE.
JUST WAIT.

99
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,166
...WILL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING.

100
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,291
AND I WON'T ACCEPT THAT EVER.

101
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,208
- ( stop watch beeps )

102
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,083
- Man: 10.81!

103
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,541
- ( pants )

104
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,708
- AKITSUKI'S BEEN
WORKING HARD LATELY.

105
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,041
- HE HAS.

106
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,416
IT'S TIME FOR A BREAK,
AKITSUKI. OKAY?

107
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
- I DON'T NEED A BREAK.
I'M FINE, REALLY.

108
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,541
- AKITSUKI SEEMS TO BE
IN GOOD SPIRITS.

109
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,625
HE CAN BE A LITTLE TOO
UPTIGHT SOMETIMES, THOUGH.

110
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,708
- OH, REALLY?

111
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,333
- SO DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

112
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,250
I MEAN, I HEARD ABOUT
HOW YOU RAN OFF.

113
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,208
- IT REALLY WASN'T
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

114
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,166
- OKAY. WELL, IT'S FINE IF YOU
DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

115
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,333
- ( gun shot)

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,750
- I WAS TALKING TO HIM,

117
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,000
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE REALIZES
BECOMING NUMBER ONE IN JAPAN

118
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,333
WON'T MAKE YOU WANNA
GO OUT WITH HIM.

119
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,500
BUT HE REALLY FEELS LIKE
HE'LL NEVER BE SATISFIED

120
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,250
IF HE DOESN'T ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

121
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,000
AND HE WON'T BE ON THE SAME
LEVEL AS YOU UNLESS HE DOES.

122
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,916
YET HE'S DETERMINED TO SHOW YOU
WHAT HE'S MADE OF.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,333
I THINK YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
TALK TO HIM, SUZUKA.

124
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,458
- Miho: YAMATO!
DINNER'S ALMOST READY!

125
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,291
- THANKS,
BUT I'D RATHER SLEEP.

126
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,000
I GUESS THIS MEANS
YOU'RE IGNORING ME?

127
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,166
- ( gasps )

128
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,500
- YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS UP
FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

129
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,000
I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOU, OKAY?

130
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,083
- HUH?

131
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,583
- THE ONLY THING I REGRET
IS KISSING YOU LIKE THAT.

132
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,291
IT WASN'T RIGHT!

133
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,666
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU, ASAHINA!

134
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,541
AND I'M NOT GOING TO
LEAVE YOU ALONE

135
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,541
UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

136
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,166
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

137
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,541
ASAHINA!
- ( Suzuka sobs )

138
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,666
- YAMATO!

139
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,875
- WHAT'S GOING ON
OUT HERE, YAMATO?

140
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,083
- I KNEW SOMETHING WEIRD
WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THOSE TWO

141
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
AND IT'S ALL MAKING SENSE NOW.

142
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,166
- YOU SHOULD NEVER,
EVER FORCE A KISS ON SOMEONE!

143
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,458
- HOLD ON. IT'S NOT...

144
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,041
- HMM. YOU LIAR!

145
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,833
I HATE YOU, YAMATO!

146
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,291
- ( panting )

147
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,750
- HE'S WORKING REALLY HARD,

148
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,208
BUT HIS TIME DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE IMPROVING MUCH.

149
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,833
- IT'S NOT. IT'S COMPLETELY OFF
AND HE KNOWS IT, TOO.

150
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,291
- HUH?
- NICE WORK!

151
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,250
- OH, THANKS!
- THANK YOU.

152
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,250
- ASAHINA.

153
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,583
UM, I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

154
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,125
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
THOSE THINGS.

155
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,625
- THANKS, HONOKA.
I'M SORRY, TOO.

156
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,000
I SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE
CONSIDERATE OF YOUR FEELINGS.

157
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,291
- I HAD A TALK
WITH MIYAMOTO SENPAI.

158
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,625
HE TOLD ME ABOUT
A SENPAI NAMED TSUDA,

159
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,625
WHO WAS ON THE TRACK
AND FIELD TEAM WITH YOU.

160
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,083
- HE DID?

161
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,708
- I THINK I UNDERSTAND,
ABOUT AKITSUKI.

162
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,250
AND WHY YOU CAN'T
MAKE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT HIM.

163
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,666
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

164
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,166
ANYWAY, I'M THINKING
ABOUT QUITTING THE CLUB.

165
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,125
- HUH, WHY?

166
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,833
- I CAN'T KEEP PUTTING MY LIFE
ON HOLD FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

167
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,083
I NEED TO MOVE ON.

168
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
- I STILL LIKE AKITSUKI
VERY MUCH.

169
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,958
BUT HE ONLY HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU

170
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,583
AND THAT'S NEVER
GOING TO CHANGE.

171
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,750
KNOWING THAT MAKES IT HARD
TO SEE HIM EVERY DAY.

172
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,583
MY HEART CAN'T HANDLE IT.

173
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,041
PLUS I'M NOT A GOOD MANAGER.

174
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,291
- BUT, HONOKA...

175
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,500
- YOU REALLY SHOULD
MAKE UP YOUR MIND EITHER WAY.

176
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
BECAUSE BOTH YOU AND AKITSUKI

177
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,833
SEEM TO BE IN A LOT
OF PAIN OVER THIS.

178
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,458
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE.

179
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,666
- SENPAI.

180
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,583
- ( yawns ) HI.

181
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,125
- GOSH, YOU SLEPT LATE,
EVEN FOR YOUR DAY OFF.

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,750
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

183
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,791
- YOUR HAIR'S A MESS!
YOU SHOULD BRUSH IT!

184
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,916
- I WILL! GEEZ!

185
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,333
WHERE'S ASAHINA?

186
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,541
- WHEN SHE FINISHED EATING,
SHE WENT BACK TO HER ROOM.

187
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,500
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING OUT.

188
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,750
- WHERE IS SHE GOING?

189
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,375
- HMM, I THINK MAYBE
SHE'S GOING BACK HOME

190
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,041
TO SEE HER PARENTS
AND VISIT HER FRIEND'S GRAVE.

191
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,333
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU LOOK SO SCARED.

192
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,041
- UH, I'M FINE.

193
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,166
- WAIT! YAMATO!

194
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,416
- ( meows )

195
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S STILL DOING THAT.

196
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,208
IS THAT YOUR ANSWER
FOR EVERYTHING, ASAHINA?

197
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,541
- HEY, YAMATO.

198
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,000
- THIS NEEDS TO STOP.

199
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:29,625
STOP VISITING HIS GRAVE.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP!

200
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,083
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS
FOREVER. LIFE IS PASSING YOU BY.

201
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,208
YOU HAVE GOT
TO MOVE ON, ASAHINA!

202
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,166
- YOUR TIMING'S PERFECT.

203
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,125
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO
ASK YOU IF YOU WANTED

204
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,833
TO COME WITH ME TODAY.

205
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,125
- HUH?

206
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,291
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

207
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,916
SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING
TO TAKE ME TO TSUDA'S GRAVE.

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,750
WHAT THE HECK
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THERE?

209
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,458
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?
WHY DID SHE BRING ME HERE?

210
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,791
- SENPAI.

211
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,625
I'M SORRY. REALLY.

212
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,708
BUT I CAN'T GO OUT
WITH YOU AFTER ALL.

213
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,000
- ASAHINA?

214
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,500
- I, UM...

215
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,916
I LIKE SOMEONE ELSE.

216
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,958
- ( gasps )

217
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,625
- HE'S IRRESPONSIBLE
AND CLUMSY, AND NOSY.

218
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,333
HE'S REALLY PUSHY, TOO.

219
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,125
AND WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING
OVER EVERYTHING.

220
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:15,208
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON,
I LIKE HIM... A LOT.

221
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,291
AND SO, I'M SORRY.

222
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,458
GOODBYE.

223
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,041
- HEY, SO, UM...

224
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,916
- ( giggles )

225
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,833
ARE YOU READY?

226
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,416
- YEAH.

227
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,750
THE EXPRESSION ON
ASAHINA'S FACE THAT DAY

228
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,958
WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

229
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:01,208
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT. MAYBE
THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

230
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,375
OR MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

231
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,750
I KNEW SHE WAS ONLY
LOOKING AT ME.

232
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,750
- THIS SUCKS!
WHY DOES MY HEAD HURT?

233
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,833
- WELL, SOME PEOPLE
CALL IT A HANGOVER.

234
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,166
YOU SHOULDN'T DRINK SO MUCH.
YOU KINDA NEED YOUR LIVER.

235
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,458
- UGH. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

236
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,333
YOU DRINK JUST AS MUCH AS I DO.

237
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,000
OH, HEY, WHAT'RE YOU
DOING HERE, SUZUKA?

238
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,125
AREN'T YOU GONNA BE
KINDA LATE FOR SCHOOL?

239
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,458
- ( gasps ) YEAH.

240
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,708
- ( chuckles ) OH, MY GOSH!
ARE YOU WAITING FOR YAMATO?

241
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:36,000
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. I WAS
JUST RESTING HERE FOR A WHILE.

242
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,125
- HEY! SUZUKA!

243
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,541
I WONDER IF SHE'S ACTUALLY
GETTING ALONG

244
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,500
WITH YAMATO THESE DAYS.
THAT'D BE WEIRD.

245
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,000
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING.

ASAHINA, I'M SORRY!

248
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,458
- AW, YOU'RE TOO LATE. SHE GOT
TIRED OF WAITING AND TOOK OFF.

249
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,708
- OH, NO. REALLY?

250
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,875
- YEAH. SHE SAID SHE HATES YOU.
- DAMN!
