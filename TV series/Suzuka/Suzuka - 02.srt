HARDER THAN THAT!

25
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,833
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

26
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:47,875
- OH, AND THE GENERATOR IS OUT
OF FUEL. YOU SHOULD FILL IT UP.

27
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,041
- THAT WAS THE NEXT THING
ON MY TO-DO LIST.

28
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,208
- DO ME A FAVOR
AND DON'T MESS UP.

29
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,416
- I THINK YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,541
- GOOD LUCK.

31
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,500
- IT'S LAME THEY EXPECT ME
TO WORK FOR FREE.

32
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,791
I KNOW I BROKE DOWN THE DOOR

33
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,750
BUT TAKING IT
OUT OF MY PAY SUCKS.

34
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,791
( sighs ) THIS IS
TAKING FOREVER.

35
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,958
ASAHINA! THIS WHOLE THING WAS
HER FAULT TO BEGIN WITH.

36
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,875
WHY ISN'T SHE HELPING ME?

37
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,791
- ( birds chirping )

38
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,791
- ( sighs ) MAN, I'M BEAT.

39
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,458
- YO! LONG TIME NO SEE.

40
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,583
- YEAH, NO KIDDING. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE, YASUNOBU?

41
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,958
- LOOKING THROUGH THIS MAGAZINE.
YOUR DOOR WAS UNLOCKED.

42
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,500
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
JUST BARGE IN AND LOUNGE!

43
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,958
AND THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE CHIPS
YOU'RE EATING!

44
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,041
- BACK OFF THE ATTITUDE, MAN. I
THOUGHT WE WERE BEST FRIENDS,

45
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,166
BUT I GUESS NOT.

46
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,666
- WHAT? WHO SAID
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS?

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,291
YASUNOBU HATTORI. BORN IN THE
CITY AND THE SAME AGE AS ME.

48
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,583
A LADIES MAN. WOMEN ARE MORE
IMPORTANT TO HIM THAN EVEN FOOD.

49
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,541
- DUDE, GOT ANY PORN MAGS
AROUND HERE?

50
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,875
- WHAT DO YOU THINK? NO!
- YOU LITTLE LIAR.

51
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,125
- WHEN I MET HIM, IT WAS
DURING MY VERY FIRST TRIP

52
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,041
TO THE CITY TO VISIT MY AUNT.

53
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,333
I HAD GOTTEN LOST
AND WAS JUST WANDERING AROUND

54
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,250
WITH MY FACE BURIED
IN MY SLEEVE.

55
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,375
( sniffling )

56
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,583
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

57
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,833
( laughs ) YOU'RE SO UGLY!

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,500
THERE'S SNOT ALL OVER YOUR FACE!

59
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,500
- UH, WHO ARE YOU?

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,833
- HERE, HAVE A TISSUE.
- OH, THANKS.

61
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,291
HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD GUY.

62
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,416
- THAT IS SO COOL THAT
YOUR AUNT OWNS THE BATHHOUSE.

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,333
- YEAH.

64
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,750
- NOW I KNOW
HOW YOU CAN THANK ME.

65
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,125
- IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT
EVERYTHING STARTED TO GO SOUTH.

66
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,666
I WOULD COME TO TOKYO
TO VISIT ONCE A YEAR.

67
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,125
- HEY, YAMATO!
TIME TO COME OUT AND PLAY!

68
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,916
- HE'S BACK AGAIN?

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,833
- LET'S SNEAK DOWNSTAIRS
AND CHECK OUT THE SECRET SPOT.

70
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,000
IT'S SHOWTIME!

71
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,375
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING!

72
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,083
- YASUNOBU, WE
SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

73
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,750
I COULD GET IN TROUBLE.

74
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,416
- I GOT A SWEET PLAN.

75
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

76
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,875
- ( girls screaming )

77
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,416
- HELP ME!
HE KEEPS PICKING ON ME!

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,875
I TRIED TO TELL HIM
WE SHOULDN'T PEEK IN THE BATH

79
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,541
BUT THEN HE PUNCHED ME
AND HE PUSHED ME IN.

80
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,416
- ( exclaims )

81
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
- AW, YOU'LL BE OKAY.

82
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,666
- EVEN AS A KID, HE KNEW EXACTLY
HOW TO PUSH THE GIRLS' BUTTONS.

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,458
- YAMATO, HOW COULD YOU?
- BUT I DIDN'T DO IT!

84
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,000
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE
TO TAKE THE HEAT.

85
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,541
- SO, YOU'RE STILL BOUNCING
AROUND WITH NO GIRLFRIEND?

86
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,625
PEOPLE ARE GONNA START TALKING,
YOU BIG DORK.

87
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,458
- AH, LEAVE ME ALONE.

88
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,416
- DON'T SWEAT IT, THOUGH.
I CAN WATCH OUT FOR YOU,

89
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,875
SINCE WE'LL BE AT THE SAME
SCHOOL AND ALL.

90
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,333
- HUH?

91
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,666
- MIHO'S BEEN KEEPING ME
UP TO DATE. SHE'S A COOL GIRL.

92
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,541
- STAY AWAY FROM MIHO!
THAT'S WHERE I DRAW THE LINE!

93
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,458
- CHILL OUT ALREADY.
I DIG THE OLDER WOMEN.

94
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,083
IF YOU ASK ME, MATURITY IS
SEXIER THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

95
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,666
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,
BRO, YOUR AUNT AYANO

96
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,000
IS QUITE THE BOMBSHELL.

97
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,916
- I DON'T CARE! NOW GET
THE HELL OUT! I MEAN IT!

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,583
- WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SO RUDE.

99
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,958
I ALWAYS LIKED THE NAME SUZUKA.
IT'S SWEET.

100
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,041
SO IS SHE A LOOKER OR WHAT?

101
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,125
- NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
SHE'S GOTTA BE, LIKE,

102
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,458
FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS OLD.

103
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,041
- REALLY? LIVING HERE?

104
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,291
- OH, YEAH. SHE'S FAT, UGLY,
GOT A NASTY ATTITUDE.

105
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,875
- Suzuka: OH, I'M SO SORRY.

106
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,208
I'M SORRY FOR BEING FAT AND UGLY
WITH A BAD ATTITUDE.

107
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,083
- NO, THAT'S NOT...

108
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,333
- YOU CREEP.

109
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,958
- HEY, ASAHINA,
PASS THE SOY SAUCE.

110
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,583
IT'S SITTING RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF YOU, SOY SAUCE.

111
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,666
- OH, GEE, THANKS.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,041
- OH, I'M FAT AND UGLY
WITH A NASTY ATTITUDE.

113
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,708
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT YOU'RE SENSING.

114
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,583
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!

115
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,583
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- OH, NOTHING.

116
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,541
- Ayano: YAMATO, WAS
THAT YASUNOBU HATTORI

117
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,000
WHO CAME BY TO SEE YOU TODAY?

118
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,541
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE WAS JUST THE NICEST BOY.

119
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,083
SO WELL-MANNERED
AND GOOD LOOKING.

120
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,291
- ( scoffs ) HE'S A LADIES MAN

121
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,166
AND HE'S NOT AS
NICE AS YOU THINK.

122
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,208
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

123
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,375
SURE THE GIRLS LIKE HIM,

124
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,833
BUT WHEN WE WERE IN
SCHOOL TOGETHER,

125
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,625
HE REALLY HAD ALL KINDS OF
FRIENDS. EVERYONE LIKED HIM.

126
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,250
- SOUNDS LIKE JEALOUSLY, YAMATO,

127
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,333
SEEING THAT
HE'S NOTHING LIKE YOU.

128
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,458
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

129
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,208
YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE
THING ABOUT ME!

130
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,083
- I CAN MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS.

131
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,791
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOU TWO?

132
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,166
- I ALMOST FORGOT.

133
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,416
YOU TWO START SCHOOL
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

134
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,125
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.
- UM, CELEBRATE?

135
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,833
- FOR MOVING IN
AND STARTING HIGH SCHOOL.

136
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,083
YOU KNOW, A NEW CHAPTER IN LIFE.
I'LL MAKE SOMETHING GOOD.

137
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:05,083
- SOUNDS GREAT! I'M IN.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO, REALLY.

138
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,166
- I KNOW, BUT I LOVE
PARTY PREPARATIONS.

139
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,250
HOWEVER, I AM GOING
TO BE BUSY TOMORROW,

140
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,041
SO MAYBE YOU TWO WOULDN'T MIND
GOING SHOPPING FOR ME.

141
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,375
- WHAT?
- HIM AND ME?

142
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,125
- WOULD YOU?
- Suzuka: OKAY.

143
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,625
- ( Yamato sighs )

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,833
- ( doorbell rings )

145
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,708
- YAMATO, GET IT IN GEAR!
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO SHOPPING,

146
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,791
REMEMBER? MOVE IT!

147
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,250
- ( in sleepy voice ) WHAT?

148
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,916
- DID YOU JUST WAKE UP?

149
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,083
YOU COULD AT LEAST
PUT SOME PANTS ON!

150
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,250
- OKAY.

151
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,375
ISN'T IT TOO EARLY IN THE DAY
FOR YOU TO START NAGGING ME?

152
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,041
- I WOULDN'T HAVE TO NAG
IF YOU WEREN'T SO SLOPPY.

153
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,541
- SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

154
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,083
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE VERY MUCH
HAS CHANGED HERE DOWNTOWN.

155
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,833
TOKYO'S EXACTLY AS I REMEMBER IT
BEING AS A KID.

156
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,250
- WELL, IT'S JUST TOO CROWDED
HERE FOR MY TASTE.

157
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,125
I DON'T CARE FOR IT.
- OH, RIGHT.

158
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,416
- LET'S GET OUR SHOPPING DONE
QUICKLY, AND GET OUTTA HERE.

159
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,625
- HUH, TOILET SEAT COVERS?

160
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,000
- YEAH, YOUR AUNT WANTED ME
TO PICK ONE UP FOR HER.

161
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,875
- WHY DON'T YOU GRAB
ONE OF THESE FROM THE SALE BIN?

162
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,583
WE'VE GOT A WHOLE LIST
OF THINGS TO GET.

163
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,750
ANY ONE WILL BE FINE.

164
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,083
- WE CAN'T JUST GRAB
THE FIRST THING WE SEE.

165
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,041
YOU JUST DON'T THINK SOMETIMES.

166
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,083
YOU COULD TRY TO BE MORE
CONSIDERATE, YOU KNOW.

167
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,291
- WHO CARES
WHICH SEAT YOU BUY HER?

168
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,416
- IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'LL BE
THE ONE WHO'S SITTING ON IT.

169
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,166
- IT'S FOR MY LANDLADY
AND YOUR AUNT.

170
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,250
JUST PRETEND LIKE YOU
CARE, ALL RIGHT?

171
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,875
- MAN, THIS IS WEAK.

172
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,916
SHOPPING WITH A WOMAN
IS ABOUT AS MUCH FUN

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,625
AS STANDING IN LINE AT THE BANK.

174
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,000
BUT IT'S TWICE AS BAD
WITH ASAHINA

175
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,791
SINCE SHE HAS THIS PERFECTIONIST
STREAK A MILE WIDE.

176
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,666
IF THIS IS WHAT PICKING OUT
A TOILET SEAT COVER IS LIKE,

177
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,250
I DREAD WHAT THE REST OF THE DAY
HOLDS FOR ME.

178
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,791
- HERE.

179
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,083
- OH, THAT'S PERFECT!
BEAUTIFUL COLOR!

180
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,416
- YOU DON'T SOUND
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

181
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,750
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT HOME
BY DINNER.

182
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,458
WE'VE BEEN SHOPPING HERE
FOR THREE HOURS,

183
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,083
AND I'VE REALIZED SOMETHING.

184
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,333
YOU'RE NOT A PERFECTIONIST,
LIKE I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

185
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,208
YOU'RE JUST VERY INDECISIVE.

186
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,041
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I
SPEND MONEY ON THE RIGHT THINGS.

187
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
- OH, SURE.

188
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,416
- ANYWAY, I'M READY
TO GO HOME NOW.

189
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,041
ALL THE BUSTLE OF THE CITY'S
MAKING ME NERVOUS.

190
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,916
- WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?
THIS CITY'S A COOL PLACE,

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,083
EVEN IF YOU WON'T ADMIT IT.

192
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,041
- I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE
WHATEVER FEELINGS I WANT.

193
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,291
- YOU JUST HAVEN'T GIVEN
THIS PLACE A CHANCE.

194
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,875
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE LUNCH, ON ME.

195
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,333
I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.
ONE BITE AND YOU'LL LOVE TOKYO.

196
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,666
- WHY ARE YOU DRAGGING ME DOWN
THIS DANK ALLEY?

197
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,083
- IT'S A SHORTCUT. JUST KEEP UP.

198
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,375
- THIS DOESN'T
IMPROVE MY OPINION.

199
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,541
- HERE WE ARE. THIS IS
THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD.

200
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,625
PINK ANGEL MASSAGE?

201
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,625
- SO THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE
PLACE? WOW. IT'S REALLY NICE.

202
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,375
- MAN! WHY'D THEY CLOSE?
THIS WAS A GREAT RESTAURANT.

203
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,083
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

204
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,333
- THEY GOT A GIRL HERE NAMED
SUZUKA. IT'S NOT YOU, IS IT?

205
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,583
- HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?
I'M GOING HOME.

206
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,708
- NO! WAIT! WE COULD FIND
ANOTHER PLACE NEARBY!

207
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,458
- NO!
- STOP RUNNING!

208
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,708
- WELL, STOP FOLLOWING ME!

209
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,958
- I PROMISE!
I'LL GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME!

210
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,041
I WON'T TAKE YOU
TO A MASSAGE PARLOR!

211
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,250
AWESOME.

212
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
( shouts )

213
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,083
- GEEZ.

214
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,583
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
THE MOST CLUMSY

215
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,666
AND LOUDMOUTHED
KNOW-IT-ALL EVER.

216
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,958
YOU GET ME TO GIVE IN,

217
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,916
THEN EVERY PLACE YOU
DRAG ME TO IS CLOSED.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,333
YOU KNOW LESS ABOUT
THIS CITY THAN I DO.

219
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,541
AND SERIOUSLY, IF ANY OF THOSE
RESTAURANTS WERE GOOD,

220
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,583
THEY WOULD STILL BE IN BUSINESS.

221
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,666
- ( exclaims )
- WHY ARE YOU STOPPING?

222
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,625
- JUST GIVE ME
TWO SECONDS, OKAY?

223
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,166
- DON'T LEAVE ME ON THE STREET!

224
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,458
- DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

225
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,458
- ( birds chirping )

226
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,125
- A SHRINE?

227
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,750
WHAT'S SOMETHING THIS NICE
DOING HERE?

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,250
IT'S SO NICE AND PEACEFUL.

229
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,250
I CAN SMELL THE EARTH
AND THE LEAVES.

230
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,625
-SORRY. THANKS FOR
WAITING FOR ME.

231
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,500
- WHERE DID YOU GO?

232
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,708
- AROUND THE CORNER.

233
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,333
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE
A WALK UP THE STAIRS?

234
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,791
- YOU PRAYING FOR SUCCESS?

235
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,125
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
AN INARI SHRINE

236
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,083
IS SUPPOSED
TO HELP WITH, SO YEAH.

237
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,625
- WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A SHOT?

238
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,916
MAYBE IT'LL HELP YOU SET A
RECORD AND BECOME FAMOUS.

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,750
- I DON'T BELIEVE
IN THAT KIND OF STUFF.

240
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,750
- YOU KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT
AND YOU'LL BE PUNISHED.

241
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,250
- I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE RELIGIOUS.

242
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,333
YOU CAME UP HERE
JUST SO YOU COULD PRAY?

243
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,041
- YEAH, SORT OF.

244
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,666
HERE.
- WHAT'S THAT?

245
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,458
- MEAT AND POTATO CROQUETTE.

246
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,666
THAT CONVENIENCE
STORE BACK THERE

247
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,333
IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CARRIES IT.

248
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,708
THE STORE IS A FRANCHISE,

249
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,083
BUT THE MANAGER LIKES TO
ADD HIS SPECIAL FAVORITES.

250
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,166
AND, LUCKY FOR YOU,
THIS HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THEM.

251
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,375
I EAT THESE RIGHT HERE
EVERY TIME I COME TO THE CITY,

252
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,291
- YOU'RE GONNA GET BUSTED EATING
LUNCH IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

253
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,125
- ENOUGH OF YOUR WORRYING.
JUST HAVE A BITE.

254
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,666
- I KNOW I'M GONNA REGRET THIS.

255
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,083
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
- I KNOW!

256
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,375
- OH, NO. IT'S NOT
THE FOOD ITSELF.

257
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,750
IT'S THE ATMOSPHERE UP HERE.
- ( laughs ) WHATEVER YOU SAY.

258
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,458
I KNOW ONLY ONE THING.
I LOVE TO PRAY AND EAT.

259
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,500
- WHEN YOU PRAYED JUST NOW,

260
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,708
WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU
HOPING WOULD HAPPEN?

261
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
- THAT I'D HAVE A STROKE OF
GOOD LUCK, FOR A CHANGE.

262
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,250
- WHAT? BUT, YAMATO,

263
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,458
WHY WOULD YOU WISH FOR
SOMETHING SO GENERIC?

264
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,916
- WHO CARES?

265
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,541
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
NOT HAVING A SPECIFIC GOAL.

266
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,333
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T BLESSED WITH
SELF-AWARENESS LIKE YOU ARE.

267
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,625
- WITH THAT ATTITUDE, NO PRAYERS
FOR SUCCESS ARE GONNA HELP.

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,458
DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU WERE FROM HIROSHIMA?

269
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,291
- CLOSE. IT'S IN THE
COUNTRYSIDE,

270
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,000
JUST OUTSIDE HIROSHIMA.

271
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,958
- WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE
YOU DECIDE TO MOVE

272
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,666
SO FAR AWAY FROM YOUR HOME
TO START OFF HIGH SCHOOL?

273
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,416
- HMM. THERE WASN'T ONE THING
THAT DID IT.

274
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,750
I'VE JUST ALWAYS LIKED NEW
BEGINNINGS AND ENVIRONMENTS.

275
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,791
IT'S WHEN I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING
THE MOST OUT OF MY LIFE.

276
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,416
IT KEEPS ME HAPPY
AND ON MY TOES.

277
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,041
- OH.

278
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,291
- I LOVE TOKYO. I THOUGHT THAT
LIVING HERE WOULD BE A BLAST.

279
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,708
BETTER THAN MOVING TO A CITY

280
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,375
ONLY HALF AS BIG AND
HALF AS FUN, RIGHT?

281
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,041
- I DIDN'T WANT
TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

282
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,208
I WANTED TO STAY IN SCHOOL
WITH THE SAME FRIENDS

283
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,708
I'VE ALWAYS HAD.
THAT'S ALL I WANTED.

284
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,458
I WAS ONLY JUMPING THE HIGH JUMP
FOR FUN UNTIL THE SCOUTS CAME.

285
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,416
THEN EVERYONE STARTED TELLING ME
I SHOULD GET OUT WHILE I COULD.

286
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,083
GO TO A GOOD SCHOOL.
I NEVER WANTED TO BE HERE.

287
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,500
THE WHOLE CITY IS OVERCROWDED.

288
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,750
AND THE PEOPLE
COULDN'T BE RUDER.

289
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,125
AND I HAVE
A VERY WEIRD NEIGHBOR.

290
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,833
BUT THAT WEIRD NEIGHBOR
HAS HELPED ME

291
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,291
TO BREAK MY HIGH JUMP RECORD

292
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,833
AND HE SHOWED ME A REALLY
NICE PLACE TO HAVE LUNCH TODAY.

293
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,291
IT MAY BE JUST A LITTLE BIT,

294
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,208
BUT I'M STARTING TO
LIKE IT HERE.

295
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,416
IN THE CITY.
- RIGHT. OF COURSE. THE CITY.

296
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,541
- WELL, I GUESS I OWE YOU
A HUGE THANK YOU

297
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,750
FOR SHOWING ME AROUND.

298
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,041
- WHY NOT? THANK ME, SURE.

299
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,583
- WE SHOULD HURRY BACK HOME. I'M
SURE YOUR AUNT IS WAITING ON US.

300
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,375
- RIGHT. WELL, HEY, WAIT UP!

301
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,416
- Ayano: CONGRATULATIONS,
SUZUKA AND YAMATO!

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,541
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS!
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED!

303
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,458
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME, AYANO.

304
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,708
- WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

305
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,083
- THE THREE OF YOU ARE GOING
TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL,

306
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,875
SO I FIGURED THIS WOULD BE FINE.

307
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,250
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

308
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,625
- IT'S SO CUTE THAT
YOU'RE STARTING HIGH SCHOOL.

309
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,250
I REMEMBER THE INNOCENT
DAYS OF MY YOUTH

310
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,500
LIKE THEY WERE YESTERDAY!

311
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY HAD ANY

312
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,041
INNOCENT DAYS IN YOUR LIFE.

313
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

314
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,583
- Miho: WHY ARE YOU TWO
HERE ANYWAY?

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,916
- WE JUST WANTED
TO OFFER OUR REGARDS.

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,625
- THE MORE PEOPLE THE BETTER,
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.

317
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,500
- THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE HERE
IS TO GET A FREE MEAL

318
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,083
OFF MY MOTHER.

319
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,541
- I MADE PLENTY OF
FOOD TO GO AROUND.

320
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,250
YOU CAN HAVE AS
MUCH AS YOU LIKE.

321
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,875
- SO LET'S EAT.
- All: LET'S EAT!

322
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,208
- HERE'S SOME FOR YOU, GORO.

323
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,458
- I GOTTA SAY, THIS IS THE
BEST HOME COOKING EVER!

324
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,083
YOU COULD BE A
PROFESSIONAL CHEF!

325
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,583
- THANKS. YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME
TO DINNER. YOU KNOW THAT.

326
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,041
- I MIGHT TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.
- YEAH, I'LL BET.

327
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,041
- I FEEL STUPID.
I LEFT THE WINE BEHIND.

328
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,583
- GOT YA COVERED.

329
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,708
- AREN'T YOU JUST ON TOP
OF EVERYTHING?

330
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,041
- A RED WINE TO MATCH
THE COLOR OF YOUR VELVET LIPS.

331
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,333
- WHAT AN ASS.

332
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,333
- SAOTOME, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
NOT TO DRINK TOO MUCH TONIGHT.

333
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,791
- LIKE YOU'RE ONE
TO TALK, MEGUMI.

334
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,375
SO, MEGUMI, AM I MISTAKEN OR
ARE YOU A GRAD SCHOOL STUDENT?

335
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,125
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- THEN YOU MUST BE VERY SMART.

336
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,666
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND
TIME IN YOUR SCHEDULE

337
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,375
TO TUTOR ME SOMETIME.

338
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,333
- I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HELP.

339
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,416
- WAY TO GO, MEGUMI. HE'S HOT.

340
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
AND HE SEEMS TO LIKE
MORE THAN YOUR BOOBS.

341
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,375
- STOP IT!
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY!

342
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,166
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

343
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,500
- YOU ALWAYS BRIGHTEN
THE ROOM, YASUNOBU.

344
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,750
- YEAH! LIKE A DEAD LIGHT BULB.

345
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,250
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO STOP TALKING NOW.

346
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,958
- I LIKE CHEERFUL PEOPLE.

347
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,291
- Ayano: I THINK THAT'S
ENOUGH FUN FOR ONE NIGHT,

348
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,083
BOYS AND GIRLS.

349
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,666
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

350
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,916
- Yuka: I DON'T WANNA GO HOME.
LET'S HAVE A POST-PARTY PARTY!

351
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,416
- Yasunobu: GOOD IDEA.
- Megumi: HOW 'BOUT YOU, YAMATO?

352
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,958
- UM, NO THANKS.
I'LL HAVE TO PASS.

353
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,750
I WAS TIRED, MAN. WHY'D YOU DRAG
ME OUT HERE WITH YOU?

354
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,125
- BECAUSE MY NEW FRIEND YUKA
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE

355
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,875
A BOX OF RICE CRACKERS.

356
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,458
- I DON'T GET IT. YOU'LL DO
ANYTHING A GIRL ASKS YOU TO.

357
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,666
- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BE TAKING NOTES.

358
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,083
- SERIOUSLY? THE CRAP YOU
PULL JUST TO GET GIRLS

359
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,500
TO LIKE YOU AMAZES ME.

360
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,208
- COME ON, MAN. YOU KNOW
I DON'T SAY IT UNLESS I MEAN IT.

361
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:48,041
AND ANYWAY, NAME ME ANY GIRL
WHO DOESN'T LIKE SOME FLATTERY.

362
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,541
- I WONDER IF SOME KIND WORDS
MIGHT WORK ON ASAHINA.

363
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,083
SO GROW A PAIR ALREADY
AND GIVE THE GIRL A COMPLIMENT.

364
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,291
- NO, MAN. I CAN'T DO THAT!

365
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,416
- I KNOW.
SUCKS TO BE YOU. ( scoffs )

366
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,000
- WHAT! WHATEVER.

367
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,708
- THAT SUZUKA IS
ONE FINE LOOKING YOUNG LADY.

368
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,375
SO, WHY'D YOU TELL ME
SHE WAS FAT AND UGLY?

369
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,416
THERE SOME REASON YOU DIDN'T
TELL YOUR GOOD FRIEND

370
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,541
THE TRUTH ABOUT HER?

371
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,541
- NO. NOTHING SEEMS
TO COME TO MIND.

372
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,083
- OH, OKAY, GOOD THEN.

373
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,666
THAT MEANS I CAN ASK HER OUT.

374
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,625
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A THING
FOR ATHLETES.

375
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,583
- SINCE WHEN?
SHE'D NEVER GO OUT WITH YOU.

376
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,208
YOU'RE NOWHERE
NEAR HER TYPE!

377
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,375
- OH, YEAH? LET'S FIND OUT.

378
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,833
YO, SUZUKA!

379
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,750
- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE
GONNA HAVE AN AFTER-PARTY.

380
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,833
- WE ARE. WE'RE JUST ON
A SNACK RUN. HOW ABOUT YOU?

381
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,541
ISN'T IT KINDA LATE
TO BE RUNNING?

382
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,000
NOT IF YOU'RE ME.

383
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,333
I MISSED SOME MILES TODAY
THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE UP.

384
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,333
- WOW, YOU'RE REALLY DEDICATED.
I RESPECT THAT, BUT YOU

385
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,916
SHOULDN'T BE OUT HERE ALL ALONE.
LET ME WALK YOU HOME, OKAY?

386
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,916
- YOU SURE?
- OH, NO, I INSIST.

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,750
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT THE SNACKS WE
WERE GETTING?

388
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,125
- I THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

389
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,208
COME ON, MAN,
HELP A BROTHER OUT.

390
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,333
- NO WAY! I'M WALKING ASAHINA
BACK HOME!

391
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,166
COME ON, LET'S GO.
- LET GO OF ME. I'M NOT A DOG!

392
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
YAMATO!

393
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,875
- SCORE ONE FOR YAMATO.
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU, BUDDY.

394
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,291
( chuckles ) YOU'LL NEED IT.

395
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,208
- YOU CAN LET GO OF MY ARM NOW!
I'M LOOSING CIRCULATION!

396
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,666
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

397
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,833
- IT'S... IT'S NOTHING.

398
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,916
- I KNOW. SUCKS TO BE YOU.

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,833
- I'M NOT GONNA MISS MY CHANCE.
I CAN DO THIS.

400
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,208
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, ASAHINA?
- WHAT?

401
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,666
- I WAS LOOKING
AT YOUR EARS EARLIER.

402
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,375
AND YOU KNOW, I THINK
THEY'RE REALLY NICE.

403
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,500
- ( scoffs )

404
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,375
- I MEAN THEY'RE
PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL

405
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,625
AND THEY'RE MOUNTED AT
JUST THE RIGHT SPOTS

406
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,750
ON YOUR HEAD.

407
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,083
- ARE YOU HAVING
SOME KIND OF SEIZURE?

408
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,541
- WHAT? A SEIZURE?

409
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,291
NO, I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A COMPLIMENT

410
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,875
BUT YOU'RE NOT
BEING NICE AT ALL!

411
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,791
- OH, WELL... MAYBE
THAT'S BECAUSE

412
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,625
I'M AN UGLY, FAT, OLD WOMAN
WITH A NASTY ATTITUDE!

413
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,833
- YOU'RE STILL STUCK ON THAT?
GET OVER IT!

414
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,000
- I'M NO WORSE THAN SOMEONE
WHO SPREADS THOSE LIES

415
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,833
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

416
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

417
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,500
- THIS IS SO
FREAKIN' HUMILIATING.

418
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,000
( sighs ) YOU LOOK SO COOL
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE

419
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,458
DOING THE HIGH JUMP.

420
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,750
BUT THE SECOND
YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH...

421
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,833
- WHAT?

422
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,958
DID YOU JUST TELL ME
THAT YOU THINK I'M COOL?

423
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,583
- YEAH. I WAS FASCINATED BY YOU
THE MOMENT I FIRST SAW YOU.

424
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
- NO ONE HAS EVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO ME.

425
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,750
SO THANKS I GUESS.

426
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,416
BUT, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE...
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

427
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,375
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYONE HIGH JUMP BEFORE.

428
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,166
- YOU MIGHT JUST BE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT,

429
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,375
BUT I'M A PRETTY GOOD JUDGE

430
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,791
OF WHAT LOOKS GOOD
AND WHAT DOESN'T.

431
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,333
- YOU ARE? BECAUSE TO BE HONEST,

432
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,041
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU PAY
MUCH ATTENTION TO ANYTHING.

433
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,000
- TRUST ME.
I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

434
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,791
YOU LOOK GREAT OUT THERE!
REALLY! BEAUTIFUL! MAGNIFICENT!

435
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,250
- ( giggles )

436
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,500
- I SUPPOSE THAT WAS ALL
I NEEDED. THAT MOMENT.

437
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,208
I'M FEELING...

438
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,458
- WHAT?

439
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,833
- OH, SORRY, I WAS DAYDREAMING.

440
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,791
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU, ASAHINA.

441
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,833
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO SAY IT.

442
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,791
