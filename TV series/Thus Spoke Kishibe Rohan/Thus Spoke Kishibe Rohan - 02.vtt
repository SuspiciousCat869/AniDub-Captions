So, uh...

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:16.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
Rohan Sensei?

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:18.318 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry to bother you
with this,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.954 position:24% line:71% align:start
but I'd like to ask
for a favor,

00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:21.154 position:30% line:77% align:start
if that's okay.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.160 position:35% line:71% align:start
All right,
let's hear it then.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:29.697 position:27% line:89% align:start
Short version is,

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:33.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
this spring, I have
some plans to travel abroad.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.168 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] Do you now?
Where to?

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.704 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh... To Italy.

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:37.572 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:38.907 position:41% line:89% align:start
Italy?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.208 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes! Which brings me
to my request.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.810 position:27% line:83% align:start
Could you please
use Heaven's Door

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:44.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
to make me fluent
in Italian?

00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:47.080 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to need you
to make a better case

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
for why I'd ever
do any such thing.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
Okay, truth is I've never
left the country alone,

00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:54.756 position:35% line:83% align:start
and I feel
extremely nervous,

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:56.691 position:19% line:89% align:start
so, at the very least,

00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:59.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd really like to be able
to speak the language.

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.029 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please help me out!

[Rohan]
Bound for Italy, huh?

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:06.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you'd like
to hear a story

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.635 position:16% line:89% align:start
about my own time there.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:09.136 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
When we first met,

00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:12.507 position:33% line:83% align:start
I was forced
on a brief hiatus

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.142 position:19% line:83% align:start
due, in no small part,
to a certain someone.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.209 position:30% line:89% align:start
(booming noise)

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.046 position:13% line:89% align:start
During that period of time,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
I undertook some research
for my work,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.149 position:19% line:83% align:start
a journey which took me
to Venice,

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.484 position:30% line:83% align:start
where I stayed
for eight days.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.286 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
And the story I discovered

00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:28.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
was truly mind-boggling.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:39.466 position:21% line:89% align:start

I've come back for a visit

00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.424 position:35% line:83% align:start
to give you
what you deserve.

00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:04.659 position:38% line:89% align:start
(choking)

00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:06.393 position:30% line:83% align:start
Young mistress,
are you all right?

00:12:06.427 --> 00:12:08.095 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant]
Shut your mouth!

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.799 position:21% line:89% align:start
(struggled groaning)

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:14.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's fine, your daughter
will get her body back

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:15.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
when we're done.

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:18.272 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please stop this!
Let go of me!

00:12:18.305 --> 00:12:19.541 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're making a mistake!

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:21.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've never wronged you
in any way!

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.410 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is that what you
really think?

00:12:23.444 --> 00:12:25.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
Bold thing to say
to a dead man

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:26.780 position:21% line:83% align:start
after enjoying a life
filled with

00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:28.215 position:13% line:89% align:start
everything you ever wanted.

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:31.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
Riches, renown, family,
am I right?

00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:33.320 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tell me, did you
truly believe

00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:36.123 position:19% line:83% align:start
you got here all alone,
without anyone secretly

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:38.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
pulling the strings
from beyond?! Huh?!

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.761 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant] Yes, I wanted you
to be at your peak

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:42.697 position:16% line:89% align:start
before I struck you down.

00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:44.231 position:24% line:83% align:start
If only to give you
a small taste

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:46.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
of the despair
you wrought on me.

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:49.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(dramatic booming)
-But, now, I'm not sure.

00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:51.105 position:27% line:83% align:start
On the one hand,
killing you

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
is the only thing
that will bring me peace.

00:12:53.474 --> 00:12:55.744 position:13% line:83% align:start
But, on the other, it would
be a shame if you died

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:57.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
sincerely believing
you were innocent,

00:12:58.012 --> 00:13:00.981 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I'd hate to perpetuate
any more injustice.

00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:03.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
That'd be the worst,
wouldn't it?

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.985 position:27% line:83% align:start
So tell you what
we're gonna do.

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:06.721 position:35% line:83% align:start
How's about
we let fate decide

00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:08.989 position:30% line:83% align:start
whether or not
you deserve to die today?

00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:10.491 position:41% line:83% align:start
-(gasp)
-That's right,

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:12.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
you've still got
a chance at life,

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:14.495 position:21% line:83% align:start
if the heavens agree
with you, that is.

00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:15.996 position:13% line:89% align:start
If destiny takes your side

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.599 position:30% line:83% align:start
and my grudges
are deemed baseless,

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:19.433 position:30% line:83% align:start
then I'll spare
your miserable life

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
and disappear,

00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:22.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you'll never
hear from me again.

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.905 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nobody could ask
for a more impartial judge.

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:26.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, wouldn't you agree?

00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:28.008 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant]
Well, will you try your luck

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:29.910 position:19% line:89% align:start
or die where you stand?

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
I-I have no idea what
you're going on about...

00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:34.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll understand soon.
Now, answer!

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:37.384 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you accept
these conditions or not?

00:13:37.418 --> 00:13:40.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Confessor] <i>Why?! Why is</i>
 <i>this happening to me?!</i>

00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:41.656 position:27% line:89% align:start
Speak, you idiot!

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.990 position:33% line:83% align:start
Use that head
to think quickly,

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:44.258 position:41% line:83% align:start
or else
I'm cutting it off.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:47.161 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(dramatic boom)
-(struggled groaning)

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
Y-Yes, I accept
the conditions.

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:50.964 position:30% line:89% align:start
(dramatic boom)

00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:53.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Confessor] What other
choice do I have?!

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.737 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(dramatic boom)
-Good.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(intense boom)
-Catch!

00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
(panicked gasping)

00:14:00.074 --> 00:14:01.609 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant]
Destiny can manifest

00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:04.411 position:13% line:89% align:start
in ways we often overlook.

00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:07.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
Throw a piece of popcorn
higher than that streetlamp

00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:09.651 position:13% line:83% align:start
and catch it in your mouth
as it falls.

00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:11.686 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do it three times in a row.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.254 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you succeed,
destiny is on your side,

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:16.156 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I'll disappear
as promised.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.859 position:33% line:83% align:start
A silly game
is deciding my fate?

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:20.528 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll remind you
that my fate

00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:22.329 position:33% line:83% align:start
will also be
affected by this.

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:25.600 position:27% line:83% align:start
You better watch
what you call a silly game.

00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:28.135 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant] You'll throw
as soon as I clap my hands.

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:29.903 position:30% line:83% align:start
If the popcorn
doesn't fly high enough

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:32.507 position:21% line:83% align:start
or you take too long,
I'll kill you immediately.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
So get ready, 'cause
we're starting right now!

00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:37.277 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, wait!
Please give me a moment!

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:40.481 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:41.750 position:30% line:89% align:start
(intense music)

00:14:41.783 --> 00:14:44.284 position:24% line:89% align:start
Up it goes, and...

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.486 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant]
Clear.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
But why?! Why am I being
forced to do this?!

00:14:48.857 --> 00:14:50.090 position:21% line:89% align:start
(struggled grunting)

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:51.392 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can see it falling.

[Confessor]
(grunt)

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.975 position:41% line:83% align:start
(gasp)
That was way too close,

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.343 position:19% line:89% align:start
but I actually did it!

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.411 position:33% line:89% align:start
I caught it!

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:12.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Confessor] (laugh)
That's one down.

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.582 position:35% line:89% align:start
(growling)

00:15:14.616 --> 00:15:16.016 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's time for round two.

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:17.985 position:24% line:83% align:start
Grab another piece
of popcorn and let's go.

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:19.788 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Confessor] N-No, wait!
Please!

00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.589 position:13% line:89% align:start
Th-The sun was in my eyes!

00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:22.990 position:33% line:83% align:start
It completely
blinded me!

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:25.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can just continue this
in the shade, right?

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant] Next, you'll ask
for a juice box

00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.462 position:19% line:89% align:start
and a pat on the head.

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:29.296 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant]
Huh?

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:31.365 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll throw the popcorn
right here,

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:33.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
and you'll throw it
right now!

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.169 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Vagrant] Two more to go.
Hop to it!

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:37.971 position:30% line:83% align:start
And, remember,
if you miss, you die.

00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:39.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(scared whimpering)
-And, if you succeed,

00:15:39.607 --> 00:15:42.844 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll disappear without
saying another word.

00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:45.446 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, your second throw.
Now!

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:47.849 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intensifying noise)

00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:49.751 position:21% line:89% align:start
If I make all three,

00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:51.452 position:13% line:83% align:start
you swear you'll disappear
for good?

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:52.386 position:24% line:89% align:start
(dramatic booming)

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:55.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's what it'll take
to save my life,

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.591 position:30% line:89% align:start
then so be it.

00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:57.458 position:33% line:89% align:start
Enough talk,

00:15:57.491 --> 00:16:00.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
make your throw now
or you're dead!

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:05.900 position:33% line:83% align:start
All right...
Yeah!

00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:08.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
This will be way easier
with the sun obscured,

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.437 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can see it coming
straight down to me.

the second one in the can!

Boom, that's right!
I'm on a roll!

Man,
I can't believe I thought

those spooky,
