(light switch noise)

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.139 position:24% line:89% align:start
I could boast about

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.042 position:33% line:83% align:start
how my injury
was earned in battle,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I take no pride in
how that battle transpired.

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.280 position:33% line:83% align:start
My right hand
is getting better,

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.315 position:21% line:89% align:start
but it'll take time.

[Rohan] While
the intermediate phalanx

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
of my little finger
is merely cracked,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.888 position:33% line:83% align:start
in my middle
and ring fingers,

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:55.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fourth and fifth
metacarpals

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
and proximal phalanges
are completely fractured,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
and will take
four weeks to heal.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.630 position:13% line:89% align:start
For once, I honestly regret

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
the actions I took
during this incident.

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.034 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's clear that this stemmed

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.736 position:33% line:83% align:start
from a fault
in my personality.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.573 position:16% line:83% align:start
I crossed a red line that
wasn't meant to be crossed.

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:14.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stuck my nose into
someone else's business.

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:18.111 position:16% line:83% align:start
I prided myself on being
able to see the truth

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
of a person's character.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:22.382 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, I know I was foolish.

-(chair creak)
-(sigh of relief)

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everything above my wrist
is intact,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.770 position:13% line:83% align:start
only thanks to a stroke of
pure blind luck that day.

You know what makes
an actor or a model a star?

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.915 position:21% line:83% align:start
They can draw you in

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:35.516 position:30% line:83% align:start
even if they're

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.885 position:30% line:83% align:start
That comes from
training your body.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
Talent has nothing
on a body

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.123 position:19% line:83% align:start

Okay, that's it.

00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:34.542 position:35% line:89% align:start
Perfection.

Sure, I might have lied
about the rep counts,

but lying's just what I do.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.315 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Coach] And you made it
through a whole week

Yeah, sorry.

Gotta say it,

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.383 position:30% line:83% align:start
your routine's
really working.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, your abs
are looking spectacular!

You look like...

00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:55.089 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I know!

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:56.991 position:30% line:83% align:start
Like Brad Pitt

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.125 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.527 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're amazing!

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.929 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who knew it was possible
to get so jacked that fast?

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.664 position:38% line:89% align:start
But wow!

00:06:03.698 --> 00:06:06.499 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you were the star
of a detective movie,

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:08.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
you'd be fantastic.

Oh, by the way,

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
the cod roe spaghetti
is ready.

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:14.909 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's eat it
while it's hot.

00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:16.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, spaghetti?

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:17.612 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mika] Yeah.

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:19.580 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Yoma] Didn't I tell you
before, Mika?

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:22.683 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm not eating
carbs or fats.

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:23.951 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.452 position:24% line:89% align:start
I only eat protein.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.453 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's better
for developing muscles

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.555 position:16% line:89% align:start
and all that other crap.

00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:29.489 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Yoma]
This is my menu.

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:31.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
I expect you to stick to it.

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is this all you're
going to eat now?

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:35.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
But, what about tonight,

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:37.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
when we go out for drinks
with all our friends?

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.633 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, I won't
be going to that.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:40.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm running 10 K
at 4:00 A.M. tomorrow.

00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:42.402 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Yoma]
I'm off to bed.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:45.106 position:24% line:83% align:start
Bed? But it's only
7:00 in the evening.

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:49.310 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mika] Wait, there's
no money in my wallet.

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:51.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Yoma] Oh, right.
I forgot to tell you.

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:53.480 position:27% line:83% align:start
My gym was having
a special deal

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:55.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
on protein powder.

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:58.719 position:19% line:83% align:start
2,000 grams for 4,800,
chocolate flavor too.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.521 position:33% line:89% align:start
Super cheap.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:02.523 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Yoma] Definitely cheaper

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:07.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
since I've even
heard from him.

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:09.323 position:27% line:89% align:start
What should I do?

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:10.124 position:19% line:89% align:start
I haven't had any luck

00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:11.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
trying to contact him
either.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:15.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
Same rules as last time
work for you?

00:13:15.362 --> 00:13:16.497 position:38% line:83% align:start
Remember,
touch the remote

00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:18.465 position:30% line:83% align:start
before 25 kph,
and you lose.

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.835 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey now,
what's with the look?

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:22.936 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hold on a sec,

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.405 position:35% line:83% align:start
you're not
playing around, huh?

00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:25.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(wooshing noise)
-I see.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.875 position:19% line:83% align:start
Still holding a grudge
from our previous run.

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:44.024 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah,

00:13:44.058 --> 00:13:46.761 position:21% line:83% align:start

an actor and a model.

00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:48.596 position:30% line:83% align:start
How's work been
treating you lately?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.963 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Rohan Sensei.
-(pant)

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:53.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
I recommend you focus
entirely on your running.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.935 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've accepted
your challenge.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:56.870 position:13% line:89% align:start
The competition has begun.

00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:59.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
This won't play out
like before.

It didn't look
like that last time.

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:28.102 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] Your name is
Yoma Hashimoto, right?

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.804 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're 21, aren't you?

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.873 position:27% line:83% align:start

Your sides!

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.908 position:27% line:83% align:start
How did you build
all that muscle?

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:38.011 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those serratus anteriors!
That's no mere six pack.

00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:39.614 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your muscle definition's

00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:41.115 position:30% line:83% align:start
beyond anything
I've ever seen.

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your serratus anteriors
are...

00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:44.485 position:33% line:83% align:start
-incredible!
-(intense music)

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:48.222 position:10% line:83% align:start

-19 K per hour.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.637 position:33% line:83% align:start
Rohan Sensei,
during our last race,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.472 position:24% line:83% align:start
you sneakily struck
the table with your fingers.

00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:06.440 position:13% line:89% align:start
It knocked the remote over

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:08.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
in a way that gave you
an unfair edge.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yoma] You caused the remote
to fall into your hand.

00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:15.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
It seems the scales
were unbalanced.

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:17.351 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not a true match.

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.821 position:33% line:83% align:start
A competition
should not be ambiguous.

00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:22.456 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Yoma] That's not gonna fly
this time around.

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:23.758 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute, now.

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:25.092 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're just playing
a game here.

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:28.730 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah. A little game between
two buddies at the gym.

00:15:28.763 --> 00:15:29.997 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just playing around,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.633 position:33% line:83% align:start
but if you're
not playing fair,

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:32.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
there's no way
to name a winner.

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:35.302 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's even truer
for a rematch.

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.639 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have to make sure
everything is done right.

00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:39.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
Revenge is only worth it
when it's taken fairly.

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:42.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of this because you
couldn't grab the remote?

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:45.112 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you saying that
I'm a cheater or something?

00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:47.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm just saying our game
is gonna be fair!

Hold on.
Did you--?

00:16:31.593 --> 00:16:34.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
Competition's lurking behind
every aspect of our lives.

00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:36.196 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why fairness
is so vital.

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.365 position:35% line:83% align:start
If you live
without fairness,

Whoever takes
the remote first

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:48.610 position:24% line:83% align:start
will win a perfect,

Oh, it's a little
too early for that.

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:06.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like you said, we can't
press the stop button

00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:09.129 position:19% line:89% align:start
until we reach 25 kph.

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yoma] Which of us will grab
the remote first?

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.768 position:19% line:83% align:start
I left you two fingers
to press the button.

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:15.870 position:27% line:89% align:start
That is fairness,

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:17.005 position:21% line:89% align:start
so neither one of us

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
can hold a grudge
when it's over.

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:20.407 position:27% line:83% align:start
The entire point
of a rematch

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
is to decide the true
winner, isn't it?

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:03.551 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Really bad!

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:04.786 position:27% line:89% align:start
(thumping noise)

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:07.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] <i>If I don't get</i>
 <i>that remote before he does,</i>

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:08.322 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(intensifying music)
-I'm <i>dead!</i>

(panting)

(intense groaning)

00:18:20.068 --> 00:18:23.403 position:24% line:89% align:start
(intense groaning)

00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:26.173 position:24% line:89% align:start
(intense groaning)

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:28.509 position:24% line:89% align:start
(intense groaning)

00:18:28.543 --> 00:18:30.912 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Both]
(panting)

00:18:30.945 --> 00:18:32.112 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:18:32.647 --> 00:18:33.715 position:27% line:89% align:start
(strained groan)

00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:36.149 position:41% line:83% align:start
-(gasp)
-I won!

00:18:36.183 --> 00:18:39.152 position:38% line:83% align:start
(holler)
I beat you!

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:40.220 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:41.756 position:33% line:83% align:start
I went for it
with everything I had.

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:44.792 position:19% line:83% align:start
(pant) Make no mistake,
your movements were quicker

00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:46.094 position:27% line:83% align:start
and more elegant
than mine.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.328 position:33% line:83% align:start
This victory
is indisputably yours.

-(pant)
-(wooshing noise)

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:52.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] Too bad for you,
I've got Heaven's Door,

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:54.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
the power to make someone
into a book,

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.236 position:21% line:89% align:start
and rewrite them too.

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:58.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just now, I took the chance
to write in you,

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:00.908 position:30% line:83% align:start
but, as far as
our competition's concerned,

00:19:00.942 --> 00:19:01.976 position:35% line:89% align:start
you've won.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] I concede.
Isn't that enough?

00:19:04.078 --> 00:19:05.079 position:27% line:89% align:start
(clicking noise)

00:19:05.113 --> 00:19:06.547 position:24% line:89% align:start

-[Yoma] (gasp)
-(screeching noise)

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.349 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were the one
who ultimately

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:11.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
-pressed the button.
-Huh?

00:19:11.085 --> 00:19:12.553 position:21% line:89% align:start
(struggled groaning)

00:19:12.587 --> 00:19:15.489 position:24% line:89% align:start
(intense drumming)

00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:18.458 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic noise)

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:19.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
Rohan.

 <i>to the scene down below.</i>

 <i>Even if I did,</i>

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.516 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'm sure I wouldn't see Yoma</i>
 <i>at the bottom.</i>

00:19:42.884 --> 00:19:43.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>He may be clinging to</i>

00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:45.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>the side of the building</i>
 <i>somewhere.</i>

(soft piano music continues)

[Rohan] <i>I need to get out</i>

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:53.427 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>I need to escape.</i>

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:59.466 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Though I didn't intend to,</i>
 <i>I crossed the red line.</i>

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:03.504 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>If I looked out</i>
 <i>of this window now,</i>

00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:06.507 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>if I stuck my head out</i>
 <i>as if to look down upon him,</i>

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.342 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>he would probably kill me.</i>

00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:14.615 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>The muscles on his back</i>
 <i>were in the shape of wings.</i>

00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:18.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>The ones above</i>
 <i>his ankles too.</i>

00:20:18.452 --> 00:20:20.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>And, when the wind</i>
 <i>blew through his hair,</i>

00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:22.489 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>I saw them behind his ears.</i>

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:26.460 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>They were a symbol,</i>
 <i>I'm sure of it.</i>

00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:29.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>He's a man possessed.</i>
 <i>The wings were the sign.</i>

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:33.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>He is possessed</i>
 <i>by the god of muscle.</i>

 <i>for that remote.</i>

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.419 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's the truth.</i>

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:55.857 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>But that still doesn't mean</i>
 <i>he'll ever accept it.</i>

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:58.126 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>I sincerely hope</i>
