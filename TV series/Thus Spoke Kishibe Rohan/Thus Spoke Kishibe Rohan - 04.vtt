00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:12.514 position:33% line:89% align:start
(piano music)

00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:13.615 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
(breathes)

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.083 position:35% line:89% align:start
Extend arms

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.052 position:30% line:83% align:start
and bend wrists
at precisely 90 degrees,

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
making sure to keep
each finger straight.

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:23.023 position:27% line:89% align:start
(straining groan)

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.094 position:38% line:89% align:start
(exhale)

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:30.230 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then palms up in front,
straighten elbows.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whilst maintaining
the 90-degree angles,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
bend each finger.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.137 position:10% line:89% align:start
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:40.274 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, open your hands
back up.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:43.210 position:10% line:89% align:start
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.746 position:38% line:89% align:start
And done.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:48.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
(relaxed sigh)

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.852 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now you are ready
to draw manga.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's begin, shall we?

00:00:55.322 --> 00:01:00.494 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] Let's talk about
your summer deadline,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.072 position:33% line:89% align:start
Rohan Sensei.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.740 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope you haven't
forgotten about

00:01:45.773 --> 00:01:47.575 position:16% line:89% align:start
the 45-page one-shot due.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.877 position:27% line:83% align:start
Have you at least
settled on a story yet?

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:52.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] Hmm...
One moment.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
(scribbling noise)

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.284 position:30% line:83% align:start
A solar eclipse
might be a good theme.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.787 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] Oh yeah,
that's an amazing hook!

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:01.188 position:35% line:89% align:start
I love it!

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.091 position:33% line:83% align:start
But you know
what else sounds cool?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.826 position:19% line:83% align:start
What if you drew for us
a manga about

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
buying a beautiful
holiday villa in the hills?

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.164 position:41% line:89% align:start
(groan)

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:13.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry, come again?

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
It doesn't look like
you're into the idea.

00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:18.138 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's such a shame.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, you hold on
just a minute.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.778 position:21% line:83% align:start
I need you to explain
what you meant

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:24.812 position:16% line:89% align:start
by a villa in the hills.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:26.413 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was an idea for a story.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.348 position:35% line:83% align:start
But, like,
you could also totally go

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
and do it for real,
and see if, maybe,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
a bolt of inspiration
strikes you.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.687 position:41% line:89% align:start
Enough!

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stop acting like you
don't know what I mean!

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:37.457 position:10% line:83% align:start
I took issue with the buying
part of what you said.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.993 position:24% line:89% align:start
You know full well

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:40.528 position:30% line:83% align:start
that I recently
declared bankruptcy

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
due to a purchase
of that very nature.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:43.831 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Rohan Sensei,

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:45.399 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't want
anything from you

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:47.669 position:16% line:89% align:start
other than a good story.

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:48.836 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here.
-(hesitant gasp)

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.972 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Kyoka] Look at this.
-Hmm...

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:52.707 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Quite the discovery, huh?

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a little village
nestled in the hills

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
with no connecting roads.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
And, yet, it's got about
a dozen luxury villas.

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:01.314 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet you never would
have guessed

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.550 position:13% line:89% align:start
there was a place like this

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:05.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
just a few hours
northwest of Morio.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.288 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's so weird seeing such
a developed patch of land

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.591 position:27% line:83% align:start
without any roads
or power lines.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.628 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Rohan] Hmm...
-They're not hooked up

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.564 position:24% line:83% align:start
to a power grid or
any other public utility,

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:18.666 position:30% line:83% align:start
yet they've got
working electricity

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
and transportation.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:21.936 position:33% line:83% align:start
Judging from
all those helipads,

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.071 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm going to assume

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:24.772 position:27% line:83% align:start
that these people
get around mainly by air.

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:25.707 position:27% line:89% align:start
You may be right.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
It certainly seems
like they can afford it.

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.143 position:30% line:89% align:start
And, is it me,

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:30.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
or does that building
by the tennis court

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:32.180 position:21% line:89% align:start
have an Isetan logo?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.313 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wow, it does!

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
They have one there?
Good for them!

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.452 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, and one more thing.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.353 position:30% line:83% align:start
At the moment,
one of those villas

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
-is accessible to you.
-(surprise)

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.291 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right,
for 3 million yen.

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:45.593 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
(grunt)

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:48.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oi yoi yoi yoi yoi,
hang on!

00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:52.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oi yoi yoi yoi yoi
yoi yoi yoi yoi yoi yoi!

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you finally admit you're
selling me real estate.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.671 position:33% line:89% align:start
Still wrong.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:59.907 position:16% line:83% align:start
Trust me, the only thing
I want you to do is draw.

00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:01.542 position:19% line:89% align:start
The one buying a house

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:02.610 position:35% line:89% align:start
will be me.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:03.211 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wha--?
You?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.444 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now, let's see...

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:08.015 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's 2600 square meters
going for 3 million yen.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.050 position:33% line:89% align:start
On my salary,

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.450 position:27% line:83% align:start
I could probably
get a loan for it

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:12.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
or even buy it outright.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.988 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Yeah, this could work!

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could commute from
my apartment during the week,

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:17.525 position:33% line:83% align:start
then retreat
to the countryside

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:19.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
and kick back during
the weekend and holidays!

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.162 position:21% line:89% align:start
Slow down for a sec.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.730 position:19% line:83% align:start
-You forced me to ask.
-Hm?

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.498 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is this coming out of
your pocket

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:26.266 position:41% line:83% align:start
or from
the publishing company?

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.335 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was planning to
do this with my own money.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:29.369 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I'm to draw a manga

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.605 position:35% line:83% align:start
-about you?
-(giggle) Nope.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
Once again, this is all
to inspire you, silly!

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look, I've put a lot
of thought into this.

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.111 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
And I'll share with you

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:38.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
all the info I dug up
to prove it.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.413 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.883 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] The owner
of villa number one

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:44.685 position:24% line:83% align:start
is the president of
a shipbuilding company.

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
Number 2 belongs
to a pharmacy EO,

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:48.823 position:33% line:83% align:start
while the guy
in number three

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
owns a printing company,

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.628 position:13% line:83% align:start
and the guy in number four
runs a cosmetics business.

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:55.630 position:27% line:83% align:start
Needless to say,
all the people living here

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:57.765 position:30% line:83% align:start
are fancy-pants
millionaire types,

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
with their trophy wives
and cute kids.

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:02.236 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sounds like a dream,
doesn't it?

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.905 position:30% line:83% align:start
Collecting data
is one thing,

00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:06.007 position:13% line:83% align:start
but making sense of it all
is quite another.

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:07.642 position:33% line:89% align:start
For starters,

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:10.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
how does a villa here
go for only 3 million?

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:12.747 position:19% line:89% align:start
There must be a catch.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.481 position:24% line:83% align:start
Except there isn't,
Rohan Sensei.

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:15.583 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've yet to tell you

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:17.985 position:16% line:83% align:start
the most important thing
about this place.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.053 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:21.088 position:10% line:89% align:start
The 11 people who live here,

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:22.322 position:13% line:89% align:start
they all bought their lots

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.258 position:30% line:83% align:start
when they were
just 25 years old.

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:25.626 position:24% line:89% align:start
Can you believe it?

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.460 position:33% line:83% align:start
I mean, yeah,
they're super loaded today,

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.064 position:19% line:83% align:start
but all of them came up
from humble beginnings.

00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:31.966 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] The most recent
arrival in this village

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:35.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
bought his plot of land,
number 11, back in 1989.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.906 position:21% line:83% align:start
The man was a modest
25-year-old delivery driver

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
who had moved all the way
out there from Tokyo.

00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:43.410 position:38% line:83% align:start
And now,
he's the head honcho

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:47.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
of a big airline company
worth over 30 billion yen!

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] So, yeah,
there's not a single person

00:05:49.617 --> 00:05:52.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
living in this village
who came from money.

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:55.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
They were all just
ordinary 25-year-old dudes

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
who moved out here,
one by one,

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.694 position:33% line:83% align:start
and built up
their fortunes over time.

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:00.928 position:44% line:83% align:start
And,
you've probably noticed,

00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:03.396 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it looks like
there's a common number.

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:07.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
As it happens,
I'm also 25 years old.

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:10.705 position:13% line:83% align:start
Get it now? There's clearly
a story here!

00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:13.107 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, be honest, don't you
want to come see me

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.775 position:10% line:89% align:start
get a lucky villa of my own?

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:16.510 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmmm...

00:06:18.913 --> 00:06:19.780 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:06:20.281 --> 00:06:21.414 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
(inhale)

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:23.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm assuming you have
access to a chopper?

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.953 position:35% line:83% align:start
I can't see
how else we'd get there.

00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:29.957 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(piano music)
-(birds chirping)

00:06:30.992 --> 00:06:31.959 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
(grunt)

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:36.097 position:24% line:89% align:start
(scribbling noise)

00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:40.201 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:43.537 position:21% line:89% align:start
(exhausted groaning)

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:46.941 position:19% line:89% align:start
(piano music continues)

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:49.944 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.421 position:24% line:89% align:start
(piano music ends)

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:09.797 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Rohan Sensei,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.464 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's one more
important detail

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:13.034 position:10% line:89% align:start
I forgot to mention earlier.

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:15.269 position:19% line:83% align:start
The seller is the head
of the village council,

00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:17.204 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they're very fussy
about decorum.

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:18.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've heard they're
dead set against

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
selling their land
to anyone whom they think

00:07:20.408 --> 00:07:22.475 position:33% line:83% align:start
comes across
as disrespectful.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
Proper manners will make
all the difference today,

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:27.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I hope you'll be
on your best behavior.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.783 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
(grunt)

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:32.019 position:10% line:83% align:start
I fail to see how my conduct
will endanger anything,

00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:33.654 position:13% line:89% align:start
when the only buyer is you.

00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:34.889 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Okay, fine.

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:36.691 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'll just
spell it out for you.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:39.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter which one
of us commits the faux pas.

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:40.460 position:33% line:83% align:start
They'll just
lump us together

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:41.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
and toss us both out.

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:44.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I don't want to leave
empty-handed after that hike.

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:45.933 position:24% line:89% align:start
Seriously, though,

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.769 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know if anyone's
ever told you this before,

00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:50.938 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you always act
like some hotshot diva

00:07:50.972 --> 00:07:52.807 position:30% line:83% align:start
who's addicted
to his own flatulence.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.742 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on!
What does that even mean?

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:57.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
It means stop worshipping
yourself and be a good boy,

00:07:57.578 --> 00:07:58.679 position:13% line:89% align:start
or the locals will boot us

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:00.648 position:21% line:83% align:start
before you can smell
one more fart.

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:02.717 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Here's an idea,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.618 position:30% line:83% align:start
let's practice
before we go in.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] Traditionally,
where in the house

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:09.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
should a visitor
take their jacket off?

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:10.725 position:41% line:89% align:start
Humph.

00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:14.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
You seem set on wasting
my time with this nonsense.

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:16.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] The answer is
at the entrance.

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.632 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not once
you've come inside,

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.735 position:24% line:83% align:start
but before you pass
through the door,

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:23.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
just in case there's
lingering dirt on your coat.

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:25.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
What a relief! So you do
now how to behave!

00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:28.509 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wait, I understand
this visit takes precedence,

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
but perhaps we should
do something about that.

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:32.580 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:34.281 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] I mean,
that chick over there.

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:36.450 position:33% line:89% align:start
(bird noises)

00:08:36.484 --> 00:08:39.186 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Aww, poor thing!

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.989 position:16% line:83% align:start
The simplest explanation
would be that it fell down

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:42.857 position:30% line:89% align:start
from its nest.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.091 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
What should we do?

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.061 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we leave him, he might
get eaten by something

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:48.396 position:24% line:89% align:start
or freeze to death.

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:49.864 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, if that happens,

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:52.833 position:10% line:83% align:start
we could simply write it off
as nature's work.

00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:53.868 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yawn]

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] Good thing
we found you, little fella.

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:58.639 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, we'll help you.

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm glad I hung on
to this box.

00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:02.610 position:33% line:89% align:start
There you go.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's likely his nest
is in one of these trees.

00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:07.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
We should come back here
later and find it.

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:11.052 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-Huh?

00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:21.729 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good day to you.

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.532 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd like to begin
by thanking you

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:24.765 position:16% line:89% align:start
for coming all this way,

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.500 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I'm glad to see
the good weather

00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
was accommodating
to your long journey.

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:30.604 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu]
This way please.

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.207 position:24% line:89% align:start
We've been waiting.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.076 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let us proceed swiftly.

00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:36.811 position:33% line:89% align:start
(piano music)

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:37.845 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:40.648 position:24% line:89% align:start
(signaling grunts)

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.783 position:19% line:89% align:start
My name is Kyoko Izumi.

00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:44.251 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much
for sparing us

00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:46.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
some of your precious time
to discuss the sale

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.655 position:19% line:89% align:start
of your lovely estate.

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
This gentleman here
is my good friend,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.624 position:30% line:89% align:start
Rohan Kishibe.

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:52.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's a successful
manga artist.

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:55.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm pleased to meet you.
You may call me Ikkyu.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.532 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've been given
the great honor

00:09:57.566 --> 00:09:59.733 position:30% line:83% align:start
of facilitating
your visit today.

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:02.036 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please follow me
as I guide you.

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:04.271 position:33% line:89% align:start
(piano music)

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:07.041 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:16.551 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now then, if you
would kindly allow me

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:18.152 position:30% line:83% align:start
to relieve you
of your coats.

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.794 position:19% line:89% align:start
(piano music continues)

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please. You may enter
at your leisure.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.838 position:41% line:89% align:start
(grunt)

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:45.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
(noticing grunt)
Hey!

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.047 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.753 position:19% line:89% align:start
(piano music continues)

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:58.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
In just a moment,

00:10:58.826 --> 00:11:00.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
I shall go fetch the seller

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.795 position:38% line:83% align:start
with whom
you will transact.

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:03.364 position:10% line:89% align:start
Make yourselves comfortable.

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:14.108 position:19% line:89% align:start
(piano music continues)

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:19.847 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:11:32.393 --> 00:11:35.729 position:19% line:89% align:start
(piano music continues)

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:45.839 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hmm...
-Hmm...

00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:50.844 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm beginning to suspect...
that...

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.847 position:16% line:83% align:start
the test has already been
put into motion, right?

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.818 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm talking about
our etiquette.

00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
There may be rules
surrounding tea drinking,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
and they're waiting to see
how we approach our cups.

00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:04.925 position:13% line:89% align:start
Somehow, I get the feeling

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.827 position:21% line:83% align:start
we're being observed
right now.

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.163 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Do you know the proper way

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:09.897 position:30% line:89% align:start
of proceeding?

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.566 position:30% line:89% align:start
(hesitant sigh)

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or should I just go straight
to consulting the internet?

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:16.737 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, it's fine.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.406 position:19% line:83% align:start
As the buyer, I should
be able to handle this.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.175 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't trouble yourself.

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.545 position:30% line:83% align:start
Everyone knows
the polite way of drinking

00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:25.980 position:30% line:83% align:start
is quietly and
without acting weird.

00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:32.186 position:24% line:89% align:start
(tense piano music)

00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:37.891 position:27% line:89% align:start
(hesitant grunt)

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.193 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu]
Excuse the intrusion.

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.194 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:45.366 position:24% line:83% align:start
I sincerely regret
to inform you of this,

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:48.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
but, sadly, the seller
is no longer interested

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.169 position:21% line:89% align:start
in meeting with you.

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.104 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wha-?

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.306 position:30% line:83% align:start
I must ask you
to leave the premises now.

00:12:53.742 --> 00:12:56.110 position:19% line:83% align:start
It pains me to say it,
but we cannot abide

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.345 position:16% line:83% align:start
your etiquette mistakes,
Miss Izumi.

00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.947 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.484 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have no land to sell
to anyone who lacks manners.

00:13:03.518 --> 00:13:04.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please return home
for today.

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:06.755 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wait, what are you
talking about?

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:07.955 position:30% line:89% align:start
What did I...?

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:09.390 position:21% line:89% align:start
What did I do wrong?

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:11.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
Firstly, though you are
a guest in this house,

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:13.695 position:19% line:83% align:start
it is improper to take
the furthest seat

00:13:13.728 --> 00:13:15.829 position:33% line:83% align:start
from the door
unless it is offered to you.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu]
You should take the closest.

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:23.037 position:27% line:83% align:start
You are expected
to remain there

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
until you have been properly
greeted by the host.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
Secondly, it is improper
to tread on the edges

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:30.545 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the tatami mats
in the Japanese room.

00:13:30.578 --> 00:13:33.847 position:27% line:89% align:start
(intense booming)

00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:35.849 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
(gasps)

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:37.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu] And, third,
when sitting at a table

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:39.453 position:35% line:83% align:start
lower than
the level of your knees,

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
it is correct to hold
your tea by the saucer.

00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:46.060 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, to put your finger
through the handle

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:49.129 position:33% line:83% align:start
of the teacup
is unspeakably vulgar.

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:52.066 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
(gasps)

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:54.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
Good etiquette is
a simple organization

00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:56.638 position:13% line:89% align:start
of shoulds and should nots.

00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:58.272 position:19% line:89% align:start
There is no gray area.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.841 position:21% line:83% align:start
Again, I must ask you
to return home.

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:03.611 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hm? You mean
we're finished already?

00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:05.946 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, wait a moment!
Please!

00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.881 position:33% line:83% align:start
You said it's
just for today, right?

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:08.916 position:30% line:83% align:start
Does that mean
it'd be possible

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
for me to try again?

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:12.853 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because, if it does,
I'd sincerely appreciate it.

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:14.556 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I'll get it this time!
-What?

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:17.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just one more try,
if it's not too much to ask.

00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:18.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
I promise I won't
disappoint you again.

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:20.194 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
Please let me prove it!

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:23.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
So you would like to attempt
the trial one more time?

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:25.366 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did I understand
you correctly?

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] (hesitant gasp)
Only if that's okay.

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.069 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu]
Very well then.

00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:30.471 position:24% line:89% align:start
If that's the case,

00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:34.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
I will present your requests
to the master for an answer.

00:14:34.108 --> 00:14:35.744 position:35% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
Please do!

00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:37.746 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] I promise
you won't regret it.

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:39.814 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, let's just leave.

00:14:39.848 --> 00:14:41.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
There aren't any good
manga ideas

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:42.483 position:27% line:89% align:start
to be found here.

00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:45.986 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would leave if I weren't
so in love with this place.

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:47.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sure, they're strict
about etiquette,

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:49.089 position:13% line:89% align:start
but that's what I'd expect.

00:14:49.123 --> 00:14:51.726 position:41% line:83% align:start
Just...
Just look around you.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Kyoka] It's so lovely!
-(ominous music)

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:57.431 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
(gasp)

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.669 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone buzzing)

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:02.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
(noticing gasp)

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:08.942 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hi, Kyoko speaking.

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:12.112 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-(intense music)

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.749 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
 <i>What the hell happened?!</i>

00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:17.017 position:38% line:83% align:start
(shriek)
Oh no!

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.086 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
(sobbing)

00:15:19.888 --> 00:15:21.922 position:47% line:83% align:start
No!
Please, no!

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
I-I-I have to...

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:27.629 position:21% line:83% align:start
My... I just got news
my mother was killed.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:29.963 position:21% line:89% align:start
They said that she...

00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:33.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka] (sobs)
There was a car accident,

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:36.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
and she didn't make it.
(sobs)

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
(cracking noise)

00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:39.406 position:41% line:83% align:start
-(gasp)
-(gasp)

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
My boyfriend was there too.
We were making plans

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
to finally get married
next year,

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:47.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
but he was in the car
with my mother at the time.

00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then she suddenly got
a heart attack at the wheel.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(music intensifies)
-I can't... (sobs)

00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:53.353 position:41% line:89% align:start
(grunt)

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:54.154 position:30% line:89% align:start
(booming noise)

00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:56.290 position:33% line:83% align:start
They've both
been taken from me!

00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:58.158 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] [gasps]
What is going on?

00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where did these insects
come from?

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:01.596 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kyoka]
(wails)

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:03.163 position:21% line:89% align:start
Excuse the intrusion.

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:06.166 position:21% line:89% align:start
The master has agreed

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.169 position:16% line:83% align:start
to let you take the trial
of manners once again.

00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:10.437 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now, let us proceed.

00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:12.406 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(action music)
-You will reveal yourself

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:13.741 position:33% line:89% align:start
this instant!

00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:18.412 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(slamming noise)
-Heaven's Door!

00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:26.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] I am the guide
at the main gate,

00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:27.856 position:33% line:83% align:start
and the land
speaks through me.

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:29.624 position:33% line:83% align:start
When crossing
into this domain,

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:30.859 position:33% line:83% align:start
those lacking
proper etiquette

00:16:30.892 --> 00:16:33.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
will soon find themselves
also lacking

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.062 position:10% line:89% align:start
something that they cherish.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.764 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Without exception.

00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:38.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the punishment
of the hill.

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:41.669 position:30% line:83% align:start
One will gain,
while one will lose.

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:45.607 position:10% line:83% align:start
That is the fundamental rule
which governs this land.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.442 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those proficient in
etiquette will gain success.

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:51.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those who are not will
suffer for each offense.

00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:53.615 position:30% line:83% align:start
This young man
is no stand user.

00:16:53.648 --> 00:16:56.049 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems he's little more
than a guide and mouthpiece

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.117 position:27% line:89% align:start
for these beings

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
with no special abilities
of his own.

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:01.054 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
This bodes terribly!

00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:03.090 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
 <i>It appears our enemies</i>

00:17:03.123 --> 00:17:05.092 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>are the gods of the hill.</i>

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] For the three rules
she broke,

00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.730 position:19% line:89% align:start
she lost three things.

00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:09.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
She then further
transgressed

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.666 position:30% line:83% align:start
when she begged
for another chance.

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:12.700 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Impudence.

00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:13.835 position:27% line:89% align:start
On top of that...

00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:15.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
(intense clanking noise)

00:17:15.803 --> 00:17:17.304 position:13% line:89% align:start
Turning someone into a book

00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:19.874 position:19% line:83% align:start
and reading their mind
without permission

00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:22.510 position:16% line:83% align:start
is also an egregious act
of disrespect.

00:17:23.745 --> 00:17:24.712 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Oh no!

00:17:25.613 --> 00:17:26.981 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're kidding!

00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:28.516 position:41% line:83% align:start
This...
This is bad!

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:30.417 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:33.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Kyoka] (groan)

[Kyoka]
(groaning)

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:36.423 position:35% line:89% align:start
M-My chest!

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.093 position:38% line:83% align:start

I- I can't...

[Ikkyu]
It appears Miss Izumi

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
is currently suffering
a heart attack.

00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:51.371 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mr. Rohan Kishibe,

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:53.407 position:16% line:83% align:start
you have broken one rule
of etiquette,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.143 position:41% line:83% align:start
and so,
you will lose one thing.

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:59.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tell me, do you intend
for her to die?

00:17:59.179 --> 00:17:59.814 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu]
You first.

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:01.015 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:03.216 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu] Do you intend to
continue with the trial,

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.687 position:24% line:83% align:start
or would you prefer
to return home now?

00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:09.023 position:27% line:89% align:start
You know I can't.

00:18:09.057 --> 00:18:10.257 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not anymore.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.926 position:19% line:89% align:start
I won't leave her here.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.194 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please, I beg of you,
have mercy!

00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:15.295 position:19% line:89% align:start
Her only transgression

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:17.565 position:16% line:83% align:start
was yearning for a chance
at happiness.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] I know now,
that when she said

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:20.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
she wanted to help me
with my work,

00:18:21.002 --> 00:18:22.503 position:30% line:89% align:start
it was sincere.

00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:25.105 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mercy is outside
the realm of etiquette.

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:30.545 position:13% line:83% align:start
Here, you will either gain
or you will suffer loss.

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:32.647 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Now, what is the proper way

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
to eat a cob of corn?

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:39.219 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, would you care to try
once more, Mr. Kishibe?

00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:41.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
Again, you are free
to return home

00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:43.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
-whenever you wish.
-(intense music crescendo)

00:18:43.691 --> 00:18:46.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Rohan] (hesitant grunt)
-[Kyoka] (groaning)

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:48.261 position:27% line:89% align:start
(hesitant grunt)

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.464 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:53.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[Rohan] (nervous panting)
-(tense music)

00:18:56.037 --> 00:18:59.040 position:13% line:89% align:start
(nervous panting continues)

00:18:59.073 --> 00:19:01.809 position:19% line:89% align:start
(tense music continues)

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.049 position:27% line:89% align:start
(music crescendo)

00:19:08.082 --> 00:19:09.383 position:41% line:89% align:start
(smirk)

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:10.384 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:14.154 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't underestimate
Rohan Kishibe.

00:19:14.187 --> 00:19:16.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
The utensils you've
laid out here before me,

00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:18.993 position:24% line:83% align:start
it is obvious that
none of them are suited

00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:20.227 position:21% line:89% align:start
for the task at hand.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.730 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(dramatic booming)
-Behold, as I answer you.

00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:24.666 position:27% line:89% align:start
(intense booming)

00:19:24.699 --> 00:19:26.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
Satisfied yet?

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.635 position:30% line:83% align:start
-There's more.
-Huh?

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:30.270 position:35% line:83% align:start
You should
brace yourself first,

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:33.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then, look down
when you're ready.

00:19:33.107 --> 00:19:34.274 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:35.143 --> 00:19:37.310 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ikkyu]
(gasps)

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.747 position:30% line:89% align:start
(shocked gasp)

00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:41.248 position:13% line:89% align:start
Who's the rule-breaker now?

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:44.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, I'll admit this
isn't the plot I envisioned,

00:19:44.052 --> 00:19:45.252 position:44% line:83% align:start
but,
given the tight deadline,

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
it was the best one
I could write.

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:50.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
(eating)

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:53.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm speaking of my ability,
Heaven's Door.

00:19:54.028 --> 00:19:55.228 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:19:55.797 --> 00:19:57.264 position:24% line:89% align:start
(dramatic booming)

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:59.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] Oh, look!
You're doing it again.

00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:02.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(nervous gasping)
-[Rohan] It's both feet.

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:04.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
-It's an impressive power,
-[Ikkyu] Whoa!

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:05.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
-wouldn't you say?
-(groan)

00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:08.509 position:30% line:83% align:start
I do appreciate
the lessons you gave me.

00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:09.443 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:12.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, on to the matter
of what I gained,

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:13.514 position:27% line:89% align:start
as per the rules.

00:20:13.548 --> 00:20:15.282 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:17.417 position:27% line:89% align:start
(nervous panting)

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:19.453 position:13% line:89% align:start
Seems my answer was right.

00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:21.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] The proper way
to eat a cob of corn

00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:22.389 position:35% line:89% align:start
is by hand.

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:25.225 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think you owe my colleague
something as well.

00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:27.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her beloved mother
and boyfriend.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:28.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is an obscene trick.

00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:31.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
You... You will incur
the wrath of the gods.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.301 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mr. Kishibe,

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:36.504 position:24% line:83% align:start
will you be making
another attempt?

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:38.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or would you prefer
to call it a day

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
and return home?

00:20:39.507 --> 00:20:42.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
My my, it seems the gods
have no quarrel with me.

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:43.745 position:24% line:89% align:start
And why would they,

00:20:43.778 --> 00:20:46.313 position:13% line:83% align:start
considering you're the one
who violated the rules.

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(music crescendo)
-I choose to go home,

00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:49.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
(dramatic booming)

00:20:49.449 --> 00:20:51.451 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I don't intend
to return.

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:55.288 position:21% line:89% align:start
(intense music ends)

00:20:57.091 --> 00:20:58.960 position:33% line:89% align:start
(piano music)

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:00.528 position:33% line:89% align:start
(bird noises)

00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:05.600 position:33% line:89% align:start
(bird noises)

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:06.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(bird noises)
-(chuckle)

00:21:07.869 --> 00:21:11.038 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(piano music continues)
-(birds chirping)

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.273 position:27% line:89% align:start
(appearing noise)

00:21:16.309 --> 00:21:20.380 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Koichi] Woah,
that's one heck of a story.

00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:22.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, so do you know
what ended up happening

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the editor lady's
mother and boyfriend?

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.788 position:30% line:83% align:start
They were both
perfectly fine.

00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
They were merely rear-ended,
which panicked a relative,

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:31.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
who then proceeded
to sound a false alarm.

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.194 position:19% line:89% align:start
That is such a relief!

00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:35.096 position:24% line:89% align:start
By the way, Koichi,

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:36.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have some research
to do after this,

00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:39.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
and likely won't be back
until well after 8:00.

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:40.268 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Koichi]
Okay.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.937 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Okuyasu] So, you're gonna
go do research, huh?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
I hope you're
looking up a way

00:21:44.105 --> 00:21:45.740 position:13% line:89% align:start
to stop being a freeloader.

00:21:46.439 --> 00:21:48.075 position:13% line:89% align:start
You make a very good point.

00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:49.877 position:27% line:83% align:start
I should work on
finding a new place

00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:51.378 position:16% line:89% align:start
where I can draw freely.

00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:53.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sadly, I'm utterly broke.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.149 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you want to come
to my place?

00:21:55.183 --> 00:21:57.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
We got plenty of rooms
you can set up in.

00:21:59.153 --> 00:22:00.755 position:21% line:89% align:start
That does sound nice.

00:22:01.454 --> 00:22:02.590 position:30% line:89% align:start
As it happens,

00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:05.526 position:30% line:83% align:start
your father is
a topic of interest for me.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(ending theme music)
-[Okuyasu] Wait, really?

00:22:06.594 --> 00:22:07.795 position:16% line:89% align:start
You wanna do today then?

00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:09.997 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe your Heaven's whatever
can turn him back!

00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:11.398 position:27% line:89% align:start
Could you try it?

00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:12.800 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
I must refuse.

00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:13.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Okuyasu]
What?!
