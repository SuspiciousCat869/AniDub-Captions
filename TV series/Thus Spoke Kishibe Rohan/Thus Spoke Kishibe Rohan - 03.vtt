[Minoru]
Rohan Sensei,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
thanks for meeting up
with me.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.323 position:27% line:71% align:start
What's that book
you're reading there?

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.158 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
A de Stael collection.

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:26.961 position:33% line:89% align:start
Death Stall?

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is that a new rock band
or something?

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:30.832 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] He was
a Russian-born artist.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
I believe he died in 1955.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
By the way, Kagamori,

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.109 position:16% line:71% align:start
I know full well that in
the working world at large,

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.845 position:30% line:71% align:start
being late for
any business meeting

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:44.979 position:19% line:77% align:start
is considered improper.

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:46.446 position:27% line:71% align:start
-(booming noise)
-[Rohan] However,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
an editor arriving
six minutes early

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
for a meeting with
his manga artist

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
is equally rude,
don't you think?

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.855 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry about that!

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
Arriving early is
a bad thing then?

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.092 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're lucky
you're meeting with me.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.127 position:24% line:89% align:start
But on to business.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
You want to talk about
my upcoming

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:03.898 position:13% line:89% align:start
61-page one-shot manga, no?

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:05.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Fan 1] Excuse me,
Rohan Sensei!

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:06.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're huge, freakin' fans!

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:08.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Fan 2] Could we please
get your autograph?

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.605 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can you make mine
out to "My pal, Akira"?

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:11.471 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Cut it out!
-(gasps)

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:13.273 position:30% line:83% align:start
Mr. Kishibe is
not giving autographs.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.009 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(booming noise)
-(grunts)

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:16.276 position:33% line:83% align:start
Can't you see
he's hard at work?

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.411 position:21% line:89% align:start
He doesn't have time.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.013 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
It's already done.

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:20.515 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.317 position:13% line:83% align:start
Unlike some manga artists,
I'm a fast worker.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
I always have time
to thank my fans.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:27.187 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fans]
(gasps)

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.691 position:16% line:83% align:start
Doin' drip art autographs
done in coffee?!

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:30.592 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:32.560 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thank you, sir!
We'll treasure these!

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:34.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Fan 1] No way! No way!
-[Fan 2] (laughing)

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.096 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Fan 1] No way!
(dumbfounded groan)

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.565 position:38% line:83% align:start
Actually,
if you wouldn't mind,

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
there is something personal
I'd like to discuss

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.768 position:24% line:83% align:start
before we get down
to business.

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:41.869 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure...

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:44.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
To be perfectly frank,
it's a question about cash.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
More specifically,
my payment.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.009 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.476 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Could you pay me in advance?

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've actually just
gone bankrupt.

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:52.346 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.048 position:30% line:83% align:start
I haven't gone
into debt yet,

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:55.783 position:30% line:89% align:start
but, right now,

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.250 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I'm homeless.
-(gasps)

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] I'm staying at
Koichi's at the moment,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.656 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I don't even have
a desk to work on.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.489 position:30% line:89% align:start
(stunned groan)

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:03.992 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
My <i>Sailor Moon</i> figures,

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:05.693 position:33% line:83% align:start
Led Zeppelin
paper jacket CDs,

00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:08.128 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Rurouni Kenshin</i> manga,
I've sold them all.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.897 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Slow down a sec!
-(slam)

00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:11.633 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't have
anywhere to work?!

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:12.867 position:30% line:89% align:start
And bankrupt?!

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.935 position:10% line:89% align:start
Didn't you just buy yourself

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
an entire mountain
the other day,

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:16.771 position:33% line:83% align:start
complete with
vacation cottages?!

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:17.872 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I told you before,
-(gasp)

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.273 position:13% line:83% align:start
I bought it to investigate
the rumors of the monster

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.142 position:19% line:83% align:start
that lives on that hill
for my manga,

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.078 position:27% line:83% align:start
but then I heard
those developer bastards

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:25.947 position:30% line:83% align:start
wanted to build
a resort up there,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.649 position:35% line:83% align:start
so I bought
the six surrounding hills

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:30.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
to put a stop to
their sleazy little plan.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.886 position:27% line:83% align:start
More land equaled
more influence,

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.186 position:16% line:89% align:start
so what else was I to do?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.556 position:30% line:83% align:start
I bought it all
to stop the construction.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.858 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(stunned groan)
-[Rohan] But with plans

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.560 position:16% line:83% align:start
for the resort canceled,
the land's value plummeted.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:41.095 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now that area
is just wilderness

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.730 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:45.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
The six hills I just bought
are basically all worthless,

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
which means I'm flat broke.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think you could
offer me an advance?

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let...Let me process
all this...

00:02:52.974 --> 00:02:54.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Minoru] Did you really buy
all those hills solely for

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:57.210 position:16% line:83% align:start
-manga research purposes?
-Yeah.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.713 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Minoru]
Not as an investment?!

00:02:58.746 --> 00:02:59.580 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's correct.

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm shooting for
reality here.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.282 position:24% line:89% align:start
In your comic about

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
a folktale monster
on a hill?

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.153 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You heard me.
-(gasp)

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.021 position:24% line:83% align:start
Imagine if they did
build the resort.

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:08.056 position:13% line:89% align:start
All that traffic could have

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
scared the monster
elsewhere,

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:10.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
in which case,

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.061 position:10% line:83% align:start
-my plan would be for naught.
-(booming noise)

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:15.328 position:24% line:89% align:start
(dumbfounded groan)

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
what's with that face?

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:19.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can't you look me
in the eye?

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:21.769 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, you're looking away!

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:24.237 position:16% line:83% align:start
You think that I've gone
completely off my rocker,

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.406 position:19% line:89% align:start
don't you, Mr. Editor?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.543 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] Listen up.
Souped-up super cars

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.210 position:33% line:83% align:start
and basement
video game theaters

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.445 position:24% line:89% align:start
are fine and dandy,

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:32.847 position:30% line:83% align:start
but they're not
the only things

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.381 position:19% line:89% align:start
manga artists can buy.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:35.717 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.152 position:27% line:83% align:start
And, what's more,
I did find it in the end,

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:40.655 position:19% line:83% align:start
so you see, my research
was worth every yen.

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:41.522 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Minoru]
Huh?

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:42.790 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Listen carefully,

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:45.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
and don't tell anyone
outside the magazine

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:46.928 position:13% line:89% align:start
what I'm about to tell you.

00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:49.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
You...found it...?
What...?

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:51.966 position:21% line:83% align:start
What exactly are you
saying you found?

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, come now.

00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.235 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you not listen to people
when they talk?

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.105 position:13% line:89% align:start
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:03:57.138 --> 00:04:00.307 position:30% line:83% align:start
The monster of
Mutsukaba Hill does exist,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
and, as of this moment,
it lives there still.

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:06.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
I hate to ask,
Rohan Sensei,

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
but could you please
say that again?

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.719 position:27% line:89% align:start
What lives there?

00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:14.589 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:17.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Rohan] There was a girl
named Naoko Osito,

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.427 position:27% line:83% align:start
a student in her
last year of college,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.064 position:27% line:83% align:start
but as September
came to a close,

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:25.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
she would murder
her boyfriend.

00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:35.408 position:21% line:89% align:start
(opening theme music)

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.153 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
Naoko Osito,

00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:21.321 position:27% line:83% align:start
the only daughter
of the Osito family,

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.389 position:19% line:89% align:start
who found their fortune

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.225 position:35% line:83% align:start
making miso
in Mutsukabe Village,

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:25.893 position:24% line:89% align:start
for over 300 years.

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.731 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Osito estate
stood at the end

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:33.534 position:19% line:83% align:start

[Naoko] Hey, could you
go home for the day?

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:50.818 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:52.787 position:33% line:83% align:start
And clean up
the game stuff, will you?

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.757 position:41% line:83% align:start
(groan)
What's going on?

00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.227 position:13% line:83% align:start
Someone from the main house
comin' to visit?

[Naoko]
Does it matter?

[Gunpei]
Come on now!

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:07.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lately, you've been...
I don't know,

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:09.570 position:10% line:89% align:start
kind of chilly toward me...?

00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:13.040 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't want to ask this,
but is there another guy?

00:06:13.074 --> 00:06:14.041 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Gunpei]
(gasps)

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:16.443 position:24% line:83% align:start
You just spared me
the trouble

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.812 position:24% line:89% align:start
of an explanation.

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:19.914 position:44% line:83% align:start
Look,
I'm not going to deny

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:22.049 position:24% line:83% align:start
that we've had some
good times together,

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.117 position:24% line:83% align:start
but it's not going
to work out

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
as long as my dad's around.

00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:25.987 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're a part-time gardener.

00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:28.589 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Naoko] And,
as my dad's only daughter,

00:06:28.623 --> 00:06:30.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm supposed to protect
the family fortune.

00:06:31.092 --> 00:06:32.293 position:35% line:89% align:start
We're done.

-You don't mean that.
-(struggling groans)

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come on, what's wrong with
keeping our thing going?

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.468 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Let go of me!
-There's no reason

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:42.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
for us to split up.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.138 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just let me go!

they would react

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:47.008 position:30% line:83% align:start
if they came in
and saw us like this?

00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:49.744 position:21% line:83% align:start

I didn't...uh...

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.390 position:27% line:83% align:start

I just reacted.

-(grunt)
-(gasps)

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.992 position:13% line:89% align:start
I really do love you, Nao.

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:05.826 position:41% line:89% align:start
I mean,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
even if we have to
keep it secret,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.596 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm happy
just the way things--

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:09.864 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Go on!
-(gasps)

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:10.598 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get out of here!

we didn't exactly tell her

00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:21.108 position:19% line:89% align:start
we were coming, did we?

00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:22.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
She'll probably be
flustered.

any minute.

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:31.919 position:41% line:89% align:start
Gunpei,

00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:34.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
please take your stuff
and get out of here now.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:35.623 position:19% line:89% align:start
To be perfectly honest,

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:37.792 position:38% line:83% align:start
you're...
the one I want to be with,

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:39.961 position:24% line:83% align:start
but this is the man
I've been engaged to.

00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:42.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
My family has decided that
we'll be getting married

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:44.265 position:16% line:89% align:start
after I graduate college,

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:45.766 position:13% line:89% align:start
so this is the end for us.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.735 position:33% line:83% align:start
We can't see
each other anymore.

00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:51.505 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

Gunpei...?

that's not funny.

Gunpei...

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:24.705 position:21% line:89% align:start
Stop playing around.

I don't feel a...
pulse.

Hey, can you hear me?

Huh, Gunpei?

what you're after.

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:33.755 position:33% line:83% align:start
In the attic

00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:35.023 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:17:47.502 --> 00:17:50.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
My family always warned me
not to talk to strange men.

00:17:52.272 --> 00:17:54.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
Apparently, there are
a lot of perverts

It looks like I...

00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:34.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
was responsible for
this poor girl's death!

Who the hell is this girl?

Naoko Osito...

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.029 position:21% line:89% align:start
did she get pregnant

00:18:48.062 --> 00:18:49.797 position:30% line:83% align:start
from the corpse
hiding in the attic,

00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:51.032 position:27% line:89% align:start

This is bad.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
All the memories that
make this girl who she is...

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:16.891 position:21% line:89% align:start
They're fading away!

00:19:16.924 --> 00:19:18.760 position:41% line:83% align:start
No, no!
It's all disappearing!

00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:21.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
If her memories go,
I can't bring it back!

00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:22.496 position:24% line:89% align:start

That was too close

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:07.875 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rohan]
A moment's hesitation,

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:09.510 position:27% line:83% align:start

been possessed.

I'm terribly sorry to have
left you alone like that.

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:25.026 position:16% line:89% align:start

from the main office,

00:20:26.828 --> 00:20:28.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
