1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,416
Once upon a time...

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,208
Wait a minute.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,708
I have no idea where we are.

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,875
Since you have awakened
me I have the power

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,000
to grant you three wishes.

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,791
A genie from a magic
lamp with Ringo...

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,208
I wasn't expecting that.

8
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,500
There's really only one
thing I have ever wished for.

9
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,250
That so?

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,125
Tell me what it is.

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,916
There's somebody
I want to reconcile with.

12
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,916
You'll have to be more specific.

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,291
I've never told anyone...

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,083
Poo...

15
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,666
I should have known
it was all a dream.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,541
Although, isn't a dream supposed
to be a wish your heart makes?

17
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,208
Pretty, pretty
Otogibana City and...

18
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,666
Otogi Academy... What the...

19
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,791
Not even close.

20
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,500
We haven't been
to this house before.

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,375
This girl is Himeno Shirayuki.

22
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,750
She's the PYT
who took first place

23
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,958
at the Miss Otogi
Academy Pageant.

24
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,041
I wonder what's wrong
with Ringo all of a sudden.

25
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,791
Okamisan and Ryoshi are
watching seven little dwarves...

26
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,916
...err elfmidgets...
little people, right?

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,125
Anyway, seven kids.

28
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,791
Thanks.

29
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,291
Boy.

30
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,541
She already has them wrapped
around her little finger.

31
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,750
C'mon Ryoshi!
I know you can take it.

32
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,458
Defeated by a bunch
of grade school kids.

33
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,125
Hello, everyone!

34
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,000
Himeno! You're home!

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,125
Yay, we're so happy
that you're back, sis!

36
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,041
These are Himeno's
seven siblings

37
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,000
While Himeno went out
to work she had Okamisan

38
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,041
and company watch the children.

39
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,583
I know how hard it is to
keep them entertained.

40
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,291
I didn't really seem to have
any problems with them...

41
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,000
Ryoshi...? How bout you...?

42
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,750
No, not really.

43
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,416
I'll have dinner
ready in a jiff, okay?

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,583
Well then I better
fold the laundry, huh?

45
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,375
And I'll go clean the bathroom.

46
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,875
Now this really is
turning into a Fairy Tale--

47
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,958
kids helping like that.

48
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,125
I was really hoping that Ringo
might've wanted to come too.

49
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,958
She couldn't... She had
something else come up.

50
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,625
I tried my best to convince her
to come with us...

51
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,166
Sorry Himeno.

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,500
It's all right...

53
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,375
I know it's not your fault
she couldn't make it...

54
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,250
It was very sweet
of you to try anyway.

55
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,208
The next day at the Otogi Bank

56
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,250
So...

57
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,875
How did babysitting
go yesterday?

58
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,208
I think I dislocated
my shoulder.

59
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,250
She's completely insane--looking
after all those rug rats...

60
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,625
I don't think I could
do it all by myself.

61
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,958
She even works part-time
to help with all the bills.

62
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,541
Himeno certainly
looks nice in a uniform.

63
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,458
That poor girl.

64
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,041
All she does is work...

65
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,041
How is she ever gonna find the
time to get into a good college?

66
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,625
Truth is, she won't.

67
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,375
She plans on going right into
the work force after graduating.

68
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,250
With grades like
these she probably has

69
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,666
plenty of colleges that
are trying to woo her...

70
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,833
I guess she must really be
a dedicated older sister

71
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,083
to help out like that.

72
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,166
That is too much
responsibility for a young girl.

73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,375
First things first...

74
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,291
Did Ringo ever accept
Himeno's invitation

75
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,625
and go over to her house?

76
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,666
It's kind of rude
of her to back out.

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,541
She asked us if we would
babysit again tomorrow...

78
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,083
I'll see if I can convince
Ringo to go this time.

79
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:19,916
Hey guys...

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,458
I'm know I'm kinda slow ...

81
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,541
But is there weird stuff going
on between Himeno and Ringo?

82
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,083
You know, stuff?

83
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,500
What's the matter with you two?

84
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,916
You're awfully quiet.
Everything okay?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,250
It's not like you
don't know what it is...

86
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,416
Himeno was upset
that you didn't come...

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,583
You know she
didn't make a request

88
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,083
from the bank for me or Ryoshi.

89
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,500
If you don't do something soon
it's going to be too late.

90
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,375
Once Himeno leaves
the academy...

91
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,833
...you probably won't
see her again.

92
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,041
I know... but it's too hard...

93
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,583
Hey...

94
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,875
Would someone please explain
what the heck's going on.

95
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,375
Because...

96
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,041
If there's some way I can help
you figure this out Ringo,

97
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,708
you know I will...
help... I can help...

98
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,958
Uh, I'd like... to help...

99
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,500
Staaaaaaaare

100
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,750
Don't stare at me.

101
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,041
Thank goodness he's fine...

102
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,416
He was acting so manly I feared

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,083
he'd perhaps been
replaced by an imposter.

104
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,166
As long as you're
comfortable sweetie pie.

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,583
Well... I suppose can tell you.

106
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:34,916
It's not like it's some
big secret or anything.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,250
Here goes...

108
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,958
When I was growing up
it was just my mom and me

109
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,666
for quite a long time.

110
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,375
Ringo...

111
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,000
I want you to always have a
smile on your face for others.

112
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,000
A bright smile
lets everyone around

113
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,291
you know that you're
a good little girl.

114
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,750
Kay... Mama.

115
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,791
You sweet thing...

116
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,208
Now remember to
be polite no matter

117
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,833
who it is you're
talking to, understand...?

118
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,625
You just be a sweet little lady,
and everyone will fawn over you.

119
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,708
Okay, Mama!

120
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,958
That's Ringo's mom alright.

121
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,833
She's as cunning
as her daughter.

122
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,041
You're such pretty
little girl... still...

123
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,666
You can't make it out there on
cuteness alone.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,291
I've got it, Ringo...

125
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,458
Starting today, you're
going to talk like an adult.

126
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,208
If you learn
to speak correctly,

127
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:24,000
you'll grow into an intelligent,
well-mannered young lady.

128
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,541
A very anime way of thinking...

129
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,833
"Yes, ma'am?"

130
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,541
Uhhh... yes ma'am... Mama.

131
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,875
That's perfect!

132
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,125
Okay yes ma'am...

133
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:36,791
Very good.

134
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,125
That's how we lived.

135
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,625
Then one day...

136
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,708
Mama took me to this house
that was as big as a mansion.

137
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,791
Oh my, that place
is practically a castle!

138
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,333
I want one.

139
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,291
Mommy has something important
to talk about downstairs...

140
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,458
...but you can play here
and be good, right?

141
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,208
Yes, Mama.

142
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,625
It's lonely here all by myself.

143
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,125
Then, would you like
to play with a big sister?

144
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,708
Be careful, okay 

145
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,958
I shall.

146
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,125
Are you all right there, Ringo?

147
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,250
I'm just fine.

148
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,541
She was a sweet,
beautiful big sister...

149
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,000
Come on!

150
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,625
Finally, Mama was finished
with her important talk.

151
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,166
Will I get to
see you again soon?

152
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,875
If you're a good girl,
Ringo, I'm sure you will...

153
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,208
An indescribable
happiness filled my heart

154
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,166
after that day...

155
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,083
I finally got to meet my daddy,

156
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,041
even though Mama had told
me we'd never be together.

157
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,500
I began living in a big house.

158
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,666
But, one day
I learned the truth...

159
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,583
I found a letter in
my Daddy's study...

160
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,958
...it was addressed
to his daughter...

161
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,916
That's when I understood.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,333
Himeno and I had the same
father but different mothers.

163
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,458
We were half sisters.

164
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,000
The important talk
my mother had mentioned...

165
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,875
it was about a
family splitting apart...

166
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,541
Himeno's parents
were divorcing...

167
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,833
My mother kicked
Himeno and her mother

168
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,125
out of the only
home they knew...

169
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,500
...and all I did was whine.

170
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,666
"Will I get to see
you again soon?"

171
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,333
How could I be so cruel to her?

172
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,166
But... it's not your
fault--you didn't know that.

173
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,625
It doesn't change the fact
that the happiness I felt

174
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,458
came at the cost of
Himeno's father and home.

175
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,500
Once I found out the truth,

176
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,875
it was hard to
stay in that house.

177
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,416
That's why I wanted to come
to the city all by myself--

178
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,458
to get away from the feelings
of guilt I had at home.

179
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,083
And I thought I might
be able to do something

180
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,833
to try and make
amends to Himeno.

181
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,791
But three years passed,

182
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:10,291
and I could never muster up the
courage to do anything at all...

183
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,958
I avoided even seeing her.

184
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,416
Who cares...

185
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,208
What if this is your best
chance to make it up to her?

186
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,583
Himeno is reaching out to you
and asking for your help, Ringo!

187
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,791
That's right.

188
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,416
But I'm so scared...

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,666
Whenever I try to gather
my courage to speak to her...

190
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,708
I completely freeze up...

191
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,041
Pease don't...

192
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,291
I can't sit here while you
start talking like I do.

193
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,541
I guess I have no right

194
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,625
to make fun of you
anymore after this, do I?

195
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,958
What is this for?

196
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,125
It's a gift from Lizst...

197
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,708
Tomorrow...

198
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,541
...everybody from the Otogi Bank
will be taking Himeno's siblings

199
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,375
on a field trip to the pool...

200
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,500
Himeno will be there too.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,250
It's your choice whether or
not to take this opportunity.

202
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,291
But it may be your last.

203
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,875
The very next day everybody
went to the Mermaid Pool...

204
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,666
Incidentally,
the owner of this pool

205
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,583
is none other than our
own academy director,

206
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,166
Ranpu Aragami, head
of the Aragami Family.

207
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,291
So I'd be careful
about undressing

208
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,625
in case of hidden cameras...

209
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,791
As a matter of fact,

210
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,500
change before you
get there if you can...

211
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,875
He's a naughty old man

212
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,666
Thank you for
inviting us all along...

213
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,125
I'm not a very good swimmer

214
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,125
so they never get
to go to the pool.

215
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,958
I guess that's why
they're so excited.

216
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, it's nothing

217
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,625
You've always been a big help

218
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,500
as a representative
of the Academy...

219
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,666
And we do like
to reward big helps.

220
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,791
Plus she's... you know...
pretty.

221
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,500
I've never had anyone fill
in for me at work before--

222
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,625
I hope its not a problem.

223
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,208
And will that be all?

224
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,416
Check out Momoko
at the checkout...

225
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,208
Did she really have
to dress like that?

226
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,375
Yes, that's it.

227
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,333
Oh, everything will
be fine I'm sure...

228
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,375
We just called in one
of our favors for it.

229
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,208
Really?

230
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,750
How can I ever thank you?

231
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,083
I guess Ringo's not
going to show up after all.

232
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,083
Not true...

233
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,458
She showed up.

234
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,791
She's just hiding
because she's too afraid.

235
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,750
Wow... What is
that girl's problem?

236
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,250
That girl's got problems?

237
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,500
Look who's talking.

238
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,916
Well, let's go, everyone

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,125
Alright!

240
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,208
There's Ringo hiding
like a little chicken...

241
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,083
It's sad, but sweet.

242
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:14,833
Attention!

243
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,625
Swimsuits coming next!

244
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,375
So here we are at
the Mermaid Pool

245
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,458
That swimsuit
looks great on you.

246
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,125
You're correct.

247
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,291
Its anime...

248
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,416
Everyone looks
good in a swimsuit.

249
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,291
Hey, don't slip.

250
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,583
Girls are pretty like flowers.

251
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,750
This is what it's
all about, my boys.

252
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,750
It's- Ryoko...

253
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,541
Best field trip ever,
I would say.

254
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,291
Hey...

255
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,833
Do you know where Himeno is?

256
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,750
Hey baby.

257
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,625
Lookin' good there.

258
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,833
Wanna get wet with me?

259
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,916
I wonder if he knows
he sounds creepy.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,083
No thanks...

261
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,750
You don't know fun
till you hang with me.

262
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,333
Mommy! Mommy!

263
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,083
Nothing will make a guy run
faster than a girl with kids.

264
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,375
Touch my sister again and
next time I won't be so nice.

265
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,833
Okay, everyone!

266
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,125
Let's split up into the
groups you were assigned

267
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,333
and make sure you have
all your children...

268
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,000
Now kids, you
mustn't get separated

269
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,500
from your leaders, okay?

270
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,833
Okay!

271
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh dear. Not good.

272
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,916
Majolika... I get scared
if we go too fast.

273
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,125
Okay

274
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,708
No! It's not stopping!

275
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,416
Majolika is quite
a troublemaker.

276
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,291
Here.

277
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,416
Kazuya!

278
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,791
Oh my... Look what happened.

279
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,041
Oww!

280
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,416
Are you okay?

281
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,625
Now... let's think of something
we can all do together.

282
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,875
Okay.

283
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,125
Taro wastes no time in
picking up the ladies.

284
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,083
These kids will be scarred for
life with those expectations.

285
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,583
Oh Taro.

286
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:32,291
You've got the wrong idea,
Otohime--we were just talking.

287
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,708
And balance is restored.

288
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,416
That Otohime girl is strong.

289
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,958
Well, Otohime...

290
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,916
That wasn't too... painful.

291
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,541
Oh Taro...

292
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,708
I'm scared of the water.

293
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,041
Once Taro receives
certain satisfactions

294
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,750
from Otohime he goes
into Gentleman Mode.

295
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,125
Otohime's all sweet
and happy now...

296
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,083
I wonder what Taro did to her.

297
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,166
You'll find out
when you're an adult.

298
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,708
Who knows?

299
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,083
I see... for reasons that
don't make any sense

300
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,333
Ryoko and Ryoshi
aren't together.

301
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,458
Even as children, girls
just get that love stuff.

302
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,791
You don't seem to have much
upstairs either, Miss Alice.

303
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,833
True... but still more
than Ryoko or Ringo...

304
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:15,708
...to be sure.

305
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,208
Hey...

306
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,416
Are you going out with that
guy over there, Miss Alice?

307
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,250
Negative...

308
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,875
That's my cousin so we're
kind of stuck with each other.

309
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,500
When it comes to men or clothing

310
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,500
we always have a
choice, girlfriend.

311
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,458
Yeah, are you going to let him
pick your wedding dress, too?

312
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,125
What precocious
little talk show hosts!

313
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,833
I'd watch out boys...

314
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,833
I'm gonna go for a little swim.

315
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,375
Well if it isn't Ringo
in her school swimsuit...

316
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,125
...hiding behind that
huge scuba mask.

317
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,250
Make sure to stay nearby okay?

318
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,916
Still too scared to
talk to her sister.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Help me!

320
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,541
Kazuya!

321
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,208
Himeno...! Wait!

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,166
Take him.

323
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,541
I've got him.

324
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,500
Oh crap... Where'd she go?

325
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,208
No, Himeno!

326
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,291
Ryoshi's in hero mode again!

327
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,916
Come on Himeno!

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,666
Say something...

329
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,333
Himeno, breathe!

330
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,250
Please don't die, Himeno.

331
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,208
I better do CPR or something.

332
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,833
Step aside, please.

333
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,791
Himeno, talk to me.

334
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,625
Himeno, please breathe.

335
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,416
Ringo...

336
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,125
Please come back...

337
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,375
You can't die...

338
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,583
I need to see you one more time.

339
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,416
Please... Please...

340
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,708
I need my sister.

341
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,291
Don't leave me!

342
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,875
I'm sorry...

343
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,791
You're okay, sis!

344
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,000
I was so worried!

345
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,583
I didn't mean to
scare you, I'm sorry.

346
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,916
No. Stay.

347
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,250
Thank you again
for saving my life.

348
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,500
Sure.

349
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,000
How many years has it been

350
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,958
since we've had the chance
to talk to each other... Ringo?

351
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,000
I just... wanted you to know...

352
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,375
If you're thinking of trying
to apologize... don't...

353
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,791
I wouldn't change
a thing about my life.

354
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,666
Really?

355
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,000
It's only because
of you moving

356
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,916
in that I got to
meet these children.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,250
Come on, Himeno!

358
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,958
I would never trade that.

359
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,250
You don't have anything
at all to apologize for...

360
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,750
I was sorry I didn't get
to be there for you...

361
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,916
...till now that is...

362
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,333
I am so grateful to have
you as my little sister...

363
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,166
Thank you for that.

364
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,000
I missed you so much!

365
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,041
That's better...

366
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,916
Would you like to meet your
brothers and sisters now?

367
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,458
Yes I would!

368
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,375
One small broken family
put back together...

369
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,583
Good for them.

370
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,000
This is my
little sister, Ringo...

371
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,375
So she's your sister too, now.

372
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,125
Hi, everyone...!

373
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,958
It's... nice to meet you!

374
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,791
Well, what do we say children?

375
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,291
That went pretty well, huh?

376
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,791
Yeah.

377
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,083
Good, Okamisan doesn't need
to worry about that anymore.

378
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,875
Then the next day...

379
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,958
I've come here to
make a formal request.

380
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,458
Go ahead.

381
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,958
I heard that if you work

382
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,916
for the Otogi Bank
for three years...

383
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,958
you get three wishes granted...

384
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,291
Is there any truth to that?

385
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,916
There could be.

386
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,166
I'd like to have one of my
wishes fulfilled right now.

387
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,416
Oh... I think it's a
little soon for that...

388
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,250
You haven't even been here
a full year yet have you?

389
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,083
You know I'll
work three years...

390
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't even need
the other two wishes...

391
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,833
I just need the one now...

392
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,083
Please sir...

393
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,458
I'll beg if I have to...

394
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,833
Well, now...

395
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
if you're really that
serious about this

396
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,125
I suppose I could be convinced.

397
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,041
Pretty please...

398
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,375
I promise to be a
good little girl...!

399
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,916
I think you're the
bestest grandpa ever!

400
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,166
Fine... If you promise
to be a good girl.

401
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,958
I don't know which one
I'm more disturbed by...

402
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,375
Lucky Himeno...

403
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,708
...a special college scholarship
showed up out of the blue.

404
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,958
Did you have anything
to do with it?

405
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,083
No ma'am.

406
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,916
My sister's a very
talented student...

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,375
Himeno's grades have
always been exemplary.

408
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,291
It's only natural.

409
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,541
Ringo used her only wish
for her beloved older sister

410
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,333
so that she could
go on to college.

411
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,000
I think it's going to
be your turn next, Ryoko.

412
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,375
My turn?

413
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,916
For someone to use the
power of their undying love

414
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
help you with your
problems--maybe Ryoshi?

415
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,875
 What...? That's crazy.

416
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,333
You are so adorable
when you blush.

417
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,458
Is the great
Okamisan embarrassed?

418
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,875
I'm going to bed.

419
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,000
Looks like we're in one of
Okamisan's dreams this time.

420
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,375
Ryoko...

421
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,208
Oooh... Ryoshi slicked-back
his dream hair.

422
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,291
Ryoshi!

423
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,083
This is a very
different kind of anime!

424
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,333
Don't worry. I've got this.

425
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,666
I know how to wake up
a sleeping princess.

426
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,458
Are you sure
about this, Okamisan?

427
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,291
A dream.

428
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,125
Oh dear.

429
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:28,041
It would appear something inside
our Wolf's head has snapped.

430
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,166
Hey, you guys...!

431
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,666
Wait up for me!

432
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,833
How are you this morning?!

433
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,333
Why?

434
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,583
Well that was rational.

435
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,708
Let's go.

436
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,833
You act like a crazy
person sometimes.

437
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,166
Yeah, the world's
a messed up place.

438
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,708
Hey, what was that for?

439
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,125
Come back!

440
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,208
Regardless, this time,
all's well that ends well.

441
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,250
Watch the next one.

442
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,041
It's good, and
sleep is overrated.
