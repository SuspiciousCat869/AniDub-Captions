1
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,041
Here we are again in our
little Otogibana city...

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,541
Oh... I guess this story's going

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,916
to begin at Ryoshi's house
instead of at school...

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,791
I bet that's because
today is Saturday.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,750
Who is that guy, anyway...?

6
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,416
This episode looks like it
might be on the serious side.

7
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,375
Ringo is busy
cleaning the dorm room.

8
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,125
Okamisan's getting
ready to go somewhere...

9
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,416
Well, I'm off to the gym.

10
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,625
Kay... Don't stay
out too late, though...

11
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,041
I'm making hamburger
steak tonight.

12
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,375
Hamburger steak, huh...?

13
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,875
Yeah, okay.

14
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,541
Well that's bizarre...

15
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,500
She usually gets
excited about ground beef.

16
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,541
Elizabeth and Francoise
are outside and loving it.

17
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,208
However, Ryoshi doesn't
really seem to notice.

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Okamisan... I love you!

19
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,416
Oh okay... I got it,
I got it, chill...

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,875
I love the strength you have...

21
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,250
I love your style...

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,583
That you're dignified...

23
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,750
You're never afraid of anything.

24
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,666
You're like a guy but hotter...

25
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,916
...really, it's your--

26
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,208
What is it really?

27
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,291
Hello, this is Ringo.

28
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,958
Hi, is Ryoko there?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,375
Nope... She's
currently at the gym...

30
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,583
Is this Ryoshi?

31
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,458
You sound much more
manly over the phone.

32
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,208
Is everything all right?

33
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,958
I need to talk about Ryoko.

34
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,458
Oh.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,833
I see... That's what happened.

36
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,041
It's just...

37
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,375
I think Shiro Hitsu,

38
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,916
or whatever-the-guy's-name-is,
he's the problem.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
She's fine...

40
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,208
Although she does seem a little
distracted lately, I must say.

41
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you have any idea why?

42
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,416
Please, you have to tell me...

43
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,625
I need to know
about him and Ryoko.

44
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,458
I'm sorry, but I can't.

45
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,958
If this is truly so important,

46
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,000
then it's up to you to find the
courage and ask her directly.

47
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,166
Don't look so defeated.

48
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,958
She'll eventually learn to
trust you, I know she will...

49
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,291
And then I she'll open up
to you about everything.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,625
I didn't think she'd ever learn
to trust me, either, at first.

51
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,958
Meanwhile... at the gym...

52
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,208
Shiro wouldn't do anything like
that, especially not to you.

53
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,750
C'mon, just admit it;

54
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,291
you're lying because
he dumped you.

55
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,708
She acts all innocent but in
reality, she's the guilty one.

56
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,000
So... Have any luck?

57
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,125
No, it appears as though
all the data on Shiro

58
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,875
from before his transfer has
been purposefully deleted.

59
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,541
Alice has clearly embraced
the serious nature

60
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,208
of this episode...

61
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,333
Oh, in case you all forgot,
these two are cousins.

62
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,958
I can't be sure of
what he's thinking,

63
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,333
so we need to exercise
caution no matter

64
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,541
what route we decide to take.

65
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,958
Ugh... She's making me nervous.

66
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,375
Perhaps we should
give everyone a GPS...

67
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,291
I'll see if I can get the
student council to give us some.

68
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,291
Yeah, that'd be
great, thanks a lot.

69
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,041
I think it's sweet how concerned
the President is for everyone.

70
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,708
They really are like a
little family, aren't they?

71
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,541
Red and Okamisan
in middle school...

72
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,375
This is what they looked like

73
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,083
before they got
all hip and cool.

74
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,250
You'll be fine, Ryoshi.

75
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,166
You just have to hang in there.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,208
Ryoko Okami?

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,375
What we're witnessing
is a flashback

78
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,666
to Ringo's first year
in middle school...

79
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,666
You can see nothing much has
changed for her boob-wise.

80
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,041
Would you mind taking
these to her room for me?

81
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,333
Yes, ma'am, of course.

82
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,958
Thank you.

83
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,791
The teacher will
owe me big time, now.

84
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,375
Goodness me, Red Riding Hood

85
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,166
had a devious heart even
back then, didn't you?

86
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,750
Ryoko. She seems
kinda scary, don't you think?

87
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,416
Kinda? She's terrifying.

88
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,250
She hasn't talked to
anybody since she got here...

89
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,083
And it doesn't matter what
you say she always looks mad.

90
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,125
Now that you mention it,

91
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,458
she does remind
me of a gang leader.

92
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,791
Just make sure
you're careful, okay?

93
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,250
Bye!

94
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,166
Woe is me... Ringo...

95
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,791
This is what happens
when you're too hasty!

96
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,208
And so...

97
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,791
I paid a visit to the room
of the terrifying Ryoko Okami,

98
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,083
transfer student and
possible gang leader.

99
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,541
She's supposed to be here.

100
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,208
Hello? Is anybody at home?

101
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,208
I'm going to come inside.

102
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,458
Risky. Risky...

103
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,208
And also illegal.

104
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,583
Ooh, she's been reading
those romancey

105
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,708
fancy books for a while.

106
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,833
Now that is unexpected.

107
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,416
Oh...! You are here, aren't you?

108
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,958
A fever!

109
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,750
I'll get something
to cool you off.

110
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,333
Why...?

111
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,875
I swear... I'm not lying.

112
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,833
Someone... believe me...

113
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,333
I'm begging you.

114
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,083
When I saw that lovely,
sleeping face...

115
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,416
I wanted to learn
more about her...

116
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,333
What would make her cry?

117
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,958
What kind of girl is she truly?

118
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,208
What makes her happy...?

119
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,458
I was drawn to her,
and I wanted to know why.

120
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,708
Hey... Who are you and what
the hell are you doing in here?

121
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,708
My name is Ringo Akai,
and I'm in your class.

122
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,041
The teacher wanted
me to give you this.

123
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,708
Well thanks... Now you can go...

124
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,541
I've got it.

125
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,541
Oh, no.

126
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,625
Oh, what?

127
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,083
I can't leave a
sick person all alone.

128
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,125
Why not?

129
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,333
I have an idea.

130
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,958
I'll make you something
to eat, sound good?

131
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,125
I can make you
some yummy porridge.

132
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,916
Give me just a
moment, my friend.

133
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,958
Did, she just call me friend?

134
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,583
Here... "ahh."

135
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,000
You have to open your mouth.

136
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,750
Are you afraid it won't be good?

137
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
Fine. Ahh.

138
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,333
Okay.

139
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,708
So what would you like
me to do for you now?

140
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,250
Why are you still here, girl?

141
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,500
It's Ringo.

142
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,625
Huh?

143
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,416
Rin-go...

144
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,583
Since we're friends now,

145
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,208
you don't have to call
me "girl" anymore.

146
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,000
Isn't that great?

147
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,333
We're friends?

148
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,708
When did that happen?.

149
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,291
Just cuz you're here doesn't
mean that we're friends.

150
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,500
I don't need anyone
to take care of me.

151
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,375
So get out of here already.

152
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
All right. I'll go if you want.

153
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,041
Please stay warm and
try to get some sleep.

154
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,416
Hey.

155
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:50,000
Thanks... Porridge was good...

156
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,750
Ringo.

157
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,166
No problem!

158
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,916
Impressive, Ringo.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,458
You tamed the great Okamisan...

160
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,583
in your own way.

161
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,208
Since then, she's calmed
down for the most part.

162
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,666
Although... I think some one
else might tame her completely.

163
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,666
And now...

164
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,250
on to the second
half of our story.

165
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,875
What's wrong, kid? You sick?

166
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,875
Ah, yes; Kumada.

167
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,041
The gym trainer, as you know.

168
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,666
You can't hide it from me;
something's obviously wrong.

169
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,166
Look, if you're
not feeling too good,

170
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,875
I don't mind calling
Ringo to come pick you up.

171
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,541
These two have been
friends for a while,

172
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,625
so it's only natural he'd
know Ringo was her best friend.

173
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,833
Just don't push it, okay?

174
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,541
So, what? Is Ringo
like my guardian now?

175
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,791
Think about it...
the answer is yes.

176
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,208
Ryoko...!

177
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,583
Good morning!

178
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,750
And we're back to middle school
for Okamisan's side of the tale.

179
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,291
I had my seat
switched next to yours.

180
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,541
Ever since I got the flu...

181
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,583
For some reason...

182
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,583
Ringo's refused
to leave my side.

183
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,458
Never let your prey escape!

184
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,166
That's that devious
heart of hers!

185
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,125
Exactly how long
were you planning

186
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,916
on following me
around like this?

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,333
I was thinking maybe forever.

188
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,791
Do whatever you want.

189
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,708
To be honest, I didn't
mind it all that much.

190
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,041
Hey, Ryoko!

191
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,500
'S goin' on...?

192
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,166
I heard you got laid up with
a nasty fever'r somethin'.

193
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,791
Yeah, I did; but I'm
feeling a lot better now.

194
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,083
Listen to me...

195
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,250
You've gotta stop
being so hard on yourself...

196
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,416
Your body won't recover

197
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,166
if you don't allow
it some time to rest.

198
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,625
I don't care!
I just wanna get strong!

199
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,458
I know...

200
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,500
But it doesn't work like that.

201
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,708
If toughening up were that easy,

202
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,875
don't you think everybody'd
be out there doing it?

203
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,666
Strength is something
you build up gradually.

204
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,625
What's gained in one day
is easily lost the next.

205
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,041
And I don't think

206
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,333
that's the kind of power
you're looking for.

207
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,708
Is it?

208
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,125
It didn't matter.

209
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,208
All I wanted was strength...

210
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,375
...even the kind you
lose was fine with me.

211
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,916
Is that your normal routine?

212
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,375
Yep.

213
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,583
It's terribly unhealthy
to strain yourself

214
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,291
to that degree right now...

215
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,625
Remember, you are
still recovering.

216
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,625
Shut up...

217
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,500
It's none of your
business anyway.

218
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,458
Please... Stop...!

219
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,000
Leave me alone!

220
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,208
"Leave me alone!"

221
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,958
You're awful bossy, punk.

222
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,541
No! Please!

223
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,875
Wait! What are you doing?

224
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,000
C'mon...

225
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,333
Gimmie your damn wallet.

226
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,000
I told you!

227
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,375
I don't have one.

228
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,291
What's up, losers?

229
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,291
What's your problem?

230
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,791
Get out of here!

231
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,333
Great... he got away.

232
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,333
That sucks for you.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,083
Bring it on!

234
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't get too cocky, girl.

235
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,291
Police...!

236
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,166
Police help!

237
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,291
We're over here!

238
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,708
Please, we need your help!

239
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,791
Time to go!

240
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,375
Thanks to Ringo's
quick thinking...

241
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,791
...the delinquents hastily flee.

242
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,291
Are you okay?

243
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,791
What were you thinking?!

244
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,750
How could you be
so completely reckless...

245
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,791
You do realize you're
not an actual wolf?

246
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,041
Yeah, well;
I am what I am, okay?

247
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,500
Balderdash!

248
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,125
Do you understand how
worried I was about you...?

249
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,416
You could've been killed!

250
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,958
They were high schoolers.

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,416
Why do you care
what happens to me?

252
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,916
You talk in your sleep

253
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,541
That day...

254
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,916
you kept saying you wanted
someone to believe you.

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,166
No way; you're wrong!

256
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,375
I know what I heard...

257
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,166
and it made me
wonder if deep down...

258
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,416
you might be a frightened,
lonely girl just like me.

259
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,500
Why do you do it...?

260
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,625
Why do you pretend to be
rough and tough all the time?

261
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,166
Be quiet.

262
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,541
Why do you try so
hard to fool everyone?

263
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,250
Shut up.

264
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,416
Tell me the truth...!

265
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,458
Or will you just keep
lying to yourself?

266
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,208
I told you to shut up...

267
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,791
What the hell is
your problem...?

268
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,416
Why can't you leave me alone?!

269
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,958
Get out of my face!

270
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,625
I just wanted to
learn about you...

271
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,000
The real you...

272
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,958
That's all I wanted...

273
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,541
We're both alone in this city...

274
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,583
and I thought we
seemed a lot alike...

275
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,791
You hold the world
at a distance...

276
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,708
...and pretend to everyone
you're not in pain...

277
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
...while I smile and act nice...

278
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,125
...but we're both
lying to people.

279
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,375
I guess we're not
too similar, though...

280
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,125
I'm just hiding...

281
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,541
You're dealing with
everything on your own.

282
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,208
I'm in awe of you
and feel sad for you

283
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,166
at the same time,
isn't that funny?

284
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,500
In the end...

285
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,375
I'm only here because
I want to be your friend.

286
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,083
Funny...

287
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,250
You're still saying that.

288
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,750
You're scared, aren't you...

289
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,875
If someone betrays
you a second time...

290
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,125
...you don't know if you'll be
able to stand on your own again.

291
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,708
I will never betray you.

292
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,708
Promise... I swear I'll be
at your side forever, Ryoko.

293
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
You don't have to lie to me.

294
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,000
You don't have to pretend
to be something you're not.

295
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,500
You can cry all you want.

296
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,083
It doesn't matter to
me if you're not strong.

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,666
I can't...

298
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,958
I made up my mind
I was gonna be strong.

299
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,833
That way I could live
on my own if I had to.

300
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,416
I'm scared.

301
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,375
I'm so scared.

302
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,958
Damn it.

303
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,708
The day after that...

304
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,958
Ringo and I decided
to become roommates.

305
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,541
And then...

306
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,625
...we told each other things

307
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,250
we'd never been
able to tell anyone...

308
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,000
Why we'd come to this academy...

309
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,166
Our pasts...

310
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,208
I even told her what happened
with Shiro at my last school...

311
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,791
I told her the story
no one would believe...

312
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,791
And... she believed me.

313
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,000
Don't look so defeated already.

314
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,625
She'll eventually
learn to trust you...

315
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,875
I know she will.

316
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,791
And then she'll open up
to you about everything.

317
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,583
Hang in there.

318
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,458
Try to be a little bit tougher.

319
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,750
Please don't take
that too personally...

320
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,833
It's just Ryoko needs
someone in her life

321
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,791
who can take care of her.

322
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,500
You have to be strong for her.

323
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,166
Stronger than anyone.

324
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,291
Be strong...

325
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,708
When I first got to this school,

326
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,375
I was afraid of
people staring at me.

327
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,208
And so I started
to observe people

328
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,375
to learn how to
avoid standing out.

329
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,291
Among those I watched...

330
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
Okamisan has quite the impact.

331
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,791
Ooh la la.

332
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,458
I guess, in a way, I stood out.

333
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,583
Holy doodle, I'm starving.

334
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,541
I thought lunch
would never get here!

335
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,416
Yeah?

336
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,041
This is going to blow your mind!

337
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,458
Why...?

338
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,291
She always looked like
she was so cold to everyone...

339
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,541
But with Ringo...
she was different.

340
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,250
I'll take those.

341
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,166
I started watching
her all the time...

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,125
She seemed
surprisingly gentle...

343
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,875
It made me wonder why
she was always so rude

344
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
and tried to push
everyone away...

345
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,333
That weird disconnect
she had fascinated me.

346
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,625
He talked more about Okamisan's

347
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,041
disconnectedness
back in Episode two.

348
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,916
Her feet are like
those of a wild goat...

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,875
but a hot goat not like a
Billy Goats Gruff thing...

350
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,708
Ryoshi obviously
has a foot fetish.

351
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,875
Somewhere along the way,
I fell in love with her.

352
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,166
After that, I learned they
were joining the Otogi Bank.

353
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,833
I was too weak...

354
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,541
I couldn't protect
the person I loved.

355
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,833
I never want to
be like that again.

356
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,375
Watching from the outside and
not being able to do anything.

357
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,708
I will protect Ryoko.

358
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,041
Thanks, guys!

359
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,958
Ryoko!!!

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,458
Hold on just a second...

361
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,250
I'm okay.

362
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,833
Alright.

363
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,833
I... I wanted to let you know
I'm gonna become a strong man

364
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,541
and protect you
from all the bad stuff.

365
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,166
Because I love you
more than anything else

366
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,250
in the world, Ryoko.

367
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,958
Another shocking
love confession!

368
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,666
Check out the joys of youth.

369
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,416
Knock it off, you jerks...!

370
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,250
Did you have to say stupid
crap like that in front of them?

371
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,458
And, here's our
standard reaction.

372
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,166
I'm outta here.

373
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,666
No, wait...! Ryoko stop!

374
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,916
You are beyond an idiot.

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,666
They're such a sweet couple.

376
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,458
I didn't mean to embarrass you!

377
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,833
Come back!

378
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,875
Dinner's served!

379
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,958
Wow...

380
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,125
That looks frikkin awesome!

381
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,958
Someone's in a different
mood from this morning...

382
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,791
Ringo didn't fail to notice
that little tidbit, either.

383
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,000
Did something
interesting happen today?

384
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,750
Because, more than
anything, I love you Ryoko.

385
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,458
No.

386
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,375
You're lying.

387
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,250
And you can't have any more
until you tell me the truth...

388
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,458
What happened today?

389
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,375
I... well, uh... it's...

390
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,000
...to do with Ryoshi...

391
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,875
I only calmed
Ryoko down a bit...

392
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,541
I guess I readied her
for someone else to tame.

393
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,791
Nothing.

394
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,125
Liars don't get to eat.

395
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,458
Give it back!

396
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,166
And so, we've learned more
about Okamisan's past...

397
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,583
But more importantly, at least
she's cheered up a bit...

398
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,625
All's well that ends well.

399
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,541
Oooh, a double date
in the next episode.

400
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,041
Sounds promising.
