1
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:21,041
A long time ago in
a faraway village...

2
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,541
Okay, it wasn't
really that long ago

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,416
and more of a suburb really...

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Anyway... town
called Otogibana City

5
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,583
and school called
Otogi Academy, here we go...

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,166
The Academy director

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,041
was a raunchy old coot
named Ranpu Aragami...

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,750
He was also a member
of the Aragami Family,

9
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,000
which calls the shots in town.

10
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,458
He created a club called the

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,041
Otogi Academy Mutual
Student Aid Association.

12
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,583
Also known as the Otogi Bank.

13
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,875
The purpose of this club
is to help out students

14
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,291
who need assistance,

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,083
in return for favors which
are to be repaid later...

16
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,750
And that is where
our story begins...

17
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,125
So, Ryoshi...
how are things going?

18
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,750
It's been a week now, hasn't it?

19
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,291
Oh, uh... yes, sir.

20
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:08,000
You know you have gotten so
much better at being looked at.

21
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,541
Thanks; it's been hard,

22
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,833
but I think I'm at least used
to you guys looking at me...

23
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,708
...well... for the most part.

24
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,375
Staaaaare.

25
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,333
Please don't stare!!

26
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,875
Ryoshi has a condition
called ophthalmophobia.

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,166
It's a hilarious fear
of being stared at.

28
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,541
Nice going Alice!

29
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,041
She's used to
dealing with Majolika.

30
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,708
It looks like he's just as
much of a screw up as ever.

31
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,916
Seriously.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,125
Now don't forget about
yesterday's request.

33
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,000
He did do a pretty
good job of shielding you.

34
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,833
You have to admit... Didn't he?

35
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,750
Yeah.

36
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,333
True... I suppose
that didn't totally suck.

37
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,166
You didn't get hurt, did you?

38
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,833
No. I'm fine.

39
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,250
I'm just sorry
I couldn't help any more.

40
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,791
He's kind of a delicate shield,

41
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,750
but I guess it's better
than no shield at all.

42
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,416
Just so you know,
you would make things

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,125
a whole lot more
interesting for me

44
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,083
if you'd consider Ryoshi
as a potential love match.

45
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:04,791
No way!

46
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,583
Sorry, Ringo... but...

47
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,291
It's not gonna happen.

48
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,041
How utterly disappointing.

49
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,000
It's okay. I'm still happy.

50
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,416
Your companion,
your shield,

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm good with being
whatever it takes...

52
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,208
Just as long as I get
to be close to you, Ryoko.

53
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,500
Kay.

54
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm off to the gym...

55
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,583
See ya later.

56
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,541
Good job today.

57
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,833
Have a great workout!

58
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,750
'Kay, I guess I'll
see you tomorrow, Ringo.

59
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,583
Um...

60
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,416
Wait, do you have a minute?

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,833
It's not a big deal...

62
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,083
There's just something
I've been wanting to ask you.

63
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,083
Oh... Sure.

64
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,333
Ask away.

65
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,583
What is it about Ryoko
that caught your fancy?

66
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,250
Oh... well... uh...

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,833
I, um...

68
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,208
Please tell me; I'm begging you.

69
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,375
Okay.

70
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,041
Well she's cool and
she's good at boxing

71
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,708
and she's kinda got
this wild girl thing

72
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,458
going on which is nice.

73
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,541
I think you should know
that "wild thing" part

74
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,125
isn't very flattering
to say to a girl.

75
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,791
Oh... No, I guess it
wouldn't be, would it...?

76
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,250
But, to be honest, there is one
other thing that caught my eye.

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,541
I'd already been watching her
a while before I noticed it.

78
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,875
It's when she's acting tough
even though she's scared...

79
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,458
...or is strong and
weak at the same time.

80
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,916
There's like this
sense of disconnection

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
between her appearance
and what she's feeling.

82
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,125
It's almost like I'm getting
to see a bit of the real Ryoko.

83
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,500
There's more...

84
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,166
She's always striving
to be so strong.

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,833
I can't help but appreciate
that part about her, too.

86
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, that's delightful,

87
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,708
though I feel a bit
embarrassed for asking.

88
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,708
What...?

89
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh... I'm sorry--I
didn't mean to.

90
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,250
On the other hand,
at least I can relax now.

91
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,000
What do you mean by that?

92
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

93
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,875
Ringo take a hike.

94
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,875
You're just a girl!

95
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,750
Yes, I see now.

96
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,083
This could come in handy.

97
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,625
The president is
unusually serious...

98
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,291
How disconcerting.

99
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,125
Look at the little
Akita puppies!

100
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,916
Aren't they adorable?!

101
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,666
Apparently, someone
doesn't want anyone else

102
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,083
to see her loving
on some puppies.

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,583
I won't hurt you... see?

104
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,250
Aww, she's a sucker
for dumb animals!

105
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,583
Speaking of...

106
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,291
Oh, but you're a
good puppy too, huh?

107
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,791
Ryoko...

108
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,625
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,416
I was picking up groceries.

110
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,666
They belong to you?

111
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,625
Ryoshi brought these
two lovely ladies

112
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,375
with him from the countryside...

113
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,750
Not that it matters,
but his uncle named them.

114
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,083
This is Elizabeth and Francoise.

115
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,000
I've never seen them take
to someone like that before.

116
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,166
They're hunting dogs,
so they're not very social...

117
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,750
You must like dogs, huh?

118
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,541
No, they were just acting like
they wanted to be pets, so...

119
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,208
I mean, so.

120
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,166
I think they know there's
something in the air.

121
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,583
You see what I mean?

122
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,083
Still though;
they never do that!

123
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,291
Yeah, whatever...

124
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,166
I'll see you tomorrow.

125
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,000
Right, okay!

126
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,166
I'll see you tomorrow!

127
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
He's so cute...

128
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,208
Look at him smiling...

129
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,041
He's not used to seeing a sweet
side to our little Wolfie-poo.

130
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,958
Later that night...

131
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,458
You'll never guess
what dear Ryoshi told me

132
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,208
on the way home
from school today.

133
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,083
What's that?

134
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,291
He told me what it was about you

135
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,916
that he found so
terribly attractive.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,375
Did you ask him that?

137
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,083
He said it took a
while to figure out,

138
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,000
but eventually he
sensed the disconnection

139
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,291
between how you
act and how you feel.

140
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,208
And then he told me he
liked you because of how hard

141
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,958
you work to try to
appear strong all the time.

142
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,541
If you ask me,
he's fairly sharp.

143
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,541
Night.

144
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,750
And the next day, after class...

145
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,791
Shopping?

146
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,958
Yes...

147
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,833
The President had
a sudden inspiration...

148
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,250
...something about
improving our equipment.

149
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,916
Incidentally, the club funding
comes from the director,

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,666
meaning the Otogi Bank
is quite well off financially.

151
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,708
Why would he want to come along

152
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,541
when he can just
have us go for him?

153
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,083
I'm kind of worried...

154
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,166
I left Ryoshi in charge of the
public office... with Taro.

155
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,958
If you ask me,
they could both stand

156
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,791
to have a little more
testosterone in their lives.

157
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,208
His name is Taro Urashima.

158
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,458
You'll remember him

159
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,250
from a brief appearance
in the last episode...

160
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,375
That said, he's actually
a year older than Ryoshi

161
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,125
and the other club members.

162
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,916
Um... so, uh...

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,875
You, uh... transferred
here early this semester?

164
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,541
I mean, that's what I heard...

165
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,416
So was there a reason for that?

166
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,208
Oh yeah... a couple of 'em.

167
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,291
Oh... okay.

168
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,416
Yaoi fans, this
one's not into men.

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,791
Sorry.

170
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,666
Oh...! It looks like
someone's come to visit!

171
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,375
Here; this is for you.

172
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,791
Thank you so much.

173
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,666
It's just some tea.

174
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,166
Aw, lil' Ryoshi...

175
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,708
You're still not used to
dealing with people, are you?

176
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,708
Is Okamisan here by chance?

177
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,458
She's out shopping right now,
but, if you want me to,

178
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,625
I don't mind calling
her if you want me to.

179
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,333
Uhh... No, um...

180
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,750
You are simply
enchanting, my dear...

181
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,833
For someone as
beautiful as you...

182
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,416
I would listen to
requests all day long.

183
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,958
Unlike men, when it
comes to "the ladies,"

184
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,916
Taro finds himself
simply spellbound...

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,458
However...

186
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,666
Taro?

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,458
I'm curious; what
exactly are you doing?

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,083
This always ends up happening.

189
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,666
No. You don't understand.
She needs help.

190
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,875
If you're feeling lonely,
darling, I can cure you.

191
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,708
No! Let me go...! Come on...!

192
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,750
Can't we talk
about this? Please!

193
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,500
This way... Hurry up!

194
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,916
As I said before...

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,333
I'll leave what they're
doing up to your imagination.

196
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,875
...call Ryoko for you.

197
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,166
Ryoshi decided
that was a good time

198
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,083
to go ahead and call Okamisan...

199
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,666
Everyone else is
still out shopping.

200
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,625
So... What exactly
is your request?

201
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,666
I, uh...

202
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
I was sorta hoping...

203
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,083
Well, I hear you're really
good at tough requests...

204
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,958
So I came to ask you...

205
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,250
My ex-boyfriend was always
pretty violent towards me...

206
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,208
In fact, that's the
reason I broke up

207
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,375
with him in the first place--

208
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,041
but he keeps trying
to get back together

209
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,708
So this is about love?

210
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,250
Requests like this
are pretty common;

211
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,750
we get them all the time.

212
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,541
He said if I... met with
him... he'd let me go.

213
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,625
This is where he wanted to meet.

214
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,916
Triangle Park, in
the southern district.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,041
I think he might try to force
me to go out with him again...

216
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,291
I'm scared.

217
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,458
What do you want to do?

218
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,708
Only one thing to do...

219
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,000
We need to head over to the Park

220
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,250
and see if we can figure
out what he's planning.

221
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,416
Thank you!

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,583
You don't know how
much help that will be!

223
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,666
I promise I'll repay my debt!

224
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,958
Do you wanna come with us?

225
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,166
Totally up to you.

226
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,625
No... I don't really
want to see him again...

227
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,541
I'll just let you
handle it, if that's okay.

228
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,541
That's fine...

229
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,666
We'll contact you
when we're done.

230
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,208
Thanks; I appreciate it.

231
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,333
He should be here somewhere.

232
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,208
Well, I don't
see anybody around.

233
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,250
Hey...

234
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,958
You're that
Okamisan, aren't you?

235
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,125
This is bad...

236
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,791
They're from Onigashima.

237
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:09,333
Ryoshi and Okamisan are
surrounded by delinquents...!

238
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,541
What will become of them?!

239
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,625
These guys are thugs from
Onigashima High School...

240
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,041
You may not know this,

241
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,458
but the Oni part of Onigashima
technically means demon.

242
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,916
An accurate description.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You know this isn't
Onigashima territory.

244
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,458
Why are you here?

245
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,083
In Otogibana City, schools
have associated territories.

246
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,208
In Otogi Academy territory,

247
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,708
you don't normally find
these kinds of punk kids.

248
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,666
Go back to the office, Ryoshi...

249
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,708
You need to hurry; you're only
gonna get in my way here...

250
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,916
Against this many people,

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you won't be able to
shield me from much...

252
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,375
Now's your last chance. Go.

253
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,166
No way!

254
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,708
Get out of here, now!

255
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,333
No...

256
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,458
I won't...

257
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,416
I'm not gonna leave
you behind, okay?!

258
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,083
No!

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,250
You should have listened
to your little girlfriend

260
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,791
instead of acting
like you could hang--

261
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,666
Go to hell!

262
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,625
Hey!

263
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,625
You'll pay for this!

264
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,500
Let go of me you son of a bitch!

265
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,916
Meanwhile, at the Otogi Bank...

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,708
They're taking forever.

267
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,208
All the shoppers
have finally returned.

268
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,583
If they were just meeting
with some typical stalker guy,

269
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,541
don't you think they'd
have come back by now?

270
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,625
They have, I saw
the requestor earlier

271
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,791
and she said they'd both
come back together...

272
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,041
Perhaps Ryoko
had to go out again?

273
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,500
Ryoshi!

274
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,208
They've got Ryoko.

275
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,666
Hey.

276
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,625
Why do you lie to everyone?

277
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,875
I don't.

278
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,791
That's not true; your
being strong is a lie.

279
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,041
I am not lying about
that--I am strong!

280
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,958
No. You're simply a wolf in
wolf's clothing, aren't you?

281
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,041
You have to face it...

282
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,958
You've been lying
ever since that day,

283
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,250
pretending you'll be
fine all on your own.

284
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not pretending anything.

285
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:25,750
The truth is you really
do want to rely on someone.

286
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,250
Rely on someone?

287
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,250
I can't afford to do that.

288
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,958
Otherwise the same
thing will happen again.

289
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,083
It would seem she's tied up
in an abandoned factory...

290
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,750
My guess is they're
in Onigashima Territory.

291
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,416
Look who's finally awake.

292
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,458
Man.

293
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,583
You really did a
number on us... huh?

294
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,458
Don't get mad; I was just trying
to beat some of the ugly out--

295
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,666
What did you just say?

296
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,916
Bitch... Say it again.

297
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,291
Calm down.

298
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,500
Don't hurt her too much,

299
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,125
or you know the boss
is gonna hurt you, too.

300
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,125
You're pathetic.

301
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,208
Spineless cowards who
can only obey their master.

302
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,541
This is a wolf, desperately
wearing wolf's clothing.

303
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,000
Howl while you can...

304
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,041
...the boss'll be
here soon enough.

305
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,666
Yes... Right...

306
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,208
Thank you for the information.

307
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,833
The requestor was being
threatened the whole time...

308
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,250
They sent her here to find
a way to lure Ryoko out

309
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,708
where they could
get control of her.

310
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,083
Does she have any idea
where Ryoko was taken?

311
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,291
No, she doesn't know.

312
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,625
Good work on this, Alice.

313
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,041
Now, why don't we gather
everyone together quickly

314
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,166
so we can split up
and start looking for her.

315
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,750
No, wait!

316
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,875
I think I can take care of this.

317
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,083
I'll be fine. I can get away.

318
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,041
Stay calm... just stay calm.

319
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,750
You're wasting your time.

320
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,791
Ooooh, the Onigashima
boss has appeared.

321
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,916
So, it turns out the
mighty Okamisan

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,416
isn't all that mighty after all.

323
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,833
What kind of guys
gang up on a girl...?

324
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,791
Seems to me the Onigashima boss

325
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,583
isn't that concerned
about having a fair fight.

326
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm scared.

327
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,083
Yeah, that's only
'cause someone told me

328
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,208
you were too tough to
beat in a normal fight...

329
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,791
He was right, too,

330
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,000
but I think getting our hands
on you made it all worthwhile...

331
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,541
Don't you?

332
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,625
Someone?

333
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,791
Like who, because, surprise,

334
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,916
I don't know any of
your loser friends.

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Believe it or not, Princess
Ryoko, you are awfully famous...

336
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,500
Now, if you don't
give me any trouble,

337
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,458
I promise not to hurt you.

338
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,958
The wolf's clothing is on
the verge of being torn off!

339
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,416
Someone... save me!

340
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,208
Hey!

341
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,000
Got it, boss.

342
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,541
Yeah, hello?

343
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,208
Is Ryoko safe?

344
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,583
Safe? Who the hell are you?

345
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,625
I'm the one asking
if Ryoko is safe.

346
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,416
Gimme that.

347
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,791
Sorry to interrupt,

348
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,750
but we were just about
to have a little fun here...

349
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,666
Feel free to listen in,
or, if you want,

350
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,583
maybe I can send you
some pictures later.

351
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,208
No need. You won't get that far.

352
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,750
If you want I can
send some pictures

353
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,250
of what your stupid
faces look like.

354
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:04,041
Ryoshi.

355
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:06,916
Guys...

356
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,750
Heads up!

357
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,833
They're shooting something!

358
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,791
Ryoko!

359
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,416
You stuck it out pretty well.

360
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,250
Ringo...

361
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,208
You found me!

362
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,041
I had nothing to do with it.

363
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,250
Hey, girls; when
did you get here?

364
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,625
They're the ones
who led us to you;

365
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,208
they picked up on your scent.

366
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,625
Thank you...!

367
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,333
So what's gotten into Ryoshi?

368
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,541
He took us all by
surprise, actually.

369
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,750
And you know something,

370
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't think he's
quite the weakling

371
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,916
we all took him for at first.

372
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,291
Damn it! Where the
hell is this guy??

373
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,875
Ryoshi is holding
pachinko balls.

374
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,291
Together with his slingshot,

375
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,000
they make quite the
fearsome hunting weapon.

376
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,666
They're also
useful for attacking

377
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,125
from hard to see places.

378
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,833
A perfect fit for
our darling screw up.

379
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,250
The President's
the one who saw it...

380
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,666
He noticed something
when he was reviewing

381
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,708
the video of you
and that stalker guy...

382
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,833
Apparently, Ryoshi has
been using a slingshot

383
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,166
since he was a boy
and is quite skilled with it.

384
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,000
Whoa.

385
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,125
You mean that was him?

386
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,875
Incidentally,
in the first episode,

387
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,833
he was using a wad of gum
he found in his pants.

388
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,500
Yes, that was Ryoshi, but
because he didn't come out

389
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,750
from hiding to try and help you,

390
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,875
he didn't think it
was worth mentioning.

391
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,375
Isn't it funny;
he assumed it didn't matter!

392
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,125
Pretty funny. Yeah...

393
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,916
Well... might as well join in.

394
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,541
I figured you might say that...

395
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,958
Here you go!

396
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,083
Custom Made Kitty Knuckles!

397
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,875
Allow me to explain...

398
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,833
These Custom Made Kitty
Knuckles have a mechanism

399
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,666
which functions like a stun gun,
delivering an electric current

400
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,875
when they punch something.

401
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,291
Now she'll huff and she'll puff

402
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,416
and she'll knock
those jerks down!

403
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,375
Okamisan in the front!

404
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,416
Ryoshi covering the back!

405
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,375
What a magnificently
coordinated play!

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,416
My body is light...

407
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,541
I can move easily...

408
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,833
I can rely on someone
covering my back...

409
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,666
I could get used to this.

410
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,708
Oh my goodness, I just hate
it when things get violent.

411
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,708
The rest of the
Otogi Bank staff appears!

412
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't you tell anyone
I touched a man.

413
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,708
The sophisticated,
yet rather conceited Taro.

414
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,583
And, Otohime is
spellbound, of course.

415
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
Adorable!

416
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,791
They look like they're
in a little fight relay...

417
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,250
They work like a
well oiled machine.

418
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,916
That kinda tickled.

419
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,625
He's terrifying...

420
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,708
And on top of that, he's huge!

421
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,875
Would you stay still
for a damn second?

422
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll kill you!

423
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,750
Now!

424
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,583
Ding. Ding. Ding. Knockout.

425
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,500
Great job as usual.

426
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,958
Thanks... but it
wasn't just me... Right?

427
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,291
Amazing coordination!

428
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,375
Oh no. I think that was love.

429
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,708
Tale as old as time!

430
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,750
True as it can be!

431
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,833
That isn't it at all!

432
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,541
Someone doth protest too much.

433
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,416
Ryoko!

434
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,375
Get off of me!

435
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,166
I just love strong girls.

436
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,500
I knew you had to
be the one for me.

437
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,541
Hey!

438
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,250
You better let her go right now.

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,583
Let her go

440
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,666
Ryoshi!

441
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,208
I'll protect her...
No matter what.

442
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,500
You wanna do this man to man?

443
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,958
Sounds like fun.

444
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,791
Ryoko!

445
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,500
Nice...

446
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,458
You're not too bad, kid.

447
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,083
Are we done yet?

448
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,041
Little bastard!

449
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,958
I'll teach you to mess with me!

450
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,166
No way... I'm a hunter!

451
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,625
I told you to
stay away from her.

452
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,625
Oh, Ryoshi...

453
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,583
Who's a strong little fighter?

454
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,125
Wow, he actually
pulled off cool there

455
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,875
for just a second, didn't he?

456
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,125
Yeah...

457
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,416
Uh... I mean; just
forget what I just said.

458
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,458
My stars, there's no
reason to be embarrassed.

459
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,625
Whatever; I'm not.

460
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,833
All right, kids...
I think it's time to go.

461
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,458
I wonder...

462
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,375
Why on earth were
Onigashima students

463
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,708
targeting Ryoko
in the first place?

464
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,125
Good question.

465
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,000
I believe this may call
for some additional research.

466
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,458
I see more troubles
in their future.

467
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh, you're such good
puppies; yes you are!

468
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,666
I'm so proud of you both,

469
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,458
you did such a
great job today...

470
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,291
You're my little heroes.

471
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,666
You are so amazing.

472
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,083
Stop staring!

473
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,000
He's still everybody's
favorite screw up, isn't he?

474
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,916
Back to normal already.

475
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,625
Yes, and it's such a shame, too.

476
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,541
They're perfect for each other.

477
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,041
Geez, he could at least
try to not be pathetic.

478
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,375
Ryoko...

479
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,666
Aren't you going to reward
him for putting his life

480
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,458
on the line like that?

481
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,833
Hell nah.

482
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,083
It looks like it's
going to be a long time

483
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,750
before Okamisan takes off
that wolf clothing of hers...

484
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,166
I suppose I'll just let today's
story end on that note...

485
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,708
Alls well that ends well.

486
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,833
