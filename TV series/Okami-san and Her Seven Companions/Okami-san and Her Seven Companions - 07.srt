1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,291
Gary, Indiana--oh!

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,291
No, its Otogibana City.

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,416
Ryoshi is running today...

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,541
Ooh, look at him go.

5
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,458
He's really fast.

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,000
You're late, Ryoshi.

7
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,375
I'm right on time.

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,708
Suddenly he stops.

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,166
He looks up, for, lo--

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,125
What's your problem?

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,250
There she stands.

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,000
The girl of his dreams.

13
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,791
It's just that...
you're so cute.

14
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,541
I certainly didn't
get dressed up like this

15
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,708
because I was going out
with you, that's for sure...

16
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,666
Ringo said it would look
weird on a double date

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,833
if I dressed the
way I normally do.

18
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,375
That's right.

19
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,125
The "ninja tramp look" is not
a suitable first impression.

20
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,333
Mind your posture and
try to behave like a lady.

21
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,708
I think it's a perfect outfit

22
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,500
for your first real
date with Ryoshi,

23
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,041
you little lovebird,
so don't mess it up!

24
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,083
This isn't even a date.

25
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,666
It's a business meeting.

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,500
Just like any other request.

27
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,000
So, do you have any
idea where Ami and Jin

28
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,958
might be waiting for us?

29
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,125
They met up about
thirty minutes ago

30
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:24,125
and they've just been standing
there ever since... not talking.

31
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,666
This should be different...

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,583
Today's request
is a double date.

33
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,958
Long, long ago...
about a week ago really.

34
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:10,750
Hey...

35
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,791
So uh, I'm Jin Hanasaki...

36
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,708
Our requestor also happens to be
the star of the baseball team.

37
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,708
Turns out he's a little freaked

38
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,250
because someone
has been sneaking

39
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,125
into his house to clean...

40
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,583
...and also make food for him...

41
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,166
I know... what a tragedy.

42
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,541
But it is a little
creepy stalkerish.

43
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,291
Not that he was creeped
out enough to keep

44
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,291
from eating what
was made for him.

45
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,083
But, he asked
the bank to find out

46
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,291
who was committing these
culinary acts of kindness...

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:44,041
...and the crew decided to wire
his home with hidden cameras.

48
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,791
The culprit turned
out to be Ami Jizou,

49
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,000
a second year student who's
known to be a little strange.

50
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,583
She's a good, sweet girl
with a type A personality

51
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,791
and an unblemished reputation.

52
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,875
Until now, I suppose.

53
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,208
Stop that!

54
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,500
Why do we do this
to ourselves ladies?

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,416
It's repulsive
on multiple levels.

56
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,125
The next day...

57
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,750
they called Ami in to
question her about it...

58
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,666
She said that one time
Jin lent her an umbrella

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,458
on a rainy day.

60
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,291
Apparently, she thought
it was important

61
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,583
to repay that kindness
with breaking and entering.

62
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,583
You see, she was
just too nervous

63
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,166
to say "thank you" in person.

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,041
She was shy after all...

65
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,208
...and secretly taking
care of someone you like

66
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,541
is easier than facing
them, if you're Ami.

67
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,625
On account of her nervousness

68
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,583
she let Ringo tell her
exactly what to do...

69
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,583
I... um... well, I...

70
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,625
Okay... I think I might be
totally in love with you.

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,666
That's cool...

72
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,166
...but I don't really think
I could date you right now

73
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,083
because we're just friends
and stuff like that, ya' know?

74
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,500
But I can see you're
trying really hard

75
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,500
and coach always said
hard work pays off so, yeah,

76
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,250
I guess I should
do something for you.

77
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,208
No, wait...!

78
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,041
That's not why I came here!

79
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,250
In that case, I think a
date would be appropriate.

80
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,916
So Ringo set up a date

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
between the two
star-crossed love birds...

82
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,125
"But Ami will get nervous

83
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,916
if they're alone
together," she cried!

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,375
And that's how Ringo
managed convince Okamisan

85
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,291
and Ryoshi to make
it a double date.

86
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,250
That's why I have
you two with them.

87
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,208
You have to keep Ami
from getting nervous.

88
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,875
Just act the part--hold hands.

89
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,500
Huh?

90
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,041
What's she up to?

91
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,750
Dates are all about creating
the right atmosphere.

92
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,791
Not my problem.

93
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,291
But it is your job.

94
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,541
On a job for the bank you
have to do whatever it takes.

95
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,125
I'm only doing this
so that we look normal.

96
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,791
Fine with me!

97
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,833
C'mon, we're going.

98
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

99
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,875
Move it.

100
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,583
C'mon baseball, can't you get
her moving any faster than that?

101
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,750
She makes it look like
Olympic Partner Speed Walking.

102
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,041
Wait.

103
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,083
All right.

104
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,541
Well played.

105
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,250
They look like the
bulls in Pamplona.

106
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,708
Can't wait to see
what happens next.

107
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,166
His Aunt Yukime always makes
him carry the handkerchief.

108
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,375
She's like a life-sized
crying baby doll.

109
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,791
Wow, he's way too good at that.

110
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,583
This is what a young couple
is supposed to look like!

111
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,958
These two, however, look like
a bitter, old married couple.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,083
Maybe things will
pick up in the park.

113
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,500
Ami's as nervous as she
was when we started

114
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:17,208
and Jin has barely said
a word to her all day.

115
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,166
What's up? Why are
we stopping here?

116
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,583
Ah... Nothing.

117
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,833
Okay.

118
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,541
Gentleman, a picnic is almost
always a good idea for a date...

119
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,375
I'm really sorry.

120
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,958
I forgot to get something--

121
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,958
feel free to go ahead and start
without me though, alright?

122
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,958
Okami seems a bit
distracted today.

123
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,833
And of course Ryoshi is
going to have to follow her.

124
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,500
Sorry, man--you're going to have
to finish the rest without me...

125
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,916
Ryoko, hold on!

126
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,125
So much for doing whatever
it takes while on the job...

127
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,666
they totally got
double date ditched.

128
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,458
Hey, you two. Jeepers!

129
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,833
There's her basket...

130
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,083
Okay now, don't move.

131
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,291
I get it now.

132
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,958
She just couldn't leave
the kitty stranded.

133
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,875
A little risky though.

134
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,583
Almost... come here...

135
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,541
Ryoko, no!

136
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,666
His chivalry mode kicks in...

137
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:28,750
But the pond is a bit shallow.

138
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,708
Ryoko.

139
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,041
Come on, snap out of it.

140
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,791
Okamisan seems to have
hit her head rather hard.

141
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,750
Thank goodness, you're okay.

142
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,541
No! Don't lose the hero act!

143
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,916
Are you okay?
Does anything hurt?

144
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,333
Ryoko?

145
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,833
That's my name...

146
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,875
But... who are you?

147
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:59,166
We'll continue this
in the second half.

148
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,875
My name's Ryoko Okami.

149
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,541
I'm a first year
middle school student...

150
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,166
I'm thirteen.

151
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,208
Middle school? Thirteen.

152
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,375
Something's clearly
not right here.

153
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,666
What's the matter?

154
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,291
Don't hang out
with younger kids?

155
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,666
I don't think you're young.

156
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,791
You... seem older than me.

157
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,208
She thinks I'm an older guy...

158
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,083
'Now, Ryoshi, don't
get any ideas here.

159
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,125
This is absolutely nothing
to be happy about...!

160
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,083
Okay, do you have
any idea who I am?

161
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,333
No. I don't have
the slightest clue...

162
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,750
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:39,708
This is wet.

164
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,083
I'm such an idiot!

165
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:41,875
Sneezy girl.

166
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:42,666
Wet shirt.

167
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,375
Not the smoothest move.

168
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,458
It was still
really sweet of you.

169
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,416
Wow, she didn't hit him!

170
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,750
She's acting so
sweet and adorable...

171
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,958
No, no! Don't tell
me she's got...

172
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,000
Amnesia!

173
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,208
Meanwhile, the requestors...

174
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,333
Oh deary me...

175
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,500
Where did Ryoko and Ryoshi go?

176
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,666
They're not
responding to my calls.

177
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,291
Hello, this is Ringo.

178
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,625
Help me please...

179
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,791
It's no use!

180
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,541
We're all alone and
I'm screwing it up!

181
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,666
Where the heck did
Ryoko and Ryoshi go?

182
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,458
Oh, them... well...

183
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,333
...this is part of our plan
to give you some alone time!

184
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,416
Now... try not to throw up.

185
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,958
Wait, I--

186
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,875
I can't let her think we
would just abandon them.

187
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,833
Nice play, Ringo...

188
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,416
Saving the Otogi Bank name.

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,041
Geez, Louise, Ryoshi, what
do you think you're doing?

190
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,208
It was an emergency!

191
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,041
Ryoko--

192
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,583
What happened?

193
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,791
She fell in a pond
and now she's all cute!

194
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,000
Hold on... You're
not making any sense.

195
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,333
She's like thirteen now.

196
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,416
Good for you...

197
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,958
Now return here
at once young man...

198
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,500
Wait.

199
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,500
He probably should've opened
with the whole amnesia thing.

200
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,500
Excuse me...

201
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,333
Uh mister?

202
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey... you can just call me
Ryoshi if you want to.

203
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,791
Okay... Ryoshi.

204
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,458
When she says my name like that
it makes my leg all tingly.

205
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,541
What, you've never heard
anyone say your name before?

206
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,583
Get a grip, Romeo.

207
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,750
Um... you okay?

208
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,041
Yeah, I'm fine.

209
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,333
Good...

210
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,416
Then would you mind
telling me why I'm all wet

211
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,583
and I'm in a park
with a stranger.

212
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,916
Sixteen years old, huh...?

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,416
I do seem a lot taller.

214
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,750
But why...

215
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,458
I know.

216
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,958
Disappointing, isn't it?

217
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,166
My head's felt fuzzy
this whole time...

218
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,000
This amnesia thing is weird...

219
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,375
I think... hey...

220
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,791
Tell me what I was
like before all of this...

221
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,875
...maybe it'll
help jog my memory.

222
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,083
This is so weird...

223
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,625
I'm the only one she
can rely on right now.

224
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,708
Ryoshi is a responsible
young man and would never

225
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,416
use an opportunity like
this to his advantage.

226
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I know I always thought
you were really sweet.

227
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,500
I was sweet?

228
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,291
What do you mean?

229
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,375
Well, you normally
tried to act tough,

230
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,625
but I could always
see how gentle

231
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,458
you really were
on the inside...

232
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,833
I guess maybe that was the part
that I thought was sweet...

233
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,625
...the inside parts.

234
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,291
So were we like boyfriend
and girlfriend, then?

235
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,833
Wait, were we what?!

236
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,041
Mostly you beat him up and
made him feel worthless; so...

237
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,458
I like the--

238
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,541
Did I say something
to upset you?

239
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,041
No. It's nothing.

240
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,791
The old Ryoko and I were...

241
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,458
...friends, I guess.

242
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,916
Friends. I see, so we're
not together or anything.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,916
That's right...

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,458
Unfortunately.

245
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,416
Wait, then, how come we're in
the park with each other...?

246
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,375
Was it just as friends
or... something?

247
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,750
Actually, we're working
a job together.

248
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,083
Things are progressing...

249
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,916
...not at all... over here.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,958
Then shouldn't we
get back to the job?

251
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,125
But you're in
no condition for work.

252
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,083
And besides
Ringo is with them...

253
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,291
...she's got it.

254
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,250
Are you sure?

255
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,125
Yeah...! Of course.

256
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,750
So decisive!

257
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,833
Well...

258
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,416
what do you think
I should I do now?

259
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,916
Well, let's think about that.

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,125
I guess we should
prob'ly go to the hospital.

261
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,833
Could use some of that
decision here, though.

262
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,333
Okay.

263
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,916
The food looks so delicious!

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,166
Ryoshi, did you--?

265
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,583
I can't take the credit,
this was all your doing.

266
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,916
Wow, I can't believe

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,875
when I'm in high school
I learn how to cook...

268
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,000
That's amazing!

269
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,708
Ryoshi, there's enough
here for two, so please eat.

270
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,208
Yes ma'am.

271
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,708
It's so yummy!

272
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,916
I'm so happy!

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
All his dreams are coming true.

274
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,458
Minus the head injury.

275
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,916
That's good...

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,458
I still know what I like.

277
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,583
And I still dress
the same as I used to...

278
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,708
but you said I acted tough
so I must have gotten over

279
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,583
how shy I was around people.

280
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,250
You used to be shy?

281
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,000
I can talk all right
with you, I guess...

282
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,916
but I've always had
trouble with other people...

283
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,583
I wanted to get over that.

284
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,666
That's a little hard to believe.

285
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,375
All of my friends at school
are super nice to me...

286
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,750
But still... I don't like
being the center of attention.

287
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,625
When we're finished eating

288
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,333
we should really get
you to the hospital.

289
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,291
Yeah.

290
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,916
You okay?

291
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,375
They seem pretty
content doing nothing.

292
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,125
Ryoshi, come on, hurry!

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,583
You've got to slow down!

294
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,833
I must be tired...

295
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,958
What I just saw is
simply not possible.

296
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:44,750
Don't worry, Red!

297
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,916
You're not seeing things!

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,041
What about the hospital?

299
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,875
Just a small treat, okay?

300
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,791
I can't decide if this is a
date or if he's babysitting her.

301
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,000
This feels kind of like...

302
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,000
...the first date I've ever had.

303
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:07,666
Stop having fun.

304
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,375
Head injury. Head injury.

305
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,250
We have to go!

306
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,166
It's about time he remembered
what needs to be done!

307
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,958
We should go.

308
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,083
You're scared, aren't you?

309
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,958
You don't want
to be left alone...

310
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,083
I don't know anything
about this city.

311
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,208
I don't have anyone...

312
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,583
Of course you've got
someone, you got me...

313
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,875
...and I'll protect you
no matter what happens, Ryoko.

314
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,250
I'll always be by your side.

315
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,791
Okay.

316
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,875
It's raining pretty hard.

317
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,375
Can't get to the hospital
until this storm passes...

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,208
Too cold...

319
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,041
Hello?

320
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,333
Criminy, Ryoshi,
what are you doing?

321
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,625
Someone is mad.

322
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,625
Sorry!

323
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,666
How are things
going on your end?

324
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,833
I took care of it, of course.

325
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,208
They're starting to head home

326
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,833
and it feels kind
of like a date now...

327
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,833
What about you?

328
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,000
Nothing over here.

329
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,000
Just a wacked out
time warp date thingy.

330
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,250
No big. We'll talk later.

331
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,708
I think you should
meet up with us--

332
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,833
I have a feeling I'm
going to need your help.

333
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,333
You sure its amnesia?

334
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,916
Oh yeah...

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,416
She says she doesn't remember
a single thing about any of us.

336
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,666
You're kidding...

337
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
Hello Ryoko!

338
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,458
It's your friend Ringo!

339
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,625
'Member me?

340
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,041
No.

341
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,291
She's a little miffed.

342
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,583
Anyway, I think
we need to get her

343
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,958
to the hospital
as soon as we can.

344
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,375
Yeah, you're right.

345
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,250
We should begin
by contacting Alice

346
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,666
to get her recommendation
for a good doctor.

347
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,833
Ryodhi, here.

348
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,375
After that, I think
it'd be a good idea

349
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,000
to get the other Otogi Bank
members in on this little issue.

350
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,666
Yes, They're reliable people

351
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,250
in difficult
situations like this one.

352
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,166
What if Ryoko doesn't
get her memory back?

353
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,458
I don't know...

354
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,125
A stay in a hospital
might be required.

355
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,875
There will be numerous
arrangements to be made.

356
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,708
We need to start
considering the possibility

357
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,750
of contacting her family.

358
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:10,958
I guess so.

359
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,375
There's only so much
we can do on our own...

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,458
I thought you said that
you would stay with me!

361
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,708
Wait, Ryoko!

362
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,208
I don't get it.

363
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,666
I guess we should
go to the hospital.

364
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,333
Of course you've got
someone, you got me.

365
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,666
He was really nice to me...

366
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,708
and seemed so
worried about me...

367
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,916
But now...

368
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,166
Oh, sorry. You okay?

369
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,375
Shiro...

370
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,666
Well, well...

371
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,750
This is quite a
coincidence, Ryoko.

372
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,250
We can't let that
pretty dress get all wet.

373
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,375
I said wait!

374
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,041
It's you again...

375
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,708
We've met before, haven't we?

376
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,166
Hey, are you all right?

377
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,833
Let's go.

378
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,666
Okay.

379
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,625
Would you mind telling me
what your name is young man?

380
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,458
My name is Ryoshi Morino.

381
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,375
Doesn't it bother you,
Ryoshi Morino?

382
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Doesn't what bother me?

383
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,208
Ryoko's relationship with me.

384
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,916
I... I...

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,041
What does he mean?

386
00:18:59,125 --> 00:18:59,916
Is he...

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,708
It was an intimate relationship.

388
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,916
Simply put, I helped
myself to her and enjoyed it.

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,791
You didn't...

390
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,750
No...

391
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,791
I told him no.

392
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,208
Just ignore him!

393
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,833
Yeah, I seem to
recall Ryoko saying

394
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,833
that after being
pleasured by me.

395
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,916
Hard to believe I would
need to take someone...

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,791
but I think she
was asking for it.

397
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,791
You're lying.

398
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,083
Now that I've seen how she was

399
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,583
there's no way
she'd go after you

400
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,791
Who cares?

401
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,625
Our classmates at the time
seemed to think it was the case.

402
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,791
I mean one word from me,

403
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,375
and everyone thought
she was a vindictive bitch

404
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,916
trying to ruin my reputation
because I dumped her.

405
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,916
She transferred because
everyone hated her after that.

406
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,041
But, I could never forget how
Ryoko's lips tasted that day...

407
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,208
I had to follow her
all the way to this city.

408
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,541
When I saw her again,

409
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,708
I wondered if she still
tasted as good because...

410
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,541
She really looks delicious...

411
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,958
You son of a...!

412
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,041
I'm talking right now.
Don't interrupt.

413
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,375
Well look at you...

414
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,000
All fired up.

415
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:16,375
Does it irritate you that you
can never change the past?

416
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,666
It doesn't matter.

417
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,291
It doesn't matter
to me what happened

418
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,875
to Ryoko in her past...

419
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,500
All I care about now is
protecting her in the present.

420
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,000
That's why--

421
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,333
I promise that
I'll hunt you down.

422
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,708
Oooh, I can't wait.

423
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,291
It should be
interesting to say the--

424
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,541
Ryoko!

425
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,125
By the way, Ryoshi.

426
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,583
That bit about helping myself
to Ryoko wasn't quite true.

427
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,791
Yeah right.

428
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,791
But if you thought
you still had a chance

429
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,500
protect her from
that eventuality,

430
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,208
you'd never leave her side...

431
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,541
Of course that's impossible.

432
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,458
Isn't it?

433
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:04,166
After that, Okamisan got
all of her memories back.

434
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,458
You really don't
remember what happened?

435
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,000
Guess you have
amnesia of your amnesia.

436
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,708
Guess so.

437
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,333
Ryoshi sure did a whale
of a job taking care of you.

438
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,500
He deserves something more

439
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,708
than a sock in the
old kisser this time.

440
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,250
Now, then.

441
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,041
Let's get ourselves a little
treat and head home, shall we?

442
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,583
No thanks, I had that
ice cream earlier, 'member?

443
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,708
She had it with Ryoshi before...

444
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958
Wait a minute!

445
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,875
You remember that, huh?

446
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,791
Ringo always gets an evil
smile when she's onto something!

447
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,666
Then the very next day...

448
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,041
What's with... the bow?

449
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:46,166
"If you want me to keep quiet,
come to school wearing this!"

450
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,750
Little Red made her do it.

451
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,333
But...

452
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,833
It's so adorable.

453
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,458
Shut up!

454
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,625
In any case...

455
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,125
Okamisan returned
to her normal self...

456
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,208
All's well that ends well.

457
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,750
Now then, what
about Ami and Jin?

458
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,375
As it turned out,

459
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,875
he really liked the idea of
being taken care of by Ami.

460
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,166
A dude could get used to this.

461
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,791
All's well that
ends well here, too!

462
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,916
House elves and rich boys
and three little pigs!

463
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,958
Oh my!
