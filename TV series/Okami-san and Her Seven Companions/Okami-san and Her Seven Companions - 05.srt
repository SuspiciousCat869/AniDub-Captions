1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,916
A long, long time ago...

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,333
Blech... Boring.

3
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,291
You know the drill.

4
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,625
This is Otogibana City.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,500
And--surprise!--Otogi Academy.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,291
It has a slightly different
atmosphere today, though...

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,083
May I come in?

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,250
Oh, it's just you.

9
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,833
It is my job to give
regular reports, you know.

10
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,333
Remember this guy?

11
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,166
Ranpu Aragami, the
founder of Otogi Academy

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,333
and head of the Aragami
"business family,"

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,416
which runs Otogibana City.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
He's also quite
the dirty old man!

15
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,583
I could go put on a
skirt for you, sir.

16
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,458
Just give me your report.

17
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,083
The student council,
the athletics assembly...

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,083
Most students don't know
this but the Otogi Bank

19
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,250
reports regularly to
the school chairman.

20
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,458
They also don't
know that he

21
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,208
supplies their luxurious
basement clubroom.

22
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,041
And that's all for
inside the school...

23
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,875
...but issues with
Onigashima High School

24
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,458
have risen significantly.

25
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,583
Onigashima High School is where
they send all the future felons.

26
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,791
They should really change
the name to Demon High.

27
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,083
A brand new Student
Council President... perhaps.

28
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,208
That could be...

29
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,000
...who they choose to put

30
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,125
in charge doesn't
necessarily concern me...

31
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,666
It is curious though...

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,875
I'll bring a
follow-up report soon.

33
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,750
Hold on a minute.

34
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,666
Tell those girls at the
Otogi Bank that I'd prefer it

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,250
if they delivered the
report to me next time, okay?

36
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,250
I can tell them... but they
usually take some convincing

37
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,750
to deliver reports to you.

38
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,625
You children are
too smart these days...

39
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,250
How about a new
flat screen this time?

40
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,875
I'll let them know.

41
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,250
This must be how he gets
the basement all decked out

42
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,666
with swanky stuff.

43
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,208
The President is kind
of a dirty bird, too.

44
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,666
Huh... nice school...

45
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,916
Hey. What's goin' on with
this Okami chick, anyway?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,166
Oh, look who's shown up again.

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,875
Don't be in such a rush.

48
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,833
Her time will come soon enough.

49
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,333
That evil smirk means today
is not going to be boring.

50
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,750
Ahh... happy students showing
up for class at Otogi Academy.

51
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,250
Hurry up, people...

52
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,208
Let's not be late!

53
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,125
This is Momoko Kibitsu.

54
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,500
She won second-place at the
Miss Otogi Academy contest

55
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,958
on account of all her curves.

56
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,500
She's a member
of the student code

57
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,333
of conduct
enforcement committee.

58
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,125
Of course, the
outfit she's wearing

59
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,375
is breaking seven
rules and two laws.

60
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,750
Hey, Ryoko?

61
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,708
Oh, you scared me, Ryoshi.

62
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,708
What are you doing hanging
here all by yourself?

63
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,083
Where's Ringo?

64
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,500
She left early this morning
to work the day shift.

65
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,583
Hey, I know...!

66
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,750
Why don't you be my shield?

67
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,666
Move... Only
three minutes to go!

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,583
Let's hustle people!

69
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,875
Ah! What've we here?

70
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,041
You can't sneak by without
a proper greeting, Ryoko.

71
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,583
Good morning, Momoko.

72
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,750
What's with this pouty
look on your face...

73
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,875
...you know, if you let
me make you my little pet...

74
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,291
Oh, my!
Momoko does not hold back.

75
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,458
No thanks.

76
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,916
Class is starting. Gotta run!

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,458
Fine. No prob...

78
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,333
I'll be stopping by the Bank
after class is over today,

79
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,958
so I'll catch up with you then.

80
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,000
Kay.

81
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,500
Try not to be so
adorably terrified.

82
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:17,291
I actually have something
important to discuss.

83
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,833
Jeepers, that
sounds challenging.

84
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,458
I have no skills to
deal with that Amazon.

85
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,375
Normally I attempt
to distract her

86
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,041
by speaking as fast as
I possibly can until Ryoko

87
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,041
can find an opportunity
to run and hide.

88
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,458
She definitely acts like
she's got it bad for you Ryoko.

89
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,583
It all began back
in middle school.

90
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,833
Okamisan, Red,
and Momoko all came

91
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,125
to Otogi Academy from
the same middle school.

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,916
Momoko likes to tussle
with boys and girls equally...

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,833
...and the word
"tussle" is tricky...

94
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,750
It could mean fight or flirt.

95
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,375
That must be why
she's so popular.

96
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,166
Now I wouldn't mind if
Ryoko started liking girls.

97
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,041
Our friendship
might have to end...

98
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,416
...but growing in
its place would be

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
the undying fires
of maidenly true love.

100
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,958
Anyway... after class.

101
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,541
Here... This's for you.

102
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,500
Are you that little boy who was
protecting Ryoko this morning?

103
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,875
Uh, yes, that's right...

104
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,416
I'm Ryoshi Morino.

105
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,791
Oh, and you should know,
he's deeply in love with her.

106
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,041
Stop using words!

107
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,625
Oh, that's precious.

108
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,708
I mean, you must have something
special to make Ryoko nervous.

109
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,875
Now that I look at you,

110
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,375
your face is rather
handsome, isn't it?

111
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,708
Sexy, even.

112
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,750
The touch of Momoko
tends to stiffen the spines

113
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,708
of most men along
with their other bits.

114
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,291
Stop touching me!
Don't look at me!

115
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,583
What's the matter with this guy?

116
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,416
Either your touch has
caused a psychotic break

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,333
from reality or
he's just gone mad.

118
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,875
He is such a total screw-up!

119
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,083
Would you please
stop freaking out!

120
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,291
It couldn't be--is Ryoko...

121
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,541
Naturally she is...

122
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,708
...all girls get
jealous sometimes.

123
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,750
Um, as if!

124
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,208
When I see something worth being
jealous of I'll let you know!

125
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,958
Now, down to business...

126
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,166
All right...

127
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,833
I want to pay a visit
to Onigashima High.

128
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,291
And I was wondering if you'd
be willing to go with me.

129
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,541
Have you lost your mind...?

130
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,208
You want to go to Onigashima??

131
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,083
Yes... to hunt some Oni.

132
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,666
You mean pound
some Oni students?

133
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,333
Why bother with that?

134
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,458
Didn't some jerk try
to have his violent way

135
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,375
with Ryoko for
no good reason...?

136
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,083
Besides, those Oni
punks have been asking

137
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,583
for it since long before now.

138
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,083
They have been
troublesome lately.

139
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,958
The President and Alice are
always popping up like that.

140
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,875
There have been at least
twenty-five recorded incidents

141
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,458
of blackmailing, violence,
and other hooliganism.

142
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,708
Right... so I figured I'd fight
my way inand take it up

143
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,166
directly with the student
council president himself.

144
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,041
And I heard our student
council didn't like that idea.

145
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,750
How do you always manage
to be so well informed?

146
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,666
So... a confrontation will
satisfy our student body

147
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,833
that this matter is
being taken seriously...

148
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,833
But our noble student
council is afraid of how

149
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,875
that confrontation
might end up...

150
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:53,833
Is that about it?

151
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,250
Momoko is on the
student council.

152
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,625
And the president is Hansel.

153
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,166
But it's less expensive
for one person

154
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,291
to owe the Otogi Bank than a
whole Student Council, isn't it?

155
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,750
You're still going
to help me, aren't you?

156
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,833
I suppose... I'll give
it the green light.

157
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,416
Pleasure doing
business with you.

158
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,625
It feels like something
really important just happened

159
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,958
while they were all casual...

160
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,291
Right, so we'll be attacking

161
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,541
Onigashima High School
tomorrow afternoon.

162
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,541
Our objective will be to assist
Momoko in her infiltration,

163
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,333
and help to ascertain
the intention

164
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,208
of their new student
council president.

165
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,416
Understood?

166
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,458
Excuse me...

167
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,375
Isn't a direct
attack dangerous...?

168
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,166
Maybe we should
explore the option

169
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
of putting pressure
on them from above.

170
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,833
Ringo's opinion
is annoyingly right.

171
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,291
You're correct--we
could do that but...

172
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,625
its not so simple.

173
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,125
If we were to get
help from adults,

174
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,708
it would certainly give our
side a distinct advantage...

175
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,083
And don't forget,

176
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,791
we have leverage because
we're an important product.

177
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,791
Product?

178
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:45,708
Yes...

179
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,291
I know it sounds impersonal...

180
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,791
but you have to understand
that every year, this school

181
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,208
turns out more exceptional
Otogibana City graduates.

182
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,958
These outstanding
individuals go out

183
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,000
to the rest of the world
and their brand appeal

184
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,625
brings more talented
people into the city.

185
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,083
This positive marketing is the

186
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,791
Aragami Family's
objective with our graduates.

187
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,208
Onigashima is vital...

188
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,208
It was created to play the bad
guy in this marketing effort.

189
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,541
They act as a moderate threat,

190
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,250
ensuring that we don't
grow too complacent.

191
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,875
This city has been
carefully crafted

192
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,625
into a paradise of sorts.

193
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,666
Sure, the students
seem independent,

194
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,958
but that's not
at all by accident.

195
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,833
Appearances can be
deceiving, as they say.

196
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,208
In reality, we're part
of a social experiment.

197
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,291
I guess you could say
we live in a fairy tale

198
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,041
that has already been written.

199
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,583
All we're supposed to
do within the story is play

200
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,666
the parts those writers
have given us to play.

201
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,791
However... our wills
are still our own.

202
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,166
We may not be in complete
control of our lives...

203
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,833
but don't you want to
at least take charge

204
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,375
of the little bit of
freedom they have given us?

205
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,666
The new Onigashima
student council president

206
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,041
is more reckless
than his predecessor.

207
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,125
From what he tried to
pull with Ryoko before,

208
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,416
he is clearly unaware that

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,458
he's currently being
monitored by anyone.

210
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,500
You would have to be
a complete fool to try

211
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,541
and pull something like that
over on the Aragami Family.

212
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,250
I couldn't agree with
you more, Ringo dear...

213
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,541
...but we must be careful
when approaching someone

214
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,083
who apparently has
nothing to lose...

215
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,333
We have a big job ahead of us
for the first time in a while.

216
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,291
So... let's keep it together
for once, okay people...?

217
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,791
And do try not to
get hurt, please.

218
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,583
You're lookin' pretty
good there, kid...

219
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,416
Those punches are landing a
whole lot stronger now...

220
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,833
This is Kumada,
the boxing trainer.

221
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,750
If you're in his
gym you can't forget

222
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,916
to call him Boss or he'll
punch you in the kidney.

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
And then your
form would collapse.

224
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,291
You finally figure out what it
was that was holding you back?

225
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,666
You finally figure out what it
was that was holding you back?

226
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,916
She's got her head wrapped
around too many thoughts...

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,083
To be unraveled
in the second half.

228
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,666
Finally, the day of
the Oni Hunt is here...

229
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,500
...and Okami is all dolled
up with some new threads.

230
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,166
What the hell am I wearing?

231
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,791
It's new body armor!

232
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,625
Ringo designed it herself.

233
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,166
I think it suits you.

234
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,875
You are so adorable!

235
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,416
I don't want to
be cute in battle--

236
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,416
I want to look like
I'll rip your damn head off.

237
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,791
Hey, Ryoko...

238
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,750
Ryoshi also got
some new clothes...

239
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,500
You... Wow... You look great...

240
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,291
Why don't I rip your head off!

241
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,916
Wait... Where is Taro?

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,708
I don't know, I saw
him here a second ago.

243
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,791
Hellooooo!

244
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,041
Sorry we're a little late.

245
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,875
The members of
Momoko's boob club

246
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,458
are Inuzuka,
Saruwatari, Kijino, and...

247
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,583
There's Taro...

248
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,791
 ...with them.

249
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,666
May I present my servants.

250
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,708
Mistress Momo's dumplings

251
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,666
are beyond anything
I've ever seen!

252
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
You know, when she leans
forward to ask a favor,

253
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,041
it's impossible to
resist the siren call!

254
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,708
You are so shallow.

255
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,875
Momoko is more than
just a slammin' body.

256
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,458
She has a sublime spirit

257
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,416
and a sacrificial
consciousness that elevates

258
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,000
the discussion
beyond carnal desires.

259
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,166
She exudes a light that
penetrates through my soul.

260
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,416
Plus, she's got one
thing we all love.

261
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,708
A whip!

262
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,833
But still...
it's her boobs, isn't it?

263
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,000
Hypnotized into
battle by breasts...

264
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,458
Men are so easy.

265
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,416
Thank you...

266
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,125
You're all such good boys!

267
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,750
Thank you... Your dumplings
feed our man souls.

268
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,291
Of course, now they've
totally pissed off anyone

269
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,541
who can only smuggle raisins.

270
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,208
Taro, come here...

271
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,375
What's all this nonsense?

272
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,125
Well, that's one way
of controlling your man.

273
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,583
Help me! No!

274
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,708
You guys go on ahead.

275
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,041
Taro and I will try to
catch up with you later.

276
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh... okay.

277
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,666
And so begins our adventure
at Onigashima High School.

278
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,375
This place is a
little intimidating.

279
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,833
Check ... Check...

280
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,375
Can everyone read me?

281
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,208
I'll be observing your progress
through Ryoshi's goggle-cam.

282
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,833
This thing?

283
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,458
Please, stop staring!

284
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,166
I've hacked into
Onigashima's network.

285
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,583
I should have full access soon.

286
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,958
Their security
cameras are online

287
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,250
so I can give you eyes
just about everywhere.

288
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,125
There isn't much
we can do on this end,

289
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,416
but we'll try to stay
a step ahead of you.

290
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,708
Whatever happens...
just stick to the plan.

291
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,083
Roger.

292
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,625
The student council's
on the 4th floor

293
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,833
of the main building, right?

294
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,750
Right.

295
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,333
They're here!

296
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,916
Alright, let's break
through their lines.

297
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,833
Get 'em!

298
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,791
May the dumplings protect us!

299
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,916
Yeah!

300
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,875
In case you hadn't noticed,

301
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,458
the Custom Made
Kitty Knuckles meow

302
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,083
when they hit something.

303
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,166
So cute!

304
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,083
Wow! Majolika's like
a freaking genius

305
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,125
when it comes to making weapons.

306
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,833
Ryoko, You okay?

307
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:30,750
Ryoshi!

308
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,708
Thanks man, you saved my butt!

309
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,125
Ryoshi and Okamisan
make a pretty good team!

310
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,541
Why, you!

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,125
I can't stop myself--I have
to make sure they're real!

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,041
Momo's dumplings
are not for you!

313
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,166
Seriously guys? Hmph.

314
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,375
Okay, let's go.

315
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,458
We don't stop till
we hit the 4th floor!

316
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,708
Yeah!

317
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,500
They just keep on coming!

318
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,000
Dog, monkey, pheasant!

319
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,166
Stand your ground.

320
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,208
Anything you ask Momoko.

321
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,250
We'd go through
fire and damnation...

322
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,583
We'd do anything for
those two perfect dumplings!

323
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,125
Such good boys!

324
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,916
I'll be sure to give each
of you some bouncy time.

325
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,208
The dog, the monkey,
and the pheasant strive hard

326
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,458
for their mistress.

327
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,791
And they finally get
to pound some Oni thugs.

328
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,708
That bought us some time.

329
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,125
This way!

330
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,500
Right!

331
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,916
Looks like we're
in the science room.

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,250
From there, you should be
able to reach the main building

333
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
through a passage
on the third floor.

334
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,791
Got it.

335
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,583
What, aren't you happy
to see me, Okamisan?

336
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,000
What the hell?

337
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,416
Ryoshi?

338
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,750
You ladies get moving...

339
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,375
I'll handle this guy.

340
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,416
But... You can't...

341
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,791
Just go!

342
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,333
Follow me.

343
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,833
Okay.

344
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,208
So...

345
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,958
I guess this is my chance
to get a little payback, huh?

346
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,125
That hurt.

347
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:29,708
Oh no!

348
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,833
Booby trap.

349
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,625
The signal is being
blocked from the inside.

350
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,791
Alice here...

351
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,791
If you can hear me,
respond... Come in!

352
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,875
Oh, that's perfect...

353
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,375
Of course we lose com now.

354
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,208
Okamisan, I'll find another
route, you go on ahead!

355
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,666
Sounds good.

356
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,458
I hope they're okay.

357
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,666
C'mon, why aren't
you fighting back?

358
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
Stuck now, aren't you?

359
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,125
Man, what a life you got...

360
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,791
Normally you don't have
to worry 'cause you know

361
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,041
your girlfriend will be there to
protect you when it gets rough.

362
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,416
You gotta love strong chicks...

363
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,583
They're the most fun to break...

364
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,541
If you're lucky, I might let
you stick around long enough

365
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,958
to see me make
Princess Okamisan my bitch.

366
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,375
You shut your mouth.

367
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,583
Huh?

368
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,375
She's worked so hard
to get where she is...

369
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,083
and no douche bag loser
like you is going to be able

370
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,916
to take that away from her...

371
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,541
Not while I'm around!

372
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,125
That was sweet.

373
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,958
But playtime's over now!

374
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,333
This is Taro when he's
not being led around

375
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,833
by his little general.

376
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,708
We call it his Gentleman Mode

377
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,916
because he acts
selflessly, bathes more

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,750
and has a mean uppercut.

379
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,791
I can handle it
from here, Ryoshi!

380
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,833
Don't just stand
there--go protect Ryoko!

381
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,750
Right!

382
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,625
Damn it...

383
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,666
Go on... You're all mine now.

384
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,833
It's me.

385
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,375
The President's
disguises are wicked cool!

386
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,958
But don't worry,
I found a shortcut.

387
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,041
This is it.

388
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,291
Well, well... if it isn't Ryoko.

389
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,250
It's been a
long time, hasn't it?

390
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,958
Hhh... You.

391
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,416
No... No...

392
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,041
Ryoko!

393
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,916
Ryoshi...

394
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm surprised to see you, Shiro.

395
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,208
A friend of yours?

396
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,375
Not anymore...

397
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,375
I am student council
president Shiro Hitsujikai...

398
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,583
What is it that
brings you here today?

399
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,625
We came to warn you.

400
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,458
You and your band of
merry crooks are starting

401
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,333
to get a little
bit out of hand...

402
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,375
Any more problems
from Onigashima...

403
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,916
...and we'll make sure none
of you bothers us ever again.

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,833
Is that right?

405
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,333
I only recently became
President, you know,

406
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,041
so there are still some
who don't listen to me.

407
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,333
But I'll be sure to
speak to them for you.

408
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,875
Do I have your word on that?

409
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,583
I'm not sure what it'll do...

410
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,541
But yes you have my word.

411
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,458
Well. He was a
gentlemanly villain.

412
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,958
Polite as can be and
he just lets us go.

413
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,166
He said it hadn't been 

414
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,000
since he became
student council president--

415
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,458
...but his thugs
managed to stall us

416
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,250
and it certainly seemed they
were under precise orders.

417
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,875
Jamming the security cams
and cutting our network hack...

418
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,833
...and let's not forget
that they managed to close

419
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,500
that fire door just in time
to cut Momoko off from Ryoko.

420
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,333
Mr. Aragami could help us.

421
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,375
I can report it but
I highly doubt he'd waste

422
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,625
his time with something
as insignificant as this.

423
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,583
We also need something a
bit more solid than a hunch.

424
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,375
We'll have to wait
and see, I suppose.

425
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,500
Hey Ryoko...

426
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,833
Hey yourself...

427
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,833
Ryoshi.

428
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,875
You saved me.

429
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,291
I know.

430
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,208
Ryoko.

431
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,291
No matter what happens...

432
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,041
I'll always be
right by your side.

433
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,416
Well then I'll
be counting on you.

434
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,375
C'mon... let's head back.

435
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,083
Yeah... Hold on a sec.

436
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:53,416
The space between them
just might be getting smaller...

437
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,250
...but only a little bit.

438
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,708
Oh well.
All's well that ends well.

439
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,583
She's grown so nicely.

440
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And who is this thing?

441
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,666
We knew each other awhile back.

442
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:47,625
I've got a bad feeling
about what this pair is up to.

443
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,708
To be continued
in the next episode.

444
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,666
Right...!

445
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,000
Can't forget to
throw Ryoshi in there!
