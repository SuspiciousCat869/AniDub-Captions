1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,625
A long, long time ago...

2
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:23,166
I don't have to say that
part again after today, do I?

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,291
Machiko Himura is
delivering newspapers.

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,333
She's like the Little Match Girl
without the grandmother...

5
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,583
...and hopefully without
the dying at the end.

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,041
We'll see!

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,416
Okay, I'm finished...

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,666
So all I gotta do now is head
home and make dad a bento box...

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,625
I guess I can just
skip lunch today...

10
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,416
it's been slim this month.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,375
Come on girls... Let's go.

12
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,416
Wait! You're not
supposed to walk me!

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,958
Hey, I think that
guy is in my class...

14
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,416
What's his name?

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,791
Ryoshi's classmates never
can remember him, can they?

16
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,875
What does that say about him?

17
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,125
Look at that house...

18
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,000
Ugh... dumb bourgeoisie.

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,791
Wait a sec.

20
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,125
Expensive looking
dogs and a big mansion?

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,416
That's a good girl;

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,333
I bet you want a good
girl treat don't you?

23
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,208
I wonder...

24
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,708
Could he be my meal ticket...?

25
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,125
That's brilliant!

26
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,083
Oh, take me with you!

27
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,333
Later, on a day when Machiko's
destiny hung in the balance...

28
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,166
I'm late! I'm late!

29
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,708
Well, that was on purpose.

30
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,458
Oh no; I just
tripped everywhere!

31
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,625
She's got her
name on her panties!

32
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,166
You saw?

33
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,708
Well, I guess
you could say that;

34
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,500
I didn't really have a
choice about it, though.

35
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,083
Naughty.

36
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,250
I don't think she's
right in the head.

37
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,041
I totally made the
perfect first impression...!

38
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,125
Get ready world!

39
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,583
I'm gonna be happy
and worry free!

40
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,375
Do you think she realizes
everyone's staring at her?

41
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,083
Hi Ryoshi!

42
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,583
How are you this morning?

43
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,750
Hey, what's up
with the long face...?

44
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,083
You screw up again?

45
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,458
You know Machiko?

46
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,125
She was running and yelling
about how she was late

47
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,625
and then she tried to tackle me.

48
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,375
Wow, talk about a
cliché dating move...

49
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,833
Next comes the skirt flip...

50
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,083
Let me guess, you saw her
panties, and she acted coy?

51
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,333
Yeah...

52
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,666
How did you know that;
it was so weird.

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,625
Oh my gosh!

54
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,041
I ran into you earlier...!

55
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,208
It must be destiny that
brought us together once again!

56
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,291
Well... That or we're
just in the same class...?

57
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
Whaddaya think?

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,375
Odd.

59
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,833
Look, I'm not good at
being subtle, okay...?

60
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,125
So no more beating
around the damn bush!

61
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,208
Ryoshi Morino!

62
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,458
Um, yes?

63
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,458
I've decided we should
eventually get married!

64
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,375
Well, that's not subtle.

65
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,625
Please stop looking at me!

66
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,416
Nice job.

67
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,666
A little bit unexpected.

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,041
Mostly because you
do already have Ryoko.

69
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,916
What are you talking about?

70
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,041
What's your relationship
with my one true love?

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,625
Your what?

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,833
My one true love; hello, we're
gonna get married eventually...

73
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,250
Duh... like I said,
what are you to him?

74
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,541
We're, uh...

75
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,125
We're just friends, that's all.

76
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,375
She says while not
making eye contact.

77
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,875
Wonderful!

78
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,125
Now I don't have to worry
about your heart being broken.

79
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,291
Babe... we are free
to fall thoroughly

80
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,750
and madly in love
with each other!

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,541
Wait, what?

82
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,833
Hey, hold on a second...!

83
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,208
I'm sorry, but I think
you might be moving

84
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,750
a little to fast for me.

85
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,208
You know what they say,
babe; "love happens fast"!

86
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,416
Nobody says that!

87
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,500
Isn't this an interesting
development?

88
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,958
Looks like Little Red
is plotting, as always.

89
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,458
Well...

90
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,250
You're quite the ladies
man, aren't you Ryoshi?

91
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,500
Yeah.

92
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,500
Who would have expected
two people in this world

93
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,166
to have such commendable taste?

94
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,416
I mean.

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,375
Why, Ryoshi...?

96
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,541
He's such a weirdo.

97
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,500
Yes, thank you
for pointing that out.

98
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,833
Oh, look. Speak of the devil.

99
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,541
Please you guys!

100
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,875
Tell her I'm not here!

101
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,291
How may we assist you, Machiko?

102
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,083
I want the bank
to lend me Ryoshi

103
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,791
for the entire day tomorrow!

104
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,875
And would you mind
if I asked you what for?

105
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,333
To go out on a date...!

106
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,625
This is the only
way I can think of

107
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,916
to get my future hubby
to go out with me!

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,791
Ryoko, what do you
think I should do?

109
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,875
Who cares--do what you want.

110
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,791
I think Ryoshi will go.

111
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,125
How does he always
get dragged into this stuff?

112
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,291
Your request is accepted.

113
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,750
Yeah? Hooray!

114
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,708
Tell him to meet me at
9AM in the park tomorrow!

115
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,583
Because... I love you,

116
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,166
more than anything
else in the world, Ryoko.

117
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll always be here
to protect you, okay?

118
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,708
Get out of my damn head!

119
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,666
Ryoko... violence
is never the answer.

120
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,666
I've got a meal ticket.
I've got a meal ticket.

121
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,375
Dad, I'm home!

122
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,041
I guess he hasn't made
it back yet tonight.

123
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,833
Wow. Looks like she's got
it rougher than I thought.

124
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,750
She is thoroughly twitterpated!

125
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,750
I bet she doesn't even realize
why she's upset right now...

126
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,125
Love is so mysterious.

127
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,250
And Ringo is so ridiculous...

128
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,750
She's loving the
Ryoko suffering thing.

129
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,500
Situation?

130
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,041
Machiko's obsession...

131
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,166
She hasn't spoken a word
to Ryoshi before and now,

132
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,625
out of the blue, she's
suddenly in love with him?

133
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,875
It sounds suspicious;

134
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,541
I think something else
must be going on here.

135
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,166
Perhaps you should check
it out, as a friend, I mean.

136
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,583
I don't really have a choice...

137
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,208
I'll follow them
around tomorrow.

138
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:56,083
Look, a passive aggressive wolf
helping out a friend in need...

139
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,416
It's sweet, isn't it?

140
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,291
The following day...

141
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,791
Apparently, Otogi only
has one dating park...

142
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,000
She doesn't seem
like a bad person, but...

143
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,708
Okay, babe...

144
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,625
Tell me all about yourself;
I wanna know everything.

145
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,000
We barely know each other,
and that needs to change stat.

146
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,250
Yeah.

147
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,208
I mean, like, what kind
of house do you live in?

148
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,708
Is it way big and full
of expensive furniture?

149
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,458
Better yet, tell me how
much you make in a year.

150
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm sorry I wasn't lis---

151
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,041
Word to the wise:
for a first date,

152
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,458
that question is
highly inappropriate.

153
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:51,583
Okay... now to make sure he
can't help but fall for me!

154
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,833
Boy, it sure is hot today.

155
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,666
Golly... She is so forward!!

156
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,958
Does she put her name
on all of her underwear?

157
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,375
Something the matter?

158
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,333
Yes, No. I mean nothing, no.

159
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,625
No man can resist the girls!

160
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,708
Here it is!
My deluxe bento!

161
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,250
Dig in, babe;
I made it all for you.

162
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,666
Ryoshi is understandably
on guard.

163
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,416
However, I doubt
this apple's poisoned.

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Oh, my...!

165
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,333
She made him a
lunch all by herself.

166
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,750
That girl knows how to
impress a guy, doesn't she?

167
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,333
Anybody can make a stupid bento.

168
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,750
I spent a lot of
money making this thing.

169
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,375
I can't let any
of it go to waste.

170
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,500
Machiko actually
skipped dinner yesterday

171
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,000
so she'd have enough money
to make the bento for Ryoshi...

172
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,125
Now she's closing in on
her patented "ah" attack...

173
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,416
How will he defend himself
against such strategy?!

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,708
I'm good!

175
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,458
Damn it!
He's a tough nut to crack.

176
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,166
But I'm not done yet!

177
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,083
So, when were done here,
let's go on a boat ride!

178
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,750
We won't be able to
hear what they're saying

179
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,208
from this far away...

180
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,041
Do you want to watch or shall I?

181
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,250
You can look...

182
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,791
I don't really care
what's going on anyway.

183
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,541
She obviously cares...

184
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,916
Why does she keep denying it?

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,625
I'll tell you exactly
what's happening...

186
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,916
Okay, here we go,

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
they're both getting
onto the boat right now...

188
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,791
My stars, they're
passionately embracing!

189
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,333
Gimmie that!

190
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
It's rocking! Help me, baby!

191
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,500
Love me! Marry me!

192
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,916
Everyone realizes she's
doing that on purpose, right?

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,083
You have to sit down first,

194
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,083
and then it'll stop
rocking, I swear!

195
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,958
I'd say she's controlling
this date quite well.

196
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,791
Ryoshi's surprisingly easy
for her to push around...

197
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,458
Do you think he'll make out
with her if she requests it?

198
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,000
And who's rocking
the boat now, Red?

199
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,083
So, you grew up in the
country, is that right?

200
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,458
That's right...

201
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,083
I was around a lot
of elderly people,

202
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,791
and I didn't really have
any friends my own age.

203
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,500
That's how I developed
ophthalmophobia.

204
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,458
Oh.

205
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,916
But Ryoko's been a big help...

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,833
I mean the whole
Otogi Bank has helped me

207
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,541
get so much better
than I used to be.

208
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,166
He won't talk about another girl
in front of the one he's with...

209
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,750
He's surprisingly sensitive!

210
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,916
Your turn--where do you live?

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,916
What's your home like?

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,208
Mine?

213
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,916
Yeah.

214
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,541
I'm over the boat!

215
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,291
Let's go somewhere else!

216
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,500
Keep an eye out;

217
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,541
Machiko might be planning
to make her any moment now...

218
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,125
Sure you're still
okay with this?

219
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,375
So what's up,
where are we headed now?

220
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,500
Let me worry about that.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
My apartment might
be a little cramped,

222
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,291
but I'm sure I'll be able

223
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,291
to get some sort of action
inducing mood going.

224
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,208
She is determined
to seal the deal!

225
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,708
A large white house,
a large white puppy,

226
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,333
champagne by the pool...

227
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,958
Someone has delusions
about being rich.

228
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:10,666
This is it!

229
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,750
I deserve to be happy!

230
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,708
Are you okay?

231
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,791
I am so sorry to
do this to you, babe;

232
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,333
but something just came up.

233
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,166
Don't worry though, okay?

234
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,500
I'll make it up to you;
swearsey... See ya!

235
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,541
Yeah, all right then...
See ya later.

236
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,583
Well that was... weird.

237
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,791
Hey!

238
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,250
Uh oh...

239
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,958
Looks like
Machiko's in danger...

240
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,875
To be continued
in the second half!

241
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,000
What gives...?

242
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,250
Dad got this month's
payment from me,

243
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,375
so you should have
your money by now.

244
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,750
Yeah, about dear old dad...

245
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,375
He uh, never did show up today.

246
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,041
I bet he took the money and ran.

247
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,666
No... He couldn't.

248
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,291
Which is why we came
here looking for you...

249
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,583
Somebody's gotta
pay what he owes...

250
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,416
Cough it up, little girl.

251
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,291
Yeah, or else...

252
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,375
They do not sound like
very nice gentlemen.

253
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,458
A normal life.

254
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,291
Is that really
too much to ask for?

255
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,500
What the hell?

256
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,208
Let's go, now!

257
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:37,958
What was that?

258
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
I dunno, but let's
go after them!

259
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,541
For the moment at least,
Machiko and Ryoshi have escaped.

260
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,083
We should be okay here for
at least a little bit longer.

261
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,500
Those guys seemed pretty
scary back there, huh?

262
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,291
What, did I come at a bad time?

263
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,958
No. Not at all; you saved me.

264
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,833
Thanks a lot, baby.

265
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,875
I'll have to find
a way to repay you.

266
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,041
Nah, don't worry about it.

267
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,416
My pleasure.

268
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:04,958
I know...

269
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,541
You could be my first...!

270
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,916
I mean, if you wanted.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,083
Highly inappropriate!

272
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,250
Did, you, mean...?

273
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,833
Yes, of course I did...

274
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,916
Actually, my plan this
whole time was to find a way

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,041
to seal the proverbial
deal with you so we'd be able

276
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,916
to get married because you
are the perfect meal ticket.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,750
I know that sounds
pretty terrible...

278
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,916
But see, my dad owes those
loan shark guys a lot of money.

279
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,333
He took the cash I earned

280
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,333
for this month's
payment and ran off...

281
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,041
It seems like my entire life
I've been repaying his debts.

282
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,375
I thought if I could get close
to you, then I'd be safe...

283
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,166
I'm so sorry.

284
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,166
You've gotta be so mad at me...

285
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,041
I lied to you and got you
involved in my stupid problems.

286
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,833
I just don't know how
I'm gonna find the money

287
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,833
to make this payment again...

288
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,625
What do you think
I should do, Ryoshi?

289
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,125
Are you saying you want my help?

290
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,541
I'm asking you if
you want me to help.

291
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,708
You're mad...

292
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,333
I can't blame you...

293
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,625
What do you want me to say?

294
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,583
I'm mad... but not mad at you...

295
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,625
Hello...? I need a favor, so
I'm making a formal request...

296
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,708
It has to be immediate,
like today...

297
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,916
If someone asks,
this concerns Machiko.

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Okay, I can email
you the details...

299
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,458
Yes... Yes, if you could,
please; thanks a lot.

300
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,916
Um, who were you talking to?

301
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,750
We'll talk later.

302
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,500
Hey, punk; do you
know who we are?

303
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,333
We're not the guys
you wanna mess with!

304
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,875
I'll try to remember
that this time.

305
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,458
Oh! Ryoshi is armed with
his pachinko balls...!

306
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,875
I don't think those mobsters
know what they're in for!

307
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,958
Ryoko?

308
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,166
Alright you dirtbags,
who wants a piece of me?

309
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,708
Take this!

310
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,208
Okamisan!

311
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,666
Ryoshi has always fought from
behind the scenes up until now.

312
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,291
He's getting brave!

313
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,041
They're amazing.

314
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,166
Ryoko and Ryoshi have
been fighting together

315
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,583
for quite a while now,

316
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,208
so it's no surprise that
they make a fairly good team.

317
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,083
They sure do.

318
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,458
He's so awesome.

319
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,916
I was so scared;
I didn't know what to do...

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,833
The bad men came from out
of nowhere and attacked us!

321
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,083
Little Red Dramatic Hood.

322
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,291
Um... Okamisan...? Thank you.

323
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,916
Yeah, sure thing.

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,666
So, what exactly were you
guys doing out here anyway?

325
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,208
Nothing. We were just
in the neighborhood!

326
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,875
Certainly can't tell them
you were following them.

327
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,208
Yes, hello?

328
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,208
That's perfect...

329
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,708
We'll be right there...
Good news!

330
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,875
Everything's been taken care of!

331
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,541
Here we are at Okashi Manor.

332
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,708
And everyone's out in
full force to support Machiko!

333
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,625
All right, then!

334
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,708
Let's give a warm
welcome to Okashi Manor's

335
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,208
newest resident
Machiko Himura...!

336
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,041
Cheers, you guys!

337
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,666
Cheers!

338
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,666
I want to thank you for
everything you've done...

339
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,083
I can't believe
you paid the debt

340
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,333
and gave me a place to live.

341
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,750
Please, don't worry about it.

342
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,500
After all, our motto is
something about helping people.

343
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,750
Besides we'll ask you
to repay the favor one day.

344
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,375
Delicious!

345
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,083
Hey, babe...

346
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,875
Can I talk to you
for a minute... please?

347
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,958
Yeah, sure.

348
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I wonder what that's all about.

349
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,625
Who cares...?

350
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,750
It's not like it's
any of my business.

351
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,166
Hey, where are you going?

352
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,958
To the bathroom.

353
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,875
She just lied to me!

354
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,666
Yes, I think she did.

355
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,250
Thank you...

356
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,708
I just wanted to
make sure I said that.

357
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,041
I didn't do it all
by myself, you know...

358
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,375
You had a whole lot of
great people in your corner.

359
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,958
Well, nothing against them,

360
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,041
but if you hadn't tried to help
first, no one else would have.

361
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,583
It's you who deserves
all the credit in my book.

362
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,541
Well... you're welcome
then, I guess.

363
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,666
You were really unbelievable
to watch today, too, babe.

364
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,416
Listen... about us...

365
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,625
Um, Ryoko is amazing, so...

366
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,000
Sure she looks
tough on the outside...

367
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,833
but that's all just for show...

368
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,375
She's actually so vulnerable
she can hardly stand it...

369
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,083
But, that doesn't stop
her from anything...

370
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,083
When I watch her, I can't
help but get the feeling

371
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,666
there might be some
hope for me, as well...

372
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,041
And you know what's funny...

373
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,375
...the stronger she acts,

374
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,375
the stronger it makes
me want to be, for her...

375
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,083
In fact I am the man
I am today because of it...

376
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,083
She's the reason...
It's all because of Ryoko.

377
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,791
Does that, make sense?

378
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,708
Agh! I was rejected
before I even had a chance!

379
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,791
I--yeah, sorry about that.

380
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,875
Ryoshi...! Get back in here
and get us some drinks!

381
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,750
Coming!

382
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,375
Did you get all of that, Ryoko?

383
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,875
So then... how do
you feel about Ryoshi?

384
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,250
Yeah, he might be
a screw up sometimes,

385
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,791
but he's sweet,
and if you need him,

386
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,791
he will always
be there for you...

387
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,750
You have to at least
appreciate that much about him.

388
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,500
I uh...

389
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,708
I need you to give
me a straight answer...

390
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,041
Because if you don't, I'll
never be able to let go of him.

391
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,458
Do you like him or don't you?

392
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,875
Which is it?

393
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:25,125
I... I don't not.

394
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,583
Okay... fine.

395
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,250
Don't let anyone else
take him away, then.

396
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,125
Hey Ryoko?

397
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,375
Come on! We're setting
off some fireworks.

398
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,125
So pretty.

399
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,333
Yeah.

400
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,875
Seriously, how cute
are Otohime and Taro...?

401
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,125
They've been through
so much together.

402
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,875
Majolika, please stop it!

403
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
Come back, Otsuu; it's fun!

404
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,958
How nice.

405
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,041
Otsuu and Majolika are
getting along as usual.

406
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,541
Look, the president and Alice.

407
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,875
Close as two cousins can be.

408
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,375
Yukime and Wakato are so sweet

409
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,916
for gathering everyone
together like this.

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,166
Cheer up. It isn't that bad.

411
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,875
Machiko the Rejected...

412
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,875
Ringo the Consoler.

413
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,208
And, these two.

414
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,416
They're pretty, aren't they?

415
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,666
Can I tell you something?

416
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,833
Yeah, what's on your mind?

417
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,416
You know...

418
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,458
One of these days...

419
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,875
Ryoko?

420
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,291
You have to believe me...

421
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,625
No matter what
may happen to us...

422
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,708
I will always love you, Ryoko!

423
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,333
What the crap, man?!

424
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,000
Zoom!

425
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,333
Ta daa!

426
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,583
Until the day comes
when Ryoko is willing

427
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,333
to shed that wolf's
clothing of hers...

428
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,500
The tale of Ryoshi
and Okamisan...

429
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,625
Will simply have...
to be continued...

430
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,833
Alls well that ends well.
