1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:21,375
It all started back when Otohime
was just in grade school...

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,708
Back when she was fat.

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,125
Hey... Where are
the other students?

4
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,750
They... went home I guess.

5
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,000
And left you here to
clean up all by yourself?

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,916
Man, what a mess.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,333
They should know better than to
treat girls like slaves, jerks.

8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,791
No, it's okay... um...

9
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,041
I'm the one who's slow and
always ruins everything.

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,708
What does that have
to do with anything...?

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,125
You don't need to do
everyone else's work.

12
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,208
Um... I'm, really sorry.

13
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,666
Why are you
apologizing, Otohime?

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,166
How do you know my real name?

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,416
It's a talent I guess.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,625
I remember all girls'
names for some reason...

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,583
Can't say the same for guys.

18
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,333
No, I mean no one
ever uses my name.

19
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,500
They just call me
turtle or turtle girl.

20
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,500
What? Why?!

21
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,458
They say it's because I'm clumsy

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,958
and stupid and
really fat like one.

23
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,583
Well, let's take
a look at you...

24
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,166
Naww...!

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,333
I've never seen a turtle with
long legs and a pretty face...

26
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,333
Those eyes are especially nice.

27
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,666
You're pretty cute, ya know.

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,583
And just wait til you
lose your baby fat...

29
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,791
Oh man...

30
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,416
That'll show them, huh?

31
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,458
Thanks a lot Taro.

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,208
So yeah, you could say her
looks've changed a bit.

33
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,333
Long, long ago...

34
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,750
Yadda yadda yadda
something redundant

35
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,041
and on to the interesting part.

36
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,916
Ryoko made your lunch
today, didn't she, Ringo...?

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,041
You're so lucky.

38
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,666
You are correct
on both accounts!

39
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,458
Best omelets in the world
and they're all mine!

40
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,625
I shall make you a deal...

41
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,791
Spin around three times,

42
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,250
barking like a dog
and the lunch is yours.

43
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,583
Okay...! One, two three...!
Woof! Woof!

44
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,291
The hero of our story,
ladies and gentlemen...!

45
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,750
Could he be more pathetic?

46
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,333
That hurt.

47
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,291
Hey!! Move...!

48
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,583
Save me, Ryoko!

49
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,333
And I'm saved, thank you.

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,458
Get off of me...!

51
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,208
You're such a pervert!

52
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,375
Is something wrong, Taro?

53
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,250
Yeah, that.

54
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,166
Oh my!

55
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,916
Is there a fight
going on? Drama!

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,416
I recognize the one wearing
the little girl clothes...

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,958
I think that's Mimi Usami.

58
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,000
She's a second year.

59
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,916
Is she famous or something?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,583
She's popular,
because she dresses

61
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,666
and behaves like a
child to get attention.

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,208
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you, Ringo?

63
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,375
'Kay... Well, it
looked pretty intense.

64
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,208
Any idea why she would
have been staring down

65
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,791
Otohime earlier today?

66
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,541
Well, there's a history there.

67
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,083
The three of us were in
elementary school together.

68
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,958
Otohime and I both ended up
staying back a year...

69
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,625
So I had no idea Mimi Usami
went to this school.

70
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,916
He also had no idea that
while he stayed behind

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,625
to pursue knowledge, Otohime
stayed behind to pursue him.

72
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,833
It's sweet, really.

73
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,875
I'm sorry, Miss...!
Are you okay?!

74
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,625
Let me help you up.

75
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,708
Is that you Taro?

76
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,541
Yes, who... Oh wow!

77
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,833
Mimi, hello!

78
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,958
It's been so long...!

79
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,416
Look how pretty you are!

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,166
It's great to see you!

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,208
I can't believe we're
at the same school...!

82
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,916
How have I not run
into you before?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,416
Did you just transfer?

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,208
Well... I decided I wanted
to study abroad for a year...

85
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,458
So after I came back,

86
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,666
I had to start in school
as a first year student.

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,291
And now here we are running
into each other again...!

88
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,458
Literally!

89
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,125
This can't just
be a coincidence.

90
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,583
We need to catch up soon.

91
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,625
But not now.

92
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,583
I'm trying to avoid
being followed.

93
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,958
Taro!

94
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,291
Mimi... Is that you?

95
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,166
Yeah.

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,708
I'm sorry, have we met before?

97
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,666
I'm not surprised
you don't remember...

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,333
It's been a long time, we went
to grade school together.

99
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,750
I'm Otohime Ryugu.

100
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,333
Oto... hime...

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,958
Wait! Turtle Girl?!

102
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,625
Wow, that name brings back
a lot of memories for sure.

103
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,416
You look amazing!

104
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,583
Didn't even recognize you!

105
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,875
What's your secret?!

106
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,875
You got a little nip-tuck there?

107
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,708
Maybe some shnoz-scaping?

108
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,791
No, no. I didn't
spend any money.

109
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,708
I just started eating
right, exercising,

110
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,125
and doing things that make
me feel good about myself.

111
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,625
So how I look is just
kind of a reflection

112
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,583
of how I feel on the inside.

113
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,666
'Kay... Ready to go, Taro?

114
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,416
Maybe...

115
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,166
By the way...

116
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,500
Taro mentioned to me that he
was trying to avoid someone...

117
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,166
Was he talking
about you, Turtle Girl?

118
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,083
Maybe he was joking...

119
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,750
Guess you didn't know we're in a
serious, committed relationship.

120
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,958
Also... As you can see,
I'm no longer

121
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,625
the clumsy little fat kid
you used to make fun of.

122
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,250
So I'd appreciate it if
you'd stop calling me names.

123
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,083
You certainly talk a lot
more than you used to,

124
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,375
that's for sure.

125
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,208
Look, I'll make you a deal...

126
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,041
Why don't we settle this at
the Miss Otogi Academy pageant

127
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,000
they're holding next week.

128
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,291
It'll be like a game.

129
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,875
And when I take
first place over you

130
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,750
then I get to keep
calling you Turtle Girl

131
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,083
and you can't complain...

132
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,291
Sound good to you?

133
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,500
It sounds silly...
but easy enough.

134
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,083
So if I win this
thing then you have

135
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,291
to stop calling me Turtle
Girl permanently, right?

136
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,083
Turtle!

137
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:58,833
Yep...!

138
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,708
That is the game!

139
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,500
Rabbit!

140
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,958
And with that, the race

141
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,208
between the tortoise
and the hare had begun!

142
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,208
To be honest...

143
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,750
Otohime is way hotter

144
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,333
and I'm pretty sure she could
win the whole thing, but...

145
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:13,041
I suspect Mimi not calling her
names anymore won't be enough.

146
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,625
I have a request!

147
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,250
I need you to make sure
that I win first place

148
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,500
in the Miss Otogi
Academy pageant!

149
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,125
If I can beat Mimi Usami
and show everyone

150
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,916
I'm the one who
ended up with Taro,

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,833
then that should get rid
of the Turtle girl image!

152
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,666
Makes sense, but you realize
even though you are a member,

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,583
it still counts as a request...?

154
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,125
Are you sure about this?

155
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,125
Absolutely.

156
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,125
And I will repay
my debt in full...

157
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,333
Please! I'm begging you!

158
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,708
She's begging!

159
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,500
And so, the very next day...

160
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,708
Entering the Miss Otogi Academy
Pageant won't be a problem.

161
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,875
The nomination process
is a total sham.

162
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,416
It's set up to accept anyone...

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,875
...but the winner is determined
by the number of male votes

164
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,500
and that could be a bit tricky.

165
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,708
One vote per person.

166
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,458
Obviously.

167
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,458
What do you mean?

168
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,666
You've got some
stiff competition.

169
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,541
Momo from the morals
committee is entering

170
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,208
and so is Shirayuki...

171
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,083
...not to mention the
mysterious beautiful girl

172
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,875
who won last year.

173
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,875
I'm here...! And right on cue!

174
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,958
Who called for a
mysterious beautiful girl?

175
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,916
I thought people outside of
the club couldn't get in here!

176
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,208
Really...?

177
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,083
Guess that makes me speci--

178
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,958
Geez,you have got to quit that.

179
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,166
How can you be so inhumane
to a sweet young thing like me?

180
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,708
Ahem.

181
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,916
Happy...?

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,833
Wow... You must not
know your own strength.

183
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,333
That's... the president?

184
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,916
Yes, he's often in drag...

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It helps him gain access
into numerous places

186
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,875
for information
gathering purposes.

187
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,083
He can also completely
change his voice!

188
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,166
...and brought back juicy deets.

189
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,500
Turns out that for every one

190
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,833
who adores Mimi Usami--and
there are quite a bit--

191
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,291
there's another who finds
her cutesy act disgusting.

192
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,791
A whole camp, in fact,
dedicated to hating her,

193
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,416
so it's pretty evenly divided.

194
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,833
Does not surprise me at all.

195
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,708
Hello, Kettle?

196
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,541
This is Ringo.

197
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,791
You're black.

198
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,291
Otohime's popularity
seems pretty consistent

199
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,625
all the way around...

200
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,708
She's absolutely stunning--which
is always a plus--

201
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,583
but I think being with Taro will
really help her stand out here.

202
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,333
Might help her stand out, sure,

203
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,875
but I don't know
that guys will vote

204
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,458
for a girl who has a boyfriend.

205
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,916
He's got a point.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,541
So it's looking like we have
a fifty-fifty chance here.

207
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,625
No! I'm going to win this!

208
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,166
And I don't care what it takes.

209
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,125
I'm going to come in
first no matter what.

210
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,375
Tell me--what's the
first thing I need to do?

211
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,541
Oh no...

212
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,125
You made a full-fledged
request this time,

213
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,958
so the only thing you need to
do is let us handle everything.

214
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,833
If we need you, we'll call.

215
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,708
Okay.

216
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,875
Great. Then let's get started.

217
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,625
The one who controls
the media controls

218
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,125
the way the vote swings!

219
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,916
It's true, but in
which direction

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,416
are you wanting them to swing?

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,166
I figure it will take
about a week.

222
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,791
We'll release all
her dirty laundry

223
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,583
and if she doesn't
have any, we'll create it!

224
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,333
This is also a great
opportunity for us to show

225
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,958
what the Otogi Bank
is capable of.

226
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,250
That's the dirty laundry
you came up with?!

227
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,583
That's mortifying!

228
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,666
What is all this?!

229
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,833
It's gonna be okay!

230
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,000
Lies...! They're all lies!

231
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,958
You can't let them see you cry!

232
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,458
You guys are the best...
Thank you.

233
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,791
Think you're so smooth,
don't you Turtle Girl?

234
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,041
Not you too!

235
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,125
Suspicion slash awareness
of Mimi being paid

236
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,125
for dates has
exceeded fifty percent.

237
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,166
Unfortunately, she's
now spreading rumors

238
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,750
that Otohime
is sleeping around

239
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,958
and this belief is closing in
at about fifty percent as well.

240
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,500
The good news is,

241
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,416
if they didn't know who she
was before, they sure do now.

242
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,083
I think it would be a good time
to do a little wardrobe change

243
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,375
and start some more rumors.

244
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,833
Ta ta!

245
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,375
Make sure you don't talk to
her entourage by mistake!

246
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,708
Those wastrels stuffed trash
in Otohime's shoes earlier.

247
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,750
Trash smash!

248
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,166
I say we put
lizards in their shoes!

249
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,583
I guess that means
we're going reptile hunting?

250
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,583
This is getting out of hand.

251
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,375
It seems like this
is more about messing

252
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,666
with each other
than the pageant.

253
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,041
Yep.

254
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,458
And I really don't have
time for that childish crap.

255
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,666
What the hell is going on?!

256
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,166
Why does it say
I entered this thing?!

257
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,500
I thought everyone should enter!

258
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,083
It looked like so much fun!

259
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,250
What a brilliant idea, Majo.

260
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,166
Ryoko is prettier than
Mimi but not Otohime--

261
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,916
which will make
Otohime look even better!

262
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,625
Three days passed
in much the same way.

263
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,541
Oh, hi.

264
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,500
How are you doing today?

265
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,708
Hello. It's nice to see

266
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,958
you haven't completely
forgotten your manners.

267
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,666
Isn't that the girl
that charges for dates?!

268
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,166
But the other one's
easy and she's free!

269
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,416
I hope they're happy.

270
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,250
It appears the rumors
are spreading quickly!

271
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,083
Well, everyone knows who she is.

272
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,666
Yeah because of bad rumors.

273
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,166
This isn't good.

274
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,208
I can't wait to see how they
pull themselves out of this one!

275
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,250
It's going perfectly!

276
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,041
The president is never
bothered by anything...

277
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:58,916
She's slipping.

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,083
How's she supposed to get votes

279
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,916
when people think
she's a you-know-what?

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,625
Don't worry your
pretty little heads.

281
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,666
I've got this covered.

282
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,541
I'm cashing in
favors as we speak.

283
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,875
But perhaps I should
give them an extra push...

284
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,791
Oh Ringo, my dear?

285
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,041
What can you do to entice
Miss Mimi's voters away?

286
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,916
So hot!

287
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,291
Keep it in your pants, boys!

288
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,333
Do I have to watch this?

289
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,458
Disturbing, yes,
but fascinating!

290
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey! Look this way for a sec!

291
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,458
You sick jerk!
Put that thing away!

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,500
Wow!

293
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,750
An angry chick!

294
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,166
It doesn't take
much to impress them.

295
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,791
Do you really think this is
going to help us to get votes?

296
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,208
I'm hoping to get the
attention of the culture club.

297
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,291
It'll be grand if we can
get them to vote for us.

298
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,625
Oh I see...

299
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,500
'cause then we'd get
their followers votes.

300
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,791
Yes, that, and because
they're all pedophiles

301
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,125
who worship Mimi...

302
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,875
The president said it
would be very easy and all

303
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,625
we would have to do is dress in
baby clothing the way she does.

304
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,333
He said we wouldn't
have to act at all...

305
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,291
Not sure what he meant by that.

306
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,000
The boy was just being honest!

307
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,166
Um, what are you doing in here?

308
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,583
I knew it.

309
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,375
There's no way this
was going to get past her.

310
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,750
We were just here on a
job for the Otogi Bank...

311
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,750
There was a request
made to have a photo-shoot

312
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,041
with beautiful models.

313
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh sure there was.

314
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,250
You're so pathetic.

315
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,666
You think I don't
know you came in here

316
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,500
to steal my votes
you cheating pig?!

317
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,708
Wow, you are worried
about your votes.

318
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,000
It must be hard to be you.

319
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,208
The hardest part is
trying to talk to a baby!

320
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,666
What did I just hear you say?!

321
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,333
You don't get to
talk to me like that!

322
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,041
I'm the only one
who can start fights!

323
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,041
Then bring it on,
you dumb [Bleep]!

324
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,583
You can both go [Bleep]
yourselves and the Otogi Bank!

325
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,083
Now get out of here!

326
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,541
Oh my!

327
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,625
You should really take these
dirty things you're saying

328
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,291
and shove them up your
filthy [Bleep]

329
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,833
where they belong.

330
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,208
And speaking of your [Bleep]
Where's that smell coming from?

331
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,125
Oh say that again
you [Bleeping bleep]!

332
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:46,958
That's it.

333
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,375
We're going straight to DVD.

334
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,416
There's no way this
is suitable for TV.

335
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,750
I can't believe someone

336
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,500
as sweet as our Mimi
would say things like that.

337
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,750
Someone's losing votes!

338
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,916
OMG.

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,708
I'm sorry; I can no
longer respect you.

340
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,375
And with that she
lost her entourage!

341
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,166
No! No, wait!

342
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,041
You will rue this day!

343
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,875
Does this mean I won?

344
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:07,750
Boy are you naïve.

345
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,458
I'm the narrator!

346
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,708
Blah!

347
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,666
There is way too much
going on in this scene.

348
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,125
And now we come to the day

349
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,083
before the Miss Otogi
Academy pageant!

350
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,166
This is perfect!

351
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,916
Otohime's popularity
has jumped significantly!

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,208
And would you look at that,
Little Miss Nutjob's appears

353
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,750
to be dropping
right on schedule.

354
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,416
You're doing an excellent job!

355
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,416
How is that?

356
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,666
Otohime's votes jumped

357
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,083
but they're still not as
good as they could be.

358
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,750
No! No, it's fine!

359
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,208
Oh, and Ryoshi...

360
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,875
you're not allowed to
vote for Otohime tomorrow.

361
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,416
Huh?

362
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,750
Um... Why not?

363
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,375
She still needs votes,
doesn't she?

364
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,625
Oh, just trust me
and enjoy the show.

365
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,333
I can always tell when
he's up to something!

366
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,958
The first contest tomorrow will
be the swimsuit competition.

367
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,541
This one's kind of...

368
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,375
I bet Mimi will wear one even
smaller just to intimidate me.

369
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,333
Want me to walk you home, Mimi?

370
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,250
No, let's go to the new arcade!

371
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,541
I wish I could but I'm
on cleaning duty today.

372
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,166
The Turtle Girl
will clean it for you...

373
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,750
Right, Turtle Girl?

374
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,166
Yeah, it's okay. Don't worry.

375
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,666
I can handle it by myself.

376
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,625
See! Turtle Girl wants to do it!

377
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,125
Well if you're sure...

378
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,708
Thank you!

379
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,916
They're right. I am a turtle.

380
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,250
Otohime?

381
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,958
It was that moment that
changed me into who I am today.

382
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,166
That's when it clicked...

383
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,750
I had to become pretty...

384
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,666
I wanted him to
look at me someday...

385
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,666
...and be proud.

386
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,583
Oh hi it's you.

387
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,166
Have you not been home yet?

388
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,083
I promise you...

389
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,083
I am going to win this!

390
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,625
I'll win first place
and prove to you

391
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,458
and everyone that
we belong together!

392
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,041
Please... just say
you believe in me!

393
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,458
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

394
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,041
'Kay.

395
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,125
It's finally here!

396
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,125
The day of the pageant!

397
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,500
Well hello there, gentlemen...!

398
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,000
It's so good to see
you on this exciting day!

399
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,291
This is Suzume Shitagiri...

400
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,333
She's Otogi Academy's
very cheerful emcee.

401
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,208
...for your votes and
for your enjoyment!

402
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:35,041
Wow... this is so amazing.

403
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,458
What do you say
we get right to it

404
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,125
and bring out our
lovely contestants...?!

405
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,666
Ladies!

406
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,583
Let the competition begin!

407
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,541
Our first battle lays
out our girls' pride

408
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,833
and modesty on the line.

409
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,666
No way! Swimsuits?!

410
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,958
I love today!

411
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,166
You haven't seen
anything yet, my friend.

412
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,458
Oh please...

413
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,416
Oh please, don't tell me.

414
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,750
She's the heroine in the story--

415
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,416
it's hard to get
them to show skin.

416
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
That figures... You know,

417
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,583
it's too bad Alice couldn't
be here to see all this.

418
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,125
Okay, let's meet our
lovely contestants!

419
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,458
Isn't she adorable?

420
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,958
This is Mimi Usami!

421
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,291
She's here to prove fierce
things come in tiny packages!

422
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,833
Our little red riding hood has
a basket of treats in one hand

423
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,666
and a poisonous
apple in the other!

424
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
This is Ringo Akai!

425
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,666
Next we have Majolika
le Fey being quite strange

426
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,083
and wearing swirly
glasses! Oh my!

427
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,000
Good thing she brought
her maid to service her!

428
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,750
Please welcome Otsuu Tsurugaya!

429
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,458
Some just don't have
to play by the rules!

430
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,833
Give it up for our
not-as-tough-as-she-seems girl,

431
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,458
Ryoko Okami!

432
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,583
And finally, the one you've
all been waiting to see--

433
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,833
a lady by day, a vixen by night

434
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,625
and Taro Urashima's number
one fan, Otohime Ryugu!

435
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,166
This is it. I can't lose.

436
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,208
I am going to win first place...

437
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,000
...for me and for Taro.

438
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,708
Oh my goodness!

439
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,958
This is not what I meant by
sparks flying on the stage!

440
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,291
And on that note...

441
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,000
...it's time to cast
your votes, people!

442
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,958
You can turn in your ballots
as soon as you're done,

443
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,875
and remember--only
one vote per person!

444
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,208
Are you guys ready
to see some results?

445
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,500
Let's do it!

446
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,791
This Miss Otogi thing
is freakishly efficient.

447
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,958
They count votes the same day

448
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,125
and can show
results immediately.

449
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,583
Otsuu placed? Really?

450
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,125
The maid costume placed.

451
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,083
It has very loyal fans.

452
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,750
Now let's get to
the real winners.

453
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,000
Let's see our top three!

454
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,458
In third place...

455
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,541
Mei Uozumi with two
hundred and forty-nine votes!

456
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,583
Second place...

457
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,500
Momoko Kibitsu with three
hundred and forty two votes!

458
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,083
And the title of
Miss Otogi goes to...

459
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,416
You remember what'll
happen when I win, right?

460
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,458
You're gonna be so embarrassing

461
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,666
when you have
to eat those words.

462
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,333
Himeno Shirayuki...!

463
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,708
Four hundred and
thirty three votes!

464
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,708
Congratulations to
all of our winners...!

465
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,250
Is this some kind of joke...?

466
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,125
How is it that the creepy maid
made the top ten and not me?

467
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,000
There she sat, mortified
and overcome with shame...

468
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,166
Well, you reap what
you sow, I suppose!

469
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,750
I kept waiting for you to
win first place as you said,

470
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,666
but as it turns out,
you're all talk.

471
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,041
This is all your fault...!

472
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,291
You copied my act

473
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,500
and stole my votes you
ugly cheating knock-off!

474
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,666
How dare you?

475
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,791
You'll pay for that,

476
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,750
you blithering Black
Bunny Freak Show!

477
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,125
Is that a threat, Little
Red Snapper Crotch?!

478
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,541
What the hell are
you all staring at?!

479
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,791
I said... what are
you staring at?!

480
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,125
It's too soon to be
depressed, my dear.

481
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,583
Right there. One vote.

482
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,625
Now... who could
it have come from.

483
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,583
What does this mean?

484
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,833
You won...

485
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,375
You're the winner of
this contest, Otohime.

486
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,416
No I'm not.

487
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,916
I was supposed
to take first place.

488
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,458
You wanted to win...

489
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,708
...but it wasn't first place
you were truly interested in...

490
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,041
...it was about
getting the attention--

491
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,416
or in this case, the
vote--of the one you love...

492
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,375
...but you got so wrapped up in
erasing your past, you forgot.

493
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,291
We lowered both your
and Mimi's scores

494
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,583
so it wouldn't be about
popularity anymore.

495
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,166
That way, you would
recognize the importance

496
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,958
of the vote you did get.

497
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,375
Though I guess
I owe you an apology

498
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,250
for not fulfilling
your precise request.

499
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,708
I'm sorry.

500
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,833
All of your hard work
has paid off, Otohime...

501
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,250
You're beautiful
both inside and out.

502
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,958
There's no need to worry
about your past now...

503
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,375
what other people think of
you doesn't matter anyway.

504
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,791
It's what I think
that's important.

505
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh Taro... Thank you...

506
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,666
I don't know what to say...

507
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,791
I can't stop crying...!

508
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,583
Thank you so much!

509
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,416
You deserve it, Otohime.

510
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,541
And so the fight
between the tortoise

511
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,500
and the hare finally ended...

512
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,000
And Otohime became...

513
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:22,208
Well, the Otohime she
is today... Beautiful.

514
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,500
Kendo club, photography,

515
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,125
and swim team
cleared the account.

516
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,791
Art, track and
crafts created a debt.

517
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,708
Why would...

518
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,041
He will take out a loan
for anything at any time

519
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,166
and not think twice about it!

520
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,333
But that's our
President for you!

521
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,708
...complicated
business, you know...

522
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,208
...and worth it.

523
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,291
Just look how well things
are going for the two of them.

524
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,458
No Otohime! Not there!

525
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,625
Anywhere but there!

526
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,916
There's no need for
me to narrate here!

527
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,958
And we shouldn't be
listening to this anyway!

528
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,750
That was such a stupid pageant.

529
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,791
I still don't understand

530
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,291
why you dragged
me into that circus.

531
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,250
What were you thinking?

532
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,750
See for yourself.

533
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,583
Each of the contest scores...

534
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,458
This is yours.

535
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,416
And just a marginal inch
away from the top...

536
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,041
Isn't that right, Ryoshi?

537
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,041
Yeah, it's true...

538
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,291
Ryoko will always be number
one to me no matter what.

539
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,500
Dear Ryoko, tell me
what it's like to be loved!

540
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,250
Wolves have an interesting way
of hiding their embarrassment.

541
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,250
As you can see, a lot happened.

542
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,625
And yet the Otogi Bank was
as peaceful as it always was.

543
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,833
All's well that
ends well, right?

544
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,458
Now they're advertising favors?

545
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,583
Dirty. I'm sure
I'll see you there!
