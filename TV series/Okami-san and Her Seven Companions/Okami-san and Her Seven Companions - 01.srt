1
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,958
We're from the Otogi Bank.

2
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,208
Nowhere to run...

3
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,833
So just give it up.

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,875
Your days of stalking
that scared girl end now.

5
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,583
'Cause if it happens again...

6
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,791
I have several pictures for the
police and your parents; uh oh!

7
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,125
That's too bad,
because she's mine!

8
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,083
Ringo, take a hike.

9
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,583
My pleasure.

10
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,000
You're just a girl!

11
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,375
A girl who kicked your ass!

12
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,375
That was splendid Ryoko.

13
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,666
I was able to capture
the entire event.

14
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,666
Always so formal.

15
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,541
Ringo, did you see something?

16
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,333
No, what do you mean?

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,291
Nothing... It doesn't matter.

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,666
A long time ago in
a faraway village...

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,916
Well, actually not that long ago
and more of a suburb really...

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
There was a town
called Otogibana City

21
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,666
whose jewel of a school in
which the children did rule

22
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,291
was the Otogi Academy.

23
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,416
This angry girl is Ryoko Okami.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
She's a first year student
also known as Okamisan,

25
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,416
which means "the Wolf."

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,875
And the red haired classmate
of Ryoko's is Ringo Akai

27
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,750
also known as
Little Red Riding Hood.

28
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,583
Unfortunately, the flat-chested
Wolf and Little Red Riding Twerp

29
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:28,166
are this story's
eye candy... heroines.

30
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,250
The place they're headed

31
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,666
is the Otogi Academy Mutual
Student Aid Association--

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,000
but most people around school
know it as the Otogi Bank.

33
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,208
It's like a yearbook
club but a little different.

34
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,416
Together, with
some other freaky--

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,625
uhhh, unique?--special
upperclassmen,

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,833
they have "activities"
almost every single day.

37
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,583
Welcome back, ladies.

38
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,083
So... how was your assignment?

39
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,125
This is Lizst Kiriki...

40
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,250
He's the club's President...

41
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,625
...and she is the President's
cousin, Alice Kiriki...

42
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,875
I appreciate that.

43
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,875
It is strange that he
fought back, though...

44
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,625
Most students tend to give up
as soon as they hear our name.

45
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:11,500
The pretty young maid
is Otsuu Tsurugaya.

46
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,000
It still bothers
me that our women

47
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,208
always have to do all
the dirty work around here.

48
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,791
On that note, I've been thinking
about adding another guy

49
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,541
to our little group
to round things out.

50
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,875
What do you think?

51
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,333
Don't you think Taro is
enough guy for all of us?

52
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,458
Well, yes but...

53
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,708
Taro, wait!

54
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,041
What you're hearing
are the voices

55
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,250
of two first year
students Taro and Otohime.

56
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,958
I'll leave what
Otohime is trying

57
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,541
to do up to your imagination.

58
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,791
I swear...

59
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,125
See? Keep the antics of
our other male member

60
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,666
in mind in case you
find someone new.

61
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,666
After club
activities are finished,

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,416
Okamisan usually
trains at the local gym.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,625
As you've seen,

64
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,000
Otogi Bank requests
can be a little intense.

65
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,291
Ryoko...
That's enough for today.

66
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,875
Kay...

67
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,916
I have to apologize...

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,041
With that chest this is
actually Fan Disservice.

69
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,541
Okamisan... I love you!

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,166
That's weird...

71
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,708
Okamisan... I love you!

72
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,375
Is somebody here?

73
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,083
Okamisan... I love you!

74
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,375
Hey! How 'bout you go--!

75
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,541
Who... are you?

76
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,250
Uhh me...? I'm Ryoshi Morino.

77
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,375
I'm in your class.

78
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,375
Okay, whatever dude.

79
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,833
You don't remember him
at all, do you Okamisan?

80
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
He really is in your class.

81
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,250
Please don't stare at me.

82
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,916
Oh great...

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,833
D'you wanna tell
me what's wrong?

84
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,041
Ah, well...

85
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,333
Come on, spit it out already.

86
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,833
Okay... Here goes...

87
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,875
I love you.

88
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,291
That's sweet I guess but dating
really is not my thing at all.

89
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,291
So, excuse me.

90
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,416
You can't just walk
away like that...

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,125
I'm throwing
my heart at your feet,

92
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,291
the least give me a
chance to prove myself.

93
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,791
Okay fine!

94
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,416
Let go of me and
I'll give you a chance.

95
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,333
So tell me, kid...

96
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,583
What exactly is it that
you 'love' about me?

97
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:37,375
Well... you know... stuff...

98
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,166
Oh okay, I got it;
I got it, chill...

99
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,333
Hold on... I love
the strength you have...

100
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,625
I love your style...
That you're dignified...

101
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,708
You're never
afraid of anything...

102
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:55,125
You're kinda like a guy but
hotter... really, it's your--

103
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,250
Never court a lady
by calling her a hot guy.

104
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,500
Later on that evening...

105
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,875
...in the student dorm rooms.

106
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,166
Oh my goodness!

107
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,666
Did he really say he
was in love with you?

108
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,041
This is the Wolf and
Little Red's room...

109
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,541
They've lived together
since middle school.

110
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,625
Well... yeah,
I mean... he did his best...

111
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,583
I knew the day would
finally come when someone

112
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,791
noticed how beautiful
and adorable you are Ryoko!

113
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,708
So, who is it?

114
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,541
Tell me! Who? Who? Who is it?

115
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,375
He's a classmate...
His name's Ryoshi Morino.

116
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,750
Ryoshi?

117
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,250
Important note here,

118
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,166
both these girls are in the
same class with this guy...

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,625
For some reason they
have no idea who he is.

120
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,166
Guess that's him...

121
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,791
So what does it say?

122
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,166
Someone's curious.

123
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,791
Nevermind! I don't
need to know anything...

124
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,166
He does nothing for me.

125
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,500
I already like one
thing about this guy...

126
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,166
He's the first boy
intelligent enough

127
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,833
to fall in love with
you at first sight,

128
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,541
but I shall be the
judge of whether or not

129
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,375
he is worthy of my
best friend's affections.

130
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,416
She sounds like
my mother-in-law.

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,833
Whoa, no reason to
go all psycho on me,

132
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,666
and besides, I completely
shot him down on the spot.

133
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,166
You just leave this to me.

134
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,416
So... the next day...

135
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,666
Ryoshi Morino is a first
year student in group F.

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,000
Everything about him,
grades, height, weight,

137
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,750
is all the national average.

138
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,125
Socially, he doesn't
mix with others

139
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,541
and he tends to
stick to the sidelines.

140
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,250
It's not that he's
isolated, though.

141
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,458
It's more like he vanishes
from peoples' memories

142
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,583
because he doesn't stand out.

143
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,333
His talent for blending
in without appearing

144
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,166
out of place seems to
have been passed down

145
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,958
from a grandfather on
one side of his family.

146
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,291
This stealth ability
could be very useful...

147
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,416
Just think about
how it could help

148
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,125
with our surveillance needs...!

149
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,416
So you see, that is why...

150
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,250
I've invited him
to join us here!

151
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,416
Impressive.

152
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,916
Hah! Sounds like a
bunch of malarky to me.

153
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:52,666
Stare...

154
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,541
Stare.

155
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,083
Stare!

156
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,375
Stare.

157
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,458
Stare!

158
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,958
Please stop staring at me!

159
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,291
His upbringing in
a very small town

160
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,416
has given him a case
of ophthalmophobia...

161
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,666
A fear of being
stared at by others.

162
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,541
This grows more
fascinating by the minute.

163
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,958
Scared of being looked at?

164
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,791
Doesn't that just
make him worthless?

165
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,833
And that snaps
him back every time.

166
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,083
Don't you get it, silly?

167
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,500
Even with this horrid
fear of standing out...

168
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,166
He still told Ryoko
he was in love with her.

169
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,083
Ringo, gah--talk much?

170
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,166
Stop looking at me!

171
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,125
True courage acts
through the fear.

172
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,541
So when did the
love overtake you

173
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,958
and compel this act of daring?

174
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,750
Well... it just
happened last week.

175
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
Don't freak...

176
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,708
...but I secretly followed
you around most of last week

177
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,458
trying to find the right moment.

178
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,583
But, I just couldn't
bring myself to speak...

179
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, great...
So he's a stalker.

180
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,541
...until yesterday

181
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,416
We've been looking
to bring in another guy.

182
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,583
No objections, I trust?

183
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,166
Well that didn't
take much thought.

184
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,708
That's that. What do you think?

185
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,958
Uh, yes sir!

186
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,875
If you'll have me, I mean...

187
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,041
He's just thinking about
being near Okamisan...

188
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,375
Look at that smile!

189
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,875
I don't like it.

190
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,208
You're saying...

191
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,791
You were watching when
I was attacked the other day?

192
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,541
Is that right?

193
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,708
That's right.

194
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,000
Okamisan, wait...

195
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,625
You chose to hide

196
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,666
when the one you say
you love was in danger...

197
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,291
I would never trust a dude
like that to watch my back.

198
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,666
I guess she's
right about that...

199
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,750
Even when Okamisan was being
attacked, I completely froze...

200
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,375
I kept my head down
and stayed out of sight.

201
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,250
Pathetic.

202
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,583
It's a new client.
I'll be back in a bit.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,541
You still might have a chance.

204
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,125
If you were able
to redeem yourself...

205
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,041
It's possible that Ryoko
would accept you, right?

206
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,625
It's all up to you now, Ryoshi.

207
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,125
Yeah-- Yes sir!

208
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,458
I'll try... I know I can do it!

209
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,708
So now that the President's gone

210
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,166
to work on poor,
pathetic, little Ryoshi...

211
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,083
Do you think he'll
actually become

212
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,958
one of Okamisan's companions?

213
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,166
Let's get back
to that new client

214
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,333
and see what her deal is...

215
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,958
My name is Kakari Haibara...

216
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,833
I needed to help
this really sweet guy

217
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,208
I like on the tennis team.

218
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,625
Are you familiar
with our system, right?

219
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,500
I take a loan out,
in the form of a favor,

220
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,000
and then I pay back the
favor when it's asked of me.

221
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,416
Right.

222
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,208
The Otogi Bank helps out
students who request assistance,

223
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,291
and in doing so, creates
debts with said students,

224
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,333
which are
forcibly repaid later...

225
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,458
...kind of like
paying it forward

226
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,375
except you don't have a choice.

227
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,583
Well, go ahead.
Tell us what you need.

228
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,500
Okay...

229
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,958
There's this guy on
the tennis team named Ohji

230
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,833
who got hurt and
won't be able to compete

231
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,041
for a couple of months.

232
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,083
I heard.

233
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,875
It sucks to have
our best player out.

234
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,375
I used to play tennis.

235
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,875
I was forced to quit and
it bothers me to this day

236
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,708
that I never went back to it.

237
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:19,041
I would watch their practices
and dream about playing again...

238
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,958
Hey... you wanna grab a racquet?

239
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,166
This is Ohji.

240
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,958
You can think of him as
the Prince of this story...

241
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,166
or at least of the tennis team.

242
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,250
Thanks.

243
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,625
I'd love to but
I'm afraid I just can't

244
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,500
Look, I won't push
you but... at least smile.

245
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,333
Later.

246
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,750
Hey...

247
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,125
Do you mind if I come
watch you play once in awhile?

248
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,208
Yeah... cool.

249
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,791
Ever since that,
I go to the court

250
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,791
and watch him play when I can...

251
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,166
Seeing him at it made me feel
like I could do it again...

252
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,583
Hormones are more
powerful than reason.

253
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,250
But then someone told me that
he was quitting the tennis team,

254
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,541
and he stopped showing up
at the courts everyday...

255
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,625
Wow...

256
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,000
It must be his injury...

257
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,583
He's afraid he'll never
play like he used to.

258
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,166
He could still stay on the team

259
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,791
but only if he doesn't
give up his spot.

260
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,083
I know he'll regret it if he
doesn't try to follow his dream.

261
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,541
He helped me so I want
to help him this time!

262
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,583
Please!

263
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,083
A favor? You're
returning a favor?

264
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,333
That is so wonderful!

265
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,666
Otsuu has an obsession
with returning favors.

266
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,583
You can't let him turn
in that withdrawal slip...

267
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,875
You have to stop him.

268
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,958
Please don't let him quit.

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,083
A withdrawal slip is
a not a simple form.

270
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,625
After you fill it out,
it has to get stamped

271
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,458
by the club captain,
advisor, and homeroom teacher,

272
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,958
before being submitted
to the Athletics Assembly.

273
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,833
Only then is the
withdrawal complete.

274
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,500
The assembly's tomorrow
at five o'clock...

275
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,333
If he doesn't submit his
withdrawal by that time...

276
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,375
...then his next chance to do
it won't be for another week.

277
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,916
Here's what I think, kids...

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,916
We can figure out the right time
and try to steal the slip...

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,458
...or we can try to
stop the captain

280
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,125
and all of the others from
seeing it in the first place.

281
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,791
If that's the case,
I think it would be prudent

282
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,416
to maintain constant
surveillance on him.

283
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,458
You can count on me, I guess.

284
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,333
Now, we're supposed to be
evaluating Ryoshi's abilities

285
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,625
on this one so no fair helping
him out, is that understood?

286
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,708
And that is how Ryoshi
got his very first mission.

287
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,458
Look at him.

288
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,375
He could have been following
you around like that for weeks,

289
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,041
and you never
would have noticed.

290
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,083
Nice! That image is
gonna make me puke...

291
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,166
Besides, what are we doing
stalking the guy who stalked me.

292
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,500
For my research...

293
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,833
I must determine if
Ryoshi is suitable for you.

294
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,541
That's not really your
choice to make is i--

295
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,083
Come on, let's go.

296
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,041
Here ya go, here's your change.

297
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,916
A bathhouse?

298
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,666
I hope he's not stuck in a
cheap dorm without showers.

299
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,000
But since we're already here,

300
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,333
we might as well
go in and take a bath.

301
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,416
Sorry. But they'd be
waste to show anyway.

302
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,875
Where's that withdrawal slip?

303
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,250
This is his big chance!

304
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,083
If he can steal it
right now, he's done.

305
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,250
We're contractually obligated
to say that stealing is wrong.

306
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,458
Stealing is wrong.

307
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,000
I wasn't doing
anything, I promise.

308
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,041
Stare...

309
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,750
Look at Mr. Subtle,
playing it cool.

310
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,541
Hey, wait!

311
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,250
You've got the wrong idea.

312
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,041
It's not what you think.

313
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,375
Get back here.

314
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,291
Stop!

315
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,666
Okamisan, Ringo!

316
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,750
Thank goodness you're here,

317
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,208
I need some help
explaining to him...

318
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,416
You...!

319
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,250
Getting punched
while naked must suck.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Withdrawal slips require stamps

321
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,500
from the club captain, advisor,
and homeroom teacher.

322
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,791
You have to stop him
before he gets them all.

323
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,083
Ryoshi must stop him before--

324
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,166
If only... he could...

325
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,875
But... no.

326
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,250
Time zips by in a flash
and suddenly class is over.

327
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,125
What...? How did you lose him?

328
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,541
I'm really sorry.

329
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,708
We're running out of time.

330
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,041
You know as the
president of the club

331
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,250
this should be
making you nervous.

332
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,250
Looks like he's already headed
for the assembly, you guys.

333
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,458
Five minutes until it starts.

334
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,708
That's it...

335
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,208
We'll just have to stop
him by force, won't we?

336
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,208
How?

337
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,208
Even if we ran as
fast as we could

338
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,083
we'd never make it in time.

339
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,708
Well, I was afraid something
like this might happen,

340
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,000
...so I asked Majolika to help.

341
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,541
Behold the power.

342
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,750
What I have to show
you will blow your mind.

343
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,583
It's the Pumpkin Bicycle!.

344
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,708
It's just like the
coach Cinderella

345
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,291
got to use 'cept it's a bike.

346
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,875
I'm in a skirt.

347
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh that is awkward.

348
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,458
I'll drive you Miss!

349
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,541
I've done nothing except
cause trouble up to now.

350
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,958
I want to prove my love,

351
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,916
so I can't sit back
and watch what happens...

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,916
I've got to do this.

353
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,166
Right!

354
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,416
Well then, big boy...

355
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,916
I hope you don't flip
out riding that thing,

356
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,791
cause everyone is
going to be staring.

357
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,500
I've got an idea.

358
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,583
Keep going, it's straight ahead!

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,291
Okay!

360
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay, that mask makes
him look like a space frog.

361
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:01,708
Take a right up there.

362
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,833
Got it!

363
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,958
He's here!

364
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,833
Ryoshi... you have to stop!

365
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,541
Okay, sure!
Where are the brakes?

366
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,083
Way to go, Majolika!

367
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,750
She probably never thought
about making it stop.

368
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't stare at me!

369
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,166
Olympics here she comes!

370
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,833
Oh no... that bell probably
means its too late...

371
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,791
Oh wait... there's
his withdrawal slip.

372
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,166
Withdrawn!

373
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,791
Looks like Kakari left
behind one of her shoes.

374
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,291
The mission was a
success, more or less.

375
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,041
Yeah, except the whole
kicked in the face part.

376
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,583
Poor girl...
she was pretty upset.

377
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,458
It's all because that jerk
can't handle the pressure...

378
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,750
He's not getting in.

379
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,875
Hey, over here!

380
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,791
He came back.
With reinforcements.

381
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,875
Man!

382
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,041
His stupidity
makes him persistent.

383
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,666
No kidding!

384
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,791
It's time for some payback.

385
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,083
Ringo? Why don't
you take a hike.

386
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,125
As you wish, milady.

387
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,791
Incidentally,
these kitty knuckles

388
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,000
were also made by Majolika.

389
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,500
Get 'er!

390
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,500
You're dead!

391
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,958
 You little!

392
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:17,041
Okamisan, look out!

393
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,375
Oh great.

394
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,583
That does it!

395
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,083
Hey, are you okay...?

396
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,791
What were you doing, anyway?

397
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,541
I was being your shield.

398
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,500
A shield?

399
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,791
You're nuts...

400
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,416
I wanted to apologize to you

401
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,083
for all the problems
I caused so I followed you...

402
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,083
Then...

403
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,791
I thought I could impress
you if I took them out...

404
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,166
but I guess I was just
too scared to move...

405
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,750
Being a shield was
all I could manage...

406
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,458
That was a pretty
nice move, man...

407
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,791
Thanks. I think.

408
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,083
Isn't this much better?

409
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,708
Finally, I can deem thee worthy
of protecting Ryoko's back.

410
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,791
Welcome to our
humble group, Ryoshi!

411
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,958
Okamisan, I look forward
to working with you!

412
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,458
Screw up like this again and
you'll be out on your butt...

413
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,625
..till then... it's Ryoko...

414
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,000
And I'll stop calling
you "dude" Ryoshi.

415
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,333
That's great.

416
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,708
Way to go, Ryoshi!

417
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,041
So... what do we do with them?

418
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,000
For the moment, we let them be
embarrassed by their failure.

419
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,250
Then if necessary strangle
them with silk scarves...

420
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,708
That's funny.

421
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,000
And that's how Ryoshi
became Okamisan's shield

422
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,541
and one of her companions
at the Otogi Bank.

423
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,416
After that, the prince
felt he was destined

424
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,708
for the princess who
kicked his face in...

425
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,000
...so he held tryouts.

426
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,958
I might get to go out
with the Prince of Tennis!

427
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,416
Every girl in
the school lined up.

428
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Kick me!

429
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,541
Nope. Next!

430
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,208
Nope. Next!

431
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,708
Nope. Next one!
Nope. Next one!

432
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,625
Kick me!

433
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,250
Yes sir!

434
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,416
That's it...!

435
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,208
Please, kick me some more!

436
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,416
Awesome!

437
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,375
More!

438
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,083
Harder! Oh yeah!

439
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:31,666
Is anyone else kinda
creeped out by this perv?

440
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,041
You're the strongest
girl I've ever met...

441
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,375
I'll do anything
to be with you...

442
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,416
Let's play tennis together!

443
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,208
Yes... my prince!

444
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,125
Thus, the Prince found a
new purpose in life,

445
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,708
coaching Cinderella.

446
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,791
And they all lived
happily ever after.

447
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,166
Dirty tricks and
Tricky Dicks next time.
