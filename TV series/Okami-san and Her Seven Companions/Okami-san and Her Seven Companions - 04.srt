1
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,166
Today's story begins

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,250
in a bookstore of a
neighboring town...

3
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,500
Oh...

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,666
Is that a big bad wolf I see?

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:33,416
She's in disguise,
but it's obviously her.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,916
Today, she's purchasing a
romance novel for teen girls.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,708
It's finally out!

8
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:48,083
Oh, Yuki, no one can
tell a love story like you.

9
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,666
A long, long time ago...

10
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,666
Okay, so you already know about

11
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,416
the Otogi Academy in
Otogibana City, right?

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,333
Good. Let's move on.

13
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,916
Here's Otsuu happily
going about her maid work...

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,041
...(weird, I know).

15
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,208
And here are all of her fans.

16
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,250
Otsuu has quite the
following today, huh?

17
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,666
Not too surprising.

18
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,583
She's always been popular.

19
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,875
Hey, Otsuu! Look out!

20
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,208
It's a home run!

21
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,958
Crap! I'm not gonna
get there in time!

22
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,416
Nice one!

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,333
I'll say.

24
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,791
No, I... I was just lucky.

25
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,541
Yeah, well I guess every
screw up has to have

26
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,541
at least one redeeming quality.

27
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,083
Yeah... heh heh...

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,000
So cruel.

29
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,583
Excuse me?

30
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,416
Yeah?

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,375
Thank you very much, Ryoshi.

32
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,625
Oooh...!

33
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,416
You probably shouldn't
stare at him like that!

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,458
Please quit looking at me!

35
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,666
See... I told ya so.

36
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,750
Later that evening...

37
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,208
This is Ryoshi's home.

38
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,166
Also known as Okashi Manor...

39
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,791
Look! There he is!

40
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,125
Hey, I'm home!

41
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,875
Good evening Ryosh--

42
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,333
I bet he thinks his eyes
are playing tricks on him.

43
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,083
Good evening Ryoshi...

44
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,458
Welcome home, Master.

45
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,375
Yep... That's definitely a maid.

46
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,833
And so... the next day...

47
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,791
Mornin' ladies.

48
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,583
Oh, wow...

49
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,833
He does not look good.

50
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:19,750
Heavens to Betsy!

51
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,583
What's wrong?

52
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,041
When I got home last night,

53
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,083
I opened the door and a maid
was waiting there for me.

54
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,625
That sounds more like
a porno plot to me.

55
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,166
No, it really happened! I swear!

56
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,500
This cut implies time passing
while Ryoshi explains himself.

57
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,458
So... that's what's going on.

58
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,625
Fascinating...
It must be her obsession.

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,166
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,333
Ryoshi, you rescued Otsuu
yesterday, did you not?

61
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,708
Yeah, I guess.

62
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,791
Well, that's obviously
why she showed up as a maid.

63
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,500
She's attempting
to repay the favor.

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,333
Confusing, I agree.

65
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,083
Yea... But that
still doesn't explain

66
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,625
why you look so exhausted.

67
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,833
You naughty boy,

68
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,541
tell me you didn't force
Otsuu to play Master

69
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,500
with you all night long
cause that'd be too much!

70
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,416
I didn't do that. No!

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,541
I think she was only trying to
take care of me and stuff,

72
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,375
but it got really weird.

73
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,458
Here you are, Ryoshi; I brought
you a change of clothes.

74
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,208
Heavens, she brought him undies.

75
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,500
Would you like some apple...?

76
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,208
Say "ahh."

77
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,708
Ahh.

78
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,916
Wow...

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
She takes this maid thing
a little far, doesn't she?

80
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,750
Don't let me bother you.

81
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,583
Please just pretend
I'm not even here.

82
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,166
Yeah, I'm sure he'll
be able to do that.

83
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,708
I wasn't able to do that.

84
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,958
I got so nervous about her being
there, I couldn't even move.

85
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,750
I didn't get any sleep at all.

86
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,291
You've gotta be joking.

87
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,416
I heard she was really
big on returning favors,

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,208
but that seems a bit extreme.

89
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,666
It seems a lot extreme.

90
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,791
If this keeps up, I'm gonna
die of sleep depravation;

91
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,708
I just know it...

92
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,041
 I'm to young to die.

93
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,708
Why are you being
so overdramatic?

94
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,583
As a guy, shouldn't this
be a dream come true for you.

95
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,833
Well no, because...

96
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,958
I only dream about Ryoko.

97
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,541
Yes, that makes a
little more sense...

98
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,208
Basically, you want Ryoko
to be your naughty maid...

99
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,791
Why didn't you just say so--
I understand completely .

100
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,250
No, that's not what I said.

101
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,541
That's not what I want at all.

102
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,416
Do you mean you don't wish

103
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,625
to see Ryoko dressed
up like a maid?

104
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,625
No, I, what?

105
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,458
Ah, Ryoshi, he's at
such a complicated age.

106
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,041
Anyway, after our
club meeting today,

107
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,333
you should let us pay
a visit to your house.

108
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,791
Why do you want to visit me?

109
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,041
Because we might be able
to help you, silly billy...

110
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,833
You're coming too, right?

111
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,791
Yeah, no way.

112
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,791
You guys have fun.

113
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,958
I've got stuff to do.

114
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,333
Even tough girls
get embarrassed.

115
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,875
You know,
Elizabeth and Francoise

116
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,416
will be at Ryoshi's
house, as well.

117
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,500
Well, I guess I could go then...

118
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,625
...but just to see the dogs.

119
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,625
This is the boarding
house where I live.

120
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,541
Boarding house?

121
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,500
It looks like an
apartment to me.

122
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,833
It is, but it's also
a boarding house.

123
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,958
There's a main residence
where they serve meals,

124
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,083
and there's a bathhouse
for everyone to share.

125
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,916
Yukime is in to
apartment buildings.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,250
She calls it a hobby.

127
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,083
Yukime is Ryoshi's aunt,
and fortunately for him...

128
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:19,541
The owner of this
apartment building.

129
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,041
You can make enough
money to live on

130
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,458
with that kind of hobby, right?

131
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,958
I don't know,
but she's also written

132
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,958
a few decent selling
romance novels...

133
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,458
Decent selling?

134
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,750
They're aimed at
girls specifically

135
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,833
so I really haven't
read any of 'em.

136
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,375
How perfectly riveting.

137
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,958
Tell me something, does your
aunt write under her real name,

138
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,541
or does she use one of
those pen name things?

139
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,291
A pen name.

140
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,458
She goes by Yuki.

141
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,250
Huh?

142
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,875
You've heard of her, huh?

143
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:42,750
Of course we have.

144
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean, we are speaking

145
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,000
about Ryoko's favorite
author in the world...

146
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,791
Just last night
she disguised herself

147
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,041
and snuck off

148
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,583
to the nearest bookstore
selling Yuki's new book

149
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,958
and it was miles away.

150
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,708
Ringo, how the hell
did you know that?

151
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,000
Because we live
together obviously...

152
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,750
You'll never be able
to hide anything from me.

153
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,875
You keep them in your bookshelf
behind another row of books.

154
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,083
Sometimes you put
fake covers on them

155
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,333
She sure does go
through a lot of effort.

156
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,125
It's rather like you're
a guy hiding porno...

157
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,166
...but they're
just girlie books.

158
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,208
Rude!

159
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,791
There's no reason to be ashamed.

160
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,625
Everybody needs to embrace their
feminine side once in a while.

161
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,333
Am I right, Ryoshi?

162
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,458
Yeah, I guess so.

163
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,625
I mean, you are
a girl, right...?

164
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,416
You know, it's actually
funny how bad he is at this.

165
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,833
Fine...! You're right...

166
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,166
I read girlie
books; it's true...!

167
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,791
I love Yuki's novels, okay?

168
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,333
Are you two happy now?

169
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,875
I'm happy and flattered.

170
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,000
Hey, Ryoshi.

171
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,791
Hey, Yukime; I'm home.

172
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,541
Yukime? So that's her?

173
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,375
No freakin' way...
I'm about to meet Yuki.

174
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,833
To be continued
in the second half!

175
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:01,500
So I gather you two aren't
"close friends" with Ryoshi.

176
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,125
I don't know what
that pinky thing means

177
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,625
but it makes you seem
like a dirty old man.

178
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,083
What are you
talking about "old"?

179
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,541
Hello, I'm only twenty!

180
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,333
Hah! Sure she is.

181
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,500
Sorry.

182
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,083
By the way, I secretly
read your books...

183
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,208
And maybe it has something to
do with her style of writing,

184
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,541
but I expected her

185
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,583
to be a touch more refined
than this, didn't you?

186
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,625
Yeah.

187
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,500
Heh.

188
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,708
I know, I get that all the time,

189
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,875
but see I write fiction,
not autobiographies.

190
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:29,833
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,833
I meant no offense.

192
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,125
None taken, sweetie.

193
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,666
Trust me; it's fine.

194
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,916
Here...

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,250
This is an autographed
copy of my latest book.

196
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,083
It's for you.

197
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,791
What fan wouldn't love that?

198
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,000
Wait, you're giving it to me?

199
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,958
Yes, of course it's
for you, baby girl...

200
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,916
Gotta treat the
fans right, don't I?

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry about the wait.

202
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,041
Funny story:
Otsuu got permission

203
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,250
from Yukime before she
became Ryoshi's maid.

204
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,625
Your maid certainly seems
to be right at home here;

205
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,583
I bet that was a nice surprise.

206
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,916
Yeah...

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Don't get me wrong,
I love having her around...

208
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,916
But I don't know how much
longer Ryoshi can last.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,083
Here you are.

210
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,291
Uh, thanks.

211
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,000
Better be careful;
it looks pretty hot.

212
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,083
Told you so!

213
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,166
Ow! Hot!

214
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,125
I'm terribly sorry!

215
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,916
Here, come with me!

216
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,250
I, uh, oh... I'm fine.

217
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,375
Really. I promise.

218
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,750
No, please allow
me to handle this.

219
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,083
Please. No touching.

220
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,875
I can change by myself.
I don't need help.

221
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,458
Things just got a
touch more interesting...

222
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,666
Geez...

223
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,875
What the hell is Ryoshi
doing in there? Gah.

224
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,541
You're Ryoko, aren't you...?

225
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,625
I gather you have
a crush on Ryoshi...

226
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,083
Or is it possible you
don't even know that yet?

227
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,833
Ooh... Insights from
a fearsome writer.

228
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:39,916
That's not even a little true!

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,833
How impressive!

230
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,333
You caught that so quickly!

231
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,416
Cut it out Ringo.

232
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,916
You're just trying
to make me mad...

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,375
You know the kind of guy
I want has to be manlier.

234
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,750
By manly do you mean
someone who has a cool strength

235
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,583
and will always be by
your side protecting you...?

236
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,375
Someone who'll devote
themselves completely to you?

237
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,875
That kind of thing?

238
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,166
There's no doubt
Ryoshi is a screw up.

239
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,541
But he has a manly side,
too, I promise.

240
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,875
This is a flashback
to episode two.

241
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,125
I'll protect her...
No matter what.

242
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,791
You see, Ryoshi's the type of
guy who has hidden depths...

243
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,250
If the right girl
caught his eye,

244
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,125
he could become
one hell of a man.

245
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,000
Which shouldn't be a problem...

246
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,875
After all, he does have Ryoko.

247
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,666
It sure looks that way.

248
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,166
She's so embarrassed
she can't even deny it!

249
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,500
I like you two.

250
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,000
Why don't you stick around
and have dinner with us?

251
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,500
Thank you... but...

252
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,541
Come on, a couple more servings
at dinner are no big deal.

253
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,791
Go ahead and play with the dogs.

254
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,625
I'll come get
you when it's ready.

255
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,208
Thank you very much, Yukime.

256
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,291
So polite! Good girl.

257
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,791
In addition to Ryoshi,

258
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,083
this apartment and/or boarding
house provides services

259
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,583
to the Otogi Student
Council president, Hansel,

260
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,250
the secretary, Gretel,

261
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,375
as well as the mysterious girl,
Mahiru Shiratori.

262
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,833
I didn't think about it.

263
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,500
I don't really
see them that much.

264
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
Gretel, my darling sister,

265
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,291
I must say I am simply
delighted to be able

266
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,083
to enjoy tonight's
dinner with you.

267
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,583
Oh, me too my
dear brother Hansel.

268
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,791
These two are German.
And very close.

269
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,166
Okay, Wakato.
Looks like everybody's here.

270
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,041
Terrific!

271
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,166
This is Yukime's man, Wakato.

272
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,333
He's the perfect house-husband.

273
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,833
No.

274
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,125
Please allow me to assist him.

275
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,791
Awesome.
That's such a huge help.

276
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,208
Whatever I can do to help.

277
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,750
This looks delicious!

278
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,416
Otsuu!

279
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,375
There's something
wrong with Otsuu!

280
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,250
Are you okay?

281
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,416
Is she warm?

282
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,791
Oh, she's burning up!

283
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,708
A fever?

284
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,000
What are we gonna do?!

285
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,416
Stop freaking out.

286
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,041
Wakato, why don't
you go get the car

287
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,333
and we'll take
her to the hospital.

288
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,708
Yeah. I'm on it.

289
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,833
There's no need to worry.

290
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,541
Just finish your dinner.

291
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,333
She'll be okay.

292
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,458
Ringo and Okamisan
returned to their dorm

293
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,750
after hearing the results
of Otsuu's hospital visit.

294
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,000
They said she was suffering

295
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,208
from sleep-depravation
and being overworked.

296
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,750
Yeah, apparently she
wasn't allowing any sleep

297
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,708
in Ryoshi's room or at school.

298
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
She's very dedicated.

299
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,583
I'm glad she's okay,

300
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,958
but why'd she go
through all that trouble

301
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,458
just because someone
helped her out one time?

302
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,833
I'm not sure, but I think it
goes back to her childhood.

303
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,083
Whatever it is
I don't get it at all.

304
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,833
I see...

305
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,041
Well, that explains why
Otsuu isn't here today.

306
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,500
Yes.

307
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,208
Yukime won't let her leave
until she gets enough rest.

308
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,083
What about you?

309
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,583
You manage to get any rest?

310
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,791
I wish...

311
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,541
Otsuu still insists
on sleeping in my room

312
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,041
because she's
my maid or whatever,

313
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,291
which then makes me feel weird

314
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,083
so once again
I didn't get any sleep.

315
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,583
That is gonna kill you dead.

316
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,125
Not to change the subject,
but back to Otsuu...

317
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,083
President, you and Alice have
known her longer than we have,

318
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,916
so I was wondering...

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,375
Do you know why she's so
OCD about returning favors?

320
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,833
We certainly do...

321
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,666
Don't we, Alice?

322
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,416
So then...?

323
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,250
Whether or not we can
discuss it is another matter.

324
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,166
Tell me something, Ryoshi,

325
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,041
do you know if Otsuu
will be spending tonight

326
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,166
at your house as well?

327
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,291
Um, yea... Probably.

328
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,875
Then it sounds to me
like it would be best

329
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,583
if we made a visit
to your home tonight.

330
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,708
I'm glad you're here...

331
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,791
But I didn't expect all
of you to be coming over.

332
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,833
Cramped in here.

333
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:42,541
Yeah.

334
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,041
Call it an impulse.

335
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,541
Oh, hello...

336
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,041
Welcome back, everyone.

337
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,916
She's not confused at all.

338
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
We've been worried.
Are you feeling better?

339
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,583
Yes, I'm very sorry...

340
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,125
Give me a moment; I'll be
right back with some tea.

341
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,541
Wait, Otsuu.

342
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,291
You're not supposed
to push yourself.

343
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,583
No, I have to get up.

344
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,875
I still have to repay the favor.

345
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,958
I told you to get some rest.

346
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,250
But Yukime...

347
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,000
No more people in this room!

348
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,041
I have to.

349
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,625
You talk about repaying favors

350
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,166
but instead you've just managed
to cause problems for everyone.

351
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,458
I know where
you're coming from...

352
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,500
To me, though, you look
unbelievably selfish right now.

353
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,916
I suppose we have no
choice but to explain.

354
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,125
There's something you need to
know about Otsuu's childhood.

355
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,375
She has an ultimate favor

356
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,625
that she will never,
ever be able to repay.

357
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,583
This is little Otsuu
from ten years ago.

358
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,916
She looks the same.
Just more adorable.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,083
Big brother! Over here!

360
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,875
Everyone in the
neighborhood calls him that.

361
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,083
Hey! Otsuu!

362
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,750
No Big Brother.

363
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,750
I promise I'll
be good from now on.

364
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,208
I'll thank you and thank you

365
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,875
and never stop thanking you;
just get better, please...

366
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,541
Please... Please.

367
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,583
Big brother!

368
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,166
Alright, that was
unexpectedly depressing.

369
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,458
More than anything, she's afraid

370
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,875
she won't ever have
the opportunity

371
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,250
to repay your favors.

372
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,208
I think we may have finally
pinpointed the reason

373
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,125
she's going overboard like this.

374
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,708
Which is ridiculous.

375
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,541
I mean, seriously,
the kid who saved her

376
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,625
wouldn't want her
living life like that.

377
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,041
I bet she doesn't see it
in the same way, though.

378
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,875
It's a favor-repaying curse.

379
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,458
Now that you mention it,
last night she kept repeating

380
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,458
she had to return favors
to Yukime and Wakato...

381
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,708
...over and over again
like she was in a nightmare.

382
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,208
And the favors just
keep accumulating.

383
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,041
She's gonna bust
like a balloon soon.

384
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,416
She'll bust.

385
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,625
I have an idea...!

386
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,375
And tomorrow is Saturday,
so there won't be any school.

387
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:35,625
What are you thinking?

388
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,750
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bacey.

389
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,333
Niiice...
It's a Temp Maid Army.

390
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,291
Um, what are you doing?

391
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,458
Sit back and relax

392
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,083
because today we're
taking care of you!

393
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,625
Yeah, you know...
today's your day...

394
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,875
...so... don't you
worry about anything

395
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,625
cause we're here for you.

396
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,375
Wow. She must
have practiced that.

397
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,041
No, please,
it's not necessary...

398
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,541
I'm practically back to
normal already, you see?

399
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,333
No way!

400
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,375
We're handling everything!

401
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,875
Please don't!

402
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,041
Wait!

403
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,500
Their voices alone are too much.

404
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,958
I know.
Talk about a turn on.

405
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,875
I still don't understand
why we had to dress up too.

406
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,833
That was Ringo's
strategy, of course.

407
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,208
All right!

408
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,125
It's time for some serious
Otsuu taking care of, girls!

409
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah!

410
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you all very much.

411
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,833
I have no idea what's
going on right now.

412
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,833
You have looked after me
in everyway possible.

413
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:13,833
And I promise
I'll return the favor.

414
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,916
That is very kind of you,

415
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,083
but we've already
done far too much...

416
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,958
So you won't be able to repay it
no matter how hard you may try.

417
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,500
No, I swear I will...

418
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,666
I'll make sure each and every
one of you is fully repaid.

419
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,125
Fine... Wanna be that way...?

420
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,625
I'll just keep doing
even more favors for you.

421
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,458
That's right.

422
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,625
And I'll be doing the same.

423
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,750
Me too.

424
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll be glad to help.

425
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,291
Right. I'll do it too.

426
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,458
Same thing over here!

427
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,208
Apparently you are
deeply entrenched

428
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,458
in debt at the moment.

429
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,083
I don't understand.

430
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,750
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do now.

431
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,583
You know, Otsuu, I would
say we've been friends

432
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,416
for quite a while now,
wouldn't you...?

433
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,041
And you must have
some debts incurred

434
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,541
other than the ones from today.

435
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,625
Yes, and I promise I will
eventually repay those as well.

436
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,000
Honey.

437
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,666
So let's say that you
repaid all of our favors...

438
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,666
Would we not be
friends after that?

439
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,375
Yeah, this whole
thing is stupid...

440
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,333
It doesn't make sense at all.

441
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,791
Why would you ever
consider anything a favor

442
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,166
between us in the first place?

443
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,041
We're supposed to
be friends, aren't we?

444
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,833
You really think you have
to pay your friends back

445
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,000
for every nice thing they do?

446
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,541
I mean, sure, the
Otogi Bank is built around

447
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,708
making sure favors are repaid,
but that's for the clients!

448
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,416
Otherwise, what would be the
difference between us and them?

449
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,500
Friends should
always help each other

450
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,125
and allow their friends
to help them out in return...

451
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,958
And the only thanks they should
ever need is a little gratitude.

452
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,541
That's what friends are for!

453
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,750
She's right.

454
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,958
So you don't have to
repay me for anything.

455
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,583
And you all feel this way?

456
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,875
Otsuu... why don't you
stop treating us like

457
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,541
we're all just stupid strangers
you owe something to.

458
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,333
Ahh...! You guys she's crying!

459
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,458
Ryoko, you're being
too hard on her!

460
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,958
Are you blaming me for that?

461
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,000
What the crap?
I didn't make her cry.

462
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,708
No... It's not her fault.

463
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,333
It's mine for acting stupid...

464
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,833
You all have been
wonderful friends

465
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,541
and you've always
been so nice to me...

466
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,583
but I kept you at a distance.

467
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,416
From now on I promise to stop
think of things that way...

468
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,416
...and just think
of you as my friends!

469
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,625
Sounds great!

470
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,125
And now that we've
gotten this taken care of...

471
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,083
I say we stay in Ryoshi's
room all night and celebrate!

472
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,166
Party!

473
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,083
Slumber party!

474
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,458
We should all stay here tonight!

475
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,458
A, wha...? You guys!
I have to get some sleep!

476
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,708
Several hours later...

477
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,958
Ryoshi finally caught up on
all the sleep he had missed...

478
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,250
Even though they say you
can't do that, you can.

479
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,916
Gah... what a mess that was.

480
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,541
I know! But at least
Otsuu finally got the point.

481
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,916
I hope you had
a wonderful evening.

482
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,458
Welcome home, ladies.

483
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,833
What the crap...

484
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,083
Um, what are you doing here?

485
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,791
I wanted to show you
a little gratitude...

486
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,208
We are friends after all...

487
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,250
That's just what we do!

488
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:43,416
It seemed like she had
changed, but she hadn't...

489
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,208
Oh, okay, I'm sure something
changed in her... somewhere...

490
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,875
All's well that ends well.

491
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,083
Next time: who doesn't
like a good hunt?

492
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,958
Me. I hate guns.
