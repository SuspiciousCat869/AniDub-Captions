1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,333
A long, long time ago...

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,958
Actually, we're just
picking up the story

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,875
from the last episode...

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,500
Neko and Ryoshi
are still training.

5
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't tell me
that's all you've got.

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,458
No sir!

7
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,500
Hello? Yeah, of course...

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,458
Ryoko? What do you mean?

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:42,083
The Otogi Bank's greatest
challenge continues!

10
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,041
Good, you're awake.

11
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,291
Reiko, how's tricks?

12
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,083
Sorry about all these lies,

13
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,416
but Shiro really wanted
me to bring you here.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,458
Must be nice... all this love.

15
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,000
I can't say I'm not jealous.

16
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,833
Don't forget to be gentle
with our guest, Reiko.

17
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,416
This is the
Onigashima High School

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,791
student council president...

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,541
Shiro Hitsujikai.

20
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,791
No need to fret, my sweet.

21
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not quite ready for you.

22
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,375
What're you trying to prove?

23
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,666
Merely that I enjoy watching
the misery of others.

24
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,458
In addition to abducting you...

25
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,208
I thought it might be
fun to play with everyone

26
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,708
from the Otogi Bank
for a little while.

27
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:47,000
Though I did think that
it would be harder than this.

28
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,083
Go to hell.

29
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,875
Now we just have
to wait for Ryoshi.

30
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,125
The fun is just beginning.

31
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,416
Nobody else has the
motive and capability.

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,708
From what I can tell the only
logical conclusion is that

33
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,666
Shiro's the one
conducting this operation.

34
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,250
He knew exactly how
we'd react at every turn

35
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,166
and we just let him take them!

36
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,416
It's time to call in some of

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,250
those favors we banked
the past couple of days.

38
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,583
If he's smart he'll be
holding each of our people

39
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,000
in different locations.

40
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,666
So let's get to work.

41
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,583
Move it! Come on!

42
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,875
It's a dead end...

43
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,916
This way!

44
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,833
Hey!

45
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:34,666
Damn it!

46
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,500
Where could they have gone?

47
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,250
Well don't just stand there.

48
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,458
Look around for them!

49
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,875
Let's go.

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,458
It looks like we
finally lost them.

51
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,041
This is all my fault, Alice.

52
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,750
I'm really sorry.

53
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,041
They just made it
seem so innocent...

54
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,916
How can I make this right?

55
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,833
What's wrong?

56
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,041
Nothing.

57
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,500
It's just that you're
surprisingly honest.

58
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,333
There is nothing
surprising about it.

59
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,125
Hey, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,750
Now are you sure that
Ryoko's in Onigashima?

61
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,666
Shiro had her taken
to try to lure us out...

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,333
That's gotta be it.

63
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,875
So now... he'll be waiting for
us somewhere he knows I'd look.

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,291
Inside!

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,750
Taro got snagged by them too.

66
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,625
Taro, thank goodness!

67
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,583
Otohime!

68
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,500
Lucky for her all
they did was tie her up.

69
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,916
I hope you guys are ready
for what's coming next.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,958
Easy Champ, we're not the
ones you should worry about.

71
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,708
A bikini ambush!

72
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,000
Cut to a creepy abandoned
factory somewhere

73
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,708
on the outskirts of town.

74
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,416
You're stuck here girlie.

75
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,000
This should be fun.

76
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,125
Where you going?

77
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,625
I've got a surprise for you.

78
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,458
Ta dah!

79
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,791
No.. I won't do it!

80
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,333
A maid would never
wear a nurse's uniform!

81
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,291
It's like Otsuu's
own personal hell!

82
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,416
Oh please, let us
touch you, Taro...

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,916
You're soooo adorable!

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,166
Is Taro actually blushing?

85
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,625
Oh boy... it's hard to choose...

86
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,375
You're all so darn beautiful.

87
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,208
Taro I'm here...

88
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,541
If Taro doesn't love
me like he used to

89
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,583
then I don't have anything
left to live for anyway...

90
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,625
They can kill me...

91
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,291
That'd be a waste of the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

92
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,875
You know I never mean
to make you worry...

93
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,333
...my sweet...

94
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,166
Oh my Taro...

95
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,333
I thought these chicks
were gonna break him!

96
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,875
Let's get him!

97
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,916
That's my boy.

98
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:15,291
Heh... looks fun...
I should help.

99
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,333
A woman's jealousy is blacker
than the deepest ocean chasm.

100
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,000
You may all begin screaming now.

101
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,500
Okay... never make
Otohime angry.

102
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,958
You've been warned.

103
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,333
Meanwhile, Otsuu is
facing fashion torture!

104
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,875
Will she be forced to
shed her maid costume?

105
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,583
Will she? Will she?

106
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,041
That's enough!

107
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,708
Oh yeah? And who
the hell are you?

108
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,583
Pee-ons don't get
to know my name.

109
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,000
Otsuu.

110
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,458
Let's go!

111
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,125
Thank you so much
for coming to save me.

112
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,916
I need you to put these on.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,833
Majolika, not you too?!

114
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,375
No... Come on!

115
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,458
And so Otsuu's fashion
nightmare continues.

116
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,125
Back to Alice and Mimi who
are not out of the woods yet.

117
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,041
Alice is more of a tech nerd so
running isn't really her thing.

118
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,583
Can you still walk?

119
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,500
I don't know.

120
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,208
You do know it's
over now, right?

121
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,166
Good... now sleep tight.

122
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,000
Huh...? Wait, who are you?

123
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,083
Aw, geez...

124
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,833
Sure took you
long enough, Litzy!

125
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,375
Whoa, did you just say 'Litzy'?!

126
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,583
I mean... sure took you
long enough, President!

127
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,166
Yes, sorry about that.

128
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,083
Takes awhile for me
to get into character.

129
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,875
Plus, I couldn't take
them all on at once

130
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,583
so I had to pick my moments.

131
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,833
If they figured
me out I'd be dead.

132
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,250
Where's your help?

133
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,583
Didn't anyone
else come with you?

134
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,375
They've all got their own
problems to deal with...

135
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,458
But Ryoshi...

136
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,166
Well...

137
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,333
He's running out of time

138
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,458
and he's got quite a
battle ahead of him.

139
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,833
In the next half,
we'll storm the fortress!

140
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,875
I hope you know...

141
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,000
you'll be toast
after this little stunt.

142
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,041
And do you think
I care about that?

143
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,041
It's worth it if
I get to watch you

144
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,416
and all your friends
get torn into pieces.

145
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,875
My bonus is seeing all your
hopes dying in front of you...

146
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,083
Well, well, now
what do we have here?

147
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,500
It seems your Prince has come.

148
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,208
That's a big crowd.

149
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,750
Prudence suggests we
wait for reinforcements.

150
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,458
Don't be such a wuss.

151
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,541
I know that sexy voice.

152
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,666
It's Momoko and her pack
of wild breastlings...

153
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,375
Which now includes
the Tonda brothers!

154
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,125
What are you guys doing here?

155
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,500
We made a lot of requests on
that thirty percent off week--

156
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,875
better start paying you back.

157
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,583
We'll lend our helpiness.

158
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,375
Helpiness?

159
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,666
Debts repaidified!

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,333
Repaidified?

161
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,291
Just leave it to us!

162
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,416
That third guy is normal.

163
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,041
Whatever Momo asks...

164
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,916
Even through fire
and damnation...

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,333
It doesn't matter!

166
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,583
We'll repay her
for her dumplings!

167
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,375
Is dumplings too subtle
a metaphor? Breasts!

168
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,333
Things are really
starting to heat up now.

169
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,416
That's right.

170
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,625
You still got nothin'!
Let's get 'em!

171
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,833
Yeah!

172
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,541
So that thirty percent
off sale seems like

173
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,708
a real bargain about now.

174
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,791
It's like the President knew

175
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,916
they were going
to need the back up.

176
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,375
Look at the doors!

177
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,500
We're the holdingest
brothers in the world!

178
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,500
Hurryupitude!

179
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,375
I can't take them seriously
when they talk like that.

180
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,541
Time to save Okamisan, Ryoshi!

181
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,083
Yes, sir!

182
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,500
Yeah... just your
normal triplets.

183
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:36,458
Not so fast!

184
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,083
I'll cut through all the fat.

185
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,708
I don't think so.

186
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,916
Sorry we're a
little late, my friends.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,875
And as for all the rest
of you Oni delinquents...

188
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,041
Heh... better run.

189
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,708
Uhhh!

190
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,125
Ah, yes. Taro in gentleman mode.

191
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,708
I'm sure he and Otohime had
quite the make-up session

192
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,916
after being trapped together.

193
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,375
Jeez. I can't beat up
boys twice my size.

194
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,958
Stop that! Get your
hands off of me!

195
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,708
Wow Mimi... Nice job there.

196
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,333
Yeah, well don't
you get all mushy.

197
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,125
Running away would
be totally spineless.

198
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,375
I didn't want to ruin
my reputation, that's all.

199
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,250
Right.

200
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,333
Now boys, go get 'em!

201
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,625
Yeah!

202
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,125
Ow, my spleen.

203
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,250
Ryoshi, you'll have to go
find Okamisan on your own.

204
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,666
Right!

205
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,583
Ryoshi...

206
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,750
do you remember when you asked
me why I wanted to train you?

207
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
I can tell you now.

208
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,791
Three years ago, I had
a chance to save a girl,

209
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,958
but I ran away instead.

210
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,791
There were some people after
me and she tried to stop them.

211
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,750
But I abandoned her...
and I never looked back.

212
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,708
After that... I felt
like such a complete jerk.

213
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,416
But how could I waste
her sacrifice like that?

214
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,125
She gave everything to save me.

215
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,625
I decided right then
and there that I needed

216
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,458
to hone my fighting skills

217
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,916
so maybe one day
I could defend her honor.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,333
All my training has
led up to this moment...

219
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,375
...but none of
it matters anymore.

220
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,708
Because of you.

221
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,416
Because you're the one
who has to save her.

222
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,041
Ryoko...

223
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,875
Get out of here, Ryoshi!

224
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,625
My name's Neko, and trust me,
after today you won't forget it.

225
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,916
I think completely
destroying you

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,625
one by one is the purrfect way

227
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,000
to spend a little time,
wouldn't you agree?

228
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,333
Exterminate!

229
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,125
Let's do this!

230
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,375
Get out of here...!

231
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,833
You have to save Okamisan...!

232
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,250
Go!

233
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,833
Ryoko!

234
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,458
Ryoshi!

235
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,875
Ah, we've been waiting
for you Ryoshi...

236
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,916
Though I did expect you to
arrive much sooner than this.

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,250
I'm here!

238
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,958
He's blinded by his anger.

239
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,250
Shiro don't!

240
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,666
Hey, it's no fun if I let
you use your little toy.

241
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,625
Yep, only one way to show me
how far you're willing to go

242
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,875
for the girl you claim to love.

243
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,083
Oh I'll show you all right.

244
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,458
I'd do anything for her...

245
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,041
Oh wow... That is just adorable!

246
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,458
Ryoshi!

247
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,041
How does it feel?

248
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,750
Must be awful to be humiliated
in front of the girl you love...

249
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,750
...just awful.

250
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm sorry...

251
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,375
You're the one
who has to save her.

252
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,208
You've never given up...

253
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,875
...even when you were
surrounded on all sides...

254
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,583
...nothing was going to tear
you away from protecting her.

255
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,291
You were able to see
what Okamisan needed

256
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,708
and then you did it
without taking credit...

257
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,375
While the best that
I could do was abandon her.

258
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,500
You're saying the
girl you left was...

259
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,916
It was Okamisan.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,541
But I figured there
was no possible way

261
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,625
you could protect her
without somebody's help...

262
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,166
So I decided to train you.

263
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,708
Ryoshi, I need you to
think about the reason

264
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,041
you want to protect Okamisan.

265
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,916
My reason?

266
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,875
That's it...

267
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,208
...connecting to those
feelings will give you

268
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,375
the strength you need

269
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,875
to protect her from
absolutely anything.

270
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,458
I know you can do it.

271
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,541
Okamisan needs you!

272
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,416
No!

273
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,708
Come on, you're not giving
up on me already are you?

274
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,666
Leave him alone.

275
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,291
You...

276
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,000
You can't...

277
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,416
...stop me from...

278
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,416
...protecting Ryoko!

279
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,000
The most important thing in
a fight is to keep your cool.

280
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,166
You need to learn to maintain
your calm, no matter what.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,958
I can't believe
you actually hurt me.

282
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:44,083
Now it's time to make you pay
for your insolence, little boy.

283
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,708
Can't we all just get along?

284
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,291
You're okay!

285
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,041
Yeah...

286
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,916
You certainly have put us
through the wringer today

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,125
but don't worry;

288
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,291
your punishment will
be swift and thorough.

289
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,333
Are you attempting
to threaten me?

290
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
You know, for a club of
your considerable reputation,

291
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,625
I would think bringing adults
into this was beneath you...

292
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,250
Such a pity.

293
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,291
Don't be silly, we seem
to be fine on our own.

294
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,416
You made the decision
to pick this fight

295
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,791
with the Otogi Bank...

296
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,250
And we'll be sure
to make you pay.

297
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,625
You'd best be ready.

298
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,125
Right, and on that little note.

299
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,958
Wait a sec!

300
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,333
We're going.

301
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,291
That is such a drag.

302
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,083
I had so many fun things
that I wanted to do to her.

303
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,791
Don't you worry.

304
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,166
The more they enjoy it now,

305
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,375
the more it will hurt
when I finally destroy them.

306
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,250
That will just make it
so much more delicious

307
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,166
when I tear them
away from each other.

308
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,750
Now I know today wasn't easy.

309
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,916
But your support made all
the difference in the world,

310
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,041
and I want to thank you.

311
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,291
I'm sorry you got
dragged into this.

312
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,791
You have nothing
to apologize for.

313
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,708
You can't handle
everything by yourself.

314
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,041
Isn't that the reason for the
Otogi Bank in the first place?

315
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,583
Our motto is "help those who
need it without any question."

316
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,625
Thank you.

317
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,166
Right, that's it
for today, then!

318
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,541
Very good work everyone!

319
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,916
Yeah! Congratulations!

320
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,541
Mimi, I just wanted
to say thank you

321
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,291
for lending a hand
the way you did.

322
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,333
You certainly came
through for us in the end.

323
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,083
Well, I started off by
making things worse for you

324
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,958
so I figured I had
to make up for it.

325
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,541
I'm really sorry
for how I was before.

326
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,041
I don't know why I was
acting rude to everyone...

327
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,750
But it was totally beyond
wrong, I know that...!

328
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,791
I hope you'll forgive me.

329
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,625
Of course.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,541
I wasn't the nicest
person to be around

331
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,666
during the beauty
pageant either if I recall.

332
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,333
I apologize as well.

333
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,875
Then let's call it even, okay?

334
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,375
I love it when people
learn to get along.

335
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,625
I would say your
assistance was invaluable.

336
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,875
Thank you so much.

337
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,875
It's nothingIt helped
me more than you know...

338
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,833
In fact, I feel like
I can sleep peacefully now.

339
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,791
Don't be modest, Neko.

340
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,583
Thanks a lot for
coming back for me.

341
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,916
M'lady.

342
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,583
Good for you... Puss in Boots.

343
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,916
Well, I guess I might as
well get in some exercise

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,208
on the way home...

345
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,166
Goodbye, all.

346
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,875
Take care.

347
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
Yeah.

348
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,916
See you later.

349
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,458
Well, Ryoshi...

350
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,125
I didn't run away.

351
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,541
Not this time.

352
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,750
And neither did you.

353
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,666
Boy somebody we know sure did

354
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,416
a lot of saving
today, didn't they.

355
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,541
Not really.

356
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,416
It was mostly Neko
and everyone else.

357
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,791
You should think about giving
your hero a little reward...

358
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,333
Maybe you could put on some
fluffy wolf ears and a tail,

359
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,916
and give a sexy howl for him!

360
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,416
I will never do that, got it?

361
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
How about showing him
your undergarments?

362
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,000
Rejected.

363
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,708
Okay, maybe just a bikini, then?

364
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,000
In his dreams.

365
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,458
Very well, a one piece
but you have to be wet.

366
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,875
Now you're just being stupid.

367
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,875
I'll take whatever...

368
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,416
You'd look good
in anything Ryoko.

369
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,125
And the three of them go home,
happy as they've ever been.

370
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,708
Later that night...

371
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,750
Alice has fallen fast asleep,
exhausted from all her running.

372
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,250
Good night to you,
my dear cousin Alice.

373
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,041
Sweet dreams.

374
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,500
You know Ryoshi said he
was training this whole time.

375
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,708
What?

376
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,458
Neko helped him
with his fighting skills

377
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,625
because he wanted to be strong.

378
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,125
Strong enough to protect you.

379
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,583
Maybe you could do
some training in order

380
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,708
to get stronger
for him in return.

381
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,791
Okay... Well then let me
get your opinion on something.

382
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,750
Oh what a beautiful day.

383
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:42,125
Oh wow... I feel
great this morning!

384
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,166
You know that
spending time with you

385
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,000
is all the reward
Ryoshi needs, Ryoko.

386
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:47,875
I know...

387
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,750
surprisingly wolves sometimes

388
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,875
take the advice
of their friends...

389
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,416
so she went on a walk
with him and the dogs.

390
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,000
You okay?

391
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,958
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

392
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,833
Well... that's good.

393
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,666
It seemed like you'd
been avoiding me

394
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,791
more than usual lately.

395
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,166
It's like a dream being able
to hang out with you like this.

396
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,958
I want you to know I'll
always be here to protect you.

397
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,333
Uh, Ryoshi...?

398
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,125
The whole getting
kidnapped thing...

399
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,500
I mean...

400
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:27,375
For a wolf, this is
unusually forthright... But...

401
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,625
Don't look at me!

402
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,125
Nothing ever changes.

403
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,583
Keep talking Ryoko...

404
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,541
...you were about to say
something weren't you?

405
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,833
Once again, you have totally
blown the mood you screw-up!

406
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,875
On that note, all's
well that ends well...

407
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh, I should let you know

408
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,958
that our next
episode is the last one.

409
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,541
It's about a sad little girl...

410
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,000
...a sad little match girl.
