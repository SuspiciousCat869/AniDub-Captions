1
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,041
Hello, everybody!

2
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,416
Welcome back
to Otogibana City...

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,750
Every time I see this
scenery I feel so zen...

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,583
Oh, look! It's our
trio of misfits!

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,083
Okamisan, Red, and our
favorite screw up, Ryoshi!

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,041
Do you have any idea
what the president wants?

7
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,916
No, but I do know this is
not your average meeting;

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,166
he doesn't normally
get everyone together.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,416
It sounds like there
might be an emergency.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,541
There she goes with
that fantasy again.

11
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,041
Are you okay?

12
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,708
Yeah, I'm fine,
all right, jerk...?!

13
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,041
Why don't you mind
your own business?!

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,583
Funny how one little dream
can make her so moody...

15
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,875
Such a delicate flower.

16
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,083
I'm sorry... I think?

17
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,625
Okamisan is no fairy
tale damsel in distress.

18
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,291
Here we are, at the Otogi Bank.

19
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,500
I'd like you to take
a quick look at this.

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,125
The Otogi group is corrupt,
and they charge

21
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,958
ridiculous interest for
virtually no assistance...

22
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,333
What the hell is this crap?

23
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,041
Um... It's kind of accurate
if you think about it...

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,416
...but someone
managed to scatter

25
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,041
these papers all around town.

26
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,875
On top of that,
baseless criticism

27
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,875
has been showing up
on internet forums.

28
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,791
Come to think of it,
there must be a lot of people

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,000
who're holding something
against us, right?

30
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,416
He's correct...

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,541
Which begs the question,
we have been denounced before,

32
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,291
so why is this
time more important?

33
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,166
Well...

34
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,666
it's more than just criticism...

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,333
Things have taken a bit of
a turn for the dramatic...

36
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,333
This is an article in today's
Otogi Newspaper.

37
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,583
It can't be!

38
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,375
They found out where our
secret basement room is?

39
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,500
No, no. It hasn't
gone that far, yet.

40
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,791
The newspaper gave us
a call about this article;

41
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,833
apparently they received an
anonymous tip a few days ago...

42
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,708
They actually asked if
we would mind commenting

43
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,000
on a story about us.

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,458
So we gave them our secrets?

45
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,875
No way.

46
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,750
I just showed them my
workshop and gave 'em a tour.

47
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,166
See?

48
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,708
Majorica's workshop
is also in the basement,

49
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,750
so they weren't exactly lying.

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,958
I gave them sucker
souvenirs, too!

51
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,833
Don't worry, no one
knows where we are.

52
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,000
The door to this
room is triggered

53
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,916
to be hidden in case
of emergencies...

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,666
We have a lot of personal
data stored in here,

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,666
so we've taken
extra precautions.

56
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,000
That's comforting.

57
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,333
I suppose we need
to figure out just

58
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,916
who was responsible
for that anonymous tip.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,750
Hold on--you're not implying
one of us did it, are you?

60
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,250
Of course not; no one here
would do something like that...

61
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,541
...but someone somewhere has an
awful lot of information on us.

62
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,500
Any idea who it might be?

63
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,000
I think it's most likely

64
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,041
the student council president
of Onigashima High School.

65
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,625
Shiro...? Seriously?

66
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,041
Of course.

67
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,916
Shiro Hitsujikai...

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,541
In Onigashima High School...

69
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,833
...he is the thug president.

70
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,708
...to figure that part out.

71
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,750
Okay... so what do we do?

72
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,125
The only thing we can do;

73
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,125
we'll just continue
to monitor the situation.

74
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,000
There's a high probability
he's waiting for us

75
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,416
to make the next move.

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,416
In the meantime, I thought
it would be a good idea

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,958
if we were more proactive
about taking requests.

78
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,416
Someone obviously
knows how to prioritize...

79
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,291
Right now, all requests
are thirty percent off.

80
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,041
Requests are thirty
percent off? Weird.

81
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,250
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to go ahead and stock up

82
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,958
on some favors in
case we need them.

83
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,791
So, let's get out there
and take some requests!

84
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,041
Hit up the school

85
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,750
and wherever else people
might need some help...

86
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,041
You can do it!

87
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,583
It says requests
are thirty percent off.

88
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,250
What does that even mean?

89
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,291
I don't get it...
So what do you think?

90
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,791
There's probably no difference,
to tell you the truth.

91
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,208
Oh well. It worked.

92
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,166
And we're ready; who's next?

93
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,208
What exactly would you
like us to do for you?

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,875
I'd love it if you
would fetch my balls!

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, no! The pain, the pain!

96
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,291
Could you clean
the swimming pool?

97
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,958
The unbelievable sorrow!!!

98
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,125
Would you feed
the animals for me?

99
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,625
The horr-- Oh, wait.

100
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,416
She likes doing this.

101
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,083
Alice is a request
handling superstar.

102
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,833
Okay, is everyone listening?

103
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,166
Move your tongue like this.

104
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,791
Otohime is holding
a beauty class...

105
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,083
Or, maybe a kissing class...
I'm not sure.

106
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,791
Otsuu is being her typical
sweeping maid self.

107
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,166
La la la la laaa!

108
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,041
Three days nonstop--I'm
freakin' exhausted.

109
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,291
Me too.

110
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,125
I feel like a handyman.

111
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,583
And we still have to help
out the manga club, don't we?

112
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,916
I don't like their room;

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,375
it always smells like
stinky feet and sour milk.

114
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,708
Oh... you leaving?

115
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,541
Yeah, we've got a request.

116
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,375
I can help you
out if you want...

117
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,708
I'm done with all
mine for the day.

118
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,583
No thanks... We'll be fine.

119
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,083
This show
should be called

120
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,708
Okamisan and Her
Complicated Heart...

121
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,916
Poor Ryoshi doesn't
stand a chance.

122
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,541
Yea, I'm fine,
all right, jerk...?

123
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,250
Mind your own business!

124
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,541
No thanks... We'll be fine.

125
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,291
Maybe it was something I said.

126
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,541
Ryoshi senses
another presence...

127
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,750
Not bad!

128
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,541
You knew I was here
before I called out...!

129
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,458
You really must be
descended from hunters.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,833
So...

131
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,708
You are...?

132
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,458
My name is Saburo Nekomiya;

133
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,291
I'm a senior at Otogi Academy.

134
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,000
You can just call
me Neko, though...

135
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,250
Everybody does.

136
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,541
Oh my... He's certainly
a handsome young man.

137
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,375
Well, then...

138
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,291
Nice to meet you.

139
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,291
Yeah, okay; it's nice to
meet you too--I'm uh...

140
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,458
You are a first year member
of the infamous Otogi Bank...

141
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,125
You're Ryoshi Moreno...

142
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,333
You boldly confessed
your love to Okamisan...

143
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,791
..only to be rejected.

144
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,666
This one is clearly
a fan of the show.

145
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,000
That fancy little
club of yours gets

146
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,625
an awful lot of attention...

147
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,958
Guess what else I know?

148
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,041
Staaare.

149
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,333
Please don't look at me!

150
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,166
I really hate being stared at!

151
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,416
Oh, yeah, you got it bad...

152
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,125
That's ophthalmophobia.

153
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,750
What do you want
from me, anyway?

154
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,541
Do you have a request
or something like that?

155
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,083
No, no... I was hoping
you'd let me give you a hand.

156
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,291
What?

157
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,541
See I'm a big fan of
helping people out...

158
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,333
I like to offer assistance
to others whenever I can.

159
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,250
Uh, this sounds
extremely shady to me.

160
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,291
Relax, man.

161
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,000
You're not gonna
have to repay me...

162
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,416
It's totally free!

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
And now, the whole
thing's even shadier.

164
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,416
I'm sorry, but I can't think of

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,083
anything I would
need to ask you for.

166
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,750
Thanks anyway though...
See ya later.

167
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,458
So you don't want to
protect the girl you love?

168
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,833
Come on now, don't
act so surprised...

169
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,208
You've gotta know the way
things are going between you,

170
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,458
it won't work out.

171
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,500
Don't worry; I've
got your back, friend.

172
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,791
Stop freaking out and
put your faith in me.

173
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,208
I will turn you
into the perfect man...

174
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,125
One Ryoko Okami won't
be able to resist.

175
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,125
Interested?

176
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,625
Now, we can begin
your training tomorrow...

177
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,083
...sound good?

178
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,708
Heh, well, Neko
may be Puss In Boots,

179
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,166
but I think we know
who the real puss is...

180
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,791
Yes, sir!

181
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,916
I'm so worn out!

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,583
I'll go draw a bath for you.

183
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,875
Whoa. Who's that?

184
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,083
Please... Help me.

185
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,750
Oh, how awful!

186
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,666
That's an Onigashima
High uniform, isn't it?

187
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:26,791
Who cares?

188
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,375
Let's just get her inside.

189
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,291
Hey there, sleepy, welcome back.

190
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,791
What? Where am I?

191
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,791
The Otogi Academy girls' dorm.

192
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,250
You collapsed right
outside the front door.

193
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,166
You didn't have to
take care of me-- Ow!

194
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,041
Just try to relax, okay?

195
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,333
Thank you...

196
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,416
You're both very kind.

197
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,583
My name is Reiko Kokonoh.

198
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,583
Some jerks from my high
school were after me so I ran...

199
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,916
I didn't mean to bother you;

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,875
I was just trying
to find a place

201
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,541
where I could hide from them.

202
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,791
That's weird.

203
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,500
Why were they chasing
you in the first place?

204
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,625
Do you know Shiro Hitsujikai?

205
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,000
He's the Onigashima
student council president.

206
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,333
Yes, we've heard of him.

207
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,583
Why do you ask?

208
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,958
He's my; well, I used
to be his girlfriend...

209
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,208
...but I guess he didn't
want to be with me anymore.

210
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,208
So he tried to sell me.

211
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,916
I was waiting to talk to him,

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,750
but those thugs
showed up instead...

213
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,916
They said Shiro told them

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,625
they could do whatever
they wanted to me.

215
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,583
That bastard!

216
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,666
He will pay!

217
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,416
What are you going to do?

218
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,416
What do you think...?

219
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,666
I'm gonna go see him!

220
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,166
Don't be ridiculous.
You know you can't!

221
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,250
She's right!

222
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,000
It's much too dangerous.
Please don't!

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,625
The important thing is
I was able to get away

224
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,958
from those guys...

225
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,166
Trust me--that's enough for me.

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,875
I'll help you get out of there.

227
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,875
We can get you transferred
from Onigashima.

228
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,000
Are you serious?

229
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,750
I think it's do-able...

230
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,500
Don't you, Ringo?

231
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,833
Yeah.

232
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,500
You can stay here until
the paperwork is finished.

233
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,708
Are you sure?

234
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,875
Yes.

235
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,083
And don't worry;
we'll protect you... Cool?

236
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,833
Thank you so much.

237
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,208
Ringo, you're fine
with this, right?

238
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,083
Yeah... Sure thing...

239
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,833
To be continued
in the second half.

240
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,291
The day after
Okamisan rescued Reiko.

241
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,666
Well, congrats; you all
did a lot of work today.

242
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,333
Fifty requests were completed,

243
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,500
and even at a discount

244
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,583
a return favor is
still a favor, isn't it?

245
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,875
Sure would've been nice if
you woulda done some of them.

246
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,875
She's right--you've
been a bump on a log.

247
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,416
I'm not gonna disagree.

248
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,208
Don't you worry; I'm doing a
bit on my end of things, too.

249
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,375
I know you're all tired,

250
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,125
but we need you to
keep up the hard work...

251
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,125
Just think, only
two more days to go.

252
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,250
'Kay.

253
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,375
It's like a Hell Week
for requests.

254
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,083
Oh... I have to go now.

255
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,916
I'll see you guys later.

256
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,958
What was that all about?

257
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you saying you're curious?

258
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,208
No, gah... We should
be heading back, too.

259
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,250
I have some business
I need to take care of...

260
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,666
But by all means,
you go on ahead without me.

261
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,333
Seriously, you too?

262
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,708
See ya later, then.

263
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,750
I have something important
I need to discuss with you.

264
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,458
So, um...

265
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,166
what kind of training is this?

266
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,291
The kind that'll
help you in a fight.

267
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,666
I guess Ryoshi decided to
take Neko up on his offer.

268
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,666
Now...

269
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,000
I heard when you
went to Onigashima

270
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,708
to bring those
juvie losers down,

271
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,625
you used a slingshot,
is that true?

272
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,750
Yeah, that's right.

273
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,166
That's cool and all,

274
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,000
but you're only backing
her up not saving her butt...

275
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,916
If she got into a tight spot
and needed some real help...

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,291
you'd have to step it up
and fight, wouldn't you?

277
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,833
Yes, of course he would.

278
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,625
Don't you want to get ready
for when she truly needs you?

279
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,333
The most important thing

280
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,541
to remember in a fight
is to keep your cool.

281
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,125
If you snap,
you've lost control,

282
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,791
which means you'll likely
lose the upper hand as well.

283
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,416
You need to learn to maintain
your calm no matter what.

284
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,125
Brace yourself for your
first challenge, Ryoshi!

285
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:20,916
Wait...!

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,666
Can I ask you something?

287
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,916
Sure, what?

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,875
Why are you helping me?

289
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,000
What is all this about?

290
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,166
I have been wondering
the same thing.

291
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,875
All you need to worry
about is keeping up...

292
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,375
Now get ready!

293
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,875
Hey! What was that for?

294
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,708
Ha! For your own good.

295
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,791
My boots are steel-toed,

296
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,000
so it's really gonna hurt
if you don't dodge them.

297
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,500
He's quite strict for
such an adorable boy.

298
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,625
Yes, sir.

299
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,625
Okay... Here we go!

300
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,916
Yes, sir!

301
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,083
I'm home.

302
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,375
Hey, I made dinner.

303
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,041
Holy crap...

304
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,708
You mean you did all of this?

305
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,083
Yes; I figured it was
the least I could do...

306
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,250
I went ahead and folded
all the laundry as well.

307
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,541
And straightened up a bit.

308
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,541
Get out. Well, thank you, Reiko.

309
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,083
Sure thing.

310
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,666
So it's a girl from
Onigashima High School?

311
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,083
Yes.

312
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,166
I'm not saying there's
anything suspicious going on...

313
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,250
I just feel...

314
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,000
That it's better
to be safe than sorry.

315
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,166
Yes.

316
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey...! I think I found her.

317
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,958
She has good grades.

318
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,416
Although it does appear
that her personality changes

319
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,375
drastically depending on the
guy she's dating at the time...

320
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,833
She's at Onigashima because one
of her boyfriends influenced her

321
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,958
to shoplift, and so she had
a run in with the police.

322
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,541
That's so sad.

323
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,000
Ringo...

324
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,625
why don't you monitor the
situation for right now...?

325
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,375
If her story is true, then we'll
probably be receiving a visit

326
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,458
from a few of those
guys who were chasing her.

327
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,875
No problem.

328
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,458
In case the worst happens
and those boys do show up,

329
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,833
it might be a good idea to pair
an additional person with her.

330
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,000
My instinct would
be to send Ryoshi...

331
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,791
...but he seems to be
busy somewhere else.

332
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,625
Finally, I'm back you guys!

333
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,583
It's a good thing
I left the curtains open.

334
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,625
This is fun...!
I love stakeouts!

335
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,708
True... but there's no need
to get overly excited about it.

336
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,333
All you need to
do is tell someone

337
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,666
if anything bad
happens to Ryoko, okay?

338
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,208
I won't let you down!

339
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,666
I'm like a hawk!

340
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,416
She is in total stakeout mode.

341
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,541
So?

342
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,375
Did you find anything out?

343
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,208
What makes you
think I could get info

344
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,041
the great Otogi Bank
president couldn't?

345
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,041
That's what I was afraid of.

346
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,166
You know... we're
assuming Shiro was the one

347
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,833
who was trying
to frame the bank,

348
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,041
but what exactly
is in it for him...?

349
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,666
I mean he's gotta have some
sort of motive, doesn't he?

350
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,500
Guess I've got no choice.

351
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Thanks for all
your help... See ya!

352
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,500
And so... Time passed...

353
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,125
Slower for some
than for others...

354
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,958
And now it's the last day

355
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,125
of the thirty percent
off request campaign.

356
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,166
Don't tell me you
have another request?

357
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,750
In just a few days,

358
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,416
Otohime became the go-to beauty
guru (and kissing expert).

359
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,625
All right. Have fun!

360
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,500
The last day of the sale and
Litzy decides to disappear...

361
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,708
Isn't that just perfect.

362
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,625
Wait, did she just call
the president Litzy?

363
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,500
Huh... well that's odd.

364
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,208
Mimi is visiting the Bank,
which is pretty odd...

365
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,541
so we'll deal with Litzy later.

366
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,958
What can we help you with, Mimi?

367
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,416
Well, is Otohime here?

368
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,125
She's out on a request right
now, but can I help you?

369
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,458
Oh, yes, of course...!

370
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,708
One of my friends who
goes to Anderson asked me

371
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,250
to come up here for her;
she has a request.

372
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,583
You mean Anderson
Academy for Girls?

373
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,750
The academy they're speaking
of is basically a school

374
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,875
for the richiest
of rich girls...

375
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,041
which I'm sure
piques Alice's interest.

376
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,166
Yeah, I could do that.

377
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,125
So where are we going?

378
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,166
You need to learn
to concentrate...

379
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,666
If you're scared
of being looked at,

380
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,791
then your fear will distract
you from avoiding my kicks.

381
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,833
Thank you for fixing my window.

382
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,875
You're so sweet!

383
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,416
Taro has just
finished a request.

384
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,750
Now then, how would you like
to join me for a cup of tea?

385
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,041
Is something the matter?

386
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,750
No, no... I'm fine;
something just seems off.

387
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,333
Without Otohime showing
up out of the blue,

388
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,625
he looks kind of ridiculous.

389
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,458
Your girlfriend's
not coming, Urashima.

390
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,083
This is for you.

391
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,000
This is Otohime's purse.

392
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,416
You're gonna want to
come with us I think, pal.

393
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,000
Who are you!

394
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,750
Alice and Mimi have
come to meet the student

395
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,541
from Anderson Academy for Girls.

396
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,083
That was so easy!

397
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,625
It would've been
more fun with Otohime,

398
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,500
but as long as I get everyone
out of the Bank, I'm good...

399
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,625
I wonder what they're
gonna do to the place...

400
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,458
I can't wait to find out!

401
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,625
Is something the matter, Mimi?

402
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,541
Oh, no... I'm... just great.

403
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,958
Hey.

404
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,916
What the heck is
wrong with you guys?

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,625
Nice work.

406
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,041
You should leave now.

407
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,750
You're part of the Otogi Bank,
aren't you, four eyes...?

408
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,791
Get up, 'cause you're
coming with us.

409
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,000
You set this entire thing
up for them, didn't you?

410
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,541
They set me up, too!

411
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,041
Come on!

412
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,583
Damn it!

413
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,958
Get 'em!

414
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,875
And we're back with the girls...

415
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,666
They're making a
quick trip to the store

416
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,208
on the way to another request.

417
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,458
I'll just run in

418
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,125
and give this to Reiko
before we head out, kay?

419
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,541
I'll wait for you here.

420
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,958
Blocked caller...?

421
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,375
Yes? This is Ringo.

422
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,291
Ringo Akai.

423
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,375
Is that correct?

424
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,458
And who is this?!

425
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:48,250
Were you aware that Himeno
Shirayuki has seven siblings...?

426
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,541
What do you think she would do
if they disappeared one by one?

427
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,041
What...?! What are
you talking about...?

428
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:03,250
Ryoko, I...

429
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,500
Himeno Shirayuki's house...

430
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,541
She's Ringo's older sister
and has seven little siblings.

431
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,333
Coming!

432
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,125
Ringo, it's good to see you...!

433
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,166
How's it going?

434
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,791
Did you come to
play with the kids?

435
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,416
Himeno!

436
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,583
Is everyone okay?

437
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,208
Yes, they're fine...

438
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,875
See.

439
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,500
Thank goodness!
They're all safe.

440
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,333
Thank goodness.

441
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,708
Oh, no!

442
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,791
Reiko, I'm home...

443
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,125
I got that stuff you
asked me to bring you!

444
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,208
Wonderful, you're just in time.

445
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,500
How's it been?

446
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,041
Anything weird
happen around here?

447
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,166
No... Not yet.

448
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,500
Well, that's a relief...

449
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,208
I was planning on talking
to the school director

450
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,583
about your transfer tomorrow...

451
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,208
...so... it shouldn't
be much longer on that.

452
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,000
You're so nice.

453
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,875
"Ryoko Okami is nothing if
not a decent human being...

454
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,416
She's also extremely gullible." 

455
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
You're just like
Shiro said you would be.

456
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,750
You lied!

457
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,458
I'm back, Alice!

458
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,583
Hello? Where'd Alice go?

459
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,041
Out on a request, maybe...?

460
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,125
I don't know; I just got
back from filling one myself.

461
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
Lizst!

462
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,416
What's wrong, Ringo?

463
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,625
It's... I think Ryoko and
Reiko have disappeared...

464
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,708
and Otsuu is missing, too!

465
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,541
I found this on the
floor of our room.

466
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,250
The Otogi Bank
has been scattered.

467
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,625
What will become of them now?!

468
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,125
Hey! Ryoshi!

469
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,791
What are you doing?!

470
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,833
Your friends need you!

471
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,500
The Otogi Bank is in
its greatest peril yet!

472
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,458
To be continued.

473
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,250
You're never going
to know what happens

474
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,250
unless you watch
the next episode.
