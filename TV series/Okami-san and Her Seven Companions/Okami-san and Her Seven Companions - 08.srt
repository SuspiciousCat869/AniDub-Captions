1
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,458
And now, a very special preview.

2
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,291
Something's happened...

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,666
And I need your help.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,416
Will they live...?

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Or will they die?

6
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,708
I bet they're hiding in here.

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's stay close...

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,000
They have one more than we do.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,958
Not anymore they don't.

10
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,916
The Otogi Bank
Chosen Team versus

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,708
the Three Tonda Brothers--the
Stink Terrorists...

12
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,291
It's going to be a
fierce, brutal battle.

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,791
Bring back the Gourmet Club
or we will refusing to bathing

14
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,125
and pass gassing
whenever you walk bying!

15
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,125
Unbelievable word endings.

16
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,041
If you want to win this battle,
then listen up good...!

17
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,208
First you must defeat
me in Twister-ee!

18
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,625
Really unbelievable.

19
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,458
We've been waiting for you.

20
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,375
The third one is normal.

21
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,833
Ryoko Okami.

22
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,541
Ryoshi Morino.

23
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,041
Ringo Akai.

24
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,208
In...

25
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,958
Okami-san and the Three Pigs.

26
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,208
I'm okay...

27
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,541
I just got a little in my
lungs, but you carry on.

28
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,083
Ringo!

29
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,208
That preview before the opening
song threw you didn't it?

30
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,000
Just trying to keep
you on your toes!

31
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,166
Now back to our usual beginning!

32
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,125
A bride request?

33
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,375
Seriously?

34
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,541
Yes but it's not from
anyone at this school.

35
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,166
In fact... I think it
would be very convenient

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,500
to have a favor
owed from this person.

37
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,458
From the way you're talking,

38
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,708
I assume this is someone

39
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,916
who's either very
powerful or very rich?

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,958
Yep...

41
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,541
He's an heir to the
House of Nezumi.

42
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,000
I think I've heard of them...

43
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,750
Their company has industrial
real-estate commercials

44
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,541
on television,
isn't that right ?

45
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,208
The point here is that
this guy is a big deal.

46
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,208
He doesn't really need
help finding a bride.

47
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,166
He's just lazy and
trying to buy one.

48
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,208
If he's as powerful and
as wealthy as you say,

49
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,750
there are probably plenty of
girls who want to be with him.

50
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,458
This is true.
Money is quite the aphrodisiac.

51
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,500
I think it's because he's not
every woman's physical type.

52
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,875
But I trust you'll help him out.

53
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,875
We appreciate your help.

54
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,583
This is Master Chutaro Nezumi...

55
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,041
...no need to genuflect.

56
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,125
I am Harmel,

57
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,500
his butler--honorable
by association.

58
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,625
Whoa, wait a minute...

59
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,708
I'm a little confused...

60
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,458
He's the one
looking for a bride?

61
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,458
No girl is going to say "yes"
to him dressed like that!

62
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,625
It's so small.

63
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,166
Is this a peasant's
house or something?

64
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,500
It's an office, sir, but
I do understand the confusion.

65
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,416
Let me smack him...

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Rude little jerk.

67
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
Come on now, he's just a kid.

68
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,958
Anyone thirsty?

69
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,916
Then the maid-girl enters.

70
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,291
Um, may I ask what
your name is, sir?

71
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,125
Yes, I suppose
you could do that.

72
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:38,958
Okay.

73
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,500
If I may be so bold.

74
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,458
It's Harmel, though I've always
felt more like a Sebastian.

75
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,125
Wow! I love that name!

76
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,083
A butler named "Sebastian,"
that's original.

77
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,041
I do too.

78
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,666
It just feels right, doesn't it?

79
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,833
And what's your name miss?

80
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,625
Oh my goodness.

81
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,250
How rude of me.

83
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,791
I'm Otsuu Tsurugaya.

84
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,583
Ah, and here I would
have guessed Mabel...

85
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,541
Just by virtue of
your ensemble...

86
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,458
I would also assume you
have a very clean house.

87
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,458
And a dirty mind.

88
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,083
Perhaps you assume too much!

89
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,916
Well that was
awkward for no reason.

90
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,375
Can someone explain
what just happened here?

91
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,041
Not it!

92
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:15,875
You're on your own.

93
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,083
So what you're saying is...

94
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,458
...as the Nezumi heir,

95
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,833
it is customary for
Chutaro to select a bride

96
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,333
before his twelfth birthday

97
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,916
and he hasn't been able to
find one yet, is that correct?

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,083
You've understood me perfectly.

99
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:27,916
Married by twelve?

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,166
And we're okay with this?

101
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,500
We will need to get
started straight away.

102
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,541
We're running out of time...

103
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,208
His birthday is
one week from today.

104
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,375
But you've known about it
for almost twelve years now.

105
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,208
Shouldn't something
have been arranged earlier?

106
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,250
He does have a good point there.

107
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,250
Um, yeah.

108
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,750
Kid...!

109
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,875
You don't have any little
friends that you could marry?

110
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,583
No...

111
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,708
I really don't...

112
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,041
If I did, I wouldn't be here.

113
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,041
It wasn't easy to
lower myself like this.

114
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,500
It's not easy for me to
watch this--you're eleven!

115
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,083
No, we understand...

116
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,583
so let's say we were to search
for prospects at our school...

117
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,458
what would we look
for--preferences, conditions...?

118
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,125
I haven't thought about it much.

119
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,416
I know I want a
woman who'll be able

120
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,625
to help me run the Nezumi
House in the future.

121
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,125
So maybe that's what
you could look for--

122
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,333
someone who's smart and who
seems like they'd work hard.

123
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,625
Someone who's smart.

124
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,458
And who'll work hard for you.

125
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,666
We're looking for a girl, right?

126
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you already have
someone in mind for him?

127
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,583
Maybe someone perfect
is about to walk in.

128
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,375
No, just making
sure we got it right.

129
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,041
Pardon me...

130
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,500
Sorry, but the
President sent me here

131
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,625
to see how things were going.

132
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,583
What have we here?

133
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,416
Is this the girl?

134
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,750
She does seem
like a possibility.

135
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,958
Just wait until I get
my hands on that pansy...

136
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,333
...ugh!

137
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,625
I can't believe he's
setting Alice up like this...

138
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,708
The nerve!

139
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,875
Believe it...!

140
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,333
This is, in fact,
the President's doing!

141
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,958
He even provided that file
of information in advance.

142
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,833
It says that you're
beautiful, intelligent

143
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,000
and a competent worker.

144
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,625
Exactly what we're looking for.

145
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,916
Gee, thanks a lot...

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,541
You're one smooth
talker, y'know that?

147
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,791
Strange isn't on here.

148
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,333
It does say you're a bit rigid,

149
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,708
but that might be a good quality
for a servant-wife to have.

150
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,458
At least we know you're clean.

151
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,833
Excellent!

152
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,041
Will you please accept
my hand in marriage?

153
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,166
Right to the chase!

154
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,375
Wha?!!

155
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,583
Hold on.

156
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,708
Rigid is sometimes a nice way

157
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,333
of calling someone
a control freak.

158
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,625
And control freak is a nice way

159
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,041
of saying this woman
would ruin your life.

160
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,333
I don't know why we
didn't notice it earlier...

161
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,708
Just look at the deep
creases between the eyebrows.

162
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,041
Those are frown lines and
proof that she becomes angry

163
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,625
and hysterical quite often.

164
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,375
That tight miniskirt will soon
be replaced with sweat pants,

165
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,291
she'll wear chains
on her glasses

166
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,833
and spend all her free
time watching soap operas.

167
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,375
Yes, I think I understand...

168
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,083
and those are some
deep lines, I mean...

169
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,000
wow...

170
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,625
Plus, I don't like soap operas.

171
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,458
At least he let her down easily.

172
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,125
It's not like I have
wrinkles on my face

173
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,291
because it's fashionable!

174
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,083
And I don't like soap operas!

175
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,166
Sorry.

176
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,125
Something tells me she
wouldn't have been able

177
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,708
to handle the job.

178
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,041
That wasn't her fault.

179
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,250
They're the ones who made
her freak out like that!

180
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,333
Idiots.

181
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,791
Anyone would react
the way Alice did

182
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,583
if you criticized
them that much.

183
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,125
We'll have to apologize
to her for this later.

184
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,000
Who's that?

185
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,500
What did you see?
Is something wrong?

186
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,083
I don't know.

187
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
I thought I saw something that
looked kinda like a house gnome.

188
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,291
Or... maybe not?

189
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,458
Okay, I know it's early

190
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,125
but that is such a
perfect place to break.

191
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,958
So suspenseful!
See you in a bit!

192
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,416
We're back!

193
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,458
The wolf is on the
hunt for a child bride...

194
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,333
or a bride for a child.

195
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,583
Now that I think about it,

196
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,500
Ami already has a boy
that she's in love with,

197
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,458
so perhaps this
isn't a good idea.

198
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,583
Well, "in love" doesn't
mean that she's married.

199
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,166
She's not, but...

200
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,208
...there's another side to her
that isn't listed in that book.

201
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,625
Well, it doesn't matter
if she has a boyfriend.

202
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,166
I'm extremely good looking...

203
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,375
She'll be much happier with me.

204
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,583
Do your best not to hate
him because he's beautiful.

205
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,666
Or a mini-dork--take your pick.

206
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,166
Comes with being a
wealthy scion, I guess.

207
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,916
That's Inuzuka.

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,166
You may remember him

209
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,625
from earlier as part of
Momoko's entourage...

210
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,166
He's also on the baseball
team as Jin's assistant.

211
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,750
'So... Where is she?

212
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,625
She's right over there.

213
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,250
I see a tree and a bush.

214
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,375
Is that who I think it is?

215
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,750
Hello, how are you today?

216
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,500
What?! Nothing!

217
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,125
Yep!

218
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,791
That's Ami Jizou.

219
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,250
She's supporting Jin in
her usual maniacal way.

220
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,708
Of course not...!

221
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,125
I'm just secretly watching
over him from a distance...

222
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,125
not that it's any
of your business.

223
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,708
Wouldn't it make more
sense for you to go in

224
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,125
and watch from the sidelines
like a normal person?

225
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,916
You are dating him, right?

226
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,666
I can't do something like that!

227
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,791
It might creep him out!

228
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,083
That might creep him out?

229
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,291
You're wearing a stalker poncho

230
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,875
and spying on him
from the bushes.

231
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,708
And I imagine it
gets hot in that thing.

232
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,416
Pardon me.

233
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,333
Is your name Ami Jizou?

234
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,750
According to my records,

235
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,750
you're the serious type,
but a very good house keeper.

236
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,583
It also says you're
physically frustrated

237
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,250
but you're choosing
to keep quiet about it.

238
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,291
"Physically frustrated"?

239
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,416
Is that his attempt
at being subtle?

240
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,625
It didn't work.
It's still awkward.

241
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,500
I believe you would
be very good at looking

242
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,208
after the Nezumi House.

243
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,666
Most beautiful lady,
will you marry me?

244
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,291
What?!

245
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:06,958
Are you kidding?!

246
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,291
Not just yet!

247
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,333
If she's as repressed
as that book says she is,

248
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,500
this could be bad news.

249
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,833
She could blow her top
like an emotional land mine.

250
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,625
Is he really doing this again?

251
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,416
And another thing...

252
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,625
She clearly has
stalker-like tendencies.

253
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,291
Pretty soon your
pets will go missing

254
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,166
and you'll wake up to find her
undergarments in your mailbox.

255
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,958
Now he's just being tacky.

256
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,291
Where does he get this stuff?

257
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,208
I'm sorry, but that's
coming on way too strong.

258
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,375
Mailing unmentionables
would be a bit forward,

259
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,125
but aren't we
jumping the gun a bit?

260
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,625
Too crazy...?

261
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:41,041
Emotional land mine...? Stalker?

262
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,666
Ami, don't go!

263
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,500
She'll be all right.

264
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Just remind me to take

265
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,000
an apology gift
basket over to Jin's.

266
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,250
Good idea...

267
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,666
Although that means
they'll have to tell him

268
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,875
where they found her and
that could be a little awkward.

269
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,583
Oh look, there she is again...!

270
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,416
It's the house gnome
girl from earlier.

271
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,291
Wish they'd explain who she is.

272
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,250
The next stop on their search
is the gym class storage area.

273
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,416
You know, you're from
a very high class family...

274
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,708
You should make sure

275
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,625
that the bride you
choose is of equal caliber

276
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,833
or else things could
become quite unbalanced.

277
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,291
That's a good point,
Harmel, thank you.

278
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,666
So...

279
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,250
We need to find a girl
from a higher class family.

280
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,375
Can you think of anyone?

281
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,625
Yes...

282
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,708
In fact, the one we're
looking for qualifies.

283
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,000
According to the
student network,

284
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,750
this is where Taro Urashima
tends to hide out.

285
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,041
So if we can find Taro, Otohime
will either be with him already

286
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,500
or close behind, right?

287
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,000
Ah. That makes more sense.

288
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,666
Man, I could learn
something from her.

289
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,541
The way she has Taro follow her
around like that is pure genius.

290
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,416
Oh really?

291
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
What technique is it, precisely,

292
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,833
that you would be
interested in acquiring?

293
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:40,750
Um, yeah.

294
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,625
Um, yeah.

295
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,166
It's just a misunderstanding!

296
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,333
I was yawning and "request"
just sounded like "breast...!"

297
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,375
I promise I wasn't
hitting on her!

298
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,458
We were working, I swear!

299
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,416
I knew it!

300
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,791
I'm getting good at this.

301
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,291
Since when does that
involve holding hands

302
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,041
and whispering sweet nothings
into someone else's ear?!

303
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,375
We always seem
to find them like this.

304
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,750
Right in front of the child!

305
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,958
This can't be good...

306
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,583
We could always
say it's educational,

307
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
but what if it scars him?

308
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,208
Or, no, wait, I guess he's fine.

309
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,333
I'm told you come from
a high-class family.

310
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,458
I would be so honored
if you'd be my bride.

311
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,625
I'm very sorry but,
I have to say no...

312
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,875
I've already found the one

313
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,041
I'm going to marry in
the future and he's...

314
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,500
Ringo and Ryoko...!

315
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,833
So good to see you...
scrumptious as always.

316
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,875
Thanks, though that's
highly inappropriate.

317
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,416
I have no response to that.

318
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,375
You're as hard to
please as ever I see.

319
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,416
That's all right; I enjoy
a challenge--it's exciting.

320
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,416
Taro, get over here...!

321
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,125
There is a refined gentleman
proposing to me right now

322
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,750
and not only are you
completely oblivious

323
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,916
but you're throwing yourself

324
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,208
at all these girls
right in front of me!

325
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,375
How can you be so cruel?!

326
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,916
Wait, that's not a gentleman.

327
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He's still just a kid.

328
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,125
That's not the point!

329
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:41,875
Tell me the truth.

330
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,875
Do you still love me?

331
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,083
Of course I do, Otohime.

332
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,708
My eyes may look at other women,

333
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,833
but the only one
my heart sees is you.

334
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,083
Sold! He's so good at that!

335
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,000
Thank you, Taro.

336
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,208
Oh crap!

337
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,500
Here we go. Get it girl!

338
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,500
Hey kid, I'm sorry.

339
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,625
I know you wanted
to be with her,

340
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,333
but let me explain
something to you...

341
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,666
that kind of libido can
be pretty exhausting.

342
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,916
You know, I'm not saying don't
ever do it, cause well...

343
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,041
That would be painful.

344
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,416
But moderation is your friend.

345
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,958
Remember that!

346
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,541
I'm not sure I understand what
you mean by that, but okay.

347
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,791
It was nice of
him to try though.

348
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,125
Maybe we can make this
into an instructional video.

349
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,875
I don't know much about girls,
but they're sure enthusiastic.

350
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,416
Look who has an opinion.

351
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,875
Great. Now he's going to think
all women are just like her.

352
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,833
It's not that
Otohime's a bad person,

353
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,666
but I know what you mean.

354
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,166
All right then...

355
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,083
Let's move on to
the next, shall we?

356
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,333
Yes, because they're
clearly ready to go.

357
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,041
Hi!

358
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,083
I'm Mimi Usami!

359
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,375
It's so nice to meet you!

360
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:44,958
Aw...!

361
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,208
She's so cute!

362
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,750
Careful young master.

363
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,208
It's often the cutest ones who
have the blackest of hearts.

364
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,125
Why don't you come and say
that to my fist, you jerk...?!

365
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,083
I dare you!

366
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,916
Hi, I'm Suzume Shitagiri...

367
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,416
Suzume with the broadcast club!

368
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
We like her!

369
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,083
Oh! She has such a
pretty voice, too!

370
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,208
Yet she would chat about the
most boring subjects all day.

371
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,583
You'd feel like you were
living with a broken radio.

372
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,458
And you are about to live
with a broken face, turd-liver!

373
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,833
Remember Gretel?

374
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,333
The student council secretary?

375
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,375
The Nezumi House
would be international!

376
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,458
You don't want a girl
with a brother complex.

377
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,375
The love my brother
and I share is sacred

378
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,875
and none of your business!

379
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,708
Kizaki! Shiratori! Tanuki!

380
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,333
Aisaka! Kushieda! Kawashima!

381
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,708
Misaka! Shirai!
Saten! Hatsuharu!

382
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,291
They look so exhausted.

383
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,375
You showed us a lot,
but none of them worked--

384
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,833
they all had something
wrong with them.

385
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,958
No you just kept
looking for their flaws.

386
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,291
You're never going to find
anyone if you keep that up.

387
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,583
Young master...

388
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,958
If I may, please allow me to add

389
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,875
one more important condition
to your bridal criteria.

390
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,666
What's that, Harmel?

391
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,541
Make sure she has
a huge bra size.

392
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,750
Where did that come from?!

393
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,333
What the hell is
wrong with this guy?

394
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,125
Yet another prejudiced
generalization.

395
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,416
The size is important?

396
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,708
Yes...

397
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,416
I know you don't
understand it now, sir,

398
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,958
but someday they will be
the only joy you have left.

399
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:01,916
Observe!

400
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,041
A prime example!

401
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,541
It's the famous
Otogi double dumplings!

402
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,875
Wow, Harmel! You're right!

403
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,041
Those are incredible!

404
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,416
That they are indeed, sir...

405
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,583
Every man's folly
and wildest fantasy,

406
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,458
wrapped up in
two perfect bundles.

407
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,833
I'm not exactly sure what
you mean, but thank you!

408
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,041
There's too much
awkward happening here.

409
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,541
By the way, Ryoshi?

410
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,958
What's wrong with Ryoko
and her little friend?

411
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,250
They're not comfortable
talking about breast size.

412
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,333
You know, just stuff...

413
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,166
You know how girls can be.

414
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,416
I like you!

415
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,250
Will you do me the
honor of being my wife...

416
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,000
Wait just a moment, sir!

417
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,125
Oh no! Not again!

418
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,666
I was so blinded
by their beauty,

419
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,333
I forgot to remind you that
there is gravity here on earth.

420
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,541
Yeah, I know that, so what?

421
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,875
It's a curse sir...

422
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,500
One day that perky shelf
will fall down to here.

423
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,000
Life as you knew
it will be over...

424
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,333
Shape, a distant memory.

425
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,500
Hey...!

426
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,458
What the heck are
you talking about...?

427
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,708
I will never let that happen.

428
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,083
Gravity has no effect on me!

429
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,833
It feels that way...

430
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,250
Believe me, I wish
it could be true,

431
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,500
but give it ten years
and you'll see it isn't so.

432
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,583
So passionate about
something so absurd!

433
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,375
What a waste.

434
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,625
That's gonna be rough.

435
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,250
Have fun keeping those
things off the ground.

436
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,166
It's the attack of
the angry flat girls.

437
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,333
I'm sorry you skipped
puberty but insulting me

438
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,541
is not going to make
your chest pimples grow!

439
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,416
Harmel...

440
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,958
...if gravity is so powerful,

441
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,708
does that mean eventually
every size breast will fall?

442
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,875
No sir.

443
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,833
Fortunately there
are some miracle sizes

444
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,291
that can defy the
laws of gravity.

445
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,791
For example...

446
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,541
Tiny ones like those
two are smuggling!

447
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,083
He's just asking for it!

448
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,333
These miniature
morsels are majestic!

449
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,250
They rest on towering,
curveless figures acting

450
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:36,083
as shields unyielding to the
wind and refusing to back down!

451
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,250
I think I get the idea.

452
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,916
If there's nothing for
anyone to grab on to,

453
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,458
then gravity will
never be an issue.

454
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,833
His parents must be so proud.

455
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,041
Absolutely.

456
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,291
Because of their limited
handling over time,

457
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,333
they do tend to
hold up quite well.

458
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm gonna kill you!

459
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:52,958
Lemme at him.

460
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,000
You have to calm down now.

461
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,750
We're still
fulfilling a request!

462
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,916
Little Red is impressively
calm, considering.

463
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,041
Well...

464
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,291
I guess that leaves
me with these two

465
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,500
and they're both about
the same size up there,

466
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,166
so which one should
I pick, do you think?

467
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,291
The younger one, sir.

468
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,541
She'll be physically
attractive longer

469
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,375
and have more
energy for housework.

470
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,083
All right...

471
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,291
Then I choose that one.

472
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,750
What are you talking about?

473
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,625
On the other hand, master;
she may look young and firm,

474
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,666
but I can see through her.

475
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,583
She is well past expiration.

476
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,833
No he did not!

477
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,333
Uncalled for!

478
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,083
What did you just say?!

479
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,625
That's it, butler...!

480
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,500
It's on!

481
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,916
Just hang in there, Ryoshi...!

482
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
You've got to keep them
back or it's going to get ugly!

483
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,583
Gotta keep them back.

484
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,333
Just ignore the pain!

485
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,708
I've always found it
impressive how butlers

486
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,625
can remain completely stoic
in situations like this.

487
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,958
It's interesting, isn't it?

488
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,083
All the things we look for

489
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,958
when trying to find
the perfect bride?

490
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,125
Women only look for
one thing, you know,

491
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,791
it doesn't matter
how much money you have

492
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,916
or how powerful
you'll be in the future.

493
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,791
They want what you
give without really noticing.

494
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,583
What's that?

495
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,750
Friendship...

496
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,625
one that's genuine
and lasts a lifetime.

497
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,208
Look at that...

498
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,541
It's like we're in a
completely different story.

499
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,916
Tell me something, young master,

500
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,041
why did you decide to go looking

501
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,250
for a bride at this
particular time?

502
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,875
Because it's the custom.

503
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,750
You know that.

504
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,083
That's not the real reason...

505
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,250
Be honest, now...

506
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,125
Wasn't it for her?

507
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,250
Hey!

508
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,291
It's the little
gnome girl again!

509
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,916
I'd know that
shaggy bob anywhere!

510
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,375
Is that Uika?

511
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,916
Chutaro!

512
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,375
I don't understand why
are you looking for a bride?

513
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,791
Is it because you
don't like me anymore?!

514
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,208
No! Of course it isn't!

515
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,958
It's just that I was
hearing these rumors...

516
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,250
They said you'd found
a boy you really liked

517
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,458
and that you were happy.

518
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,125
I didn't!

519
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,708
They're lying!

520
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,333
There's only one person
in this whole world

521
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,875
that I like in that way...

522
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,375
And that's you, Chutaro!

523
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,416
Thanks, Uika.

524
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,500
It's a common mistake, sir,

525
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,000
but hopefully now you can see

526
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,833
that it is dangerous
to believe rumors,

527
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,708
rather than going
straight to the source.

528
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,000
There was never any need

529
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,458
to search for someone
to complete your life.

530
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,166
Everything you were looking for

531
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,708
was right beside
you the entire time.

532
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,333
You're right.

533
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,125
This was certainly unexpected.

534
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,625
Looks like they were
thinking the same thing.

535
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,416
Ah!

536
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
What great story!

537
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,958
So his long journey led
him to find the treasure

538
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,791
that he'd always had beside him.

539
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,833
You should be
proud of yourselves.

540
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,375
Because of all your hard work,

541
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,583
the love between a young boy
and girl was finally realized!

542
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,958
Very good work, all of you!

543
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,541
Notice that the President
is the only one laughing.

544
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,666
Oh don't look at me like that.

545
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,125
I don't think it's
very funny either.

546
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,750
Guess who...?!

547
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,333
I'm sure you've forgotten
all about it by now,

548
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,541
but we're gonna go
back to that random story

549
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,208
we started in the beginning.

550
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,333
We take you now to the climax!

551
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,416
The Otogi Bank Team
has broken into the hideout

552
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,958
of the three terrorist brothers.

553
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,500
Although it was dangerous,

554
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,208
Red insisted they
go through with it.

555
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,791
It's because of her that they
were able to force these pigs

556
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,375
to drop their deadliest
weapon--their stench.

557
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,250
There's only one
thing left to do...

558
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,708
The entire future of the school

559
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,166
and humanity rests on
one game of Double Dare...!

560
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,833
Who will survive?

561
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll make the
first dare... so...

562
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,750
Number one has
to kiss number two!

563
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,250
So if I'm number one then...

564
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:53,708
Hey look!

565
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,750
A fan service shot!

566
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,875
What the crap do you
think you're doing, Ringo?!

567
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,208
Don't be angry, it was a dare.

568
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,541
I had to do it...

569
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,958
I hope you took notes!

570
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,666
Because next time, we will
be passing out the dares.

571
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,833
So pucker up!

572
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,250
I hope you're all
ready for that.

573
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,458
Oh yuck!

574
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,166
I don't want to watch
those pigs make out!

575
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:13,541
Hey!

576
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,291
What just happened...?

577
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,625
I was watching that!

578
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,750
No reason to continue from here.

579
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,333
I'm surprised that Ringo would
even make a movie like this.

580
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,666
Whoa!

581
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,583
So that whole thing was
a movie that Ringo made?!

582
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,916
What a fun plot-twist!

583
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,333
I wonder where Otohime
and the others ran off to.

584
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,541
Oh! Sorry...!

585
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,791
Meanwhile...

586
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,250
I want that... oh,
and come to think of it...

587
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,041
Tonight every single girl
in this story is here.

588
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:40,083
I'll have one of everything
on this front row, please.

589
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,083
Give me the top five most
expensive items you have.

590
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,708
I want one of these and two
of those things over there.

591
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll have whatever's
in here, please.

592
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,500
I'll have what's in
there, two of these,

593
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,750
one of those, and
that entire front row.

594
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,375
On second thought,
I'll have three of everything.

595
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,208
Change my order
to four of everything!

596
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,875
Stop trying to be better than
me you ugly brat and ex-turtle!

597
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,791
And just who are you
calling an ex-turtle?!

598
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,208
I don't know why
you dress like that.

599
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,916
Everyone knows
you're an old hag!

600
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
I'm adorable!

601
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,708
I can't decide!

602
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,458
It all looks so delicious!

603
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,500
It's certainly hard
to choose, isn't it?

604
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,041
Oh come on, stop
worrying about that

605
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,500
and pick something yummy!

606
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,458
Wow what a turn-out.

607
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,000
I didn't expect this.

608
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,833
There seem to be people here
that didn't even show up today.

609
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,333
I guess that's true.

610
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,833
Mojolika wasn't involved,
but that's the only one I see.

611
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,208
Since you're here, Ryoshi...

612
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,708
My wallet seems to be
getting thinner and thinner

613
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,291
and I don't know that I'll
be able to cover all this.

614
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,500
Do you think I could borrow
just a little bit of cash?

615
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,416
Of course, but
I don't have that much.

616
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,000
And then a few
other things happened.

617
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,250
But in the end, all
anger and heartache

618
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,750
was snuffed out by delicious,
yet expensive, pastries...

619
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:48,166
and with the exception
of the President's wallet...

620
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,375
...all's well that ends well!

621
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,166
Now what do those
two girls holding hands

622
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,958
have to do with that title?
