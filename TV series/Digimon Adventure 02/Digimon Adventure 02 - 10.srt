00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:08,881
HMM.

160
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:17,947
FOOLISH CREATURE.

161
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,147
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO FIGHT ME,

162
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,614
BUT YOU'VE GIVEN ME
WHAT I NEED.

163
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:26,047
THE DARK RING CAN CONTROL
AN ADULT-STAGE DIGIMON

164
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:28,581
BUT NOT
A FULLY EVOLVED DIGIMON.

165
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,214
IT NEEDS TO BE
A DIFFERENT SHAPE

166
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:33,181
LIKE A CYLINDER OR A --
[ Gasps ]

167
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:36,647
OF COURSE. I KNOW
WHAT I NEED TO DO NOW.

168
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,614
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.

169
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,581
Cody: TAI, SLOW DOWN.

170
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,514
Tai: WE DON'T HAVE
THE TIME.

171
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:43,847
OH, HEY, LOOK.

172
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,814
WE'VE MADE IT. RAIL TOWN.

173
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,814
Kari: RAIL TOWN.
Cody: RAIL TOWN.

174
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:50,314
Davis: LOOKS MORE LIKE
GRASS AND HILL TOWN TO ME.

175
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,547
COME ON, GUYS, AGUMON IS
IN THIS TOWN SOMEWHERE.

176
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,014
SO LET'S GO!

177
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:58,481
EVERYBODY SPLIT UP
AND START LOOKING FOR HIM.

178
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,981
IF AGUMON ESCAPES,
KEN WILL HAVE TO USE ME,

179
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,154
BUT HE'S GOING TO BE MAD.

180
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,587
I'LL BAKE HIM SOME BROWNIES.

181
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,087
THE DARK RING'S GONE.
I'M FREE!

182
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:17,087
AH. NOW IT'S TIME
FOR A LITTLE PAYBACK.

183
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:21,554
THIS NEW STRUCTURE WILL
INCREASE THE POWER TENFOLD.

184
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:23,921
I WON'T EVEN NEED
THE CONTROL SPIRES.

185
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,754
HA HA HA.

186
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,487
NO ONE WILL EVER BE ABLE
TO STOP ME

187
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,521
FROM TAKING OVER
THE DIGITAL WORLD!

188
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:34,721
NOT A DARK RING,
BUT A DARK SPIRAL!

189
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,187
WITH THIS I CAN CONTROL EVEN
A FULLY DIGEVOLVED DIGIMON.

190
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,687
NOW, TO TEST IT
ON AGUMON.

191
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,154
WHAT? HE'S GONE!

192
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,621
BUT -- BUT HOW?

193
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:49,354
Davis: TAI, AGUMON'S CLOSE.
I'M FOLLOWING HIS TRACKS.

194
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:52,021
Tai: THOSE ARE TRAIN TRACKS,
DAVIS.

195
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,487
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
HUH?

196
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:58,821
Kari: IT'S EITHER THE LOCAL
OR THE EXPRESS.

197
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,087
AND LOOK WHO'S DRIVING.

198
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,061
WHOA!
OH!

199
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:05,761
IT'S -- IT'S AGUMON.

200
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:06,961
AGUMON!

201
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,194
TAI!

202
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:13,394
Gatomon: THAT OUGHT
TO SLOW HIM DOWN.

203
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,527
AGUMON, ARE YOU OKAY?

204
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,127
I'M FINE. TAI!

205
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,161
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
GIVE ME A GREAT BIG HUG.

206
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,327
OUCH.

207
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,461
ARE YOU OKAY?
DID HE HURT YOU?

208
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:30,094
NO, YOU WERE JUST
SQUEEZING MY RIBS TOO HARD.

209
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,061
TAI, WE SHOULD GET GOING.

210
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,527
I'M SURE KEN
WILL COME AFTER AGUMON.

211
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:38,394
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WE ALL CAME HERE TO FIGHT!

212
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,361
NOW YOU WANT US
TO TURN AROUND AND GO HOME?

213
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,594
I WANT TO GET THE GUY
WHO DID THIS TO AGUMON, TOO,

214
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:47,827
BUT SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO THINK
WITH YOUR HEAD, NOT YOUR HEART.

215
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,827
REMEMBER, WE'RE NOT
AT FULL STRENGTH.

216
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:51,661
AGUMON'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT,

217
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:54,661
SO OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS
TO GET HIM BACK TO SAFETY.

218
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,794
YOU MEAN WE CAN COME BACK
HERE LATER AND GET HIM?

219
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,494
MM-HMM.

220
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,076
HOW DID AGUMON GET AWAY?

221
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,983
AN ESCAPE CLAUSE
IN HIS CONTRACT?

222
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,883
I'M IN NO MOOD FOR HUMOR.

223
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,149
GOOD, BECAUSE I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU

224
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,916
ABOUT SOMETHING SERIOUS.
MASTER?

225
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:14,983
WHAT?

226
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,683
I-I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT YOU COULD USE ME

227
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,116
FOR YOUR EXPERIMENTS.

228
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,783
I MEAN, I AM A DIGIMON
JUST LIKE AGUMON.

229
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,449
I CAN DIGEVOLVE, TOO.

230
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:24,949
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

231
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,416
I SAY YOU CAN
FORGET ABOUT IT!

232
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:28,883
BUT, MASTER, PLEASE.

233
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,883
I'VE DONE ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING AROUND HERE

234
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,883
YOU'VE ASKED ME TO DO
AND MORE.

235
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,883
I EVEN CLEANED THAT HAIR TRAP
THING IN THE SHOWER.

236
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,883
HA! AND WHAT KIND OF DIGIMON
WOULD YOU DIGEVOLVE INTO?

237
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,883
PERHAPS
YOU'D TRANSFORM YOURSELF

238
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,216
INTO A GIANT BUTTERFLY
WITH SCARY-LOOKING WINGS?

239
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,149
HA! YOU'RE ABOUT
AS USELESS TO ME

240
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,116
AS AN OLD PAIR OF UNDERWEAR

241
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:49,083
THAT'S MADE
OF 100% POISON IVY.

242
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,549
GIVE ME A CHANCE, KEN,
AND YOU WON'T BE --

243
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,749
AND WILL YOU STOP
CALLING ME KEN?

244
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,749
MY NAME IS
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR!

245
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,216
ALL I'M SAYING IS NOW
THAT AGUMON HAS ESCAPED,

246
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,049
I'M ALL YOU'VE GOT.

247
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,183
ENOUGH! HUH?

248
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:04,183
THEY'RE HERE

249
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,156
AND THEY'VE GOT AGUMON.

250
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:10,156
HE'S A USEFUL DIGIMON.

251
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:13,123
BUT, KEN, I AM -- OHH!

252
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,089
WE'LL HAVE COOKIES
AND ICE CREAM.

253
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:17,889
I WANT MINE
WITH CHOCOLATE SPRINKLES.

254
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,489
HOW ENDEARING.

255
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,056
Kari: IT'S KEN.

256
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,523
MY NAME IS
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR!

257
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:26,156
NOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE CALLED KEN, HUH?

258
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,723
HOW'S KENNY OR KENNETH?

259
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:30,189
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO MAKE ME ANGRY.

260
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,656
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PUT AGUMON IN A CAGE

261
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,156
LIKE A WILD ANIMAL.

262
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:37,156
YOU COME DOWN AND TAKE
YOUR MEDICINE LIKE A MAN.

263
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,156
YOU DO AMUSE ME SO.

264
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:42,123
I CAN DEFEAT YOU JUST
AS I DEFEATED AGUMON.

265
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,823
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF, KEN.

266
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,923
YOU'RE THE KIND OF BULLY

267
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,789
THAT GIVES BULLIES
A BAD NAME.

268
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,756
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT,

269
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:53,956

PROTECTS HIM FROM HARM,

BUT IT CONCEALS HIS DESTRUCTIVE
