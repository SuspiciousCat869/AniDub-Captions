Davis: COME ON, GUYS,

479
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,954
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY
TO TAKE THIS GUY OUT.

480
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:25,454
THERE ARE BILLIONS OF HUMANS
AND DIGIMON COUNTING ON US.

481
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,687
Kari: BUT, DAVIS,
WHAT CAN WE DO?

482
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:29,821
THE DARKNESS IS SPREADING
SO QUICKLY.

483
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:32,021
IT'LL TAKE A MIRACLE
TO STOP HIM NOW.

484
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:35,721
[ Thinking ] KARI'S RIGHT.
BUT WHERE CAN I FIND A MIRACLE?

485
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:38,887
WILL MALOMYOTISMON
ENVELOPE BOTH WORLDS

486
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,054
IN HIS SHROUD OF DARKNESS?

487
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,154
FIND OUT ON THE NEXT
"DIGIMON -- DIGITAL MONSTERS."
