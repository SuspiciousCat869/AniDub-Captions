00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,702
DAVIS:
<i>Arukenimon had us</i>

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,937
<i>caught in her</i>
<i>web of evil, literally.</i>

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,006
<i>Our Digimon were under</i>
<i>the spell of her magic flute,</i>

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,808
<i>and she had them</i>
<i>fighting each other.</i>

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,210
<i>Meanwhile, T. K., Kari</i>
<i>and Yolei were fighting off</i>

6
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,512
<i>her insect</i>
<i>Digimon creatures.</i>

7
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,347
<i>Cody helped us escape,</i>

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,982
<i>and then we distorted</i>
<i>the flute to help the others.</i>

9
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,717
<i>That finally broke the spell</i>

10
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,386
<i>and we were able to face</i>
<i>Arukenimon head to head.</i>

11
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,688
<i>Of course we didn't realize</i>
<i>she had a spider's head.</i>

12
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,991
<i>She was actually an</i>
<i>Ultimate Digimon.</i>

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,593
<i>With the help of Paildramon</i>
<i>we managed to capture her,</i>

14
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>but Mummymon put the wraps</i>
<i>on us and they escaped.</i>

ARUKENIMON:
Those Digibrats make me

42
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,759
so tense.

43
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:33,994
I've got to try and relax.

44
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,629
Maybe I should think
happy thoughts.

45
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,565
Let's see, evil spells,
crushing my enemies,

46
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,368
more Control Spires,
less DigiDestined.

47
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,737
Oh, I can't keep those
kids out of my head.

48
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,572
How hard can it be
to get rid of them?

49
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,541
Where did I go wrong?

50
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,715
(Arukenimon grunts)

51
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,950
MUMMYMON:
Oh, there you are.

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,954
Usually a bubble bath
relaxes me

53
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,023
but not this time.

54
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,658
(groaning)

55
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,027
MUMMYMON:
Arukenimon, a rather unusual

56
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,196
place for a tub,
don't you think?

57
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,365
Well, I guess
all you have to do

58
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,667
is build the rest
of the house around it.

59
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,768
(laughs)

60
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,769
Let's do it!

61
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,837
Let's go get 'em!

62
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,172
(T. K. yells)

63
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,440
You're next!

64
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,809
PAILDRAMON:
Desperado Blaster!

♪ Hello! ♪

66
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,782
That sure
does look comfortable.

67
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,320
I haven't had a bath
like that in years.

68
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,189
Do you think that I could‐‐

69
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,791
Would you be quiet?

70
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,793
Can't you see I'm
trying to concentrate?

71
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,262
Those kids are destroying
my supply of Control Spires.

72
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,866
I'll just have
to work faster.

73
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,334
(laughs)

74
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,635
MUMMYMON:
In the meantime,

75
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,936
mind if I take a dip?

76
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,838
FLAMEDRAMON:
Fire Rocket!

77

SHURIMON:
Double Stars!

81
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,015
(spire rumbling)

82
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,450
Awesome!

83
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,519
DIGMON:
Rock Cracking!

84
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,654
(ground cracking)

85
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,591
Digmon, nice job!

86
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,393
PEGASUSMON:

(spire rumbling)

88
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,898
That a boy!

89
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,800
NEFERTIMON:
Rosetta Star!

90

Say cheese, please.

KEN:
I can't believe it.

95
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,949
We're actually
making progress.

96
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,457
That's 147 so far today.

97
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,026
I think we can all
use a break.

98
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,199
Let's eat.

99
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,166
Yeah!

100
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,869
KARI:
I'm thirsty.

101
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,437
Me too.

102
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,672
T. K.:
There was a vending machine

103
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,707
with juice in it
back there a ways.

104
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,077
Well then,
why are we here?

105
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,546
Hopefully it has milk,
preferably in a saucer.

106
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,781
Count me in.

107
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,883
Me too, I'm coming.

108
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,651
Don't worry, we'll
just get something

109
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,953
and bring it back
to you, okay?

110
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:13,920
Huh?

111
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,557
(groans)

112
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,693
Hey, what kind
should we get you?

113
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,863
Whatever.

114
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,466
Davis, what's
the matter with you?

115
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,634
(groans)

116
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,035
Nothing.

117
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,637
VEEMON:
I know when something's wrong,

118
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,905
and something's wrong.

119
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,273
Now what's wrong?

120
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,941
DAVID:
Stop asking me what's wrong!

121
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:35,942
Huh?

122
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,245
Hey Davis, what's wrong?

123
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,913
Huh?

124
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,148
Hi, Yolei.

125
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,549
Are you just gonna
stay up there

126
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,417
and be crabby all day?

127
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,852
Look, I'm not crabby,

128
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,021
get it through your
thick head.

129
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,923
Ah, now there's
the old Davis.

130
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,925
Why don't you come down
here and we'll talk?

131
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,460
Huh?

132
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,462
YOLEI:
It's about Cody and Ken.

133
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,030
Have you noticed they
never talk to each other?

134
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,799
They're not friends.

135
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,101
And it's not like they
argue the way you and I do.

136
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,170
They just don't talk.

137
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,938
Yeah, you're right.

138
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,239
I guess they're still
both a little nervous

139
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,841
around each other.

140
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,343
Well, they can't go on
like this much longer.

141
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,746
Well, what are we
suppose to do about it?

142
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,148
Actually, I've got a plan.

143
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,283
Listen.

144
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,486
It's worth a shot.

145
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,790
Hey Ken, Cody,
I need a hand.

146
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,825
BOTH: Huh?

147
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,829
See that Control Spire
over there?

148
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,664
It's right behind you.

149
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,866
It's seems that Flamedramon
wasn't strong enough

150
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,267
to knock that one down.

151
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,436
Are you nuts?

152
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,771
I can do that
blindfolded!

153
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,472
‐ (Veemon grunting)
‐ YOLEI: Quiet!

154
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,308
It's a plan to get Cody
and Ken to work together.

155
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,176
VEEMON:
Oh! Nevermind.

156
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,382
It's really kinda strange.

157
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,052
Yeah, go figure,
you know?

158
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,620

Wormmon and Armadillomon
seem to be

getting along just fine.

00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,527
(monsters giggling)

167
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,096
Yeah, now if only
Cody and Ken

168
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,664
would act the same way.

169
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,336
That's enough!

170
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,504
You two just worked
together

171
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,039
to destroy
a Control Spire,

172
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,741
why don't you shake hands
and be friends?

173
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,909
CODY: Davis!

174
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,343
What?

175
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,912
I think Flamedramon
could have destroyed

176
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,380
that Control Spire.

177
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,348
I agree with Cody.

178
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,950
Well, now that you
mention it‐‐

179
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,418
Davis, please don't make us

180
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,054
waste our energy
like that again.

181
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,455
Cody, you're so stubborn!

182
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,257
Yolei, stop,
you're not helping.

183
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,494
It seems not every
team member

184
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,895
wants us around Wormmon.

185
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,863
Let's go.

186
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,800
‐ BOTH: But wait!
‐ Ken!

187
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,402
ARMADILLOMON:
Wormmon, where ya going?

188
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,371
(groans)

189
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,539
You!

190
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,175
Cody.

191
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,614
I'm going to need an
all powerful Digimon

192
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,416
if I ever hope to squeeze
the life out

193
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,251
of the DigiDestined.

194
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,755
When I only used
one Control Spire‐‐

195
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,291
(spire humming)

196
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,329
This is what I created.

197
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,400
And then I tried using
10 Control Spires.

198
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,273
Spirit Needle!

199
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,147
And I created this
powerful creature.

200
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,486
And yet neither of them
was sufficient enough

201
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,722
to defeat those kids.

202
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,390
In order to destroy those kids

203
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,193
I'll need to use
100 Control Spires.

204
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,194
MUMMYMON:
If she's going

205
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,795
to use 100 Control Spires

206
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,630
how many hairs
does she need?

207
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,200
Let's see, that's six,
carry the four, minus two,

208
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,634
that would be a hundred.

209
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,536
If you have to use
a hundred hairs

210
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,838
you could get a job
in the circus

211
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,640
as the bald lady.
(laughs)

212
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,342
ARUKENIMON:
And you can join the circus

213
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,277
on the flying trapeze.

214
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,546
(Mummymon yells)
(trees rustling)

215
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,915
(Arukenimon laughs)

216
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,487
MUMMYMON:
Every time she treats me

217
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,721
like that

218
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,358
I feel closer,
and closer to her.

219
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,127
Could this be love
I'm feeling?

220
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,232
(engine revving)

221
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,700
ARUKENIMON: Mummymon!

222
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,403
Would you hurry it up?
We're leaving.

223
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,871
MUMMYMON: I'm coming!

224
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,007

Look at all those
beautiful Control Spires.

230
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,186
I need those eager‐beaver
brats didn't have time

231
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,321

Then you're really
gonna love this.

236
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,571

destroy the DigiDestined,

237
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,973
but also the entire
Digital World.

242
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,724
DAVIS:
And that's the whole story.

243
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,460
He's been up there
ever since.

244
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,397
We're gone 10 minutes
and you cause a mutiny?

245
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,965
Both of them are
so stubborn,

246
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,201
neither one of them
is willing to talk to the other.

247
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,902
I feel sorry for Cody.

248
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,838
I'm sure he feels terrible.

249
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,341
(all sighing)

250
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,012
(juice gurgling)

251
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,416
You know what?

252
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,651
I was thinking,

253
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,353
maybe I should talk
to both of them

254
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,455
about acting their own age.

255
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,424
(choking)

256
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,496
I think I can
straighten them out.

257
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,900
(all laughing)

258
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,304
Alright, what
exactly is so funny?

259
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,407
ALL: Huh?

260
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,645
(dramatic orchestral music)

261
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,114

are you guys mad?

(tires screeching)

263
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,152
You don't have to give
me the silent treatment.

264
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,453
I mean, come on!

265
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,221
Davis, take a look behind you.

266
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,823
Huh?

267
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,092
(maniacal laughing)

268
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,162
Shouldn't you
boys and girls

269
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,063
be home with your
mommies and daddies?

270
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,865
None of your business!

271
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,800
Alright,
what do you want?

272
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,636
I thought you kids
might enjoy

273
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,872
playing with a little
Digimon I put together.

274
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,374
When will you learn?

275
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,642
Every time you try
to fight us,

276
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,277
you end up losing.

277

T. K., what's that?

332
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,831
(air blasting)

333
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,132
(Kari screams)

334
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,501
‐ Ugh!
‐ Kari!

335
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,936
T. K.!

336
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,472
(crashing and groaning)

337
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,208
(crashing and groaning)

338
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,977
(dramatic orchestral music)

339
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,551
PEGASUSMON:
I know who that is.

340
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,955
NEFERTIMON:
It's BlackWarGreymon.

341
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,126
(dramatic orchestral music)

342
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,666
(yelling mightily)

343
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,508
DIGIVICE:
BlackWarGreymon is

344
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,477
a Mega‐Digimon who looks
like WarGreymon

345
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,011
but he's pure evil.

346
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,047
His Terra Destroyer attack
releases a concentration

347
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,249
of 100% negative energy.

348
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,284
BlackWarGreymon?

349
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,519
It can't be.

350
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,055
It is.

351
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,324
But I don't know
how it's possible.

352
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,094
What should we do Ankylomon?

353
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,764
I'd say protecting
the kids is high on the list.

354
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,599
I agree, wholeheartedly.

355
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,835
(growling)

356
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,275
(claw scraping)

357
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,577
(ExVeemon groaning)
(ground rumbles)

358
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,614
(Digimon thuds)

359
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,549
(both laughing)

360
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,220
(fists thudding)
(monsters grunting)

361
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,222
He's too strong for them!

362
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,091
They need more help, now!

363
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,893
Paildramon is
the only one who

364
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,594
is strong enough
to help.

365
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,230
That's it then,
we have to call Ken.

366
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,899
(Digivice beeping)

367
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,901
STINGMON:
Finally, I'm good at something.

368
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:37,970
KEN: Email.

369
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,872
It's from Yolei.

370
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,574
STINGMON:
What does she want, Ken?

371
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,775
YOLEI:
I don't want to mess up

372
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,310
the dynamics of your team.

373
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,578
Worrying about our team

374
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,946
is the least
of our problems.

375
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,781
CODY:
I say forget about Ken.

376
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,983
We never needed him before,
and we don't need him now.

377
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,118
We can do this on
our own.

378
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,252
You're wrong.

379
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,821
Both of you,
knock it off.

380
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,656
You're acting like
a couple of 12 year olds.

381
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,024
You know what I mean.

382
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,425
Aquilamon!

383
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,993
You called?

384
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,995
We're gonna find Ken
and bring him back.

385
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,797
Hold the fort until then.

386
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:05,865
Right!

387
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,000
(BlackWarGreymon growling)

388
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,237
I have created
a magnificent specimen.

389
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,573
If I do say so myself.

390
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,808
(Ankylomon groaning)
(BlackWarGreymon growling)

391
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,180
‐ Ken?
‐ Huh?

392
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,449
Are you sure
you don't want to go?

393
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,650
Go where?

394
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,185
You know where.

395
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,454
Davis and the others
called you, didn't they?

396
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,823
I don't know what
you're talking about.

397
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,059
Hey, Ken, it's me!

398
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,894
Huh? Yolei?
What are you doing here?

399
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,362
You have to hurry.

400
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,698
Arukenimon made this
really strong Digimon,

401
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,166
we need Paildramon.

402
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,237
STINGMON: Ken!

403
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,707
Yolei, I can't go.

404
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,708
You must!

405
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,775
I'm sorry.

406
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,810
Why you!

407
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,044
(screams)

408
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,180
(hand slaps)

409
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,153
KARI:
It's Ken and Yolei.

410
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,321
I'm sorry
I slapped you,

411
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,756
but you needed
to wake up.

412
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,324
(Ken groans)

413
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,926
(ExVeemon groans)
(ground shakes)

414
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,828
(BlackWarGreymon snarling)

415
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,430
Let's keep fighting.

416
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,366
I'm sure that Stingmon
will show up soon.

417
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,835
Right.

418
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,904
BlackWarGreymon,
it's time!

419
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,872
Finish them off
once and for all.

420
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,708
(monsters growling)

421
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,510
Arukenimon is your master.

422
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,145
You must do what
she tells you.

423
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,851
Davis, I brought Stingmon
and Ken to give us a hand.

424
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,085
Alright!

425
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,123
Let's get to work.

426
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,325
DIGITAL VOICE:
Digimon.

427
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,762
ExVeemon.

428
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,499
Stingmon

429
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,570
BOTH:
DNA Digivolve to

430
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,775
Paildramon!

431
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,776
♪ Digimon ♪

432
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,877
♪ Digital Monsters ♪

433
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,278
♪ Digimon ♪

434
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,047
(Paildramon growling)

435
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,448
BlackWarGreymon,

436
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,750
I've seen this
mutant Digimon before.

437
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,619
I want you to show him
who's the most powerful

438
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,921
Digimon in the entire
Digital World.

439
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,457
(BlackWarGreymon growls)

440
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,793
This is gonna get ugly.

441
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,395
(crashing)
(grunting)

442
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,598
Wow, talk about
meeting head to head.

443
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,932
We're gonna need
an aspirin the size

444
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,867
of a Control Spire
after this fight.

445
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,806
Desperado Blaster!

446
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,708
(lasers firing)

447
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,845
(rocks rumbling)

448
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,254
Uh‐oh.

449
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,923
(laughing maniacally)

450
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,492
Look, there's not even
a scratch on him.

451
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,793
Impossible.

452
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,662
DAVIS:
Paildramon was our only chance.

453
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,797
Now what do we do?

454
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,899
(Arukenimon chuckles)

455
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,570
(gasping)

456
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,905
Let's get out of here!

457
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,447
(explosion thundering)

458
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,319
(DigiDestined groaning)

459
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,961
(BlackWarGreymon stomps)

460
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,864
(growling)

461
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,202
You have done an outstanding
job, BlackWarGreymon.

462
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,905
You may now proceed
to destroy the Digital World.

463
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,642
MUMMYMON:
Don't just stand there,

464
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,943
patting yourself
on the back,

465
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,513
your master has
given you new orders.

466
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,615
Now get to work!

467
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,018
BLACKWARGREYMON:
I will take orders from no one.

468
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,887
BOTH: You what?

469
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,221
BLACKWARGREYMON:
Why should I take orders

470
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,258
from you when you're so
weak you need me

471
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,527
to do your fighting
for you?

472
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,063
I must find a more
worthy opponent.

473
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,331
(loud soaring)

474
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,499
(Arukenimon groans)

475
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,034
MUMMYMON: Arukenimon!

476
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,469
Can you hear me?

477
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,337
Speak to me, my darling.

478
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,605
(Arukenimon grumbles)

479
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,977
(dramatic orchestral music)

480
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,679
(Arukenimon groans)

481
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,347
NARRATOR:
<i>How can the DigiDestined</i>

482
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,183
<i>handle BlackWarGreymon</i>
<i>and Arukenimon</i>
