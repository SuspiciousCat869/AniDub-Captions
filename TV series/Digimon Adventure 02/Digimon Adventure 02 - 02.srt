00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:05,570
Davis: <i>THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,</i>
<i>I MET THIS NEW KID T.K.,</i>
<i>WHO I THINK</i>
<i>HAS A THING FOR KARI.</i>

2
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:07,837
<i>THEN IZZY SHOWS UP,</i>
<i>AND I FIND OUT</i>

3
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:09,670
<i>TAI'S IN TROUBLE</i>
<i>IN THE DIGITAL WORLD.</i>

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,270
<i>YOLEE, CODY, AND I GOT</i>
<i>THESE COOL NEW DIGIVICES,</i>

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,637
<i>BUT ONLY KARI AND T.K. AND I</i>
<i>GOT TO GO THROUGH THE GATE.</i>

6
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,104
<i>I COULDN'T BELIEVE</i>
<i>ALL THOSE DIGIMON.</i>

7
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:18,204
<i>WE FOUND</i>
<i>THE DIGI-EGG OF COURAGE,</i>

8
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:21,070
BUT ONLY I WAS ABLE TO LIFT IT,
<i>NATURALLY.</i>

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,070
<i>THAT'S WHEN I MET V-MON,</i>
<i>WHICH IS GOOD.</i>

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,070
<i>HE TAUGHT ME</i>
<i>HOW TO OPEN THE DIGI-EGG.</i>

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,537
<i>FLADRAMON IS RAD,</i>

12
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:30,537
<i>BUT THAT EVIL DIGIMON EMPEROR</i>
<i>LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF TROUBLE.</i>

WHERE ARE WE?

37
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,644
THIS IS THE COMPUTER ROOM.

38
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,944
HEY, WHEN YOU GUYS
CAME THROUGH THE COMPUTER,

39
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,777
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

40
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:40,477
THE DIGITAL WORLD.
THAT PLACE IS THE COOLEST EVER.

41
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:41,544
THERE WE WERE,

42
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,744
WHEN SUDDENLY A DINOSAUR-LIKE
DIGIMON ATTACKED.

43
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:45,744
THAT'S WHEN
I JUMPED NTO ACTION.

44
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:47,444
ENOUGH! LET'S GO BACK.

45
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,710
I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
EXCITEMENT FOR ONE DAY.

46
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,577
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD, CODY?

47
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:54,844
SEEING ALL THOSE MONSTERS
AND STUFF WOULD BE FUN,

48
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,177
BUT TONIGHT'S MACARONI
AND CHEESE NIGHT AT MY HOUSE

49
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:59,177
AND I DON'T WANT
TO MISS OUT.

50
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:00,950
IT'S PORK SURPRISE
AT MY PLACE.

51
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,584
STUFFED
GREEN PEPPERS.

52
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:04,417
TV DINNERS
IN THE MICROWAVE.

53
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:06,917
NO FAIR.
I WANT TO GO!

54
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:09,117
DON'T WORRY, YOLEE,
YOU'LL GET A CHANCE.

55
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,650
WHEN?

56
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,850
OOPS, I ALMOST FORGOT
TO TURN OFF THE COMPUTER.

57
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,584
THE GATE'S CLOSED.

58
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:19,517
Boy: LEAVING ALREADY, MATT?
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH REHEARSAL.

59
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,717
O . THEAÃSOME
<i>TAKE</i>
I'VE GO

60
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:23,517
HERE HE COMES.

61
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,650
I'M L
SR HY, VER

62
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:36,484
I WONDER WHAT
IT'S REALLY LIKE

63
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,650
TO ACTUALLY TRAVEL
INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

64
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,117
I DON'T CARE
IF THEY DON'T WANT ME.

65
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:48,117
TOMORROW I'M GOING
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

66
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:50,117
Woman: YOLEE, ARE YOU
STAYING FOR DINNER?

67
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,484
NO, BUT THANKS ANYWAY.
I HAVE TO GET GOING.

68
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:59,117
BOY, I JUST CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT V-MON.

69
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,457
DIGI-ARMOR ENERGIZE, HUH?

70
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,424
IT WAS A FORM OF DIGEVOLVING
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

71
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:06,724
SOMEHOW, DAVIS' DIGIMON
WAS ABLE TO DIGEVOLVE,

72
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:09,390
BUT AGUMON AND THE OTHERS
WEREN'T.

73
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,657
DAVIS FROM THE SOCCER CLUB
WENT TO THE DIGITAL WORLD?

74
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:15,624
THAT'S RIGHT, AND THE TWO KIDS
FROM MY APARTMENT BUILDING --

75
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:17,624
YOLEE AND CODY --
ALSO GOT NEW DIGIVICES.

76
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:21,524
IF HEY@HAV DIGIVICES, THAT
MEANS THEY ARE DIIDESTIND.

77
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,357
THAT'S JUST WHAT I THOUGHT.

78
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:26,724
I
D
EPRR AÃ OE Q

79
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,757
AND MAKING THEM HIS SLAVES,

80
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,524
WILL BIYOMON AND THE OTHERS
BE OKAY?

81
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:34,557
<i>I</i>
F I GT A -AL ERIR

82
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:37,457
SHE WAS ASKING
THE SAME QUESTION.

83
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:40,724
I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST GO THERE

84
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,490
AND DO THINGS OUR WAY.

85
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,490
WE CAN'T. I WENT BACK
TO CHECK THE COMPUTER,

86
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,457
AND THE GATE
WAS ALREADY CLOSED.

87
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,890
THAT MEANS
WE CAN'T HELP THEM?

88
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:55,024
AND CHECK THE COMPUTER

89
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:57,524
TO SEE IF THE GATE
HAS OPENED UP AGAIN.

90
00:03:57,624 --> 00:03:59,490
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

91
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,464
AND SO AM I.

92
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:02,930
M-M.

93
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,864
MM-HMM.

94
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:10,297
MY BAND'S GOT
A BIG CONCERT COMING UP.

95
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,864
WE HAVE TO PRACTICE.

96
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,830
DONT WORRY ABOUT IT GUYS. JUST
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO US.

97
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,997
OKAY, BUT LET US KNOW
IF YOU NEED US.

98
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,259
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
IT'S STILL CLOSED.

99
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,459
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

100
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,525
IZZY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

101
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,092
OH, HI. I WAS TRYING
TO GET MORE INFORMATION

102
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,725
ON WHAT HAPPENED HERE
YESTERDAY.

103
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,458
I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.
I KEPT THINKING ABOUT IT.

104
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:42,292
IZZY, WILL YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD?

105
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:45,192
I CAN'T BECAUSE
THE GATE'S NO-- HUH?

106
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,459
LOOK, IT'S OPEN!

107
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,092
HOW'S IT GOING,
GUYS?
HI, EVERYBODY.

108
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,125
THOSE ARE THE NEW DIGIVICES?
HOW COOL.

109
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,259
THOSE WERE RELEASED
FROM THE DIGI-EGG

110
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,059
WHEN I TOUCHED IT.

111
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,392
WHAT ARE WE STANDING
AROUND FOR? LET'S GET GOING.

112
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,199
HOLD IT. I SHOULD GIVE
YOU A COUPLE OF POINTERS

113
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,432
ABOUT THE THINGS
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE.

114
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:08,032
GIVE ME A BREAK.
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN THERE ONCE.

115
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:10,332
I THINK WE SHOULD
BE PREPARED FOR DANGER.

116
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:13,999
MY SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED.
I CHECKED THE OTHER COMPUTERS.

117
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:16,299
NONE OF THEM SEEMS
TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS.

118
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,265
THE GATE IS ONLY OPEN
ON THIS ONE. THAT'S NOT ALL.

119
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,732
THE GATE HAS NEVER BEEN OPEN
TWO DAYS IN A ROW BEFORE.

120
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,532
THEN I SAY WE GET GOING.

121
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,499
ALL ASHORE
THAT'S GOING ASHORE.

122
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,432
All: MM-HMM.

123
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:31,699
Man: TAI KAMEA,
IS THAT YOU?

124
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,665
WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

125
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,165
Tai: MR. FUJIAMA.

126
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:37,365
AND SORA AND IZZY
ARE HERE AS WELL.

127
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,065
DIDN'T YOU ALL GRADUATE?

128
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,399
YEAH, WE DID, AND WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

129
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,732
I'M THE NEW HEAD
OF THE COMPUTER CLUB.

130
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,732
Sora and Tai: BUT WHAT DO
YOU KNOW ABOUT USING COMPUTERS?

131
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:49,032
NOT A SINGLE THING.

132
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,532
I JUST REMEMBERED
THERE'S SOMETHING

133
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:52,632
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

134
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,065
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

135
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,499
SURE, WHAT IS IT?

136
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,332
UH, I'VE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS
ADJUSTING TO HIGH SCHOOL.

137
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:01,199
IT'S THE GIRLS.
THEY'RE SO MUCH OLDER.

138
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,172
THANKS, TAI. WE OWE YOU.

139
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,139
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET GOING.

145
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:24,572
Tai: I FEEL LIKE I WENT
THROUGH THE RINSE CYCLE

146
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:26,172
OF THE DISHWASHER.

147
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:30,139
WOW, SO THIS IS
THE DIGITAL WORLD. HEY, WAIT.

148
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,605
I'M WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES,
AND THEY'RE COMFORTABLE, TOO.

149
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,072
HEY, I'M DRESSED LIKE I'M
PART OF THE COOL CROWD.

150
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,005
I FORGOT ABOUT
A NEW WARDROBE.

151
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:41,972
I LOVE THIS HELMET. IT MAKES
MY GLASSES LOOK SMALLER.

152
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,039
I WONDER IF THEY HAVE
A SURFER STYLE.

153
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,039

EVERY TIME WE COME BACK?

471
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,680
Patamon: I THOUGHT
DIGEVOLVING WAS A TOUGH JOB.

472
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,680
Matt: AT LEAST WE MADE IT
BACK SAFE AND SOUND.

473
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,680
Sora: EXCEPT BIYOMON
AND TENTOMON.

474
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,513
<i>We'll both be safe here</i>

475
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:07,980
<i>because the digimon emperor</i>
<i>never comes out at night.</i>

476
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,586
<i>Imagine -- all that power</i>
<i>and he's afraid of the dark.</i>

477
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:14,053
WELL, GET SOME REST.
YOU'LL NEED IT FOR TOMORROW.

478
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:16,420
Davis: WE'LL GO BACK
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD

479
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,720
AND BEAT THAT DIGIMON EMPEROR
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

480
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,386
REALLY? WELL, EXCUSE ME

481
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,353
IF I DON'T START
SHAKING IN MY BOOTS.

482
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:26,353
<i>WHAT DOES THE DIGIMON EMPEROR</i>
<i>HAVE IN STORE</i>

483
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:28,353
<i>FOR THE NEW DIGIDESTINED?</i>

484
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:32,553
<i>FIND OUT ON THE NEXT</i>
<i>"DIGIMON -- DIGITAL MONSTERS."</i>
