1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,136
We all made it back home in
one piece and without jet lag.

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,372
Good thing too because
Arukenimon and Mummymon

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,840
were busy while we were gone.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,842
They kidnapped kids
from all over the city

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,545
and then strange Digimon
started popping up everywhere.

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,013
These Digimon weren't
just confused,

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,481
they were actually evil.

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,883
But they didn't seem
to be any happier

9
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,518
with Arukenimon than we were.

10
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,354
The older Digimon gave their
power to Imperialdramon

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,122
so he could Digiball
to his fighter mode.

12
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,624
But unfortunately,

13
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:24,791
he couldn't just
send SkullSatamon

14
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,293
back to the digital world

15
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,928
and he was attacking a
whole busload of kids.

16
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,531

bad habit of mine.

50

these kids go free!

Oh that?

necessarily, don't you think?

heard all about you.

You're smart and
you rule at sports.

60

I bet you could do
just about anything

62

It'd be awesome to be like that.

63
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,827
Then I met this
man and he told me

64
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,329
he knew a way I could do it.

65
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,830
What man?

66

can't blame me can you?

Would you mind giving
me a little boost?

You must have some reason

for keeping me tied
up like a pretzel?

197

Ever since I first saw you,

198
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,957
I knew you had
something special.

199

A dark spirit deep inside.

200
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,360
If I planted the Dark Spore,

201

I knew that it would
be able to grow.

It's a magnificent device.

205

It makes a person smarter
and better at sports.

206

Well, that's powerful if
you really think about it.

207

These kids were excited
when I told them

208
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,546
what the Dark Spore had
to offer, right kids?

209
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,249
Hmm, they believed me and
want to be just like you,

210
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,986
so I had you brought here in
order to grant them their wish.

211
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,320
The Spore planted inside you

found fertile soil
in which to grow.

213
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,226
I'm going to borrow some of it
to implant in these children.

You have plenty.

that will be transferred
electronically.

beautiful music together.

(bats chirping and fluttering)

327
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,465
(screams)

328
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,602
What's the matter, got
bats in your belfry? (laughs)

329
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,671
Hold on!

330
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:37,009
(dramatic orchestral music)

331
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,945
Kachina Bombs!

332
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,581
(grunts)

333
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:45,151
Don't get me mad, I don't
want to have to hurt you.

334
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,426
(electric shocks)

335
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,061
Go Shakkoumon!

336
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,397
That's the way,
we're counting on you!

337
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,565
You're the only one that
can stop MarineDevimon!

338
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,072
(crashes)

339
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,707
(gasping)

340
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,642
[Man] He must've come
from a costume party.

341
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,210
[Man with Blue Hat]
Hey, you okay?

342
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,547
I'm fine (grunts),
but get me outta here.

343
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,716
How humiliating!

344
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,852
Wow, I bet she was at
the costume party too

345
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,254
and won first prize.

346
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,755
[Man with Blue Hat] Sweet.

347
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,257
[Silphymon] Watch
it, she's dangerous!

348
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,691
I don't get it, dude!

349
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,959
(LadyDevimon laughs)
She's too pretty.

350
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,128
Stay away!

351
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,664
This is convenient, do
you like being my shield?

352
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,100
(grunts)

353
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,436
(dramatic orchestral music)

354
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,806
(monster grunting)

355
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,575
(tires screeching)

356
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,076
[Wormmon] Where do you
think they're taking him?

357
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,645
I gotta pretty good idea.

358
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,646
Where?

359
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,080
It's nearby.

360
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,849
What's it called?

361
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,984
Heightened View Terrace,
that's the place where Kari

362
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,987
and Tai first got a
look at a Digimon.

363
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,490
They say that it's an
entry to the Digital World.

364
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,826
Oh no, do you think Arukenimon

365
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,361
and the others know about it?

366
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,796
[Oikawa] I think
Heightened View Terrace

367
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,531
is much to cheery of a name.

368
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,233
Hmm?

369
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,769
Huh, I say they rename it
Dark View Terrace instead.

370
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,138
That's much more appropriate.

371
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,775
I'm surprised, I thought
you'd appreciate my humor.

372
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,110
I suppose you think you're
a superior human being.

373
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,449
Well, you should
think again. (laughs)

374
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,253
The face of disdain, look how
he turns his nose up at us.

375
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,055
You can learn something
from all this, kids.

376
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,058
This is an example of
how your exalted hero

377
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,595
gives the cold shoulder to
those less worthy than himself.

378
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,698
(laughs)

379
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:39,932
(sighs)

380
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,901
(zapping)

381
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,537
(grunts)

382
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,573
(laughs and grunts)
What you waiting for?

383
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,808
A written invitation, come on!

384
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,376
Give me your best shot!

385
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,879
Hey, wait, whatever I
did, I didn't mean it.

386
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,147
Well, if you're just
going to sit there,

387
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,185
I'll go home and file
my fangs, so bye‐bye.

388
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,287
No! (grunts)

389
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,189
(smashes)

390
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,690
[Kari] Yolei!

391
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,059
Stop that! What's
the matter with you!

392
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,528
He's just an innocent kid!

393
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,530
That's called fighting
dirty, coward!

394
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,231
Watch it, Yolei! Be careful!

395
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,866
You think I'm a coward?

396
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,003
You humans are so pathetic

397
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,273
with your honor and
your compassion.

398
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,841
I'll show you honor.

399
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,943
I'll win!

400
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,044
(Yolei gasps)

401
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,579
You won't stand in my way.

402
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,016
No, Yolei! (screams)

403
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,389
You asked for it!

404
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,190
(Kari and Yolei scream)

405
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,831
Huh? Oh no.

406
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,043
You have to understand,
I didn't have a choice.

407
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,745
You were in great danger.

408
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,981
You vaporized her.

409
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,016
She's finished.

410
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,418
I made a mistake.

411
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,420
[Man] Dude, are you okay?

412
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,623
[Man with Blue Hat] Oh man,
what just happened there?

413
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,091
(men conversing)

414
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,593
It was the right thing to do.

415
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,262
You saved that guy's life.

416
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,196
Oh.

417
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,404
‐ Hmm.
‐ Hmm.

418
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,508
(dramatic orchestral music)

419
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,678
(people screaming)

420
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,246
This is bad.

421
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,749
The patients inside are
going to need some help.

422
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,217
We've got to get in there.

423
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,553
Please, Shakkouman,
move away from here.

424
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,122
(people screaming)

425
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,790
(Shakkouman grunting)

426
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,460
We have to do something
before someone gets hurt.

427
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,128
Let's go.

428
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,830
There's no sense wasting
more time just sitting here.

429
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,802
I actually gave up
a medical career.

430
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,205
Who'd believe I'm here
doing what I'm doing.

431
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,273
This just proves you
don't have to be a doctor

432
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,376
to make an important
difference and save lives.

433
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,977
Yeah.

434
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,312
[Cody Voiceover] My dad was
a police officer.

435
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,114
He saved lots of lives too.

436
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,684
I bet he'd be really
proud if he saw me now.

437
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,919
(wailing)

438
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,022
[Cody] Shakkoumon!

439
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,257
Justice Beam!

440
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,694
(whirring)

441
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,897
He's completely gone.

442
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,099
You destroyed it, Digimon.

443
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,502
You really destroyed him.

444
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,303
[Doctor] Thank you so
much for all your help.

445
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,638
I don't know what
we would have done

446
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,606
if you hadn't come along.

447
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,710
Thanks a lot.

448
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,479
Come on, Ace. Let's go.

449
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,715
Oh, yeah.

450
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,383
Bye.

451
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,918
[Cody Voiceover] It seemed
like the right thing

452
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,220
to do at the time,
Dad, but I don't know.

453
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,023
I just hope it really was.

454
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,793
(tires screeching)

455
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,062
Isn't that kid
getting saddle sore yet?

456
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,130
Speed up, Raidramon.
You can do it!

457
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,898
Right!

458
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,770
You think you're so smart.

459
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,205
How'd you like
to do the rumba?

460
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,175
(tires screeching)

461
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,076
Don't worry, you two.

462
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,510
I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,745
Just hold on tight.

464
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,780
You are completely useless.

465
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,215
(gasps)

466
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,717
Huh?

467
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,585
(whirring)

468
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,489
‐ Who's that guy?
‐ Don't ask me.

469
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,226
[Narrator] Who is Daemon?

470
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,096
Will the Dark Spore
grow and spread?

471
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:35,167
Find out in the next episode
of Digimon: Digital Monsters.

472
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:42,174
(kids laughing)
(playful tune)

473
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:48,681
(upbeat techno)
