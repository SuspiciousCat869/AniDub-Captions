1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,466
We found tons and tons of
control spires

2
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,366
so we decided not to leave

3
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:07,000
again until we destroy the
Digimon Emperor's headquarters.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,933
We told our parents we
were going camping and

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,433
the older kids went for
real to cover for us.

6
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:16,233
The Digimon Emperor's
base had vanished and
Yolei went ballistic.

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:20,366
She and Hawkmon were
attacked by Dokugumon and
Hawkmon was badly hurt.

8
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:24,366
Yolie felt so bad, she
told us to go on and look
for the base without her.

9
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:28,333
Hawkmon woke up, and they
saw the Digimon Emperor's
base floating in the sky.

10
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,266
If he can make his
base fly, who knows
what else he can do?!

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,173
(snoring)

27
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:35,873
Does Davis always
snore like that?

28
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,040
Every night.

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,006
How do you sleep?

30
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:40,006
I don't.

31
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:45,206
Where are those
guys going?

32
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:49,340
I still think we
should have told the
others before we left.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,506
It may be none of my
beeswax, but why didn't you

34
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:53,473
ask Davis to come with us?

35
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:56,373
I didn't want to leave Kari
and Yolei alone anymore.

36
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:58,273
Don't worry,
he'll understand.

37
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:02,813
I'm just glad I'm not going
to be the one to tell him.

38
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:06,213
The e-mail says they've figured
out which way the Digimon
Emperor is heading.

39
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:07,513
Let's see.

40
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:10,880
What do you mean they
left without me?

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,713
How come nobody wants
to go anywhere with me?

42
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,513
Well, Davis, it could
be your snoring.

43
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:17,179
Is it finished yet, Master?

44
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,480
Not quite. I still have a
few minor details.

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,113
Should he have
four arms or six?

46
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,913
Decisions, decisions.

47
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:25,746
(slurp)

48
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,613
We're getting an
update from Kari.

49
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,713
Any of you guys know
how to catch a fish?

50
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,913
(sighs)
I wish I had a T.V. dinner.

51
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:42,213
Alright. All I have to
do, is take the bus, to
the campsite, and Matt.

52
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,180
Wait! Don't go!
I want to get on!

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Should we tell Davis
we're leaving?

54
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,780
Nah, he'll understand.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,313
Why's everyone leaving?
Is it my snoring?

56
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:52,180
We've been flying for hours
and haven't seen a thing.

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,646
I'll check with Cody and
see if he's seen anything.

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,113
What did TK say?

59
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,553
They haven't spotted
anything from up above.

60
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:03,920
Well, we haven't
seen much of anything
either, except seaweed.

61
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,953
Maybe we should turn back.

62
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,753
Huh?

63
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:10,120
What <i>is</i> that thing?

64
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,553
Let's dig a little further.

65
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,420
This thing is enormous.

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,486
It makes Texas look
like Rhode Island!

67
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,786
It has to be the
Digimon Emperor's base!

68
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:24,020
I'll let TK know
that we found it.

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,753
Huh?

70
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,953
It's from Cody.

71
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:29,820
They found the base
and are going to try

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,386
and sneak in through
an underwater cave.

73
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,020
That sounds kind
of dangerous.

74
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,353
Maybe they should wait.

75
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:39,453
TK, look!

76
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,353
Huh?

77
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,486
A whirlpool.

78
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:48,453
Oh, no. They'll get
sucked right into it!

79
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,715
Hmm, looks like
it's finally here.

80
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:02,515
What is that,
Master, a new way to
hypnotize your slaves?

81
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,221
No, you fool.

82
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:07,288
You might call it a
gateway to the source of
the powers of darkness.

83
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:11,355
But for simplicity's
sake, let's just call
it the Dark Pool.

84
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:15,155
I think it's caused by an
evil digimon, and if I
can tap into it's power,

85
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,421
then I'll have everything
I need to complete my
very own Digimon.

86
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,321
Please, Master,
don't do it!

87
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:23,121
What are you
talking about, of
course I'll do it.

88
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,021
But it feels like
evil itself is coming
from that Dark Pool.

89
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,355
You can't feel
it, because you're
not a Digimon.

90
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:29,888
Don't be ridiculous.

91
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:32,688
I'm not going to stop my
master plan because of a
silly feeling of yours.

92
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:36,721
But on the evil scale of
one to ten, that dark
pool is really evil.

93
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,821
(laughs)
Fine.

94
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,288
Then you stay
away from it.

95
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,588
In the meantime, I've
got things to do.

96
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:43,255
Please don't ignore me.

97
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,755
Oh, I'm sorry how's this?

98
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,388
A huge whirlpool?

99
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:53,755
And Cody and Submarimon
are inside the base?

100
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:54,921
We've got to warn them!

101
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,155
Try to contact
them with the D3!

102
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,555
Don't you think I've
tried that already?

103
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,521
Something seems to be
blocking the transmission.

104
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:06,428
We can't just hover here.
We've got to do something!

105
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,861
Tentomon's right.
We're running out of time!

106
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:09,795
Yeah.

107
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,561
Are you guys feeling okay?

108
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:15,495
Well, I think I might
be getting a bug, but,
other than that, I'm fine.

109
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,961
I am feeling a
little strange.

110
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,428
How about you, TK?

111
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,395
I'm not really sure.

112
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:32,161
I... I feel kinda weird.

113
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,395
I'm tired.

114
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:36,461
Don't they have an
escalator in this place?

115
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:37,828
Whoa!

116
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,428
My thoughts exactly.

117
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:47,628
This has to be
the engine room.

118
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,361
I say we destroy this
place once and for all.

119
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:52,928
We will but, let's take
a look around first.

120
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,161
Alright, if you say so.

121
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,761
Hey, do you think it's
kinda cold in here?

122
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,128
Not especially.

123
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:02,835
That's weird Cause I just
can't seem to warm up.

124
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:04,401
The chill of evil
is in the air.

125
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:05,801
Don't be so dramatic.

126
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,268
You know what
this place needs...

127
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,601
More window space.

128
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,201
There!

129
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,668
Master I know you hardly
ever listen to me.

130
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:15,201
Okay, you never
listen to me.

131
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,868
But, please, just this
once, do what I ask.

132
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,235
Don't do it!

133
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:22,901
Hmm. I'm sorry
I wasn't listening,
did you say something?

134
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,801
Look, it's on the move.

135
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,935
And heading for
the whirlpool.

136
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,168
Cody.

137
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,701
We're moving!

138
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,568
Armadillomon, look!
This place is like a prison.

139
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,735
It must be where the
Digimon Emperor keeps all
of his captured slaves.

140
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:42,768
I guess you guys didn't
have a very good lawyer.

141
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:44,401
So what are we going
to do about them?

142
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,301
This is more important
than the engine room.

143
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,401
You'd better armor
digivolve and break
the bars open.

144
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,001
Now that's a good idea.

145
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,635
Digiarmor... Huh?

146
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,368
What is <i>that</i> thing?

147
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,735
My thoughts precisely.

148
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,035
(evil laugh)

149
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:04,275
Now, into the dark whirlpool.

150
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,941
(more evil laughter)

151
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,808
Ah, it's not that funny.

152
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,308
Thanks for the lift, Grandpa.

153
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:14,608
I can't believe they
left without taking me.

154
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,775
So, you're going camping?
That's nice.

155
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,741
We used to do lots of
camping, didn't we dear?

156
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:23,008
Yeah, until that time I
used poison ivy instead
of toilet paper.

157
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:26,241
Huh?
(sighs)

158
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,875
Davis, what are you doing?

159
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:33,141
I'm thinking about how
we can make a canoe
out of this tree.

160
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:35,375
Great!
How are we gonna do it?

161
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:36,875
First, we gotta
push this tree down.

162
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:41,375
A little too hard.

163
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,475
Beats a canoe.

164
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,875
Ah!

165
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,308
Smell that salt air.

166
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:52,741
Hey Davis, how come
we're on land and
I'm getting seasick?

167
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,481
That's the biggest mobile
home I've ever seen.

168
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,448
It must be impossible
to find parking.

169
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:07,715
Come on guys, we've got to
find the cave that Cody

170
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:10,381
and Armadillomon
used to get inside.

171
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,581
Hurry up, they
might be in trouble.

172
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:19,148
(scary howling)

173
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,248
This place feels... evil.

174
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,815
Don't pay any
attention to them.
What are those things?

175
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,315
They're just trying
to scare you.

176
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:27,748
They live in
the dark whirlpool
and feed off fear.

177
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:31,881
(scary howling)

178
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:34,681
Don't look at it!

179
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,781
Can I sit up here
with you guys?

180
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:41,281
Look... this has
to be the cave!

181
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,615
Hmm?

182
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,081
Master?

183
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,081
Hmm?

184
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,748
Are you all right?

185
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:56,181
Never been better.
Initiate the attack!

186
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:10,888
(scream)

187
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:12,455
What's going on?

188
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:16,288
(scream)

189
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,521
They're gone!

190
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:19,321
How'd that happen?

191
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,255
Sector A, report.

192
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,755
Sector B, come in.

193
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,921
Sector C, where
is everybody?

194
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:30,655
They were never very
good at spelling.

195
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:32,221
(growl)

196
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,255
Where are you going?

197
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,355
If you want something done
right, do it yourself.

198
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,388
This one's stuck.

199
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,388
Oops.

200
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:44,821
Cody!

201
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,188
Hi guys, I'm glad you're
here, we were just
setting these captive

202
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:48,388
digimon free.

203
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,821
Why didn't you say so,
that's my specialty!

204
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,555
Super Shocker!

205
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,328
I can just tell, there's
something out there.

206
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,361
Master, please come back.
You don't know what's out there.

207
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,228
Quiet!

208
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:24,728
Devimon!

209
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,828
(laugh)

210
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:35,031
Impossible!

211
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:44,064
I'll take what I need
from this digimon,

212
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:46,131
then my digimon
will be completed!

213
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,264
Are you sure?

214
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,697
Huh?

215
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:52,597
Do you really believe
you can control the
powers of darkness?

216
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,397
Alright, who are you?

217
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:58,131
I am here to warn you:
beware the darkness.

218
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,597
(evil laughs)

219
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,564
Beware the darkness?

220
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,764
Ha, I'm the
digimon emperor.

221
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,237
I rule this world and
some voice comes out of
nowhere and tells me to

222
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,437
beware the darkness?

223
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,604
Who does he think
he's kidding?

224
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,204
(big laugh)

225
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:17,737
Of all the digimon that
are out there, why did
it have to be Devimon?

226
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:20,204
I'll never forget our
battle four years ago.

227
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,471
Angemon faced
Devimon one on one.

228
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:25,437
It was our last chance to defeat
Devimon, once and for all.

229
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:26,771
Be careful!

230
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,771
(Laughs)
I'll get him, relax.

231
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:32,337
Angemon knew what
he had to do.

232
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:34,337
Ohhh! Ahhh!

233
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:38,137
The only way to completely
destroy Devimon's evil powers

234
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,671
was for Angemon to
sacrifice himself.

235
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:48,871
Come here pretty boy!

236
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:50,737
I begged him
not to do it.

237
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:56,004
But, we both knew
there was no choice.

238
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:58,371
I always felt that
it was my fault.

239
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:01,604
That maybe I could've
done something.

240
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,504
But, it was too late.

241
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,311
I was too young back then
to know how to handle it.

242
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,044
Too young to understand.

243
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:12,111
Well, that was then
and this is now!

244
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:12,977
Huh?

245
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:14,311
Are you okay, TK?

246
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,644
Cody, I've got some
unfinished business
to take care of.

247
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,577
Time to get to work!

248
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:20,711
TK, wait a minute!

249
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:24,044
TK!

250
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,377
Where's he off to?

251
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,477
Uh...
Maybe we should
follow him?

252
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,644
Don't worry, Patamon will
take care of TK.

253
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,544
We need to keep working
to free these digimon!

254
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,577
You're right.

255
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:37,944
How could he not
know who I am?

256
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:40,577
I've told everybody.

257
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,177
Huh?
Well, what do you know?

258
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,244
I have visitors.
It's those kids.

259
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:49,677
I don't have time to
deal with those annoying
brats right now.

260
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,311
You sure have
changed, Master.

261
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:54,011
You used to love trying to
destroy the digidestined.

262
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,344
It was your favorite
thing to do,

263
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:58,177
next to putting coal in
children's Christmas stockings.

264
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,111
Bah, Humbug.

265
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:05,011
Now, for the final touch!

266
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:06,651
There!

267
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,951
My masterpiece is
finally completed!

268
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,351
Nothing can stop me now!

269
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,484
(snores)

270
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,417
She sure can snore!

271
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,017
No louder than you!

272
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:19,917
Gee, Davis, the rest
of the guys must
be way ahead of us!

273
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,851
Yeah, we're just gonna
have to go faster.

274
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:25,751
I still can't believe
Kari did this to me.

275
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:28,617
Yolei, do you think Davis
is really mad at us?

276
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,517
Naw, he's a
pretty good sport.

277
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:33,551
Hey, look at that!

278
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,017
It's heading right for us!

279
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,251
Alright, everyone,
get ready!

280
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,851
If I had known I was
having this many guests,
I would've catered!

281
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,151
Oh, I can still give
them a party favor!

282
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:49,284
Go get them!

283
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:50,517
(low growl)

284
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,191
Do you see what I see?

285
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,324
(roar)

286
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:12,791
What is that thing?

287
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:15,724
(laughs)
Chimeramon is
my ultimate creation!

288
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:18,291
I combined the most
powerful parts of other
digimon to form this

289
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,857
unstoppable
fighting creature!

290
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:23,091
His Heat Viper attack
will melt my enemies
into oblivion!

291
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:25,491
(roar)

292
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:27,291
I've never heard of a
digimon like that before

293
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,091
and I get all the news
from the underground!

294
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:34,024
Listen Cody, while those
guys do battle with him,
we can free the prisoners!

295
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:34,991
Let's go!

296
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,791
(roar)

297
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:39,391
Tempest Wing!

298
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,157
That's why I picked
Kabuterimon's head,

299
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,357
they don't come
any more hard headed!

300
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,657
Cat's eye beam!

301
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:54,091
And he's fast with Angemon
and Airdramon's wings!

302
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,291
Play time's over.
Now, it's my turn!

303
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:59,124
(roar)

304
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:06,731
Throw in Garurumon's legs, as
well as Monochromon's tail.

305
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:13,231
I added Kuwagamon's,
Skull Greymon's and
Devimon's arms.

306
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:17,664
His body is Greymon's and
I topped him off with
Metal Greymon's hair.

307
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:20,631
He's perfect!
(laughs)

308
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:29,589
(laughs)
Where's my VCR?

309
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,955
Oohhh, I wish I was taping this.

310
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,255
Take a good look
at him, Wormmon.

311
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,122
Now that's what a partner
should look like.

312
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,755
Not a scrawny
runt like you!

313
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:42,089
(sigh)

314
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:50,755
Okay, that's the last one.

315
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:53,755
It's time we got
out of here too.

316
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,855
We can't leave without TK.

317
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,889
He'll be fine.

318
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,889
We've got to get these
digimon to safety.

319
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,189
Let's go!

320
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,055
TK, can't you do this later?

321
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,622
We've got to get out
of here while we can.

322
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:07,389
Don't be so stubborn!

323
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,862
I don't remember sending
you an invitation.

324
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:18,295
I must admit, you
have a lot of nerve.

325
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,729
Sneaking into the base of
the most powerful being
in the digital world!

326
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,995
(Laughing)

327
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:30,995
What's so funny?

328
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,062
Let me ask you
something, Ichijouji.

329
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,929
Don't you think it's
time you gave up on
this little charade?

330
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,729
It's getting old.

331
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,929
You say you're the most
powerful being in the
digital world, and yet,

332
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,562
you have no idea about
the powers that are here.

333
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:44,762
You're a pretender.

334
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:47,462
You're like that story,
the emperor's new clothes.

335
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:51,629
(gasp)

336
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:52,995
You're nobody!

337
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,962
Not like me!

338
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:57,695
You will bow
down before me!

339
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:59,762
Sorry, The floor's
kinda dirty.

340
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,562
You will listen to me!

341
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:04,295
(gasp)

342
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:11,202
When you can't think of
anything to say,

343
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:12,935
do you always
resort to fighting?

344
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,902
I guess.

345
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,402
That's your problem.

346
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,669
You don't know when to
talk and when to fight.

347
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:22,669
Now's a good time to talk.

348
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,869
On the other hand, it's
also a good time to fight!

349
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:39,002
Nefertimon, Halsemon!
You guys be careful, okay?

350
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:42,069
Heat Viper!

351
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,102
Hey!

352
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,435

(roar)

355
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,769
They had no effect!

356
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,735
(roar)

357
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,635
Oh no!
Sticky Net!

358
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,709
Boom Bubble!

359
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,475
Wanna fight?

360
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,375
Actually I'd prefer
a staring contest.

361
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,575
Halsemon!
Let's get out of here!

362
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:23,542
What's that thing?

363
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,809
(roar)

364
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:26,742
Didn't I tell you?

365
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:27,775
I have a new pet.

366
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:28,742
Chimeramon!

367
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,709
My secret weapon that's
not a secret anymore.

368
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:32,042
Don't worry if you
didn't get a good look.

369
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:34,542
You'll see him up close
and personal real soon!

370
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:37,475
(roar)

371
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,242

Hey Ken, remind me
where we left off

381
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:14,815
the next time I'm
pummeling you into oblivion.

382
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:18,449
Master?

383
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,015
I guess I'm not as
cool as I think I am.

384
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,682
Off day? Hmm?

385
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:27,049
Time for me to
regroup and come back
stronger than ever.

386
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,615
Equus Beam!

387
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:32,782
Thanks Pegasusmon!

388
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:35,115
It was just a
little horse play!

389
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,882
Chimeramon's
stopped moving.

390
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:39,549

Here's your hat back, TK.

393
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,515
I didn't want anyone
to step on it.

394
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:46,882
That's okay, Cody.

395
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,015
I have six others just like it.
One for each day of the week.

396
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:51,049
I'm ready to fight and all
the action's over with!

397
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,849
I wish we'd gotten
here sooner.

398
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:55,549
The other digimon
can fly, why can't I?

Come on...

You've got your own fighting

401
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,982
is as hard as mine!

402
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:02,282
Right!

403
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:04,482
Anyway, let's hear
it for TS who really
let Ken have it!

(cheer)

405
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:07,415
Um, that's TK.

406
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:09,822
Are we at the right camp site?

407
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,755
I guess they told
you the wrong place.

408
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:17,222
Why wouldn't Matt give me
the right information?

409
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,622
Could it be he doesn't
want me around?

410
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,922
She's just as
sharp as Davis.

411
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:25,822
What is the next step in
the battle for control
over the Digiworld?
