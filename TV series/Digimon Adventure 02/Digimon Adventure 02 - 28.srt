THE RIGHT MOTIVATION.

Arokinimon: LOOK AT WHAT
THESE LITTLE DEVIANTS HAVE DONE

160
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,694
TO MY PRECIOUS CONTROL SPIRES.

161
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:52,027
THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT
THE BEST OF ME, HUH?

162
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:54,027
WAIT TILL I GET MY HANDS
ON THEM.

163
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,994
THEY MAY HAVE SET MY PLANS
BACK A BIT,

164
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:57,127
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
I'LL BE DEFEATED

BY SOME DIGIDESTINED
PIP-SQUEAKS.

166

I JUST HAVE TO BE
A LITTLE CRAFTIER NEXT TIME.

167
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,260
LOOK, THEY'VE KNOCKED
DOWN THE TOWERS

168
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,827
LIKE A ROW OF DOMINOES.

169
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:05,267
SO THEY WANT TO PLAY GAMES?

170
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:07,200
WE'LL PLAY ALL RIGHT,
BUT BY MY RULES.

171
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,700
I'LL SHOW THOSE BRATS
WHO'S BOSS.

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,900
HUH? WHAT'S THIS?
A VIDEO RECORDER OUT HERE?

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,900
IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A TAPE INSIDE.

Cody: I WONDER WHERE
THAT CREEPY WOMAN IS HIDING.

176

GOOD WORK. WE SMASHED

IN THIS AREA,

178

BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE
WE HAVE TO DESTROY.

179
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,800
LET'S GET STARTED, DUDE.

180

WE SMASHED ALL CONTROL SPIRES
IN THIS AREA, BUT THERE'S...

183
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,467
OH, BE QUIET.

184
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,734
HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF WITCH.

185
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,234
I DRESS THIS WAY
TO MAKE A FASHION STATEMENT.

186
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,434
I THINK I'LL CALL SOME FRIENDS
OF MINE AND ASK THEM

187
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,700
TO TEACH THOSE BRATS
A LESSON IN MANNERS.

188

FROM THAT SPOOKY WOMAN.

WHY ARE WE GOING?

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FACE THEM SOONER OR LATER.

IT WON'T BE A BIG SURPRISE.

HURRY.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET.

208
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,974
WHO IS THE BIG PERSON
THAT LIVES IN IT?

209

THIS IS GIGAHOUSE?

IT'S HUGE AND SPACIOUS.

211
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,007
IT MUST BE 200 FEET TALL.
IT'S AMAZING.

00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,140
NO KIDDING.

OR WASHING THOSE WINDOWS?

YOU'D NEED A HELICOPTER
TO GET UP THERE.

216
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:53,107
Yolei: WHY DO YOU THINK
AROKINIMON CALLED US HERE,

217
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,540
TO ATTACK US WITH A TEAM
OF BASKETBALL PLAYERS?

218
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,574
Davis: I DON'T KNOW,
BUT KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

219
00:07:57,674 --> 00:07:59,540
LET'S LOOK FOR A WAY IN.

220
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,507
SO YOU GUYS
GOT THE E-MAIL, TOO.

221
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,974
HEY.

222
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,314
YOU GUYS COME
FOR THE HOUSE PARTY?

223
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,914
SOME HOUSE PARTY, VEEMON.

224
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:10,847
TOO BAD THE HOSTESS WANTS
TO MAKE PIÑATAS OF HER GUESTS.

225
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,047
THIS IS A SET-UP.

226
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:13,447
WE FIGURED THAT, TOO.

227
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:15,414

WANTS TO ELIMINATE

IN ONE SWOOP.

229
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,647
THAT'S WHY I THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA

230
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,447
FOR YOU GUYS TO GO IN.

231
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,880
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

232
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,880
THAT'S CRAZY. ARE YOU PLANNING
ON GOING IN BY YOURSELF?

233
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,047
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
SHE'LL EAT YOU FOR LUNCH.

234
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,547
KEN HAS A POINT.
WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE.

235
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,014
THIS MIGHT BE OUR BEST CHANCE
TO STOP HER.

236
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,114
I HAVE AN IDEA.

237
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,180
WE GO IN THERE
TO SCOPE THINGS OUT.

DAVIS, SINCE YOU AND KEN
ARE SO FIRED UP TO GO,

241
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,180
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO FIRST?

242
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,514
Both: MM-HMM.

243
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:45,147
COUNT ON ME, TOO.

244
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:48,147
GREAT IDEA.
GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT.

245
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,614
HUH?

246
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:50,747
WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT HERE.

247
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,147
IF THINGS GET TOO CRAZY,
SIGNAL,

248
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,080
AND WE'LL COME
TO THE RESCUE, OKAY?

249
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,080
I STILL THINK
IT'S A BETTER IDEA

250
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,914
IF I GO IN THERE ALONE,
GUYS.

251
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,047
NOT A CHANCE, KEN.

252
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,647
WE'RE DNA
DIGIVOLVED PARTNERS.

253
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,514
WE SHOULD REALLY BE
TOGETHER ON THIS.

254
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:05,487
IF THINGS GET HECTIC IN THERE,
YOU'LL REALLY NEED ME.

255
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,887
COOL YOUR JETS, GUYS,

256
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,354
OR YOU'RE GOING TO END UP
FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

257
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,954
THAT'S WHY
I'M GOING ALONG, TOO.

258
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:14,020
LET'S GO. COME ON, GUYS.
FOLLOW ME.

259

LAST ONE IN
IS A ROTTEN DIGIEGG.

260

TO BE A ROTTEN DIGIEGG.

261
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:21,354
Arokinimon: THOSE FOOLS.

262
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:23,020
I KNEW THEY'D WALK WILLINGLY
INTO MY TRAP.

263
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,387
HOW STUPID CAN YOU GET?

264
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:26,287
I'LL TRY NOT
TO DISAPPOINT THEM.

265
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:28,087
I'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF LOVELY HORRORS

266
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,354
IN STORE FOR THEM
ONCE THEY GET INSIDE.

267
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,987
IF I'M GOING TO HAVE GUESTS,
I'LL HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN UP.

268
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,087
SO LITTLE TIME,
SO MUCH DESTRUCTION.

269
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:37,054
WHOA!

270
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:39,920
HOW IN THE WORLD
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET

271
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
IN THERE ANYWAY?

272
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,654
Davis: MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK
UNDER THE DOORMAT.

273
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,020
MAYBE THERE'S A 40-FOOT KEY.

274
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,320
MAYBE AROKINIMON WILL TRY
TO DESTROY US

275
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,839
WITH A GIANT,
SUPER EVIL DIGIPIZZA.

276
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:55,939
LET'S JUST HOPE

277
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,739
THAT WOMAN WON'T USE US
AS THE TOPPINGS.

278
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,039
I'M VERY ALLERGIC
TO ANCHOVIES.

279
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,406
IT REMINDS ME OF THIS BOOK
CALLED "GULLIVER'S TRAVELS."

280
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,239
IT'S ABOUT THIS KID
WHO SELLS AN OLD COW

281
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,646
FOR SOME MAGIC BEANS
AND ENDS UP FIGHTING THIS GIANT.

282
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:09,946

AND THE BEANSTALK," SILLY.

283
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,146
I KNEW THAT, DUDE.
I WAS JUST JOKING.

284
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,746
YOU GUYS ARE CLASSIC.

285
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,113
YOU TWO FIGHT JUST LIKE
AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE.

286
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:20,046
Davis: DID YOU GUYS
HEAR SOMETHING?

287
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:23,046
Cody: MAYBE IT WAS
YOUR IMAGINATION.

288
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:24,779
Ken: I HEARD IT, TOO.

289
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,013
WE'RE NOT ALONE HERE.

290
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,246
SOUNDS LIKE CLICKING.

291
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:30,446
Wormmon: IT'S COMING
FROM THAT VENT OVER THE STOVE.

292
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,813
EW, YUCK.

293
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,979
IT'S AN ARMY OF BILKIMON.

294
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,513
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
AN INFESTATION OF KILLER BUGS

295
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,613
TO RUIN THE CHARM
OF A SWEET LITTLE COTTAGE.

296
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:44,079
WAIT. THERE'S SOMETHING BIG
COMING THIS WAY.

297
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,679
WHAT IS IT, GATOMON?

298
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,546
A WEIRD BUZZING NOISE.

OF ANGRY KILLER BUGS.

00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,587
SHE'S CONTROLLING
DIGMON, TOO.

481
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,187
CODY, LOOK OUT!

482
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,554
YOU CHILDREN DISAPPOINT ME.

483
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,587
OF COURSE THE FLUTE
CONTROLS THE DIGIMON,

484
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,154
BUT YOU STILL AREN'T
BRIGHT ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

485
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,154
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

486
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:02,220
YEP. I'VE GOT IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

487
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,420
THE FLUTE ONLY CONTROLS
INSECT DIGIMON.

488
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,587
THAT'S WHY ONLY DIGMON
AND STINGMON

489
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,120
ARE AFFECTED BY IT.

490
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,560
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

491
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,527
SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT IT NOW?

492
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:15,494
WHY DON'T YOU BE A SPORT
AND TAKE YOUR LUMPS,

493
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:17,160
GOGGLE BOY?

494
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,694
Yolei: WE'D BETTER
FIND THE OTHERS SOON.

495
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,994
THEIR AIM IS GETTING BETTER.

496
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:35,227
HELLO, BOYS.

497
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,260
Cody: DIGMON,
DON'T DO IT.

498
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,894
ROCK CRACKING.

499
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,094
AAH!

500
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:45,527
GUYS, I'M STUCK.

501
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:48,260
ME, TOO.
IT'S SOME KIND OF WEB.

502
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,794
YES. PARDON MY RUDENESS,

503
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:51,960
BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

504
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,027
Davis: KEN, PLEASE TELL ME
THAT'S A DIGIMON FRIEND OF YOURS

505
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,094
WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE
AND NOT A BIG RAVENOUS SPIDER.

506
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,394
SORRY, DAVIS.

507
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:59,827
Arokinimon: MEET TOKUGUMON,
AND SHE'S HUNGRY.

508
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:02,827
NO! LET ME GO!

509
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:09,160
GRRAAH!

510
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,600
Man: WILL THE DIGIDESTINED

511
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,800

SITUATION?
