1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,336
NARRATOR: Arukenimon and
Mummymon searched all over

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,271
for the legendary Destiny Stone.

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,006
Once they found it, Arukenimon

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,774
created Knightmon to destroy it

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,378
but our guy's DNA digivolved
and we were to stop him.

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,814
Meanwhile, Agumon
confronted BlackWarGreymon

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,849
and tried to convince
him to be his friend.

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,551
Yeah, good luck.

9
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,220
But just as BlackWarGreymon
was coming around, he got this

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,923
weird feeling and left
to find the Destiny Stone.

11
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,258
There was nothing we could do.

12
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,093
We had to watch
as BlackWarGreymon

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,661
destroyed the Destiny Stone.

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,497
Is this the end
of the Digital World?

‐ Yay I'm finally in Kyoto!

39
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,401
CLASSMATE: Yolei, hurry
or you'll miss the bus!

40
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,569
‐ I'm coming!

41
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,573
Dear Poromon and Izzy,
how's it going guys?

42
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,075
This is the second
day of our school trip

43
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,776
and we're finally in Kyoto!

44
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,046
I'm having a great time with
my friends, what a cool place!

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,615
And the food is fab!

46
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,417
Poromon, if you're good
I'll bring you a souvenir.

47
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,785
Ciao for now, Yolei.

48
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,322
‐ According to everything
you've just told me, this whole

49
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,758
mess started when your
digivice changed into a D3.

50
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,694
If my calculations are
correct, it's all your fault!

51
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,029
‐ Huh?

52
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,732
‐ The other needed D3s in
order to compete with you,

53
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,400
so their sub‐conscious
minds must have

54
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,502
willed their
digivices to change,

55
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,438
although I'm not sure Davis
has a sub‐conscious mind.

56
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,240
As strong as these
digivices are,

57
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,775
they just weren't enough.

58
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,344
Of course, that also
means you must have made

59
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,380
a wish for your digivice
to change into a D3.

60
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,348
‐ I don't remember
making any wishes.

61
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,251
In fact, I always
got the short side

62
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,153
of the wishbone from the turkey.

63
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,088
‐ Like I said, it must've
been your sub‐conscious.

64
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,690
We geniuses have
pretty pig ones.

65
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,959
In the Digital World, data
is formed into shapes,

66
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,727
usually based on whatever
a person has running

67
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,230
through their mind, kinda
like a VCR for the brain.

68
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,233
And that's the reason why
everyone's clothes change

69
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,735
every time they go into the
Digital World, and why Davis

70
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,240
looks the way he does, like
a fighter pilot on safari.

71
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,742
‐ I see.

72
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:59,579
So, then I must have wished
for that Digimon Emperor outfit.

73
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,314
‐ So you're not perfect.

74
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,018
You should read Singbold's
<i>Theory of Ultimate Brain Power.</i>

75
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,487
You might be able
to pick up a few pointers.

76
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,990
‐ Actually, I taught
a class on it.

77
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,126
But don't you think Tsaro's
<i>Strengthening Your Mind</i>

78
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,663
was more effective?
‐ Uh, yeah.

79
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,799
But of course, Gorski's
My Brain My Buddy

80
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,967
is the quintessential
masterpiece when it comes to

81
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,136
exploring the inner
working of the human mind.

82
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,672
But I'm sure you've read it a
dozen times, it's a bestseller

83
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,340
in the school's psychology
department bookstore.

84
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,809
‐ I'm sorry, Izzy.

85
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,278
I can't believe I've
never heard of that one,

86
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,880
I feel so ashamed of myself.

87
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,148
‐ Oh, don't worry.

88
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,917
I've got another
copy you can borrow.

89
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,886
After all, we high‐IQ types
gotta stick together, right?

90
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,823
Besides, of all the other
digi‐destined I've met,

91
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,991
you're one of the only
ones as smart as me!

92
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,093
‐ Other digi‐destined?

93
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,594
What are you talking about, huh?

94
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,396
‐ Oh, I guess no one told you

95
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,264
we're not the only ones around.

96
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,067
Actually, there are quite
a few of us all over the world.

97
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,604
I haven't met them all,
but I'm working on it.

98
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,807
It seems that most of us
have one thing in common,

99
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,410
we all had some kind
of encounter with the digimon

100
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,946
when they invaded the real
world a few years ago.

101
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,716
And now we each have
our own digimon partner.

102
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,987
‐ I see, that means
that I must've, too.

103
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,425
Everything from that time
is still such a blur to me.

104
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,163
‐ Oh, Poromon,
there's an e‐mail here

105
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,098
for you from Yolei on her trip.

106
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,900
‐ Hey, what's wrong with you?

107
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,901
Are you sick?

108
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,671
‐ Oh, he's just really tired

109
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,440
because he's been
here in the real world

110
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,876
for a couple
of days without Yolei.

111
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,044
I know sometimes
when Ken's not here

112
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,580
even my naps make me exhausted.

113
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,382
‐ Yolei asked me to watch
him while she was on

114
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,951
her school trip, and it's been
three days since she left.

115
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,320
I've noticed that,
as each day passes, he seems

116
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,023
to get more and more tired,
and he's not very hungry.

117
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,958
You know it's really
gotta bad when he'd

118
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,528
rather sleep than eat a bag
of chocolate gummy chews.

119
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,096
‐ Well then I'll just
have to take him into

120
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,698
the Digital World so that
he can regain his strength.

121
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,866
Davis and the
others have already

122
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,135
gone on ahead, haven't they?

123
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,237
‐ Yeah, you're right,
that's a great idea Ken.

124
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,305
Here you go.

125
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,439
Things are kinda
crazy there now,

126
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,941
so be careful of any warps.

127
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,443
Promise me you won't talk
to any strange digimon.

128
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,912
‐ I'll be fine.

129
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:15,348
Hey, Izzy, d'you think
I can ever make up

130
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,485
for all the trouble I've caused?

131
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,087
‐ Look, Ken, we
all make mistakes.

132
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,291
When we first went
to the Digital World,

133
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,592
I came up with
a bunch of theories.

134
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,460
Not all of them
were exactly right.

135
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,962
But I was only a kid then.

136
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,964
I eventually realized
that you have to have

137
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,666
all the facts before
hypothesizing.

138
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,436
We need to learn all we can
about the Digital World.

139
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,038
I know that somewhere
down the road,

140
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,707
we'll be called on again
to help the Digital World.

141
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,876
Let's just make
sure that this time

142
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,911
we're both totally prepared.

143
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,718
TEACHER: Alright, listen up.

144
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,321
I want you all to meet
back here in two hours.

145
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,022
STUDENTS: Okay.

146
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:59,259
‐ I told my whole family I
would bring them back souvenirs.

147
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,661
‐ There!
‐ That was fast!

148
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,630
‐ Okay, now we can
see the sights.

149
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:09,569
Huh, tell me I'm not seeing
what I think I'm seeing!

150
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,075
( terrified scream )

151
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,044
BLACKWARGREYMON:
Terra Destroyer!

152
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,617
I'll demolish them all,
and once I do,

153
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,387
my suffering will
finally come to an end!

154
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,990
‐ Yeah, whatever.

155
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,791
Stop the talking
and keep destroying!

156
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,427
I've got a deadline
to meet, I haven't got all day!

157
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,962
‐ I'm so proud of that boy,

158
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,865
sometimes it just
makes me want to cry.

159
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,002
BLACKWARGREYMON:
Terra Destroyer!

160
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,141
‐ Rats, we got here to late!

161
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,813
‐ What's that?
‐ It's warping!

162
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,116
‐ The area is starting
to become unbalanced!

163
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,651
I saw a warp when he destroyed

164
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,086
the other one too,
but it was smaller then.

165
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,322
It seems that every time
BlackWarGreymon destroys one

166
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,525
of those stones, the warp
just gets bigger and bigger!

167
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,494
‐ Hey, look what's
happening to him now!

168
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,131
‐ What?

169
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,904
‐ Oh.

170
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,742
I was right,
it's BlackWarGreymon!

171
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,747
( menacing growling )

172
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,716
‐ Ahh, why is everybody standing

173
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,785
around like nothing's happening?

174
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,520
What's wrong with you people?

175
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,490
( crowd murmuring )

176
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,528
( growling )

177
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,234
( panting )

178
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,669
Wait!

179
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,442
( growling )

180
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,544
‐ Stop, you, er, digimon!
‐ Huh?

181
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:08,021
‐ ( scared cry )
‐ ( digimon grunting )

182
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,426
APEMON: I am Apemon,
I swing into action

183
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,097
and use my Mega Bone Stick
attack to demolish my enemies!

184
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,404
‐ I've got to tell the
others what's going on!

185
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,840
Emergency, Digimon
are now in Kyoto!

186
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,642
Hurry, having
a wonderful time, Yolei.

187
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,277
( evil laugh )

188
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,912
ARUKENIMON: When will
you children ever learn,

189
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,215
you can't possibly beat me!

190
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,184
‐ Ha, we'll see about
that, let's go, Veemon!

191
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:46,726
EXVEEMON: Veemon,
digivolve to ExVeemon!

192
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:55,869
ANKYLOMON: Armadillomon,
digivolve to Ankylomon!

193
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,242
PEGASUSMON: Patamon,
armor digivolve to...

194
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:07,147
Pegasusmon, flying hope!

195
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,950
NEFERTIMON: Gatomon,
armor digivolve to...

196
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,255
Nefertimon, the angel of light!

197
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:19,025
‐ That's just a legend.
‐ I'm not so sure.

198
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,830
‐ Huh, wait a minute,
what was that?

199
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,832
‐ What do you mean,
it was a rehearsal!

200
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,300
‐ That's not what I mean.

201
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,903
I just saw something.

202
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,541
‐ Ahh! Get my agent!

203
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,842
‐ Oh, good, there he is.

204
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,245
Of course now what
am I supposed to do?

205
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,915
‐ Uhh, good dog?

206
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,491
‐ There it is, alright,
Stingmon, do your thing!

207
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,126
STINGMON: Right!

208
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,863
( growls )

209
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,872
‐ Stingmon!
‐ Yolei!

210
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,608
‐ Ken, I don't get it.

211
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,410
‐ I'll explain
everything to you later.

212
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,514
Stingmon, remember, he's
not a Control Spire digimon

213
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,349
so you can't destroy him!

214
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,184
STINGMON: Don't worry, Ken!

215
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,425
( grunting )

216
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,093
Ken, I got him

217
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,996
‐ Alright, Yolei,
the rest is up to you now!

218
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,698
‐ What are you talking about?

219
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,932
Come back!

220
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,772
POROMON: Okay, Yolei,
I'm ready for action!

221
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,708
What shall we do first?

222
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,710
‐ Hey, I thought
I left you with Izzy.

223
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,979
What are you doing here?
‐ It's a long story.

224
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,781
‐ I found her,
she's over here, professor!

225
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,416
Excuse me, miss,
are you the girl

226
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,752
who called out digimon before?

227
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,987
YOLEI: Uhh, maybe?

228
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,688
‐ I have one more
question to ask.

229
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,323
YOLEI: What is it?

230
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,893
‐ That's a digimon
you're holding, isn't it?

231
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,961
‐ Oh boy.

232
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,401
Who are you guys?

233
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,304
‐ Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm Professor Takenouchi.

234
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,973
I teach folklore at the
university in Tokyo,

235
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,075
but I've been spending the
last year doing research

236
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,677
right here in the city of Kyoto.

237
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,811
And this is‐‐

238
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,213
‐ My name's Jim, Joe's brother.

239
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,781
I'm one of the
professor's students.

240
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,750
I was pre‐med and had
to study everything

241
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,451
from brain surgery to bedpans.

242
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,854
And then I took one class
with the professor here.

243
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,123
I changed my major
to ghosts and goblins,

244
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,825
my kid brother still wants
to be a doctor, though.

245
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,194
‐ How nice.

246
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,996
I'm Yolei Inoue
and I'm in eighth grade.

247
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,565
I live in Tokyo too.

248
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,667
But I'm not too sure
what I'm doing here.

249
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,968
JIM: I knew it!

250
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,138
My little brother
told me all about you!

251
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,073
‐ Huh?

252
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,942
‐ Yep, and I've heard
a lot of good things

253
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,610
about you from my
daughter as well.

254
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,847
‐ And, uh, I guess that means
that you're referring

255
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,951
to Joe Kido and Sora Takenouchi?

256
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,454
‐ Bullseye!
‐ Huh?

257
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,389
EXVEEMON: Vee Laser!

258
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,493
‐ And now it's my turn!

259
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,965
‐ ExVeemon!
‐ Davis! You alright?

260
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,233
‐ Where were you?

261
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,702
I've been waiting,
are you ready?

262
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,003
‐ Let's do it!

263
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,376
EXVEEMON: ExVeemon!

264
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:28,348
STINGMON: Stingmon!
♪ Champions

265
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:32,285
EXVEEMON AND STINGMON:
DNA Digivolve to...

266
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,455
PAILDRAMON: Paildramon!

267
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,793
‐ I've studied legends
all over the world.

268
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,230
The Loch Ness Monster,
Bigfoot, the Bermuda Triangle.

269
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,332
You should see my
Frequent Flyer Miles.

270
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,735
Anyway, I don't spend
much time at home.

271
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,471
I guess that's what caused
Sora to be so angry.

272
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,772
Then three years ago,
she suddenly

273
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,173
turned into a whole new person.

274
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,042
She and her mother
became best friends,

275
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,411
I thought maybe she had
a boyfriend or was going through

276
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,613
one of those teenage things,
but she simply said

277
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,383
that she owed it all
to her friends, the digimon.

278
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,151
‐ Her friends the digimon?

279
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,453
‐ That's right, her adventures
with them forced her

280
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,589
to grow up and change her
outlook on everything.

281
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,225
Especially the stormy
relationship with her mother.

282
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,094
You should see them now,
shopping every Saturday,

283
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,629
my credit card's at the limit!

284
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,231
‐ Oh.

285
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,734
‐ So thanks to the digimon,
our family is a lot closer now,

286
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,903
even though
I'm still never around.

287
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,705
‐ You're welcome!

288
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,906
‐ That's a beautiful story.

289
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,708
Thanks for sharing.

290
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,943
‐ I'm glad I'm getting to see
a digimon on a friendly basis.

291
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,679
I've had a run‐in with
them before, you know.

292
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,013
When everything happened
three years ago,

293
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,548
I was right in the
middle of the battle.

294
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,450
Actually, my brother Joe
was a little more involved.

295
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,519
I was sorta helping
from the sidelines.

296
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,387
It's not that I couldn't have
helped him fight, it's just

297
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,890
that I wanted to give the kid
a chance to learn on his own.

298
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,291
‐ I still don't get it.

299
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,826
Of all the cities
they could've picked,

300
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,096
why did the digimon start
showing up here in Kyoto?

301
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,131
‐ Ever since Kyoto
became the capital,

302
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,200
residents here feel
the city has developed

303
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,636
a very strong connection
with animal spirits.

304
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,271
‐ What?

305
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,007
‐ That's right, different
animals like raccoons and foxes.

306
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,009
One of the reasons
I'm here is to determine

307
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,011
if these stories
are based on fact.

308
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,146
Another reason is
there's an outlet mall

309
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,815
where I can get my
socks for half price.

310
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,583
‐ I see.

311
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,819
PROFESSOR: Kyoto was chosen
to be the capital partly

312
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,289
because the four gods are in
harmony surrounding the city.

313
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,859
Have you heard that story?
‐ I'm not sure.

314
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,327
PROFESSOR: It's
quite interesting.

315
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,962
You see, the mountains
to the north are for

316
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,263
Genbu the turtle, the river

317
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,367
to the east is for
Seiryuu the dragon,

318
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,169
the river to the south
is for Suzaku the phoenix,

319
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,639
and the road to the west
is for Byakko the tiger.

320
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,441
So the city was protected
by the mountains,

321
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,443
had the convenience of
a river and roads nearby,

322
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,712
and was open to the west.
A perfect scenario.

323
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,214
‐ Cool.

324
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,715
‐ There's also the Spirit Gate,
and the fact that

325
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:47,286
there were many temples
built in all four directions.

326
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,888
They believe that
without those temples,

327
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,924
it'd be too easy for the
magical creatures to get in.

328
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,659
‐ Spirits?

329
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,561
Creatures?

330
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,662
‐ Professor!

331
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,830
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.

332
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,298
I didn't mean to scare you.

333
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,868
Sometimes I get wrapped
up in my own stories.

334
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,271
The city has changed
a lot since those days.

335
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,574
What I'm trying to say is
that Kyoto is close to the

336
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:12,245
spirit world, in other words,
any world other than our own.

337
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,247
‐ Like the Digital World?

338
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,316
‐ I have a theory that those
digimon you saw running around

339
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,452
found it easier to travel
through the warp in the

340
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,889
Digital World to Kyoto rather
than trying to go to Tokyo.

341
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,092
‐ Wait a minute, are you
trying to tell me that digimon

342
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,828
are some sort of
magical creatures?

343
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,563
‐ Well aren't they?
‐ Huh?

344
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,832
‐ It's not like they're
just a collection of data.

345
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,501
I believe that digimon are
actually legends that people

346
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,071
have spoken of for hundreds
of years, and, over time,

347
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,707
have gained a level
of consciousness

348
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,309
and become a reality.

349
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,679
I think that digimon
may have started

350
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,116
as data in some old computer,
but have since come alive.

351
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,218
Just like those old legends.

352
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,654
Do you agree with my theory?

353
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,057
‐ Uh, huh?

354
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,927
( surprised cry )

355
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,564
Hey stop the car,
there they are!

356
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,998
MONSTER: Huh?

357
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,371
‐ Ah, what's that?

358
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,207

360
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,083
POROMON: That's
Musyamon, a warrior digimon

361
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,551
who can take different shapes.

362
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,286
I've seen him use his
Shogun Sword attack

363
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,155
to make mincemeat
out of his enemies!

of the Digital World
