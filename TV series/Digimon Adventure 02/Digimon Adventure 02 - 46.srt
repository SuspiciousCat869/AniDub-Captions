1
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,908
Davis: I COULDN'T BELIEVE KEN
WENT WITH ARUKENIMON,
BUT AT LEAST HE HAD ME
TO RESCUE HIM.

2
00:00:05,541 --> 00:00:06,841
DAEMON SHOWED UP,
AND THAT CREEPY OWIKAWA DUDE

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:08,441
WAS JUST GOING
TO HAND KEN OVER TO HIM.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,508
I SPRANG INTO ACTION.
WE DIDN'T REALLY NEED THE HELP,

5
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:13,975
BUT I WAS GLAD WHEN
THE OTHERS FINALLY SHOWED UP.

6
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:15,775
TOOK THEM LONG ENOUGH.

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,575
DAEMON COULD OPEN DIGITAL PORTS
ANY TIME HE WANTED TO,

8
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:19,575
SO KARI SAID WE SHOULD
SEND HIM TO THE DARK OCEAN

9
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,475
INSTEAD OF THE DIGITAL WORLD.
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

10
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:23,608
KEN HAD TO USE THE DARK POWER
STILL DEEP INSIDE HIM

11
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,675
TO OPEN THE GATE

12
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:27,508
AND BANISH DAEMON
FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

13
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,775
NOW THAT'S
WHAT I CALL TEAMWORK.

Man: YES, SIR, WE'RE ORGANIZING
AND CLEANING.

38
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:33,681
ANY CLEANER, AND THE PLACE
WOULD BE A SOAP FACTORY.

39
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,048
I'VE ALREADY ORGANIZED
THAT DRAWER, SIR.

40
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,048
I'VE GOT THE PAPER CUTS
TO SHOW FOR IT, TOO.

41
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,015
SORRY. I JUST NEED
TO FIND SOMETHING.

42
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:43,715
I'LL GET THE BANDAGES.

43
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:45,915
BUT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO MISS
THE OFFICE OVER THE HOLIDAYS.

44
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:47,948
IT'S ALWAYS SO NICE
AND QUIET.

45
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,848
FOUND IT!
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

46
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,215
THERE --
THIS IS THE GUY.

47
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,181
OH,
HE GIVES ME THE WILLIES.

48
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,748
IT IS HIM.

49
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,915
WELL, HE WAS AT WORK UNTIL
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO,

50
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,448
BUT YESTERDAY AND TODAY
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP AT ALL.

51
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,788
HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL IN
OR ANYTHING.
THANKS, DAD.

52
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,188
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF WE KEPT THIS PICTURE?

53
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,155
OF COURSE.
GO RIGHT AHEAD,

54
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,121
BUT DON'T DO ANYTHING
DANGEROUS, OKAY?

55
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,121
MM-HMM.
HMM, WHY DO I THINK

56
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,521
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO?

57
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,921
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE
AN ORDINARY PERSON.

58
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:17,921
YEAH? THEN WHY IS HE ABLE TO
CONTROL ARUKENIMON AND MUMMYMON?

59
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,121
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE IS.

60
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,488
I JUST WANT
TO SHUT HIM DOWN.

61
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,255
AHH, MOUNT FUJI.
THIS WORLD CAN BE BEAUTIFUL,

62
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:29,021
BUT SOON I'LL CLAIM
MY TRUE PRIZE.

63
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,421
ARUKENIMON,
I BELIEVE THAT OPENS IN.

64
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,788
WELL,
IT DOES NOW.

65
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,455
HA HA HA HA!

66
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,121
IF YOU'RE THROUGH
PLAYING AROUND,

67
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,521
IT'S TIME
TO GET TO WORK.

68
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,921
THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE
OF MASS HALLUCINATION,

69
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:43,755
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

70
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,488
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

71
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,488
IT'S OBVIOUSLY
A GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY

72
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:49,055
TO COVER UP A UFO CRASH.

73
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,655
WHAT I'M SAYING --

74
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:52,855
I MEAN, I'M JUST SAYING THAT
THE DESTRUCTION IS REAL,

75
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,188
BUT A MASS HALLUCINATION
CAUSED IT TO SEEM

76
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,421
THAT THE DESTRUCTION
WAS CAUSED BY MONSTERS.

77
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,455
THE GOVERNMENT GOT TO YOU, TOO,
DIDN'T IT?

78
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,795
OH, IF ONLY DIGIMON
WERE THIS DELUDED.

79
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:04,395
THE DIGITAL WORLD
WOULD FALL AT OUR FEET

80
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:06,428
LIKE A RIPE LITTLE PLUM.

81
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:09,228
TO THEM DIGIMON AND UFOs
ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

82
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:12,195
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THEY'RE
AFRAID TO ADMIT EXISTS,

83
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,995
BUT THINK --

84
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,995
IF THERE'S SUCH
A COMMOTION NOW,

85
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:19,561
WAIT TILL ALL THOSE
DARK SPORES BEGIN TO BLOOM.

86
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:21,928
HA HA HA HA!

87
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,195
THERE WE GO.
I'M ALL DONE.

88
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,795
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'RE
DONE WITH YOUR HOMEWORK

89
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,595
FOR THE WHOLE
WINTER BREAK?

90
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:31,995
MM-HMM.

91
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:33,595
HONEY,
THAT'S AMAZING.

92
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:35,395
I'LL SAY IT IS.
CRAZY EVEN.

93
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,395
I MEAN,
HE WAS JUST RETURNED

94
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,361
FROM THAT WHOLE KIDNAPPING
INCIDENT LAST NIGHT.

95
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,361
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S SUCH
A SMART LITTLE BOY.

96
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,761
YOU KNOW, THE PRESS
IS SURE TO SHOW UP AGAIN

97
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,695
TO TALK ABOUT
THE KIDNAPPING,

98
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:47,328
AND WE CAN GET
MORE ATTENTION

99
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,328
BY TELLING THEM
HOW SMART HE IS.

100
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:51,328
HON, MAYBE HE'LL BECOME
A MEDIA DARLING,

101
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,128
JUST LIKE THAT KEN ICHIJOUJI,
AND THEN WE'LL GET ON TV.

102
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,295
YOU BET.
THEN EVERYONE WILL KNOW

103
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:58,295
WE'RE THE PARENTS
OF A GENIUS.

104
00:03:58,728 --> 00:03:59,928
[ Thinking ] INSECTS.

105
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:10,373
YES, THAT'S THE MAN,
ALL RIGHT.
OH,
HE GIVES ME THE WILLIES.

106
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,459
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
SAYS ABOUT HIM.

107
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,723
HEY, DIDN'T YOU NEED
TO BE SOMEPLACE?

108
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:17,390
YOU'RE RIGHT. FILL ME IN
WHEN I GET BACK, OKAY?

109
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,990
NOW FEEL FREE
TO MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

110
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:21,901
All: THANKS.

111
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,501
SEE YOU LATER.

112
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,667
OH, WAIT. HERE.

113
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:28,667
T.K.: LOOKS LIKE MOM HAS DONE
SOME INVESTIGATING OF HER OWN.

114
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:30,467
HUH?

115
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,667
DIDN'T YOU KNOW T.K.'S MOM
IS A NEWSPAPER REPORTER?

116
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,834
REALLY?

117
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,834
YEAH, AND LOOK.

118
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,800
WOW! UH, WHAT IS IT?

119
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,800
OOH,
IS IT A GROCERY LIST?
NO, GOOFY.

120
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,167
IT'S THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES
OF THE KIDNAPPED KIDS.

121
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,134
YOUR MOM DOES GOOD WORK,
T.K.

122
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,301
WE'VE GOT TO SAVE THEM ALL
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

123
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,701
YOU CAN COUNT ME IN.

124
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,301
WE CAN'T ALLOW
THOSE CHILDREN

125
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,301
TO BECOME DRAWN INTO EVIL
THE WAY I WAS.

126
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,467
RIGHT. ALL THOSE KIDS
ARE DEPENDING ON US.

127
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,267
All: YEAH!

128
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,067
HEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO CAUSE TROUBLE,

129
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,234
BUT JUST WHAT IS
THE PLAN ANYWAY?
WELL, UM...

130
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:04,507
LET'S SPLIT UP
AND GO MEET WITH THOSE KIDS.

131
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,307
IF WE ACT QUICKLY,

132
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,507
MAYBE WE CAN STOP
THE DARK SPORES FROM GROWING.

133
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,674
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
LET'S GO.

134
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,907
THAT NORIKO GIRL SHOULD
BE HOME ANY TIME NOW, RIGHT?

135
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,474
RIGHT.

136
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,507
GUYS, ISN'T THAT HER, LIKE,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US?

137
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,241
OH, YEAH.

138
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,074
SHE DOESN'T LOOK SO EVIL
PLAYING WITH THAT CAT.

139
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:29,274
GET AWAY FROM ME.
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

140
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,407
[ CAT MEOWS ]

141
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,441
SHE KICKED IT!

142
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:35,241
I GUESS SHE IS EVIL,
HUH?

143
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,641
YEAH. MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN
WORTH TALKING TO HER.

144
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:42,674
IT LOOKS LIKE THE DARK SPORE
HAS ALREADY TAKEN HOLD.

145
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:45,241
WE HAVE TO AT LEAST TRY.

146
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:47,641
[ Thinking ] I DON'T EVEN
LIKE TO FIGHT DIGIMON.

147
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,441
WHAT WILL WE DO IF WE'RE
FORCED TO FIGHT OTHER KIDS?

148
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,241
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

149
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:57,007
Woman: NO. NOW GO AWAY
AND DON'T COME BACK!

150
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:00,774
WAIT, MA'AM.
JUST LISTEN FOR A MINUTE.

151
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,647
MAN, HOW DO PEOPLE
GET ANY ENCYCLOPEDIAS SOLD?

152
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,614
SORRY, GUYS. I TRIED.

153
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,414
I KNOW, DAVIS.

154
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,214
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
SHE GOT ANGRY.

155
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:11,781

TO PUT ASIDE MY WARRIOR WAYS.

472
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,076
THEY HAVE PROVIDED ME
FEW ANSWERS,

473
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:16,243
AND MAYBE ONE DAY
WE COULD EVEN BE FRIENDS.

474
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,843
I HOPE SO,
BLACK WARGREYMON.

475
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:20,509
I HOPE SO.

476
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:22,643
WILL BLACK WARGREYMON
FIND THE ANSWERS HE SEEKS

477
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:24,443
AND JOIN THE DIGIDESTINED

478
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,643
IN THEIR QUEST TO DEFEAT
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS?
