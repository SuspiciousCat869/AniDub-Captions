00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,902
DAVIS:
<i>ExVeemon and I decided</i>

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,504
<i>to take on MaloMyotismon,</i>

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,239
<i>even though the others</i>
<i>were afraid of him.</i>

4
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,740
<i>I don't blame them.</i>

5
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,442
<i>If ever stopped</i>
<i>to think about anything,</i>

6
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,110
<i>I'd be scared too!</i>

7
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,579
<i>MaloMyotismon played</i>
<i>mind tricks on everyone,</i>

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,114
<i>terrifying Ken</i>
<i>and making the others</i>

9
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,016
<i>believe their favorite</i>
<i>wish had come true!</i>

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>But my wish really</i>
<i>did come true</i>

11
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,287
<i>because Veemon digivolved</i>
<i>into all his forms</i>

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,355
<i>at the same time!</i>

13
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,023
<i>That's the good news.</i>

14
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,192
<i>The bad news is that</i>
<i>MaloMyotismon's wishes</i>

15
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>are also coming true,</i>

16
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,896
<i>and his wishes could make</i>
<i>a genie crawl back</i>

17
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,364
<i>in his bottle!</i>

TAI:
It's so dark,

43
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,793
and it'll be like
this forever

44
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,895
if we can't stop
MaloMyotismon.

45
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,597
No, I can't give up hope.

46
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,098
I have too many people
depending on me.

47
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,867
The two worlds will
unite in darkness!

48
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,403
(laughs)

49
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,672
Then they shall
both be mine!

50
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,674
That's never going
to happen!

51
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,909
MALOMYOTISMON:
And why not?

52
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,110
Cause we're gonna
stop you!

53
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,878
Once and for all!

54
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:52,946
MALOMYOTISMON:
You fools!

55
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,681
You think you can defeat me?

56
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,849
Your pitiful light

57
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,551
is no match
for my darkness.

58
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,486
Even now it consumes
the world.

59
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,588
Not for long!
Get him!

60
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,223
IMPERIALDRAMON:
Positron Laser!

61
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,592
Screaming Darkness!

62
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,728
(screaming)

63
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,732
They're losing.

64
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,100
And it's all our fault.

65
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,401
GIRL:
Thanks to us,

66
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,203
the Digital World
and the real world

67
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,438
are going to be covered
in darkness.

68
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,641
You foolish DigiDestined.

69
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,442
Watch closely now.

70
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,747
Your world is being
consumed by eternal night.

71
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,981
You'll never win.

72
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,616
Even if you defeat us,

73
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,952
others will rise up
against you.

74
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,954
Who could possibly
beat him?

75
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,189
I just wanna go home.

76
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,759
Why bother?
There's no point.

77
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,427
I don't think any
of us have a home

78
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,596
to go home to anymore.

79
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,166
Yeah, there's no point
to anything anymore.

80
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,901
Hey, quit talking
like that.

81
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,270
Why? It's all true,
isn't it?

82
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,939
There's nothing any
of us can do to win.

83
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,241
LITTLE BOY:
He's right,

84
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,009
there's no point
in trying.

85
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,478
The only thing we'll do
is fail.

86
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,981
He beat us,
it's just that simple.

87
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,149
No, he hasn't!

88
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,417
GROUP: Huh?

89
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,619
But he will beat us
if you give up!

90
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,154
Just because things
look bad,

91
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,622
that's no reason not
to try!

92
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,823
I don't know.

93
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,358
Well, I do.

94
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,160
So quit sitting there like
a bunch of sad sacks

95
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,695
and let's beat this guy!

96
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,063
But what can we do?

97
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,031
He's already defeated
us once.

98
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,633
You're right.
It's hopeless.

99
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,436
In mere moments both
worlds will be mine!

100
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,471
(laughs)

101
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,476
The darkness
is strong here too.

102
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,545
I know, but if we want
to get back

103
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,946
to the Digital World,

104
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,815
this is our only way.

105
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,149
It might be
the only chance

106
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,818
for all of us
in both worlds.

107
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,686
For everything.

108
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,489
But we don't have any idea
if this gate is going to open!

109
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,158
But the gate in Tokyo
is sealed by BlackWarGreymon.

110
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,560
This is the closest one.

111
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,261
I know he was trying
to help us protect

112
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,863
the Digital World.

113
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,865
I think he may've done
more harm than good

114
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,000
if we can't get
back there.

115
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,235
It looks like
we have no choice

116
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,303
but to give it a try

117
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,671
and hope for the best.

118
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,039
This is the place
where we first went

119
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,140
to the Digital World.

120
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,842
Maybe that's a good sign.

121
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,577
Well, this had better work.

122
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,013
We have to get Noriko
to Oikawa as soon as possible.

123
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,415
Tell me,
what's going to happen

124
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,217
to my daughter
if you don't?

125
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,785
Don't worry,
she'll be fine.

126
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,919
But‐‐

127
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,055
She'll be okay,
I promise.

128
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,357
FATHER:
Alright, we trust you.

129
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,092
SORA:
<i>Am I the only one</i>

130
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,561
<i>who's worried we won't</i>
<i>be able to save her?</i>

131
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,764
<i>That we won't be able</i>
<i>to save everything?</i>

132
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,905
The dying of the light,
and no one to rage against it.

133
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,507
My power over both
of the worlds

134
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,108
is growing stronger,

135
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,944
and now there's nothing
that can stand against me!

136
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,945
I don't think so.

137
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,480
Positron Laser!

138
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,384
Static Force!

139
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,886
Justice Beam!

140
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,855
Screaming Darkness!

141
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,693
(grunting and screaming)

142
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,832
MALOMYOTISMON: (laughs)

143
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,901
Why do they bother trying
to fight him?

144
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,302
There's just nothing
that they can do

145
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,904
that will defeat him.

146
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,273
They should know it's
all pointless by now.

147
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,607
Maybe we could help

148
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,109
if we were
the DigiDestined,

149
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,878
but we were only chosen
by Oikawa.

150
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,313
ALL: It's hopeless.

151
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,415
Tai, we have to get
to the Digital World,

152
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,583
before it's too late.

153
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,617
I know.

154
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,753
Hey, I've got an idea.

155
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,756
Digiport open!
Please?

156
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,658
MATT:
I guess our parents were wrong.

157
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,626
That's not the magic word
after all.

158
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,994
JOE:
This is bad, guys.

159
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,329
What are we gonna do?

160
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,664
This could be
the end of everything.

161
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,765
IZZY:
Whoa, wait a minute.

162
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,799
Look at this.

163
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,800
BOTH: Huh?

164
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,135
More bad news?

165
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,437
Gates are opening
all over the world!

166
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,839
Look, you guys.

167
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,640
It's lighting up like
a modem router

168
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,142
in full pulse mode!

169
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,443
MATT:
Well, if that looks like

170
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,678
a Christmas tree lighting up,

171
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,646
I'd have to agree with you.

172
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,248
SORA:
Look, the light from the gates

173
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,283
is cutting through
MaloMyotismon's blanket

174
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,853
of darkness!

175
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,454
IZZY:
It must be coming from Digivices

176
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,323
all over the planet!

177
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,191
MATT:
Just think, millions of kids

178
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,126
are banding together
to take a stand

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,996
against MaloMyotismon
right now.

180
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,631
It doesn't matter
where they're from,

181
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,299
or what language they speak.

182
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,002
They all knew they had
unite against the darkness,

183
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,205
had to fight it no matter
how futile it may have seemed.

184
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,107
TAI:
I knew that MaloMyotismon

185
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,809
couldn't win that easily.

186
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,445
The whole world's
fighting him!

187
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,613
(gasps)

188
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,615
KARI: Look!

189
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,883
So many Digimon!

190
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,884
DAVIS:
I hope we don't have

191
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,218
to feed em all!

192
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,020
There must be hundreds!

193
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,757
The light from
the Digivice has guided us.

194
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,092
It led us all here.

195
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,526
It's great!
The partner Digimon

196
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,161
are DigiDestined from
all over the world

197
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,696
are gathering.

198
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,232
We can't allow you
to destroy our world!

199
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,001
Yeah, you think
you can bully us?

200
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,569
Well, put up your dukes!

201
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,037
MALOMYOTISMON:
Your meaningless

202
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,405
little gathering
of buffoons

203
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,507
doesn't frighten me.

204
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,143
It doesn't matter how
many of you there are.

205
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,145
You'll never defeat me!

206
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,513
Screaming Darkness!

207
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,882
(screaming)

208
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,923
We have
to fight him, Mimi,

209
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,391
but I need your help!

210
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,060
I'm right here for you,
Palmon!

211
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,061
Tortomon!

212
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,095
Centarumon!

213
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,130
Frigimon!

214
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,264
Freezemon!

215
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,799
Shakomon!

216
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,034
Go, Apemon!

217
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,168
Meramon!

218
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,736
Crabmon!

219
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,171
Floramon!

220
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,205
Lunamon!

221
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,207
‐ Seamon!
‐ Kuwagamon!

222
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,011
Gotsumon!

223
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,283
MALOMYOTISMON:
Wait a minute.

224
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,052
What's happening?

225
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
The light!
It's blinding!

226
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,727
No, it can't be!

227
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,163
Hey look,
he's in pain.

228
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,632
The light of the Digimon
is winning!

229
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,467
MALOMYOTISMON:
(screams)

230
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,471
TAI:
Look, in the sky!

231
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,872
That light...

232
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,207
Just like three years ago.

233
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,642
The gate is opening up!

234
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,943
JOE:
It actually opened?

235
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,812
I mean,
of course it opened!

236
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,380
Come on, Noriko!

237
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,750
It's alright.

238
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,819
(grunts)

239
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,487
Let's go. Come on!

240
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,655
Yeah!

241
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,157
(beeping)

242
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,430
FATHER: Huh?

243
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,299
Noriko? Noriko?

244
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,533
Where did she go?

245
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,068
Don't you worry.

246
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,970
Your daughter's
in the very best of hands now.

247
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,505
Yes, but‐‐

248
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,107
There's nothing we can
really do right now,

249
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,275
but believe in the strength
of our children.

250
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,177
She's right, we'll
have to trust them.

251
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,146
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

252
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,948
It all worked out three
years ago, after all.

253
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,683
I hope so.

254
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,718
But tell me, what's gonna happen
if they don't come back?

255
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,553
We can't think like that.

256
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,223
If we want them to succeed,
we have to believe in them.

257
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,158
Everyone must believe.

258
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,329
Our children and the whole
world might depend on it.

259
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,035
DAVIS:
All the Digimon have fallen

260
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,536
into some kind of trance!

261
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,271
They look like Izzy when
he plays video games!

262
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,472
CODY:
They're absorbing the energy

263
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,774
from the beams of light,

264
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,675
like recharging
a battery on a laptop.

265
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,445
Look!

266
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,049
AGUMON: Hi, guys!

267
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,150
BOTH: Whoa!

268
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,386
Hey, look who we brought!

269
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,423
DigiDestined from
all over the world!

270
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,324
Who would've thought
there'd be so many?

271
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,326
The gates opened up
from all over the world,

272
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,761
and they came
to help us out.

273
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,030
And each one of them
has a partner Digimon

274
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,432
who wants
to help out too!

275
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,267
The bond between
the Digidestined

276
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,235
and the Digimon
opened up the gate!

277
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,671
MALOMYOTISMON: (growls)

278
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,142
I knew it was true.

279
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,079
We were never really meant
to be the DigiDestined.

280
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,713
We're not good enough.

281
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,549
What are you talking about?

282
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,952
Well, we don't have partner
Digimon like you guys have.

283
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,954
And all of us
are tainted.

284
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,557
We still carry
the dark spores inside of us.

285
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,125
LITTLE BOY:
Because of them, the only thing

286
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,561
we have to look
forward to is more pain.

287
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,096
KARI:
Oh no, the darkness

288
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,465
is returning!

289
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,935
Yes, just keep thinking
that way, my children.

290
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,837
You guys, he's getting
stronger!

291
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,372
It doesn't matter if you don't
have partner Digimon.

292
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,608
It doesn't matter
if you're not DigiDestined.

293
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,578
You don't need any of that stuff
to have a really good life.

294
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,213
That's easy
for you to say.

295
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,714
You have a Digimon.

296
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,382
We've all got
shortcoming's to face,

297
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,151
and problems we
wish we didn't have,

298
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,486
but you can't just
lie down

299
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,254
and give into all
of your troubles.

300
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,089
Look at Ken,
he didn't give up

301
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,891
when learned Oikawa
was using him.

302
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,459
Everyone has problems,

303
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,162
but everyone has good things
going for them too.

304
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,431
Yeah, but what do we have?

305
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,099
What about all your hopes?

306
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,601
And all of your dreams?

307
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,069
I think they're gone.

308
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,570
Or been taken away.

309
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,939
Geez, could you kids be
a little more negative?

310
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,975
The only person who can
take your dreams away is you

311
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,543
by giving up on them!

312
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,044
So, what's your dream?

313
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,981
Well? I wanna open
a noodle cart!

314
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,282
T. K. AND TOLEI: Huh?

315
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,484
Yeah! What's the matter
with that?

316
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,587
I wanna make the best noodles
in the whole wide world!

317
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,322
That's great, Davis!

318
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,926
Well, actually I...

319
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,595
I always wanted to be
a kindergarten teacher.

320
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,698
Me too.

321
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,467
(groaning in pain)

322
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,136
How about you?

323
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,938
A baseball player!

324
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,173
Agh!

325
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,941
I've always wanted
a bakery.

326
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,409
I love the smell
of fresh bread.

327
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,477
Agh!

328
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,279
I wanted
to draw comic books,

329
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,947
but everyone used
to laugh at me,

330
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,348
so I gave up on it.

331
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:23,416
Gyah!

332
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,651
I get it!

333
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,452
We all had dreams,
but somehow got

334
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,221
the idea
they were worthless,

335
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,323
so we gave up on them
when we shouldn't have.

336
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,524
Right?

337
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,193
Yeah, you can't
let other people

338
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,028
talk you out
of your dreams!

339
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,730
I wish we hadn't wasted
all this time by giving up.

340
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,032
Don't worry!

341
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,567
It's never too late
to go out

342
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,002
and make your dreams
become a reality!

343
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,038
Do you think that
even kids like us

344
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,873
can make our dreams
come true?

345
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,675
Of course! You bet!

346
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,143
Even me?

347
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,844
GROUP: Absolutely!

348
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,813
GROUP: Absolutely for real?

349
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,282
ALL:
Absolutely for real!

350
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,750
(Screaming in pain)

351
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,719
I feel so much happier!

352
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,188
I feel like I can do
anything now!

353
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,157
You can if you believe!

354
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,258
I do!

355
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,393
I believe in myself now!

356
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,561
GROUP: Huh?

357
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,932
Hey there, guys.

358
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,468
Well, aren't you glad
to meet your partner Digimon?

359
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,508
Thanks for believing in us.

360
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,077
A Digivice?

361
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,012
‐ For me?
‐ It's hard to believe.

362
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,413
DAVIS:
What's hard to believe

363
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,649
is how smart a handsome guy
like me can be.

364
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,817
YOLEI:
And humble.

365
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,086
NORIKO:
They're beautiful.

366
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,387
No!

367
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,955
This can't be happening!

368
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,891
These paltry children
can't make me disappear!

369
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,260
I won't allow it!

370
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,594
Quick, everybody.

371
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,929
Use your Digivices
and we'll get

372
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,398
rid of this pesky
darkness forever.

373
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,747
Giga Crusher!

374
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,624
(digital sounds)

375
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,393
We did it!

376
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,428
(cheering)

377
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,497
We destroyed him!

378
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,532
(cheering)

379
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,943
Hey, it's Gennai.

380
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,245
I have a present for you.

381
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,246
Here.

382
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,881
It's my tail ring!

383
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,716
Your tail ring was quite an
important little item,

384
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,750
Gatomon.

385
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,018
It kept the dark powers

386
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,253
of the Digimon emperor's
fortress

387
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,654
from growing out of control,

388
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,324
and it allowed you all
to DNA Digivolve.

389
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,992
And since that's not
necessary anymore,

390
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,026
you get to have it back,

391
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,628
but do me
a little favor.

392
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,330
No big deal, but if you could
keep it away from

393
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,864
the power‐hungry
evil creatures

394
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,199
looking to take over
and destroy the world,

395
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,767
that'd be great.

396
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,670
In all seriousness,
you truly saved the world.

397
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,939
Thank you, to all of you.

398
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,441
We went
to another world too,

399
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,343
different than
the real or digital worlds.

400
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,844
What was that weird place?

401
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,579
Believe it or not,
it's a world that can

402
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,414
grant people's wishes.

403
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,949
Well actually, it is
the power to grant wishes.

404
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,150
Huh?

405
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,119
You know,
the Digital World

406
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,388
also has some of that power
to make dreams come true.

407
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,658
So the Digital World is
basically a mix of digital data

408
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,026
and people's dreams.

409
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,394
I see.

410
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,896
And that ocean, maybe
it has the power

411
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,332
to bring people's
dark thoughts to life.

412
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,167
What about
the dark spores?

413
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,369
Shouldn't they all be taken out?

414
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,003
No, it's all right.

415
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,306
As long as we believe
in ourselves and our dreams,

416
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,042
the dark spores will remain
powerless against us.

417
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,543
That's great, Ken.

418
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,678
(gasps)

419
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,113
Cody!

420
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,014
What are you doing?

421
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,516
CODY: (grunting)

422
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
Almost there.
Don't give up.

423
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,393
Just a little further,
Mr. Oikawa.

424
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,594
Don't give up now.

425
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,262
I don't know if I can.

426
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,997
CODY:
Get up. You have to try.

427
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,566
We're almost
in the Digital World.

428
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,669
Thank you, Cody.

429
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,571
If only
I had your optimism,

430
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,040
I might not have ended up
with such a sad fate,

431
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,143
but I was unable
to maintain hope

432
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,812
through the bad times,
and I drowned in my despair.

433
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,014
If only I'd had
friends like you,

434
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,517
or allowed myself
to have them.

435
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,587
GREEN DIGIMON: Yukio!

436
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,389
What's this?

437
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,057
Who is this Digimon?

438
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,059
I'm Datirimon.

439
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,961
I'm Yukio's partner
Digimon.

440
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,731
Oikawa's partner
Digimon?

441
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,599
Hey, check it out!

442
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,902
This little guy's
here for you, Oikawa!

443
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,870
He's mine?

444
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,605
It's been a long time.

445
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,874
I've been waiting
practically forever.

446
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,844
He's mine.
I don't believe it.

447
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,979
Wait a minute.
Don't you remember me?

448
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,285
Of course.
I remember you.

449
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,921
It's just been so long
since I've seen you,

450
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,123
since my happier days
with Hiroki.

451
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,424
DATIRIMON:
Well, better late than never!

452
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,159
Come into the Digital World.

453
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,661
CODY:
This is your chance.

454
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,296
All you have to do is
stand up and walk into

455
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,398
the Digital World.
Come on!

456
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,066
GENNAI: He may not have
the strength, Cody.

457
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,434
His body was badly damaged

458
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,404
by having MaloMyotismon
inside of him.

459
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm afraid he doesn't
have much time left.

460
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,341
But no!

461
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,312
Is that the Digital World?

462
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,314
It seem so rough.

463
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,815
Somehow unfinished.

464
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,116
GENNAI:
A lot of energy was used up

465
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,351
to defeat MaloMyotismon,

466
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,987
and as a result,
the Digital World itself

467
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,689
has been weakened.
I'm afraid it's going to take

468
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,424
a lot of hard work
to get it back to the way

469
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,593
it used to be before
all of this happened.

470
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,795
The power
of the other world.

471
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,029
(grunting)

472
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,998
The other world?

473
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,434
We can use it
to make dreams come true.

474
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,402
So what do you plan to do?

475
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,137
My body is too weak
to go on,

476
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,807
but I won't need it.

477
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,976
Wait, there must be
another way!

478
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,914
Hold on to your optimism,
and your dreams,

479
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,916
and especially your
friends, Cody.

480
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,885
Perhaps if I had been
more like you,

481
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,486
I could've had adventures too.

482
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,888
You still can!

483
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,823
You finally made it
to the Digital World

484
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,958
and found your partner
Digimon, didn't you?

485
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,361
Mr. Oikawa!

486
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,369
Are you going so soon?

487
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,670
But we just met again.

488
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,438
OIKAWA: <i>Don't worry,</i>

489
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,775
<i>I'll always be here inside</i>
<i>the Digital World.</i>

490
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,810
<i>I shall protect it.</i>

491
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:29,282
<i>Goodbye, DigiDestined,</i>
<i>and thank you.</i>

492
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,150
T. K.:
<i>Oikawa transformed himself</i>

493
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,553
<i>into energy,</i>
<i>and used his life force</i>

494
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,655
<i>to revitalize</i>
<i>the Digital World.</i>

495
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,357
<i>He restored all of the beauty</i>
<i>that was almost completely</i>

496
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,660
<i>destroyed</i>
<i>by MaloMyotismon,</i>

497
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,995
and Oikawa's spirit
is still there

498
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,365
protecting
the Digital World forever.

499
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,067
Hey, Dad.

500
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,036
Come on already,
we have to go.

501
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,904
Right, we don't wanna
be late.

502
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,673
T. K.:
<i>25 years have passed,</i>

503
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,007
<i>and I've become a novelist.</i>

504
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,742
I'm working
on a series of books

505
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,978
about our adventures
in the Digital World.

506
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,180
There've been a lot
of big changes in the world,

507
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,116
and in us since then.

508
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,619
Hey everybody,
look, it's T. K.!

509
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,220
GROUP: Hello!

510
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,524
(greetings)

511
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,892
T. K.:
<i>Now everyone on the planet</i>

512
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,360
<i>knows about</i>
<i>the Digital World,</i>

513
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,861
<i>and has their own</i>
<i>partner Digimon,</i>

514
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,530
<i>but despite all</i>
<i>the changes</i>

515
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,699
<i>that contact with</i>
<i>the Digital world has brought,</i>

516
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,368
<i>one thing has remained</i>
<i>the same: our friendship.</i>

517
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,170
<i>We all still get together,</i>
<i>and those gatherings</i>

518
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>are some of the happiest times</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

519
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,842
<i>Tai and Agumon are diplomats</i>
<i>dealing with relations between</i>

520
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,377
<i>the real and digital worlds.</i>

521
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,412
(chuckles)
and Tai finally cut his hair.

522
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,715
‐ Hey, you wanna play tag?
‐ Yeah.

523
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,583
T. K.: <i>Matt and Gabumon became</i>
<i>an astronaut team</i>

524
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,452
<i>and made it all the way to</i>
<i>Mars,</i>

525
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,421
<i>even though they were only</i>
<i>supposed to go to the Moon.</i>

526
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,589
Now be careful, son.

527
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,324
Aw, how come?

528
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,492
I'll take care of him.

529
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,327
Okay, and I'll take care
of you.

530
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,630
T. K.: <i>Sora and Biyomon are</i>
<i>fashion designers.</i>

531
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,165
<i>Biyomon says their new line</i>
<i>is just to die for.</i>

532
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,166
Try to stay clean.

533
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,935
Nah, go roll in the mud.

534
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,870
T. K.: <i>Joe's the DigiWorld's</i>
<i>first doctor.</i>

535
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,272
<i>Too bad his patients keep</i>
<i>eating his tongue depressors.</i>

536
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,307
Now, remember to share with
the other kids.

537
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,608
Right.

538
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,076
T. K.:
<i>Mimi's cooking show</i>

539
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,911
<i>is the only time</i>
<i>she takes off her hat.</i>

540
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,113
Make sure you don't
act like a ram cache.

541
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,481
Or a SIM chip.

542
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,483
T. K.:
<i>Izzy researches the DigiWorld.</i>

543
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,917
<i>He and his daughter</i>
<i>have their own language.</i>

544
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,953
‐ Ready to have fun?
‐ Mhm!

545
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,155
T. K.: <i>Kari's a teacher. She</i>
<i>actually likes being in school.</i>

546
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,590
Now, whatever happens,

547
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,425
don't get all panicky, okay?

548
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,693
LITTLE BOY: But Mom, that's
what you always do.

549
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,261
(laughing)

550
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,763
T. K.: <i>Yolei and Ken are married</i>
<i>with children,</i>

551
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,531
<i>and Ken and Stingmon</i>
<i>are detectives,</i>

552
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>but Yolei says he</i>
<i>can't seem to detect</i>

553
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,501
<i>when it's his turn</i>
<i>to do the dishes.</i>

554
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,137
Hey Dad, can I sue
if I get tagged it?

555
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,638
T. K.:
<i>Cody's a defense attorney.</i>

556
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>He's bought</i>
<i>a hundred briefcases</i>

557
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,975
<i>cause Armadillomon</i>
<i>keeps sitting on them.</i>

558
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,411
Hey, everybody!
Sorry we're late.

559
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,347
(greetings)

560
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,349
T. K.: <i>Well, Davis finally</i>
<i>opened his noodle cart,</i>

561
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,685
<i>and believe it or not,</i>
<i>it became a huge success.</i>

562
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,853
<i>There are now "Noodle Noodle</i>
<i>Come Get Your Noodle" carts</i>

563
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,355
<i>all over the world.</i>

564
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,190
What are you doing here
standing with your dad?

565
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,558
Go play tag!

566
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,360
Yeah, go show em
what tag's all about!

567
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,828
Alright!

568
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,697
So are you guys ready?

569
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,331
GROUP: Mhm.

570
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,734
DAVIS'S SON: Come on, everybody.
Let's do it!

571
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,136
T. K.: <i>So, you can see</i>
<i>we're still having adventures.</i>

572
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,805
They're just
a little different

573
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,873
than the ones we used
to have when we were kids.

574
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,509
The darkness has
not been conquered,

575
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,713
<i>and it will continue to fight</i>
<i>against the light forever,</i>

576
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,515
<i>but as long as people remember</i>
<i>to follow their dreams,</i>

577
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,551
<i>evil will be kept at bay.</i>

578
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,219
<i>And on days like today,</i>

579
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,755
<i>it's hard to see any</i>
<i>darkness anywhere.</i>

580
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,490
<i>Now it's up to our children,</i>

581
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,759
<i>and to children everywhere</i>
<i>to follow their dreams.</i>

582
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,527
<i>Who know where</i>
<i>they'll end up?</i>

583
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,863
<i>But the only way to find out is</i>
<i>to take that first step</i>

584
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,131
<i>into adventure.</i>

585
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,769
(children speaking)

586
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,208
