‐ [Yolei Voiceover]
I was totally psyched

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,770
to go on a class trip to Kyoto,

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,405
but my trip was rudely
interrupted by BlackWarGreymon

4
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,140
destroying another
Destiny Stone.

5
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,576
I followed him and some
other strange Digimon too.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,612
Shurimon and Stingmon were
able to send them back

7
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,713
to the digital world,

8
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,081
but I had to do a
lot of explaining to

9
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,916
Joe's brother and Sora's father.

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,518
They had their own theory about

11
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,520
how magical creatures had
been known to visit Kyoto.

12
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,788
Right, if they only
knew the truth.

13
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,891
Meanwhile, Arukenimon
told us she has plans

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,793
for a trip of her own to find
the other five Destiny Stones

15
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,262
and destroy them.

16
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,430
That would totally
demolish the digital world!

‐ There must be some
kind of answer out there,

40
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,395
who I am, what I'm meant to do.

41
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,898
Alas, until I find it
I must follow the call

42
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,434
of the Destiny Stones.

43
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,603
‐ This is a pleasant
drive, don't you think?

44
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,438
‐ Well, it would be
if someone didn't keep

45
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,872
interrupting my thoughts.

46
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,874
‐ Sorry, Arukenimon, but
when I'm close to you

47
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,676
I just, just...

48
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,145
‐ Just concentrate
on the driving.

49
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,714
(grunting)

50
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,882
(screaming)

51
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,352
‐ Yum!
‐ I'll say!

52
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,586
‐ Mmm! These snacks

53
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,421
sure are scrumdillyicious!

54
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,156
‐ I could eat them all day.

55
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,324
‐ Hey!

56
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,461
That's not fair,
save one for me.

57
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,062
‐ [All Three] Just one!

58
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,831
‐ I never thought I'd see
BlackWarGreymon in Kyoto.

59
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,499
That wasn't in the
travel brochure.

60
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,534
‐ I don't understand
why he showed up there.

61
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,870
‐ Well, Sora's father
said that Kyoto is

62
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,872
at a kind of crossroads
where the spiritual world

63
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,541
and our world sometimes
cross over each other.

64
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,277
That's why they built
all those temples there

65
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,913
to protect this world from
otherworldly creatures.

66
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,082
And they say that every
Halloween night you can

67
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,552
see twisted ghostly figures
wandering the streets of Kyoto.

68
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,921
‐ Those stories don't scare me,

69
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,391
though they would be something
to consider if they're true.

70
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,026
‐ Are they?
‐ (chuckles)

71
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,328
‐ But if a Digimon
appeared in the real world

72
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,063
that's not just a child's story,

73
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,866
that means the digital world's
plane is really off kilter.

74
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,267
‐ Yeah.

75
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,436
‐ But wait, if the digital
world's plane is off kilter,

76
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,338
why is affecting our world?

77
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,673
‐ It's like this.

78
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,541
Imagine this is
the digital world,

79
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,778
and this line is our
world, the real world.

80
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,913
Normally they're
kept separately,

81
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,050
but if the plane gets off kilter
they start mixing together

82
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,285
and then nothing's normal.

83
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,621
‐ Thanks, even I understand now.

84
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,890
‐ Thank Gotomon.
She explained it.

85
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,324
Mm‐hmm.

86
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,760
And that dark ocean
is another world too.

87
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,998
‐ That's not all.
‐ Huh?

88
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,366
I'd be willing to bet
that there's a whole bunch

89
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,967
of other worlds
out there as well.

90
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,902
Like this.

91
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,639
‐ Like a rainbow.

92
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,774
‐ But look what happens if
the balance is destroyed.

93
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,177
Looks like it's all
going down the drain.

94
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,280
‐ Black.

95
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,750
‐ And in the end every world
might be covered in darkness.

96
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,286
As dark as a black
cat at midnight.

97
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,954
‐ We can't let that happen.

98
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,622
‐ You're right, and
that's exactly why

99
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,126
we have to protect the
remaining destiny stones.

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,160
‐ Hi.

101
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,895
‐ Hey Izzy, great timing.

102
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:49,963
Just hold on.

103
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,299
I got you a
decorative dish towel.

104
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,934
Cute, huh?

105
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,002
‐ Yeah, thanks Yolei, and I
have a gift for you guys too.

106
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,704
‐ You hate the towel, right?

107
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,807
‐ I've written an algorithm
for the D3 and D terminal.

108
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,576
Once I transfer it in,
we'll be able

109
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,946
to use the D terminal to
see the rift in the plane.

110
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,180
There we go.

111
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,715
‐ Wow Izzy, this is great.

112
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,351
We can use this to track
down BlackWarGreymon.

113
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,286
‐ [Izzy] Well gee, it's
the least I could do

114
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,522
after Yolei got me
that neat towel.

115
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,324
‐ So, you do like the towel.
Yay!

116
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,160
‐ Let's go mop up
BlackWarGreymon.

117
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,095
‐ Wait, I've got mail.

118
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,031
‐ Geez Kari, you'd think
that "I've got mail"

119
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,099
is your middle name.

120
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,101
‐ Yeah, Kari, check that later.

121
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,303
Digiport open!

122
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,372
Let's go save the
Digiworld one more time!

123
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,875
(rock music)

124
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,786
‐ Where's BlackWarGreymon?

125
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,320
I want to teach him
a lesson or two.

126
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,989
‐ [Veemon] Or three.
‐ [Davis] Or four.

127
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,657
‐ He's over that way.
‐ All right, then let's go.

128
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,459
‐ [Davis] Aww, I got
sand between my toes.

129
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,894
‐ [Yolei] And your ears.

130
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,329
‐ The Destiny Stone
almost looks too beautiful

131
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,632
to destroy, but I must.

132
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,233
‐ [Digimon] Boy, I
sure wish I could fly,

133
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,468
and so do my poor feet.

134
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,136
‐ We're getting really close.

135
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,437
‐ [Digimon] It's about time.

136
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,539
Hey, it's Ken.

137
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,140
‐ [Ken] Davis, hurry up.

138
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,508
‐ I'm trying to.

139
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,910
‐ Well, hurry faster.

140
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,578
‐ [Davis] Don't wait
for me, go on ahead.

141
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,546
‐ Okay.

142
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,583
‐ Terra Destroyer.

143
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,556
‐ [Arukenimon] My,
my, my, such power.

144
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,293
‐ [Mummymon] Yeah,
but he only nicked it.

145
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,496
‐ [BlackWarGreymon]
Terra Destroyer.

146
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,632
‐ [Mummymon] Now
that's a solid shot.

147
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,603
‐ Now only four stones remain.

148
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,374
‐ What?
‐ Huh?

149
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,475
‐ Could this be it?

150
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,611
The foe I've been searching for?

151
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,346
Perhaps I'm drawing him closer

152
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,748
by destroying the
Destiny Stones.

153
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:49,749
‐ [Mummymon] Do you see that?

154
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,951
‐ Gee, I'm not sure,

155
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,519
it's only a hundred feet tall.

156
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,555
Well, whatever it
was, it's gone now.

157
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,091
‐ No, no, this can't be.

158
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,661
After all my searching, my
opponent can't just run away.

159
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,697
No!!!

160
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,634
I must destroy another
stone to draw out my foe.

161
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,203
‐ He is not happy.

162
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,873
‐ Yes, but I am.

163
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,709
‐ But what if that creature in
the Destiny Stone gets loose,

164
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,478
and then gets mad at us for
creating BlackWarGreymon?

165
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,746
‐ Big deal.

166
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,548
‐ You sure?

167
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,916
‐ [Arukenimon] Yes,
you sniveling coward,

168
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,284
now step on it!

169
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,585
Ah! Slow down!

170
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,121
‐ [Kari] Oh no.

171
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,591
‐ We got here too late.

172
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,126
‐ Another Stone destroyed.

173
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,427
‐ [Yolei] What'll we do?

174
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,629
At this rate, they'll
all be destroyed

175
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,464
before we can stop
BlackWarGreymon!

176
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,999
‐ No.

177
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,067
There's no way
I'm going to stand by

178
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,536
and let some soulless creature
made from evil Control Spires

179
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,405
destroy the Digital World.

180
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,707
I want that ugly
thing destroyed!

181
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,110
‐ [Cody Voiceover] I've
never seen TK so angry.

182
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,912
No, that's not true.

183
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,446
In the tunnels...

184
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,485
Ohh! It's like there are
two sides to him,

185
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,020
two people inside him.

186
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,554
‐ OK, we'll have all
the digimon in the area

187
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,823
locate the other Destiny Stones.

188
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,127
That should give us the
edge over BlackWarGreymon.

189
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,362
‐ [Cody Voiceover] So
who is talking now?

190
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,365
The rational TK,
or the angry one?

191
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,534
Which one is the real TK?

192
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,703
‐ It galls me to
have been so close

193
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,772
to the opponent I
so hungrily seek,

194
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,007
only to have him
ripped away from me.

195
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,442
I must find him.

196
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,814
‐ See ya tomorrow, guys.

197
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,251
‐ Hasta la‐‐ um, boing ba‐‐
uh, see ya.

198
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,286
( laughing )

199
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,554
‐ Huh?

200
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,222
Cody, don't you
have kendo practice?

201
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,257
‐ What's that?

202
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,526
Oh, yes, I do, thank you.

203
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,928
‐ Hmm.

204
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,998
‐ What's up with you, Cody?

205
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,032
You seem sad.

206
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,869
Is it BlackWarGreymon?

207
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:54,207
‐ No, Upamon, it's...TK.

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,608
I'm worried that he
and I will have to

209
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,244
DNA digivolve together soon.

210
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,514
‐ But there'd be nothing
better, would there?

211
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,216
‐ I don't know.

212
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,485
I thought I knew who TK
was, but now it's like he...

213
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,789
Sometimes it seems like he's
a completely different person.

214
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,291
‐ Maybe you're just
getting to know him better.

215
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,059
Just because you see
a new side to someone

216
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,928
it doesn't mean it's a bad side.

217
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,097
Look at us digimon, we
change all the time,

218
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,832
and I don't hear you
complaining about us

219
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,700
getting you out
of tough scrapes,

220
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,236
unless you do it
when I'm not around.

221
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,006
You don't do it when
I'm not around, do you?

222
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,241
(Cody laughs)

223
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,943
‐ [TK Voiceover] No, no!

224
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,278
I've got to stop BlackWarGreymon
before he destroys

225
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,682
the Digital World and all
the digimon along with it.

226
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,551
Angemon! Angemon, no!

227
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,652
Ah!

228
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,023
(TK breathing heavily)

229
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,193
You're safe.

230
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,332
‐ Soon, we shall
meet, my nemesis,

231
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,835
and I will find a
purpose for my existence.

232
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,637
‐ [Kari] It's scary up here.

233
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,772
‐ [Davis] There's
nothing to be afraid of,

234
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,806
just don't look down.

235
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,174
‐ [Kari] Oh, I looked down.

236
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,610
And now I can't
<i>stop</i> looking down.

237
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,512
( bridge creaking )

238
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,647
Just a few more steps.

239
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,083
‐ Come on, Kari.

240
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,919
‐ Whoa!

241
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,220
‐ Kari!

242
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,822
Huh?

243
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,091
‐ Are you okay now, Kari?

244
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,692
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

245
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,228
‐ I'm too slow.

246
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,365
‐ Did the digimon find where
the other Destiny Stones are?

247
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,267
‐ I'd bet my nine lives.

248
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,102
‐ Yeah.
‐ Undoubtedly.

249
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,241
‐ Looks like it's
me and you, Cody.

250
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,376
‐ Yep.

251
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,710
‐ Hey, don't overlook me.

252
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,012
‐ Ah, Gabumon!

253
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,381
‐ Hi guys.

254
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,550
There's a Destiny Stone
just over these mountains.

255
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,085
‐ Thanks, Gabumon!

256
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,719
Well, a little hike
never hurt anyone.

257
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,089
‐ Yeah, unless of course
your boots are too small.

258
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,691
Listen, there's something
else I need to tell you.

259
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,859
It seems that‐‐

260
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,494
‐ You can tell us, Gabumon.

261
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,030
‐ BlackWarGreymon has a heart.

262
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,364
‐ He what?!

263
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,201
‐ I know it may be hard
to believe, but it's true.

264
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,602
‐ But how?

265
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,838
I mean, he's only made
from Control Spires, right?

266
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,273
‐ I know, I know, but
Agumon told me so!

267
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,975
No creature without
a heart could ask

268
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,177
the soul‐searching
questions he asks.

269
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,913
‐ But then, why is he
always fighting us,

270
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,717
and trying to destroy
all the Destiny Stones?

271
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,053
‐ This only he can answer.

272
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,288
‐ But how can we
destroy BlackWarGreymon

273
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,857
if he's got a heart?

274
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,593
It'd be like destroying
you, Armadillomon.

275
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,827
‐ What should we do?

276
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,028
‐ No, no.

277
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,098
We have to destroy
BlackWarGreymon.

278
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,634
Even if he has a heart,
it has been turned evil

279
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,336
by the powers of darkness.

280
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,938

let your anger rule you, TK?

281

‐ [Gabumon] Be wary
of the dark powers.

283
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,751
‐ Now let's go save us
some Destiny Stones!

‐ Well, let's go.

285
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,358
‐ You know, TK, you can go
with the others if you want.

286
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,559
It won't bother me.

287
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,627
‐ That's okay.

288
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,028
Take care, Gabumon.

289

‐ You too.
‐ Thanks.

290

minute, and so nice the next?

I just don't understand. Hmm.

296
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,353
Would he really
destroy BlackWarGreymon

297
