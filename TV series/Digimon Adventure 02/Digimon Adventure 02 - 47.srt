00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:04,999
WHILE THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
THOSE DARK SPORE KIDS AROUND
TO SEE IF THEY WOULD
LEAD THEM TO OWIKAWA,

2
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:07,132
TAI AND KARI
CAME TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

3
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:08,399
GABUMON AND I
HAD FOUND OUT

4
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:10,299
THAT BLACK WARGREYMON
WAS ON EARTH,

5
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,432
AND WE WERE SURE HE WAS
UP TO NO GOOD.

6
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,332
AZULONGMON GAVE ME
ENOUGH ENERGY

7
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,332
TO WARP-DIGIVOLVE,
AND I WENT WITH TAI

8
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:19,132
TO STOP BLACK WARGREYMON
FROM DESTROYING OWIKAWA.

DEFEATED BLACK WARGREYMON.

TO PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY,

11
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,866
BUT WORMMON GAVE HIM
A PIECE OF HIS MIND.

THAT MONSTERS HAVE BEEN
APPEARING WORLDWIDE,

46
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,706
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
HAVE BEEN HESITANT

47
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,806
TO RESPOND. THEY'VE
DISMISSED THESE SIGHTINGS

48
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,372
AS THE WORK
OF PRACTICAL JOKERS

AND GOOFBALLS.

50
00:01:58,772 --> 00:01:59,772
HOWEVER, RECENT INCIDENTS
HAVE PROMPTED OFFICIALS

51
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:01,746
TO TAKE THE ISSUE
SERIOUSLY.

52
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:02,912
IN A PRESS CONFERENCE
TODAY,

53
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,679
IT WAS REVEALED THAT
THESE SO-CALLED MONSTERS

UNIDENTIFIED LIFE FORMS.

THE HOME DEFENSE FORCE

IN THE MEANTIME,

58
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,979
THE PUBLIC IS BEING
STRONGLY CAUTIONED

59
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,146
NOT TO PANIC,
AND TO STAY CALM,

60
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:17,712
SO DON'T MONSTER-PROOF
YOUR HOMES YET, FOLKS.

61
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:20,245
THEY SAY THAT IT'S PROBABLY
NOTHING BUT A SILLY HOAX.

HEAR A NOISE?

00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,679
IT'S JUST
MY STOMACH GROWLING.

65
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,712
I THINK I HEAR IT COMING
FROM SOMEWHERE DOWN THERE.

66

HEY, IT TOOK
MY PRUNE JUICE!

67

UH-OH,
I MADE A BOO-BOO.

IN FRONT OF ME,

HELP MYSELF.

71

SORRY.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

72
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,212
GRANDPA, I'M SORRY
FOR KEEPING THIS FROM YOU,

73
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,612
BUT IT'S JUST THAT I--

74
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:48,712
AHA! I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON.

75

WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

76
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,079
THAT STUFFED ANIMAL'S GOT

77
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:52,879
MORE THAN COTTON BALLS
IN HIS STOMACH.

78
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,979
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

79
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,212
LET ME GUESS,
HE'S NOT FROM THIS WORLD.

80
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,846
HE'S BEEN TRANSPORTED
FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION,

81
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,019
MAYBE A DIGITAL ONE.

82
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,952
AM I HEARING YOU RIGHT,
GRANDPA?

83
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,619
YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE DIGITAL WORLD?

84
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,919
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT IT?

85

ARE CALLING IT
THESE DAYS.

87
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,619
WELL, I SUPPOSE IT WAS
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

88
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,752
I KNEW I'D HAVE
TO TELL YOU AT SOME POINT,

BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO DO IT SO SOON.

90
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:18,252
YOU SEE, CODY,
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR DAD.

91
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:20,586
WHEN HE WAS JUST
A YOUNG RASCAL LIKE YOU,

92
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:22,086
HE ALWAYS TALKED
ABOUT GOING

93
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,486
TO SOME STRANGE PLACE
LIKE A DIGITAL WORLD.

94
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,219
YOU MEAN MY DAD
KNEW ABOUT IT, TOO?

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,152
I DIDN'T THINK
TOO MUCH OF IT AT FIRST

96
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:29,886
BECAUSE HE WAS
ALWAYS INTERESTED

97
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,819
IN VIDEO GAMES
AND THINGS OF THAT SORT,

98
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,686
BUT SUDDENLY
HE STARTED DOING THINGS

99
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,052
THAT REALLY
WORRIED ME.

100
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:37,019
SOMETIMES HE'D BE
PLAYING A GAME,

101
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,152
AND HE'D ACT LIKE HE WAS
SEEING THINGS

102
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,752
THAT NO ONE ELSE DID,

103
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,752
AS IF THE CHARACTERS
ACTUALLY CAME TO LIFE.

104
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:45,086
HE'D SIT AT THAT TV
FOR HOURS IN A TRANCE.

105
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:47,686
SOMETIMES HE'D EVEN
CARRY ON CONVERSATIONS,

106

I THOUGHT
WITH HIMSELF.

107
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:51,586
IT GAVE ME THE WILLIES,
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

108
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:52,686
DAD DID THAT?

109

PLAYING AROUND,

THEY WERE REAL.

00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:32,303
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S QUICHE OR SQUASH,

159
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:33,903
AS LONG AS IT'S EDIBLE.

LEAVE MY THINGS ALONE!
NOW GO AWAY!

Woman: I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU NEEDED ANY HELP.

164

NO, NO, NO!

165
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,203
THIS IS BAD.
THAT SPORE IS GROWING FAST.

YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

WITH THAT SCREAM.

SHE'S PROGRESSING VERY NICELY,

AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT,

171
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:59,703

NO WAY.
I'M NOT MOVING.

COME ON,
WHY BE MERELY ORDINARY?

176
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:10,043
IT'S BETTER THAN BEING
CONTROLLED BY A FIEND.

177
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,043
NOBODY IS BEING CONTROLLED.
THEY ALL ASKED FOR IT.

IS GRANT THEIR WISHES.

BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

189
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,510
A SUPERIOR BEING IS SOMEONE WHO
HELPS AND CARES ABOUT OTHERS.

THAT EVERYONE SAID
WAS IMPOSSIBLE,

212
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,783
BUT YOU ALWAYS ENCOURAGED ME
TO KEEP TRYING.

214
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,983

HAPPINESS IS AN ILLUSION.

221
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,750
LIFE'S UGLY AND CRUEL.

222
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,083

COME BACK TO HAUNT ME?

223

HE'S DEAD.

224

I CAN'T LET HIS MEMORY
KEEP ME FROM MY DESTINY.

225
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:09,590
YOU WON'T CHANGE MY MIND.
I WON'T LET YOU!

226

YOU'D UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO ACCOMPLISH.

229
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,523
I MADE DIGITAL COPIES
OF MY OWN DNA.

230
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,156
THE COPIES
WERE COMPUTER-GENERATED

A BEAUTY CONTEST.

00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,096
THAT CONVERSATION
WITH BLACK WARGREYMON.

TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

265
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:35,963
I NEED TO KNOW --

266
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:37,963
WOULD YOU SAY MY DAD
WAS A GOOD GUY?

267
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,330
HMM? YOUR DAD WAS
A VERY GOOD GUY.

268
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,863
HE WAS AS GOOD AS THEY COME.

269
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,530
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, CODY?

270
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,596
I MET A MAN YESTERDAY
WHO SAID THAT HE'D KNOWN HIM.

271
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,996
I WAS JUST CURIOUS ABOUT IT,
THAT'S ALL.

272
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,463
IS THAT SO?
WHAT WAS THE MAN'S NAME?

273
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,530
HE TOLD ME HIS NAME
WAS OWIKAWA.

I'M SORRY I FOLLOWED YOU.
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

THERE'S SOMETHING

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,536
AH, PLEASE. WHY SHOULD I CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY?

283
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:25,470
NOW THAT YOU'RE
AN ORDINARY KID AGAIN,

284
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,770
YOU'RE JUST AN INSECT TO ME.

285
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,903
YOU GAVE IT ALL UP --
THE BRAINS, THE POWER --

286
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,803
AND FOR WHAT?
SO PEOPLE WOULD LIKE YOU?

287
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:31,970
NO, SO I WOULD LIKE MYSELF.

288
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,803
POWER GAVE ME NOTHING
BUT LONELINESS.

289

YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME,
NORIKO.

290
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,570
THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER.

291
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,736
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO
TELL ME THAT THE ANSWER

292
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:41,303
IS HAVING FRIENDS AND PARENTS
WHO LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

293
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:42,836
GIVE ME A BREAK.
THAT'S JUST SAD.

294
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,770
I BET YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

295
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,270
I'M SURE NOT BUYING IT.

296

[ Thinking ] THIS IS GOING TO
BE HARDER THAN I THOUGHT,

298
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,270
I CAN'T LET HER SUFFER

00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,515
IT WASN'T NORMAL,

468
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,081
BUT THEN, HIROKI HAD BEEN
YOUR ONLY FRIEND.

469
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:52,081
I WISH I COULD HAVE
SEEN IT COMING.

470
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:55,048
I WOULD HAVE TRIED
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU.

471
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:58,015
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
SO SAD IN MY LIFE.

472
00:17:58,115 --> 00:18:01,981
I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS
A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO WATCH.

473
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,081
YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED
IN HEARING THIS,

474
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,081
BUT I'D LIKE TO BE
YOUR FRIEND.

475
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,955
IT WOULD BE NICE TO TALK
TO SOMEONE ABOUT MY SON.

476
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,921
DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT?

477
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:14,888
HUH? YOU MUST MISS HIM
EVEN MORE THAN I DO.

478
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:17,388
UHH!

479
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:22,788
AHH!

480
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,421
GRR.

481
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,155
GET AWAY FROM THERE,
GRANDPA!

482
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:30,155
Armadillomon: HE'S NOT LOOKING
TOO NEIGHBORLY TO ME.

483
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:36,421
Both: BLACK WARGREYMON!

484
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:39,955
Cody: WOW. DID YOU SEE THAT?
HE PROTECTED GRANDPA.

485
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,921
HA HA HA HA!

486
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,888
OH, NO! YOU!

487
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,888
IT CAN'T BE. NO!

488
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:51,255
T.K.: THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
MORE TO THIS THAN WE CAN SEE.

489
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:54,188
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO BLIND?

490
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:56,055
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

491
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:58,455
YOU'RE PERFECTLY RIGHT
ABOUT BEING ALONE.

492
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,221
WE'RE BOTH DOOMED
TO REMAIN THIS WAY FOREVER.

493
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:03,421
THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER CHOICE.

494
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,188
HE'S CONTROLLING YOU.

495
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:07,755
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

496
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,395
YOU'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE
FOR SOMEONE SO NARROW-MINDED.

497
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:12,695
I HAVE TO HARVEST
ALL THE DARK SPORES

498
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:15,095
IN ORDER FOR ME TO FULFILL
MY DEEPEST DESIRE.

499
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,728
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

500
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:20,095
HA HA HA HA HA!

501
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,095
HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED

502
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,461
INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD
EVER AGAIN!

503
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,461
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, AGAIN?

504
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:28,361
AGAIN? NOBODY EVER
TELLS ME ANYTHING.

505
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:29,828
YOU ALL RIGHT, BIG GUY?

506
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:31,961
MY BODY'S NOT GOING TO LAST
MUCH LONGER.

507
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,961
THE IMAGE CREATED
BY THE CONTROL SPIRES

508
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,795
WILL SOON START
TO BREAK UP,

509
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,095
BUT THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

510
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,761
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

511
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:44,728
NO. MY STRENGTH IS MY FINAL GIFT
TO YOU, MY FRIENDS.

512
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:47,128
I WILL SEAL
THE HIGHTON VIEW TERRACE GATE

513
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,895
WITH MY OWN BODY.

514
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,195
DON'T DO IT.

515
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,328
I MUST.

516
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:56,095
AAH!

517
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,128
HE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
MEANINGFUL WITH HIS LIFE.

518
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,128
I'D SAY
THIS DEFINITELY QUALIFIES.

519
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,901
BLACK WARGREYMON.

520
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,901
BLACK WARGREYMON!

521
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:18,401
BLACK WARGREYMON!

522
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,901
Voice: I WISH THERE HAD BEEN
ANOTHER WAY.

523
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,868
OOH! WHAT'S THAT?

524
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,635
AHH.

525
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,635
THANK YOU,
BLACK WARGREYMON.

526
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:30,868
YOU'RE A TRUE A FRIEND,
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

527
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,868
BLACK WARGREYMON
SEALED THE GATE,

528
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,268
BUT WILL THE IMPOSTOR
THAT'S CONTROLLING OWIKAWA

529
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,268
FIND A WAY TO GET THROUGH?

530
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:39,135
FIND OUT
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

531
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,035
OF "DIGIMON --
DIGITAL MONSTERS."
