00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,797

GARURUMON IS DOING
THE SAME THING!

THERE'S STILL ONE MORE

CAN GET THAT ONE, TOO.

46
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:59,437
I DON'T THINK HE CAN.
HE'S TOO FAR FROM THAT AREA.

47
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,670
TAI'S RIGHT.

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,103

YOUR SHOES AND SOCKS!

WE CAN COME UP
WITH A NEW PLAN.

WE CAN TALK TO IZZY.

I'VE NEVER BEEN A QUITTER.

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,537
I AGREE.
DAVIS, LET'S REGROUP.

66
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,537
DAVIS, DON'T BE SO STUBBORN.

67
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:58,037
THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY
OF THEM.

68
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,510
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

69
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,477
Kari: I AGREE.
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

70
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:05,443
OH, ALL RIGHT...

71
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,410

79
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,743
IF WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP DOING THIS?

80
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,243
THE TV WAS BLOWN UP
AS WE CAME THROUGH,

81
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,710
SO WE CAN'T GO BACK.

82
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,210
WHERE DID KARI GO?

83
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,677
SHE'S TRAPPED

84
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,710
IN THE DIGITAL WORLD!

85
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:48,536
I'LL SEND THE OTHERS A MESSAGE
SAYING WE'RE OKAY.

86
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,502
I DON'T THINK
THIS HAS SPELL CHECK.

87
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:53,436
KARI, IF WE FIND OURSELVES
IN ANY KIND OF JAM,

00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,436
I CAN ALWAYS ARMOR DIGEVOLVE.

89
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,469
WELL, LET'S SAVE THAT
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.

90
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,436
Yoli: THE GATE IS CLOSED.
WE CAN'T GET TO HER.

91
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:03,442
T.K.,
WASN'T KARI BEHIND YOU

92
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,426
WHEN YOU WENT INTO THE GATE
FROM THE DIGITAL WORLD?

93
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:09,026
MM-HMM.

94
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,526
WHY DIDN'T YOU LET HER
GO FIRST?

95
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,026
IT WAS NO ONE'S FAULT.
IT JUST HAPPENS.

96
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,826
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

97
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,793
I STILL KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S
BEING A JERK.

98
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,860
OH, I GUESS THAT'S ME.

99
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,860
THE TRUTH IS,
DAVIS IS RIGHT.

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,760
HUH?
HUH?

101
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,760
IT REALLY WAS MY FAULT.

102
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,993
I SHOULD'VE BEEN WATCHING OUT
FOR HER ALL ALONG.

103
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:32,926
WELL, I GUESS
I COULD'VE, TOO.

104
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,426
SO COULD I.

105
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,526
Cody: THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
THERE'S NO ONE TO BLAME.

106
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:38,893
HUH?

107
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,393
HEY, GUYS,
IT'S AN E-MAIL FROM KARI.

108
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:42,860
HUH?
HUH?

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,860
IT SAYS, "I'M ALL RIGHT.

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,860
I'M SORRY IF ANY WORDS ARE
MISSPELLED. SINCERELY, KARI."

111
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,793
YOLI, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

112
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,793
IF I CAN FIND AN AREA
CLOSE TO THE ONE SHE'S IN,

113
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,793
THEN I CAN REACH HER.

114
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,793
GOT IT!
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

115
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:59,260
I'M GOING, TOO!

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,793
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

117
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:03,300
IF HE THINKS I'M GOING
TO STAND BY

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,300
AND LET HIM BE THE HERO,
HE CAN FORGET IT!

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
WHAT? THEN I'M GOING.

120
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,700
YOLI, WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'S ALMOST DINNERTIME.

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
THEIR FAMILIES ARE GOING
TO WONDER WHERE THEY ARE.

122
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,666
WE HAVE TO TELL TAI
AND THE OTHERS.

123
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,166
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST THING
YOU AND I CAN DO

124
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,666
TO HELP DAVIS AND T.K.
RIGHT NOW.

125
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,166
CODY, I KNOW
YOU'RE JUST A KID,

126
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,133
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
THE WISDOM OF AN OLD MAN OF 20.

127
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:31,133
BUT WAIT! YOU CAN'T
JUST GO OUT IN PUBLIC!

128
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,133
Davis: [ Sarcastically ]
THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA,

129
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,133
CROSSING THE DESERT
WITHOUT ANY WATER.

130
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,433
THERE'S THE CITY!

131
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,966
LOOKS LIKE ONE
OF THOSE THINGS YOU SHAKE

132
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,466
AND IT STARTS SNOWING.

133
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,466
I'LL GET KARI. WAIT HERE.

134
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,933
NO, I'LL GET KARI.
<i>YOU</i> WAIT HERE.

135
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:48,466
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WE'LL FLIP FOR IT.

136
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:50,900
WINNER GOES.
LOSER STAYS HERE.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,733
SINCE IT'S MY COIN,
I GET TO CALL IT. TAILS.

138
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,566
OKAY, IF IT'S TAILS,
I RESCUE KARI.

139
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,200
IF IT'S HEADS,
YOU GET TO GO.

140
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,666
TAILS!

141
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,173
I'LL TELL HER THAT
YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT HER

142
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,173
AND THAT YOU WERE -- AAH!

143
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:09,673
A COIN THAT HAS TAILS
ON BOTH SIDES.

144
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:12,173
THAT'S HOW I USED
TO BEAT MATT.

145
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,640
HOW ABOUT THAT?

146
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,106
LET'S BOTH GO.

147
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,406
OKAY, T.M.

148
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,340
DID YOU REALLY USE ONE
OF THOSE COINS ON MATT?

149
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,906
YEAH, THAT'S HOW I GOT
ALL MY BASEBALL CARDS

150
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,306
AND HIS OLD GUITAR.

151
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,240

00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,637
FLAMEDRAMON, YOU'LL HAVE
TO USE ALL YOUR POWER!

316
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,337
YOU'VE GOT IT!

317
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:21,537
FLAMING FIST!

318
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,470
LIGHTNING BLADE!

319
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,037
Both: [ GASP ]

320
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,337
V-MON, SPEAK TO ME.

321
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:35,003
YOU'RE KNEELING
ON MY TAIL.

322
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:37,337
STAR SHOWER!

323
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:41,270
LIGHTNING BLADE!

324
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,337
AAH!
AAH!

325
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:47,270
I'LL HAVE TWO CHEESEBURGERS
AND A LARGE ORDER OF FRIES.

326
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,703
THAT DIDN'T WORK.
SO WHAT NOW?

327
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,770
ANDROMON, DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE FOUGHT TOGETHER

328
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,103
SIDE BY SIDE?

329
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,603
KARI, WE HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

330
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:01,703
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S THE SAME ANDROMON.

331
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,203
EVEN IF IT IS,

332
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,443
HE'S UNDER THE CONTROL
OF THE DIGIMON EMPEROR.

333
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,910
HE CAN'T EVEN HEAR
YOUR VOICE.

334
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,410
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

335
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,643
AS MUCH
AS I LIKE YOU TWO ARGUING,

336
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,810
HE'S HEADING RIGHT FOR US!

337
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,710
LET'S GO!

338
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,110
YEAH!
ALL RIGHT!

339
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,977
HERE COMES HELP NOW!

340
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,943
I'M GLAD
WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.

341
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:32,410
HI, GUYS!

342
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,410
I THOUGHT,
SINCE I WAS HERE,

343
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,410
I'D BUILD THIS CITY
A SUBWAY SYSTEM!

344
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,343
HOLD STILL,
YOU PILE OF SCRAP METAL!

345
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,777
GOLD RUSH!

346
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:47,843
HUH? HEY, THAT COMMENT ABOUT
SCRAP METAL WAS JUST A JOKE.

347
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:50,210
Tai: KARI, ARE YOU OKAY?

348
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,677
YEAH, BUT, TAI,
IT'S ANDROMON!

349
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,643
ANDROMON, SLOW DOWN!

350
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,610
IT'S ME -- TAI.

351
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,543
TAI WHO?

352
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,550
Andromon: OH, TAI!

353
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,017
WHOA!

354
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,950
KARI, LOOK OUT!

355
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,383
All: [ GASP ]

356
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,883
HEY, YOU PUT HER DOWN NOW!

357
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,817
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

358
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,750
I AM...TRYING.

359
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,750
YES.

360
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,683
WE ALL TOOK A PICTURE
TOGETHER.

361
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:48,417
A PICTURE?

362
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:58,150
Andromon: <i>FACES...</i>

363
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,483
<i>LONG AGO.</i>

364
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,317
<i>DIGIDESTINED...</i>

365
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,490
<i>I LOVE JIGSAW PUZZLES.</i>

366
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,623
NOW I SEE THE COMPLETE PICTURE.

367
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,990
KARI,

368
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,557
I'M SORRY FOR THE TROUBLE
I'VE CAUSED.

369
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,323
ANDROMON!

370
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:27,357
MM-HMM!

371
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,990
THAT CONTROL SPIRE
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THIS.

372
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,757
WELL, NO MORE.

373
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:37,190
GATLING ATTACK!

374
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,590
Kari: ANDROMON,
ARE ALL OF THESE GUARDROMON

375
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,590
GOING TO STAY BROKEN
FOREVER?

376
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,590
NO, THEIR PROGRAMS
WERE REWRITTEN

377
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,090
BY THE DIGIMON EMPEROR.

378
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,123
THEY JUST NEED
TO BE REPROGRAMMED. WATCH.

379
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,123
ACTUALLY, ONCE I REPROGRAM
THE GUARDROMON,

380
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,123
I'LL STAY HERE
TO PROTECT THEM

381
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:05,430
IN CASE
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR RETURNS.

382
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,763
I FEEL FRESH AS A DAISY.

383
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,227
Tai: COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GO HOME.

384
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,461
♪ OH-OH, OH-OH,
OH-AY-OH ♪

385
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:21,294
♪ OH-OH, OH-OH ♪

386
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,927
♪ HERE WE GO ♪

387
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:26,894
IZZY, WERE YOU WAITING
THIS WHOLE TIME?

388
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:29,027
SHH. LET'S GO.

389
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:34,994
MATT JUST CALLED AND TOLD ME
WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH KARI,

390
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,694
AND I'M REALLY UPSET YOU GUYS
HAVE LEFT ME OUT OF THE LOOP.

391
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:41,127
CODY CALLED TAI FOR HELP,
AND TAI CALLED MATT.

392
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:43,661
NO ONE CALLS ME
UNTIL THE ADVENTURE IS OVER.

393
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:46,227
THERE WAS JUST NO TIME
TO CALL YOU.

394
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,561
YOU'RE A BIG PART
OF THE TEAM.

395
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,627
THAT'S RIGHT,

396
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,627
AND AS A TEAM MEMBER,

397
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:54,094
I EXPECT TO BE TREATED
WITH THE SAME RESPECT

398
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,094
I GIVE TO ALL OF YOU.

399
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:59,061
I'VE GOTTEN US OUT OF JAMS
WITH MY PARTICULAR SKILLS.

400
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,061
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL YOU.

401
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:04,027
THAT'S WHAT I CALL RESPECT.
OKAY, I FORGIVE YOU.

402
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:06,561
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT
THE REASON I CAME HERE.

403
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:08,567
I EXAMINED THE NEW DIGIVICES

404
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:11,501
AND DETERMINED THAT THEY HAVE
THREE DIFFERENT SETTINGS --

405
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,001
DIGITAL, DETECT,
AND DISCOVER.

406
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,501
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL THEM
D-3s FROM NOW ON.

407
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,467
PRODIGIOUS LITTLE DEVICES,
AREN'T THEY?

408
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,467
I HAD HELP WITH THE RESEARCH

409
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,467
FROM MY FRIEND WALLACE
IN AMERICA.

410
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,567
MAYBE YOU GUYS
WILL MEET HIM SOMEDAY.

411
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,067
THE D-3s
MIGHT HAVE SENT A MESSAGE

412
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,434
TO ANDROMON'S MEMORY BANKS,
WHICH THEN -- AAH!

413
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,434
PLEASE FINISH TALKING
AFTER WE EAT.

414
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:32,401
WE FORGOT ABOUT DINNER.

415
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,901
THAT'S RIGHT. OUR PARENTS
ARE WAITING FOR US.

416
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,867
THE FOOD'S PROBABLY COLD
AND SOGGY BY NOW.

417
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,834
OF COURSE, FOR MY MOM,
THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.

418
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:42,901
SOME GIRL NAMED JUN
CALLED TODAY, MATT,

419
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,901
AND SHE SAID YOU HAVE A DATE
WITH HER ON FRIDAY.

420
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,901
SHE MADE DINNER RESERVATIONS
FOR YOU TWO AT O'MALLEY'S.

421
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,401
AT O'MALLEY'S?
WHAT'S THAT?

422
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,801
THE MOST EXPENSIVE
RESTAURANT IN TOWN.

423
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,801
[ Thinking ]
<i>THIS IS ALL DAVIS' FAULT.</i>

424
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,301
<i>I CAN'T BELIEVE</i>

425
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,301
<i>I HAVE TO TAKE HIS SISTER</i>
<i>OUT ON A DATE.</i>

426
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,301
HEY, MATT,
SOMETHING SMELLS GREAT.

427
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,734
DINNER'S READY?

428
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,541
SUPPERTIME!

429
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,174
KEN, DEAR, YOU'RE BUSY.

430
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,541
I'LL LEAVE IT
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR.

431
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,507
BLAST! THOSE DIGIVICES
ARE BECOMING A NUISANCE TO ME!

432
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,941
I'VE GOT TO GET THEM AWAY
FROM THOSE KIDS!

433
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,507

<i>THE DIGIMON EMPEROR'S PLOT</i>
