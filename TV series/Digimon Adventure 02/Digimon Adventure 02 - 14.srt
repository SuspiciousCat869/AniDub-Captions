1
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:01,333
GREAT PARTY, HUH?

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,433
Girl: YEAH. MIMI THROWS
THE BEST PARTIES.

3
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:06,433
HEY, SUSIE,
WANT TO DANCE?

4
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:07,933
GREAT. LET'S GO.

5
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,933
WE HAD A GREAT TIME, MIMI.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

6
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,700
OKAY. SEE YOU.

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,233
DADDY!

8
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,266
HMM,
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

9
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,266
WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD

10
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,233
WITHOUT OUR DIGIVICES
OR D-3s,

11
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,866
BUT SOMEHOW KARI DID,

12
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,866
AND NOT ONLY
DID SHE NOT HAVE HER D-3,

13
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:32,833
SHE WAS TRANSPORTED THERE
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ANY GATE.

14
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,333
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT KARI

15
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:38,300
THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF.
HUH? AN E-MAIL.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,266
IT'S FROM YOLEI.

17
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:43,733
"THERE'S A DIGIEGG NEARBY.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP COOKING."

18
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,233
GOING TO KEEP COOKING?

19
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,700
WELL, WHATEVER YOU'RE MAKING,
BE SURE AND SAVE ME SOME.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,666
"SORRY, IT WAS A TYPO.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP LOOKING."

21
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,166
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

22
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,133
THERE ARE NO CONTROL SPIRES
IN THAT AREA,

23
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,766
SO FEEL FREE
TO TAKE YOUR TIME.

24
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:01,540
HMM? WHOA, A DIGIPORT
HAS OPENED IN AMERICA.

25
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:01,606
HEY, WAIT,
MIMI LIVES THERE,

26
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,973
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN
MORNING THERE YET.

27
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:10,440
I CAN'T CALL HER. LET'S SEE.
I'LL SEND HER AN E-MAIL.

28
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,140
OH, I CAN'T WALK
ANOTHER STEP.

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,406
I GOT
TO EAT SOMETHING NOW.

30
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:17,406
YEAH, I'M GETTING
KIND OF HUNGRY, TOO.

31
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,873
BUT WE'RE VERY CLOSE
TO FINDING THE NEW DIGIEGG.

32
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:22,873
WHEN WE FIND THAT DIGIEGG,
I'M GOING TO EAT IT.

33
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,840
YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING,
AND BESIDES,

34
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,840
YOUR CHOLESTEROL
IS TOO HIGH.

35
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,306
Kari: IF WE WANT TO EAT,
WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK.

36
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:30,973
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

37
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:33,273
Cody: SO LONG, DIGIEGG.

38
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,073
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE,
I THINK IT'S A RESTAURANT.

39
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:37,106
A RESTAURANT!

40
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,540
WE'RE SAVED AT LAST!

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,506
Man's voice: WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SIT IN THE DIGIVOLVING

42
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,473
OR NON-DIGIVOLVING SECTION?

43
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,973
Both:
THAT WAS DELICIOUS!

44
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:46,973
I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND
THIS RESTAURANT

45
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,473
TO ALL MY FRIENDS
WHO DINE IN THE DIGIWORLD.

46
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:50,973
Kari: WHAT'S WRONG, T.K.?

47
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:53,473
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE
IS REALLY BOTHERING ME.

48
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,473
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE

49
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,973
AND IT WASN'T GOOD.

50
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:58,473
MAYBE LAST TIME

51
00:01:58,573 --> 00:01:59,906
YOU ORDERED
THE WRONG THING.

52
00:01:59,940 --> 00:01:59,973
WAITER, WE'RE READY
FOR OUR CHECK.

53
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,380
OKAY,
HOLD YOUR HORSES.

54
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,346
AFTER ALL,
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE SHELL.

55
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,313
WHAT'S OUR BILL COME TO?

56
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,780
87 DIGIDOLLARS PLUS TIP.

57
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,780
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM --
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?

58
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,246
WE DON'T HAVE DIGIDOLLARS,
BUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY.

59
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,746
FORGET IT.

60
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,713
BUT OUR MONEY
IS JUST AS GOOD.

61
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:23,180
SINCE THE DARK MASTERS LEFT,
WE ONLY ACCEPT DIGIDOLLARS.

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,846
T.K.: WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

63
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,180
THE LUNKHEADED WAITER
WON'T TAKE MY MONEY.

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
I SEE YOU'RE BEING
YOUR USUAL BLUNT SELF.

65
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,146
I'M TRYING TO BE HONEST.

66
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:33,613
I THINK YOU KIDS ARE TRYING
TO SKIP OUT ON THE BILL.

67
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,613
I TOLD YOU -- WE HAVE $87.

68
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,613
ONLY DIGIDOLLARS
OR THE DIGI EXPRESS CARD.

69
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,113
THAT'S IT!

70
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:41,613
I'M NOT GOING TO RECOMMEND
THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.

71
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,113
GOOD.

72
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,580
I DON'T WANT ANY HUMAN WORLD
DEADBEATS IN HERE.

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,546
NO WONDER THE FRENCH
HATE TOURISTS.

74
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:50,513
NOW, ARE YOU GOING
TO WORK OFF YOUR BILL,

75
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:53,013
OR DO I HAVE TO
CALL A COP?

76
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:55,313
I THINK I'VE HEARD
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

77
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:57,313
CAN'T WE PAY
NEXT TIME WE'RE HERE?

78
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:59,313
THERE WON'T BE
A NEXT TIME!

79
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,253
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
IN HERE AGAIN!

80
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:01,320
NOW GET IN THE KITCHEN
AND START WASHING DISHES --

81
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,220
Boy: FEAR NOT.
I'LL PAY THEIR BILL.

82
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
HOW SWEET.
PRINCE CHARMING.

83
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,186
WHO ARE YOU?

84
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:09,520
THIS IS MICHAEL.

85
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,653
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE
FROM AMERICA.

86
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:13,386
All: IT'S MIMI.

87
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:20,619
OH, MIMI, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

88
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,619
IZZY SENT ME AN E-MAIL

89
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,685
SAYING THERE WAS A DIGIPORT
OPEN IN AMERICA.

90
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,185
SINCE MICHAEL'S
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,

91
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,485
I THOUGHT
I'D BRING HIM ALONG.

92
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,985
I WANT EVERYONE TO SAY HELLO
TO A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, TOO.

93
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,785
MY NAME'S BETAMON.

94
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:37,785
<i>BETAMON IS REALLY COOL.</i>

95
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,785
<i>HE LIVES IN THE WATER AND USES</i>
<i>HIS BETA SLUGGER ATTACK</i>

96
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:43,119
<i>TO WIPE OUT HIS ENEMIES.</i>

97
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,652
Kari: PALMON, ARE YOU SURE
IT'S OKAY YOU'RE HERE?

98
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:48,152
WHAT ABOUT THE AREA
YOU WERE PROTECTING?

99
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:50,652
TENTOMON SAID
HE'D WATCH IT FOR ME.

100
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,652
Yolei: I DON'T UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, MIMI.

101
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:56,585
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO BRING
MICHAEL TO THE DIGITAL WORLD?

102
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:59,319
MICHAEL HAS A DIGIVICE
JUST LIKE US.

103
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,819
All: HUH?

104
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,425
Davis: WAIT A MINUTE.

105
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:02,492
IF HE HAS A DIGIVICE,
THEN HE'S A DIGIDESTINED.

106
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,759
RIGHT. HIS DIGIVICE
IS THE SAME AS MINE.

107
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,759
SO HE BECAME A DIGIDESTINED
IN AMERICA AT THE SAME TIME

108
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,825
OUR ORIGINAL GROUP
DID IN JAPAN.

109
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,825
TELL US SOMETHING,
MICHAEL,

110
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,825
ARE THERE MORE DIGIDESTINED
KIDS LIKE YOU IN AMERICA?

111
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,325
TELL US HOW YOU BECAME
A DIGIDESTINED.

112
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,792
AND TELL ME YOU'RE SINGLE.

113
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:24,725
EVERYTHING HAPPENED
FOUR SUMMERS AGO

114
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:27,225
WHEN I FIRST SAW GORILLAMON
IN NEW YORK.

115
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,725
THAT'S THE SAME TIME

116
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,859
MYOTISMON WAS
TAKING OVER TOKYO.

117
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,359
Kari: T.K.'s RIGHT.

118
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,592
MY, THAT'S STRANGE.

119
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:36,592
I WONDER IF THAT MEANS
WE ALL HAD AN ENCOUNTER

120
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,058
WITH THE DIGIMON
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.

121
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:41,525
THAT'S WHEN I WAS
ON THAT AIRPLANE

122
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,625
THAT HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY
LANDING IN THE WATER.

123
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,259
THAT'S WHEN I SAW
MY FIRST DIGIMON.

124
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,725
I REMEMBER THAT SUMMER.

125
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,525
I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE
BEING HELD BY THE BAKEMON.

126
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,525
I WISH I COULD SAY THAT SUMMER
WAS AS TERRIFYING FOR ME

127
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,992
AS IT WAS FOR YOU GUYS,
BUT IT WASN'T.

128
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,992
I DID SEND A BUNCH
OF E-MAILS

129
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,892
DURING THE BATTLE
WITH DIABORAMON.

130
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:01,959
Mimi: SO EVERYONE
WAS INVOLVED SOMEHOW.

131
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,899
IT'S LIKE
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED.

132
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:07,899
BUT THERE'S STILL
ONE QUESTION --

133
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,899
WHO'S GOING
TO PAY THE BILL?

134
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,365
DON'T WORRY.
THE ENTIRE MEAL IS ON ME.

135
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,365
THAT'S IT. NOW I REMEMBER
WHERE I SAW HIM.

136
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,365
<i>HE USED TO BE ONE</i>
<i>OF MYOTISMON'S HENCHMEN.</i>

137
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:21,299
<i>HE MADE MATT AND JOE WORK</i>
<i>IN THE KITCHEN HERE.</i>

138
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,232
<i>HE GOT MAD WHEN MATT ASKED</i>
<i>IF HE COULD GET HALF PRICE</i>

139
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:26,332
<i>ON HIS MEALS.</i>

140
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:29,132
I ADMIT IT,
I WAS A ROTTEN EGG,

141
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,132
BUT THAT WAS IN THE PAST.

142
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,132
AFTER THE DARK MASTERS
WERE DEFEATED,

143
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,099
I KNEW I HAD
TO BREAK OUT OF MY SHELL.

144
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,099
WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD
OF YOU.

145
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,399
DON'T YOU FEEL
BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF?

146
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,399
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

147
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,365
IT IS KIND OF NICE
MAKING AN HONEST LIVING.

148
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:48,865
IT SEEMS YOU'RE STILL
ONE OF THE BAD GUYS

149
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,865
AFTER THE WAY
YOU TREATED ME.

150
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,365
YOLEI,
EVERYONE GETS CRANKY.

151
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,899
IF HE SAYS HE'S CHANGED,
I BELIEVE HIM.

152
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,832
SOMETIMES IT'S EASY
TO GET CRANKY WITH YOU.

153
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:00,799
I FEEL BAD ABOUT HOW
I TREATED YOU LAST TIME.

154
