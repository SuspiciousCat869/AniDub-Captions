1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,136
CODY: We hid the fifth
Destiny Stone from Arukenimon

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,671
and Mummymon, but
BlackWarGreymon found it easily

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,706
and blasted it.

4
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,274
TK had another meltdown.

5
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,176
He once had to watch
Patamon get destroyed

6
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,644
and he's never gotten over it.

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,080
The sixth Destiny Stone
was at the bottom of the ocean,

8
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,349
but BlackWarGreymon
got to that one too.

9
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,684
Even though I couldn't hurt him
because he had a heart,

10
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,454
I still stood up to him
and said if you want to destroy

11
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,689
the Destiny Stone,
you'll have to destroy me first!

12
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,758
That's the last time
I try that one.

13
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,027
Luckily Angemon saved me
before BlackWarGreymon

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,662
smashed the Destiny Stone.

15
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,130
Now there's only one left!

DAVIS: Dudes,
we can't just stand around.

39
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,461
There's only one
Destiny Stone left.

40
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,630
We gotta find it before
BlackWarGreymon does

41
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,365
and totally loses his cool!

42
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,700
KARI: Yeah, well,
I'm gonna lose my cool

43
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,602
if you keep calling me "dude".

44
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,570
( gasping )

45
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,574
( indistinct chatter )

46
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,745
Looks like Ken has to help
his mother clean.

47
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,314
He says go on ahead without him
and he'll join up with us

48
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,483
when he finishes
vacuuming the chimney.

49
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,151
But what happened to Cody?

50
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,487
Do you think he got
pushed in a locker?

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,555
I hope not.

52
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,490
Sorry I'm late.

53
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,524
Well?

54
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,293
We were worried about you.

55
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,861
I was helping clean up
the teachers' lunch room.

56
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,529
It was my turn.

57
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,431
You should be helping us
find the last Destiny Stone!

58
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,733
I mean, between you and Ken,

59
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,701
we must be running
a cleaning service here!

60
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,570
Sheesh, talk about
getting dramatic.

61
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,537
Yolei?

62
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:23,710
Right, Digiport, open!

63
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,113
We can't waste any time!

64
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,714
Let's go!

65
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,650
( upbeat music )

66
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,760
My mission is clear.

67
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,262
That Destiny Stone
is here somewhere,

68
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,530
and I'm going to find it
if I have to

69
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,632
destroy everything in my path!

70
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,703
Now, where is it?

71
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,704
( grunts )

72
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,639
Black Tornado!

73
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,817
Why can't you be
as powerful as him, Mummymon?

74
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,185
Huh?

75
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,720
But I've got charm and class!

76
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,155
Come on, don't tell me
you're falling for that

77
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,724
prefabricated hunk of shrapnel.

78
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,326
I don't have time to bother
with all that nonsense!

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,296
I'm glad,
that's such a big relief.

80
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,433
( horn honking )

81
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,471
Where is it?

82
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,739
I still don't see it.

83
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,874
I should just destroy
everything here.

84
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,342
Where'd he go?

85
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,410
Uh‐oh.

86
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,878
Oh, if we don't get moving,

87
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,414
that bucket of bolts
is going to incinerate us!

88
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,783
Wake up, Mummymon, I need you!

89
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,419
( sighing )

90
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,689
I thought you'd never
come around, give us a kiss.

91
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,691
Anyone ever tell you
you have bad breath?

92
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,326
Why, that's impossible.

93
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,594
I think I brushed my teeth
at least a year ago.

94
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,562
Huh?

95
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,300
( shouting )

96
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,871
( screaming )

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,649
Face it, the guy's not
a rocket scientist.

98
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,686
BlackWarGreymon will never
find us in this place.

99
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,687
Mmm.

100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,656
( gong ringing )

101
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,691
Huh?

102
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,659
Oh.

103
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,528
Huh.

104
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,597
Hmm.

105
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,832
♪

106
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,568
What you want is some
delicious Chinese soup.

107
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,669
Oh, come on,
try it, you'll like it,

108
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,737
it's my specialty.

109
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,539
Egg drop, haha!

110
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,642
ARUKENIMON: Well, I suppose
I could do a bit of shopping

111
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,511
while I'm here in Chinatown.

112
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,213
What I really need
is a nice pair of sandals.

113
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,815
Hmm.

114
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,018
That could be hard, considering
you have eight sticky feet.

115
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,020
They're nice!

116
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,355
Well, I don't need
any comments from you,

117
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,790
sticky tape boy.

118
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,358
You know that I'm sensitive
about my feet.

119
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,893
I'm a spider.

120
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,561
I'm just giving you
a compliment, I love your feet!

121
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,762
Even your pointy toes!

122
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,697
Enough with the feet!

123
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,767
Hey, what's that tasty aroma?

124
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,735
Yum!

125
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,236
( gasping )

126
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,372
It's incredible, what is it?

127
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,507
Mmm.

128
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,280
Chinese soup!
Let's go and get some!

129
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,649
Good idea, maybe we can
even get some extra hot soup

130
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,818
to go and give it
to BlackWargreymon

131
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,753
so he can scald
his mouth when he eats it!

132
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,720
When you're hot, you're hot.

133
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,629
Gee, I hope they
have fortune cookies,

134
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,599
they're my favorite.

135
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,535
So, what'll it be?

136
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,904
I'm Tapirmon,
and I'll be your waiter.

137
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,573
You better leave me a big tip

138
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,676
or next time you'll have
a fly in your wonton.

139
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,611
Huh?

140
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,448
Want some soup?
It's our specialty.

141
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,917
Yeah, extra flies for me!

142
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,052
Just hers.

143
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,021
Finally, a customer!

144
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,391
Uh‐oh, BlackWarGreymon's
in close range!

145
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,927
I hope Ken put away his dust rag
and is able to find us.

146
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,495
Give Ken a break.

147
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,997
After all, cleanliness
is next to diginess!

148
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,498
Okay.

149
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,601
YOLEI: Hey, Kari,
want some mineral water?

150
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,669
Sure, thanks!
Mineral water, huh?

151
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,771
Gee, Yolei, since when
did you get so healthy?

152
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,641
Since our family started
selling it in our store.

153
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,677
It's full of vitamins
and minerals for good health.

154
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,613
Next time you're in
my family's grocery store,

155
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,414
be sure to pick up
a bottle or two.

156
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,415
That's right.

157
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,417
What is this, a commercial?

158
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,418
Yolei!

159
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,054
( laughing )

160
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,557
Ever since those guys
have been able to DNA Digivolve,

161
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,858
they've become
much closer friends.

162
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,693
Don't worry.

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,395
Soon you'll DNA Digivolve
with the best of 'em.

164
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,863
Think so?

165
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,732
Patamon and Armadillomon
have been practicing hard

166
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,967
and they're about to master it
at any moment.

167
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,370
Arma‐pat!

168
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,971
Pata‐arm!

169
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,974
( laughing )

170
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,876
( sniffing )

171
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,379
Hey, check out that
scrumptious smell.

172
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,380
Huh?

173
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,482
Hmm.

174
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,017
Mmm, that's awesome!

175
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,952
My stomach is growling
with sheer delight.

176
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,354
( groaning )

177
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,889
Mine's growling
with sheer hunger!

178
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,457
Mine too.

179
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,926
Well, I'm not gonna
pass on good food

180
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,627
and besides, it's not
often we find ourselves

181
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,430
in Digi‐Chinatown,
so we may as well enjoy it.

182
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,865
Right now?

183
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,800
Yes!

184
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,001
Maybe we should
all go in together

185
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,336
for the lunch special.

186
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,904
That way you get
a lot more food!

187
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,774
I want mine as spicy as they
can make it, so watch out!

188
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,677
Cody?
Is there something the matter?

189
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,945
Aren't you hungry?

190
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,713
BlackWarGreymon
is out there looking for

191
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,849
the last Destiny Stone,
like we should be!

192
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,819
Instead, they're all
in there, eating.

193
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,888
Stuffing themselves
with egg foo young!

194
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,589
‐ But Cody.
‐ Huh?

195
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,925
Thing is, I love egg foo young.

196
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,126
Huh?

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,595
Armadillomon.

198
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,197
I have a bad feeling that
the reason you and Patamon

199
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,199
haven't been able
to DNA Digivolve is because

200
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,134
I'm too serious all of the time.

201
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,837
But I'll try to lighten up
by the time dessert comes.

202
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,576
I have to say,
this soup is magnificent.

203
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,713
And full of flies,
it's the best!

204
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,780
Waiter!

205
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,082
Need something, sir?

206
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,450
Tell me, my good mon.

207
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,784
What is this tasty soup made of?

208
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,186
Lots of noodles.

209
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,154
Well, I know that.
What else?

210
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,156
Even more noodles.

211
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,759
This isn't getting us
anywhere at all!

212
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,494
This guy's got
noodles on the brain.

213
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,695
I want to talk to your manager.

214
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,163
Of course.

215
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,667
I'm the owner, Digitamamon.

216
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,135
What's the problem?

217
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,737
ARUKINEMON: That stupid waiter
wouldn't tell us

218
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,638
what this delicious soup
is made of.

219
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,574
Sorry, it's a secret recipe.

220
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,908
What?

221
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,643
If I told you my recipe,

222
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,545
it wouldn't be a secret
anymore, now, would it?

223
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,147
What insolence!

224
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,715
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to, buster?

225
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,550
‐ More guests!
‐ Huh?

226
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,953
( gasping )

227
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,955
BOTH: Oh, rats, those kids!

228
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,691
( grunts )
Digitamamon?

229
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,127
It's nice to see you again, but
I've kinda lost my appetite.

230
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,628
Ah, don't worry about it.

231
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,196
Just remember,
there's always takeout.

232
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,865
When you're feeling better,
you have a little mushu.

233
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,833
Maybe a little pupu,
or just for fun,

234
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,668
I'll even throw in
some almond cookies.

235
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,770
How about a nice trip
to the moon?

236
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:57,837
Would you like that?

237
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,507

before they're able
to DNA Digivolve.

311
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,130
We'd better think
of something real fast!

We de‐digivolved,
what happened?

316

What's in that soup?
They won't get away with this!

Hey, what happened?

00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,085
I'm not sure,
but if I were you,

321
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,287
I wouldn't order the soup.

322

I don't get it.

‐ CODY: No, wait.
‐ Huh?

327
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,796
We should be focused
on what's most important,

328
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,766
and chasing them isn't what
we need to be concerned with.

329
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,734
Right now we all have
to replenish our energy.

330
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,436
That way, we can
DNA Digivolve and get ready

00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,372
to meet BlackWarGreymon!

332
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,840
I could use a snack.

333
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,879
What do you say?
Let's have something to eat!

334
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,247
Cody's right.

335
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,982
Hey, dudes,
I'm not complaining.

336
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,917
VEEMON AND PATAMON:
We need food, let's eat!

337
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,385
Mm‐hmm.

338
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,222
Wait, we don't have
anyone to cook for us.

339
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,525
‐ Digitamamon left.
‐ Oh, no!

340
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,894
We're not helpless,
we'll cook for ourselves!

341
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,429
We'll do our share
and set the table!

342
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:53,132
Hey, we can add some onions
and mushrooms.

343
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,968
How about some tuna fish?
How do you turn on the stove?

344
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,337
( laughter )

345
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,275
( sighing )

346
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,843
What's the matter?

347
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,345
( sighs )

348
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,046
( backfires )

349
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,182
I don't know,
it can't be the radiator.

350
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,951
I just put water in it
five years ago.

351
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,952
Lovely.

352
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,054
( groaning )

353
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,357
The only thing that'll
save it now is water!

354
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,958
( shouting )

355
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,560
( coughing )

356
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,828
I'm coming too!

357
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,831
Mummymon, where are you?

358
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,265
This isn't funny at all!

359
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,900
Mummymon!

360
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,569
‐ Quiet!
‐ ( screams )

361
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,537
What's the big idea, you twit?

362
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,872
Shh.

363
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:33,873
Huh?

364
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,210
Hmm.

365
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:42,148
( water dripping )

366
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,150
I can hear it.

367
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,251
What is it?

368
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,586
Water dripping.

369
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,254
Oh?

370
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,190
( water dripping )

371
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,061
You're right, Drippy!

372
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,896
The sound's coming
from over there.

373
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,531
Hey, wait for me!

374
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,434
MUMMYMON: We're almost there,
just a little farther.

375
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,469
( panting )

376
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,338
ARUKINEMON: Oh,
great, a swimming pool.

377
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,839
I'm going to stink after this.

378
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,374
( panting )

379
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,043
Oh, that smells
good enough to eat!

380
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,346
What is it?

381
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,350
That sign over there says
it's the Chinese soup spring.

382
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,652
We're looking at
a jumbo pot of soup.

383
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,621
This is where that
irresistible soup was made,

384
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,457
and my stomach's telling me
I've gotta have some!

385
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,126
( laughing )

386
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,461
No slurping!

387
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,329
( groans )

388
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,131
What, don't you
have any manners?

389
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,300
No slimy tongues
allowed in the soup!

390
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,868
( screams )

391
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,336
What's the big deal?

392
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,338
Is there a law against
drinking soup around here?

393
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,073
As a matter of fact, there is!

394
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,009
ARUKINEMON: "Drinking this soup
is strictly forbidden

395
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,344
and you don't want
to know the consequences." Hmm.

396
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,512
That's baloney,
it makes me want to

397
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,414
have some of it even more!

398
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,416
And you're not gonna stop me.

399
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,985
( groaning )

400
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,088
Yummy.
( chuckles )

401
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,457
( slurping )

402
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,592
Mmm.

403
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,194
Ahh.

404
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,895
( rumbling )

405
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,897
Oh!

406
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,601
I hope that's not
a giant fly seeking revenge.

407
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,406
( gasping )

408
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,574
( groans )

409
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,142
Oh, nice time for a swim!

410
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,245
( gasping )

411
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,113
Either this is
a Destiny Stone,

412
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,915
or it's a giant matzah ball!

413
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,619
( screams )

414
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,654
Hold on!

415
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,525
( groaning )

416
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,396
( screams )

417
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,169
I hope you're satisfied.

418
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,005
Now you've ruined the soup
and the Destiny Stone!

419
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,412
( slurping )

420
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,515
( sighing )

421
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,984
Not bad for a bunch of kids.

422
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,685
It's a good thing
the chef left broth!

423
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,521
Maybe so, but we
added a special touch.

424
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,456
Yeah, everybody's hands
went in the soup.

425
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,224
Tastes better that way.

426
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,493
( laughing )

427
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,062
TK: There's something strange
about this soup, Cody.

428
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,031
Huh?

429
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,001
I have this weird feeling
that we'll figure out

430
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,470
how to DNA Digivolve.

431
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,171
Must be the MSG.

432
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,406
( laughing )

433
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,141
Huh?

434
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,576
Why'd it go dark?

435
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,511
That's the light
of a Destiny Stone!

436
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,414
( dramatic music )

437
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,489
A perfect turn of events.

438
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,291
How lucky!

439
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,493
Now the digital world
will be my oyster.

440
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,462
Now I need my black pearl.

441
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:48,000
Help, I've got a mushroom
on my nose, help!

442
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,669
( grunts )

443
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,337
Go get it!

444
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,072
( shouting )

445
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,043
The final Destiny Stone.

446
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,678
I hope you came for the soup.

447
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,713
I'll shatter it to pieces!

448
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,181
DAVIS: Stop!

449
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,350
Figures, those nosy kids
always show up

450
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,352
at the wrong time!

451
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,386
Don't try it
or we'll turn you into

452
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,255
a heap of sardine cans!

453
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,592
You just never seem
to learn your lesson, do you?

454
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,460
Obnoxious parasites.

455
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,597
Show 'em what you're made of,
BlackWarGreymon!

456
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,599
I don't need you to tell me.

457
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:23,736
( shouting )

458
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,005
Cody, I think the time
has come for us

459
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,274
‐ to put that big guy away.
‐ Yep!

460
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,443
I'm ready whenever
you are, Angemon!

461

I am too, let's let her rip!

00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,346
