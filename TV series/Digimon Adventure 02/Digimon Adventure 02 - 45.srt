I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

473
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,234
I THOUGHT I LOST YOU.

474
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,534
DON'T CRY, MOM.
I'M FINE.

475
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:06,201
Officer: WE DIDN'T CATCH
THE GUY WHO KIDNAPPED THEM.

476
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:07,667
HE'S GOT TO BE
LONG GONE BY NOW.

477
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,507
BUT WE STILL WANT YOU
TO BE CAREFUL.

478
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:10,474
ALL RIGHT, MA'AM?

479
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,107
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU, OFFICER.

480
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:13,674
EXCELLENT.

481
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:16,674
WITH THE SPORES IMPLANTED,
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

482
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:20,041
IN TIME THEY'LL BLOOM
INSIDE THE CHILDREN.

483
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,807
MY PLAN IS WORKING
PERFECTLY.

484
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,674
SOON I WILL BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

485
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,474
TO DESTROY THOSE DIGIDESTINED
ONCE AND FOR ALL

486
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:30,641
AND TAKE MY RIGHTFUL PLACE
AS RULER OF THE DIGITAL WORLD!

487
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:32,441
HA HA HA HA HA!

488
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,941
WILL THE DIGIDESTINED
BE ABLE TO STOP

489
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,374
OWIKAWA'S EVIL PLAN?

490
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:40,541
FIND OUT ON THE NEXT
"DIGIMON" -- DIGITAL MONSTERS.
