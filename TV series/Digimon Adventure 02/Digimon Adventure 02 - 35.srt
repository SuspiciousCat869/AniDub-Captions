HE'S ALMOST AS GOOD A PLAYER
AS ME.

160

WOW, KEN ICHIJOUJI,

161
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,902
THE FAMOUS BOY GENIUS
IN MY HOUSE.

162
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:15,036
GEE, COULD YOU HELP MY SON
WITH HIS HOMEWORK?

163
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,802
I SPEND A FORTUNE
ON TUTORS.

164
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,869
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE
A CELEBRITY RIGHT HERE.

165
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,702
A CELEBRITY?
WHAT DO THEY THINK I AM?

166
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:24,602
HEY, MATT,
SOME KID IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

167
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:27,869
AND IF HE'S A BETTER SINGER
THAN YOU, HE'S HIRED.

168
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:28,902
VERY FUNNY.

169
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:30,702
SO WHAT? T.K. WAS ANGRY

170
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:33,602
WHEN THE DIGIMON EMPEROR
CREATED KIMERAMON.

171
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:34,869
I WOULD BE, TOO.

172
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,802
YUM, YUM, YUM.

173
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,736
BUT I CAN SEE
WHY YOU'RE WORRIED.

174
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,136
T.K. CAN BE
A REAL HOTHEAD SOMETIMES.

175
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:45,436
IT ALL HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE POWERS OF DARKNESS.

176
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:48,036
FIRST IT WAS KIMERAMON,
WHO WAS CREATED FROM PURE EVIL,

177
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,302
AND NOW BLACK WARGREYMON,

178
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,402
WHO WAS CREATED
FROM EVIL CONTROL SPIRES.

179
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,769
THAT PLUS T.K.
EQUALS ANGRY.

180
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,036
THIS IS STARTING TO MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

181
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,802
CAN YOU TELL ME IF ANYTHING
HAPPENED BEFORE TO T.K.

182
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,302
TO MAKE HIM LIKE THIS?

183
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:01,969
WELL, I'M NOT SURE T.K.
WOULD LIKE IT IF I TOLD YOU,

184
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,642
BUT SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.

185
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:06,809
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
BUT T.K. STILL CARRIES THE SCARS

186
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,309
FROM THE FINAL BATTLE BETWEEN US
AND OUR FIRST OPPONENT, DEVIMON.

187
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,976
HAND OF FATE!

188
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,242
DEVIMON USED
THE POWERS OF DARKNESS

189
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:19,276
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD
MAKE HIM INVINCIBLE,

190
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,442
BUT ANGEMON USED UP

191
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,042
ALL OF HIS OWN ENERGY
TO DEFEAT HIM.

192
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:24,876
ANGEMON KNEW HE WOULD
BE RECONFIGURED AFTERWARDS,

193
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:27,242
BUT HE DID IT ANYWAY
TO SAVE T.K.

194
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,076
T.K. WAS SCARED BECAUSE
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

195
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,809
PATAMON HAD EVER
DIGIVOLVED,

196
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,776
AND HE THOUGHT HE'D NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

197
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:35,309
NONE OF KNEW THAT MUCH
ABOUT DIGIMON BACK THEN,

198
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,876
SO WE ALL THOUGHT WE HAD SEEN
THE LAST OF PATAMON.

199
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,909
I GUESS THAT FEAR NEVER
REALLY LEFT T.K.,

200
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,109
OR THE LESSON
THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFE

201
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,742
OUTWEIGHS
THE POWER OF DARKNESS.

202
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:51,042
I GUESS T.K. HAS NEVER
GOTTEN OVER THAT.

203
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:54,042
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
IT STILL HAS AN EFFECT.

204
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,709
IT MUST BE AWFULLY HARD
TO LOSE YOUR DIGIMON PARTNER

205
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,976
BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES.

206

KEN AND WORMMON WENT THROUGH
THE EXACT SAME THING.

207
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,876
THAT'S TRUE.
KEN PROBABLY KNOWS

208
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,916
EXACTLY WHAT T.K.'s
GOING THROUGH.

209
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:07,816
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IF KEN FEELS THE SAME WAY

00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,716
AS T.K. ABOUT SOMEONE
PLAYING AROUND

211
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,616
WITH THE POWERS
OF DARKNESS.

212
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:12,616

BUT I'M SHORT ON CASH.

225
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:38,316
I WANT TO STOP

IF HE DESTROYS
THE LAST DESTINY STONE.

229

BUT SOMETHING
ABOUT BLACK WARGREYMON

230
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,616
MAKES ME THINK
HE'S JUST CONFUSED

231
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:50,949
AND NOT REALLY BAD.

232
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,916
I KNOW WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU
ABOUT BLACK WARGREYMON.

233
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:56,316

AND HE WORRIES ABOUT THINGS,

235
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,749
THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T
DESTROY HIM.

236
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,949
THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVE THE BIGGEST HEART

TO ME FIRST

PROTECT THEM SOMEHOW.

GO FIND THEM.

FOR THE LOCATION

IF WE CAN FIND THEM
BEFORE BLACK WARGREYMON DOES,

257
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:47,489
WE CAN PROTECT THEM.

I WASN'T INVITED?
