I CAN'T SEE A THING.
HOW ABOUT YOU, HAWKMON?

159
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,723
IT'S NOTHING.
I'M FINE.

160
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,190
NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE
CLEARLY SEEING THINGS.

HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
PLAY ALONG, HAWKMON.

DO YOU THINK
HE FELL ON HIS HEAD?

164
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,090
I DID THAT ONCE
AND THOUGHT I WAS A FRUIT BAT.

165
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,336
THIS IS HOPELESS.

166
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,209
WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP.
NO WAY.

167
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,576
KARI IS COUNTING ON ME
TO FIND THIS THING FOR HER.

168
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,542
WHERE DID SHE
AND YOLEI GO?

WELL, WHO'S THAT WITH THEM?

HUH? THREE OF THEM?

REALLY DARK.

WE'VE BEEN CHASING
OUR TAIL THIS WHOLE TIME?

DO YOU THINK WE'RE LOST,
IS THAT IT,

TILL WE DIE? HMM.

I HEARD A VOICE OVER HERE.

THEY'RE GHOSTS, V-MON?

WHY CAN'T HE SEE US?

IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

DID YOU FIND KARI?

198
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,949
THEY HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.
IT'S NOT LOGICAL.

199
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:19,416
THEY CAN'T HAVE GONE
THAT FAR.

200

EVEN I COULDN'T FIND THEM.
NOT ONE TRACE.

201
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:25,382
I'LL GO UP WITH PATAMON.
WE JUST HAVE TO TRY HARDER.

KEEPS GETTING THICKER.

OKAY, SO YOU DON'T
LIKE THAT PLAN.

WHY DON'T WE PLAY
A GAME?

211
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,049
WE CAN PLAY

PRETTY BORING.

TO FIND OUR WAY HOME

WHERE WE ARE? IT'S HOPELESS.

TO GO BACK TOO MUCH

TALK TO ME?

DO YOU TWO WANT
TO BE ALONE OR SOMETHING?

OF IGNORING ME LIKE THIS.

BE FIGHTING IT ALONE ANYMORE.

SEEN THE LAST OF THE DARK OCEAN?

477
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:28,881

THE APPROACHING DARKNESS?
