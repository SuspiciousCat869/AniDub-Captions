SEEN A CUTE, LITTLE, PINK,
BIRD-LOOKING DIGIMON

157
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,699
NAMED BIYOMON AROUND HERE?

158
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:21,666
HMM. DID YOU SAY "BIYOMON"?
THAT KIND OF RINGS A BELL.

159
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,166
YUP. YUP.

160
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:26,699
I'VE GOT A FEELING I'VE HEARD
THAT DESCRIPTION BEFORE.

161
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,499
BIYOMON WANTED?
WHAT DID SHE DO?

162
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,999
WELL, THAT DIGIDESPERADO
IS ON THE RUN

163
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,499
FROM THE DIGIMON EMPEROR.

164
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,499
HE'S GOT A REWARD OUT
FOR HER,

165
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,633
BUT THEY HAVEN'T
CAUGHT HER YET.

166
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,133
WELL, SHE'S HOPEFULLY
SOMEWHERE SAFE BY NOW,

167
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,599
BUT I'LL STILL FEEL BETTER
WHEN WE FIND HER.

168
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,599
MR. STARMON, SIR,
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP.

169
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,566
WE HEARD SHE WAS LAST SEEN
NEAR HERE.

170
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,666
YOU COULDN'T BE
MORE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

171
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,166
AND IF BIYOMON WERE
IN TROUBLE, YOU'D HELP HER.

172
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,866
BEING A LAWMON, I KNOW
YOU'D PROTECT HER

173
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,866
FROM THAT DIGITAL
EMPEROR, RIGHT?

174
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:01,333
MA'AM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

HE'S WEARING A DARK RING!

176
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,106
WELL, I KNEW THAT
BEHIND THAT TIN STAR

177
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:09,106
WAS JUST A GUTLESS LOWLIFE
LACKEY OF THE EMPEROR.

178
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,606
YOU COULD'VE TOLD US,

179
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:13,306
AND WHAT DID WE SAY
ABOUT NAME-CALLING?

180
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,806
THINK HE'S A BAD APPLE
OR A GOOD ONE?

181
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:18,773
PEOPLE ARE LIKE MILK.
THEY CAN TURN BAD.

182
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,239
YOU MIGHT THINK I'M LOWER
THAN A SNAKE'S BELLY

183
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,739
FOR SAYING THIS,

184
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,706
BUT I DO WORK FOR THE EMPEROR,
AND I GOT ORDERS.

185
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,273
HUNT THEM DOWN
AND PUNISH THE DIGIDESTINED!

OFF BUTTERFLIES?

HE'S EXPERIMENTING
WITH SOMETHING EVIL.

190

TO HIGHTAIL IT OUT OF HERE!

NO LOUD MUSIC AFTER 8:00,

218

MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE
TO THIS TOWN,

222
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:52,813
I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS UNDER
THE CONTROL OF THE EMPEROR.

223
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:55,813
I HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN
BY HIS FLYING DRAGONS

AND NEEDED FOOD.

312
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,620
AT WHAT?
HIS LUNCH.

313
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,286
IF I COULD JUST WRAP MY LIPS
AROUND THAT LUNCH,

314
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:37,886
I COULD ARMOR DIGIVOLVE.

315
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,386
I GOT AN IDEA.

316
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,886
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

317
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,386
PRETEND THAT THESE ROPES
AROUND US ARE PASTA,

318
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,853
AND HELP YOURSELF
TO ALL YOU CAN EAT.

319
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,353
I JUST LOVE CARDS --

320
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,786
CREDIT CARDS, GREETING CARDS,
YOU NAME IT!

321
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:52,286
AFTER A COUPLE OF HANDS,
LET'S TRY TO ESCAPE.

322
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:54,786
MAYBE WE COULD GET HIM
TO FALL ASLEEP

323
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:56,820
BY TALKING HIM
INTO PLAYING CANASTA.

324
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,686
EVER PLAY 52 PICKUP?

325
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:00,220
AH, SKIP IT.

326
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,220
AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMON,

327
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,720
WELCOME TO THE WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIP OF OLD MAID.

328
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,226
WINNER TAKE ALL!

329
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,726
AH, COME ON. LET'S HEAR IT!

330
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:11,160
Sora and Yolei:
[ Unenthusiastically ] YAY!

331
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,660
DO YOU KNOW ANY WAYS
OF CHEATING

332
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,660
WHEN IT COMES
TO PLAYING OLD MAID?

333
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,726
Veemon: I ALMOST GOT IT,
DAVIS.

334
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,126
THERE!

335
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,626
NOW TO FIGURE A WAY
TO BREAK OUT!

336
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,226
CHOCOLATE ALWAYS WORKS.

337
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,893
Cody: WELL, THAT DOES IT.
WE'RE FREE.

338
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:28,093
DELICIOUS ROPES.

339
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:30,593
ALL RIGHTY, YOU'RE FIRST,
AND DON'T TRY ANYTHING TRICKY

340
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:33,293
OR NO FRUIT CUP,
YOU HEAR?

341
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,226
HUH?

342
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:36,760
STARMON!

343
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,260
WELL, IF IT AIN'T

344
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,260
THAT NAMBY-PAMBY POOR EXCUSE
FOR A SIDEKICK -- DEPUTYMON!

345
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,960
PLAYING WITH THE GIRLS AGAIN,
GEORGIE-PORGIE?

346
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,893
STOP THAT TALK.
YOU GOT NO RIGHT.

347
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:50,326
FOR ONCE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE TIME FOR TALKING IS OVER.

348
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:53,526
LET'S SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

349
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,660
GOTCHA! COME TO PAPA!

350
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
NICE.

351
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,826
THOSE ROPES WERE JUST
A HIGH-FIBER APPETIZER.

352
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,326
NOW, <i>BON APPéTIT.</i>

353
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:06,000
LOOKS MIGHTY TASTY.
OH, BOY.

354
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,000
YOU KNOW, THE EASIEST WAY
OUT OF HERE IS TO DIG OUT.

355
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,666
YOU'LL HELP OUT LATER.

356
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,833
YOU CAN HAVE SOME.

357
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,233
GREAT.

358
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:22,233
JUST THIS ONCE, IT'S OKAY
TO GULP YOUR FOOD.

359
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,200
WE GOT TO HELP OUR FRIENDS.

360
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,033
DIGIARMOR, ENERGIZE!

361
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:42,484
ARMADILLOMON,
ARMOR DIGIVOLVE TO...

362
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:53,551
DIGMON --
THE DRILL OF POWER!

363
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:56,317
COOL!
COOL!

364
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:04,117
ALL RIGHT!
LET'S MOVE IT!

365
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:05,617
Davis: YOU GOT IT!

366
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:08,824
DIGIARMOR, ENERGIZE!

367
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:22,291
VEEMON,
ARMOR DIGIVOLVE TO...

368
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:37,157
RAYDROMON --
THE STORM OF FRIENDSHIP!

369
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,791
Deputymon: THIS GHOST TOWN
ISN'T BIG ENOUGH

370
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:42,791
FOR BOTH OF US,
EVEN IF WE HAD IT ON.

371
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,257
I SAW A MOVIE LIKE THIS ONCE.
THE GOOD GUY WON.

372
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:48,224
WHICH ONE'S GOOD?

373
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,291
Starmon: TAKE THREE PACES,
THEN TURN AROUND AND FIRE.

374
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:54,124
1...2...

375
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:55,691
GO WHOEVER!
GO WHOEVER!

376
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,257
2 7/16...AND...

377
00:16:58,357 --> 00:16:59,591
HEY!

378
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:02,557
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'VE ALREADY TURNED AROUND.

379
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:05,057
HOLD IT! GOOD GUYS
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO CHEAT!

380
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,557
I'M NOT THAT GOOD.

381
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,031
BESIDES, I'VE NEVER WON
AT NOTHING.

382
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:11,031
BUT TODAY --
WIN, LOSE, OR DRAW --

383
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,831
I'M COMING OUT OF THIS
A WINNER.

384
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:16,331
THIS IS BECOMING
A BATTLE OF WITS,

385
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:18,497
AND DEPUTYMON'S
OUT OF AMMUNITION.

386
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:20,497
SEMI-GOOD ALWAYS TRIUMPHS
OVER EVIL.

387
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:22,964
SO GO AHEAD, STARMON,
GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

388
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,964
FINE. LET'S JUST SEE HOW
THE FORTUNE COOKIE CRUMBLES!

389
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:29,264
METEOR SHOWER!

390
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:31,964
WHOA! LET'S MOVE!

391
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:33,664
AAH!

392
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,631
OH...
OH...

393
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,131
WELL, I DROPPED HIM
LIKE A BAD HABIT.

394
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:41,097
LOOKS LIKE ONE DOWN
AND TWO TO GO.

395
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:43,064
NOT QUITE.
WHAT SHE SAID.

396
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:45,064
Davis: HOLD ON!
I'LL HANDLE THIS!

397
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,064
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG!

398
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:50,097
METEOR SHOWER!

399
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,897
TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE!

400
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,897
I'LL TRY TO CUT BACK.

401
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,897
DAVIS, DIGIVOLVE ME
INTO FLAMEDRAMON.

402
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:06,497
HE'S A BETTER FIGHTER!

403
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:09,171
RIGHT, VEEMON!

404
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:15,204
DIGIARMOR, ENERGIZE!

405
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,904
VEEMON,
ARMOR DIGIVOLVE TO...

406
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:43,871
FLAMEDRAMON --
THE FIRE OF COURAGE!

407
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,771
STARMON, YOU'RE FIRED!

408
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,771
FIRE ROCKET!

409
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:52,237
AAH!

410
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,571
AAH!

411
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:56,604
Armadillomon: LOOK!
A CONTROL SPIRE!

412
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:59,037
LET'S GO!

413
00:18:59,137 --> 00:18:59,971
AAH!

414
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:08,344
YAHOOEY!

415
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:24,239
Davis: YOUR TOWN WON'T BE

416
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,006
UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CONTROL
ANYMORE.

417
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:29,506
Starmon: I GUESS
I JUST WENT PLUMB LOCO.

418
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:31,439
HOPE THERE'S NO
HARD FEELINGS, BIYOMON.

419
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,439
THERE'S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

420
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,906
I'M JUST GLAD THAT THINGS
ARE...NORMAL NOW.

421
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:39,239
Deputymon: YOO-HOO!

422
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,872
TARNATION! IT'S GOOD
THAT I CAUGHT YOU.

423
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,872
YOU DIDN'T THINK ALL OF YOU
WERE GOING TO SKEDADDLE

424
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:48,339
WITHOUT US SAYING <i>ADIOS</i>
AND PLAYING SOME MORE CARDS,

425
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,739
DID YOU?

426
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,306
All: WE WOULDN'T DO THAT!
[ Sigh ]

427
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,306
Sora: SO WHAT
HAVE YOU GOT, CODY?

428
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,806
I GOT A PAIR OF ACES
AND ANOTHER PAIR OF ACES.

429
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,306
THAT BEATS US ALL.

430
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,906
WE'RE SWITCHING
TO MY FAVORITE CARD GAME --

431
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:03,439
GO FISH!

432
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,572
All: GO FISH?
[ Sigh ]

433
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,346
HMM, THOSE DIGIDIMWITS
HAVE NO IDEA

434
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:11,846
WHAT I HAVE UP MY SLEEVE.

435
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,346
<i>WHAT WILL</i>
<i>THE DIGITAL EMPEROR DO</i>

436
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,346
TO RAISE THE STAKES EVEN HIGHER
<i>FOR THE DIGIDESTINED?</i>

437
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:21,012
<i>FIND OUT ON THE NEXT</i>
