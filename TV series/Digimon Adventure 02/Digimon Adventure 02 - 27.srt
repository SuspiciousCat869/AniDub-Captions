00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,169
Yolei: JUST AS WE FINISHED
WORKING ON A PART

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,782
OF THE DIGITAL WORLD,
THAT ARUKENIMON LADY TURNED

3
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:08,449
A CONTROL SPIRE INTO ANOTHER ONE
OF HER FAKE DIGIMON.

4
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,782
MINOTAUROMON STARTED
TO DESTROY ALL OUR HARD WORK.

5
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:12,782
DAVIS THOUGHT
WE SHOULD ASK KEN TO HELP US.

6
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:15,449
WE THOUGHT HE WAS NUTS!
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,449
IZZY CALLED KEN
AND FILLED HIM IN

8
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:18,949
ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

9
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:21,449
ARUKENIMON CREATED A REALLY
MEAN DIGIMON OF OKUOMON.

10
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:23,616
NONE OF OUR DIGIMON
HAD ANY EFFECT ON HIM.

11
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:26,282
WHEN DAVIS TRIED TO CONVINCE KEN
THEY NEED TO BE FRIENDS,

12
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:27,782
THIS WEIRD THING HAPPENED,

BEATING THE TAR

OUT OF THAT OKUOMON CHAP.

60
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:52,329
YEAH, BUT DOES HE HAVE
TO MAKE IT LOOK SO EASY?

61
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,729
IT MAKES THE REST OF US
LOOK LIKE WEAKLINGS.

62

HE'S TEARING UP OKUOMON LIKE
HE WAS A SCRATCHING POST.

00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:59,936
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.

130

162
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:12,595
OKUOMON!

163
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:14,062
GRAAH!

164
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:16,795
NO MORE MR. NICE GUY.
STING STRIKE!

165
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:24,462
THESE PIPES SEND ENERGY
TO THE REACTOR ABOVE.

166
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,395
FOLLOWING THEM
WILL LEAD US

167
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,562
RIGHT TO THE SOURCE
OF ITS POWER.

168
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,429
IF WE PLUG THAT SOURCE,

169
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,895
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP
THE REACTOR FROM EXPLODING.

170
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,462
GRAAH!

171
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:40,962
AAH!

172
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,429
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

173
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,862
WHERE ARE YOU?

174
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:48,962
HELLO?

175
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:51,062
THESE TUNNELS
GIVE ME THE CREEPS.

176
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:54,429
YOU KNOW, THIS REMINDS ME
OF SOMETHING.

177
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:57,062
HOW MUCH FURTHER
DO WE HAVE TO GO?

178
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,262
Davis: WHAT'S THAT?

179
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,029
All: AAH!

180
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:06,535
OH, NO!

181
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:09,502
THE TUNNEL'S BLOCKED.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

182
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,502
DON'T WORRY.

183
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:14,502
JUST LEAVE IT
TO OLD ARMADILLOMON.

184
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:15,802
DIAMOND SHELL!

185
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:19,702
FEATHER STRIKE!

186
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:24,535
YEAH!

187
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,502
NOW WE MAY CONTINUE.

188
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:29,769
OLLIE, OLLIE, OXEN-FREE.

189
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,435
HUH? WHOA!

190
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:38,335
NO FAIR.

191
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,835
HA HA HA!

192
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,835
TOO EASY.

193
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:45,802
THERE IT IS, THE SOURCE
OF THE REACTOR'S POWER.

194
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:49,269
BOY, IF EVIL'S
GOT A COLOR, THAT'S IT.

195
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,969
IT'S SO COLD.

196
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,102
THIS FEELING...

197
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,935
I REMEMBER.
THIS FEELS JUST LIKE

198
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,935
WHEN WE WERE
NEAR THAT WHIRLPOOL.

199
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:01,269
YEAH, I REMEMBER NOW.

200
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,242
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS
THE SAME DISTURBING FEELING.

201
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,009
I FELT IT, TOO,

202
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,942
WHEN I WAS PULLED
INTO THE WORLD

203
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:10,542
THAT LOOKED
LIKE A NEGATIVE PHOTOGRAPH.

204
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,275
EVERYTHING THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE LIGHT WAS DARK,

205
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,409
EVEN THE LIGHT.

206
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,442
Ken: THE WORLD OF DARKNESS.

207
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,875
HUH?

208
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,875
THIS IS A DOORWAY
THAT LEADS DIRECTLY

209
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,342
TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS.

210
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:24,942
T.K.: HOW DO YOU KNOW?

211
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,442
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SURROUNDED
BY THIS ENERGY

212
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:30,109
EVER SINCE I CAME
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

213
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,021
I CAN FEEL THAT THING'S
POWER BUILDING.

214
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,058
WE'D BETTER
DO SOMETHING QUICK.

215
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,125
Yolei: YEAH, BUT WHAT?

216
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,725
AAH!

217
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,691
IT'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE!

218
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,391
COME ON!

219
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,391
LOOK UP THERE.

220
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,658
WE'VE GOT
TO CLOSE THE OPENING

221
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,858
THE DARK POWER
IS COMING THROUGH.

222
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,325
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO, KEN?

223
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,825
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,

224
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,825
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO STOP THAT POWER FLOW.

225
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,991
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
AROUND HERE

226
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,958
THAT WE CAN USE
TO STOP IT.

227
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:09,931
UH-OH. THAT LOOKS
LIKE BIG TROUBLE.

228
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,631
TIME TO END THIS FIGHT.

229
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:15,631
DESPERADO BLASTER!

230
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:20,798
AAH!

231
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,898
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
GOING TO PIECES.

232
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:32,098
OKAY, IT'S TIME TO SAVE
SOME DIGIDESTINED.

233
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,598
WHOA, WHAT A DOOZY.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

234
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:38,598
I'M FINE, BUT MY PRIDE
IS BRUISED.

235
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,565
BUT LOOK!

236
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,898
Cody: THE POWER OUTPUT
IS INCREASING.

237
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:45,731
Davis: THIS LOOKS
LIKE THE END.

238
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:48,231
OH, NO! RUN, RUN!
WHY WON'T THEY RUN?

239
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,598
NO, IT CAN'T BE.

240
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,531
SOMEONE CALL FOR A HERO?

241
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,398
DESPERADO BLASTER!

242
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,931
AAH!

243
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:12,105
DO I KNOW HOW TO MAKE
AN ENTRANCE OR WHAT?

244
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,938
Together: PAILDRAMON!

245
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:16,405
THE WARP'S
RETURNING TO NORMAL.

246
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:18,405
WHOA.
BUT MY STIFF NECK ISN'T.

247
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,371
I'VE GOT TO LEARN
NOT TO GET SO EXCITED.

248
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,871
Cody: IZZY SAYS THE WARP
IS RETURNING TO NORMAL,

249
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,838
AND IT'S ALL
THANKS TO PAILDRAMON.

250
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:28,205
SAVE THE ACCOLADES.
THIS WAS JUST A BATTLE.

251
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,071
THE WAR
IS FAR FROM OVER.

252
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:34,871
ENJOY YOUR LITTLE VICTORY
WHILE YOU CAN.

253
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,871
EAT, DRINK, AND BE MERRY,
LITTLE DIGIDESTINED,

254
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:41,038
FOR SOON YOU'LL BE CRUSHED.

255
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,238
DESPERADO BLASTER!

256
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:55,471
YES, BLOW IT UP
SO NO ONE ELSE

257
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:58,138
CAN EVER USE IT AGAIN.

258
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,471
HEY, WE'RE OVER HERE.

259
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,971
DID WE DO THINGS THE WAY
YOU WANTED US TO?

260
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,638
YES, YOU DID
AN EXCELLENT JOB, MY FRIEND.

261
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,945
UM, YOU'RE VEEMON,
AREN'T YOU?

262
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:10,145
WELL, ACTUALLY, DAVIS,

263
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,411
YOU COULD JUST CALL ME
CHIBUMON FOR NOW.

264
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:14,378
WELL, WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS,
YOU ROCK.

265
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:15,811
HA HA HA!

266
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,345
WE MAKE
A GREAT TEAM, HUH?

267
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,645
WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM, TOO.

268
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:21,811
[ MUMBLES ]

269
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:22,978
WHAT'S WRONG?

270
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:25,311
I JUST DON'T FEEL
I DESERVE TO BE FRIENDS

271
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,311
WITH ANY OF YOU AT ALL.

272
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,311
BOY, THAT'S A LOT
OF BALONEY.

273
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,245
LOOK, KEN, YOU'VE
EARNED OUR FRIENDSHIP.

274
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,311
I HAVE?

275
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,978
SURE, YOU STARTED OUT
ALL MEAN AND EVIL,

276
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,478
BUT YOU DECIDED TO CHANGE
AND BECOME ONE OF US.

277
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,978
WORKING HARD LIKE THAT

278
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,145
BUILDS THE STRONGEST KIND
OF FRIENDSHIP.

279
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,478
TRUST ME, I KNOW FRIENDSHIP,
AND WE'RE FRIENDS,

280
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:47,178
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

281
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,745
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE DONE
A LOT OF BAD THINGS,

282
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,645
THINGS I'M NOT
PROUD OF AT ALL.

283
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:55,078
HEY, ALL OF US
HAVE MADE MISTAKES.

284
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,511
LOOK AT YOLEI.
SHE MAKES THEM ALL THE TIME.

285
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,245
Yolei: HEY!

286
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,911
I DON'T KNOW.

287
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,745
I NEED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

288
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,711
WAIT, KEN.
NO, DON'T GO.

289
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,451
BYE.

290
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,085
BUT WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

291
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:11,418
YOU ALWAYS COME ON
SO STRONG, DAVIS.

292
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:13,751
YOU CAN'T FORCE HIM
IF HE'S NOT READY.

293
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,418
YOU HAVE TO LET IT
HAPPEN NATURALLY.

294
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:17,418
YEAH, BUT WE JUST
FOUGHT TOGETHER.

295
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,418
THAT MAKES US FRIENDS,
DOESN'T IT?

296
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,418
FIGHTING'S ONE THING,
BUT MAYBE AFTERWARDS

297
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:23,418
HE REALIZED HE WASN'T READY
TO BE FRIENDS,

298
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:25,418
OR MAYBE HE'S UPSET
WITH SOMEONE

299
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:27,418
FOR POINTING OUT
HOW HE MAKES MISTAKES.

300
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:30,418
LET'S NOT FIGHT.
LET'S KEEP AN EYE ON KEN.

301
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,751
CODY'S RIGHT.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

302
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,751
ANY OF US
CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW,

303
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,285
SO LET'S GO HOME.

304
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:39,618
WELL, I HOPE HE DECIDES
TO BECOME OUR FRIEND SOON.

305
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,585
HOPE HE DOESN'T START THINKING
IT WOULD BE EASIER BEING EVIL.

306
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,585
Yolei: IZZY,
WE'LL BE THERE TOMORROW.

307
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,551
ARE PAY PHONES SUPPOSED
TO BE THIS STICKY?

308
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,518
Cody: WHAT DID IZZY SAY?

309
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:55,018
HE WANTS TO TELL US
ALL ABOUT DNA DIGEVOLVING.

310
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,018
Davis: SOMETIMES I WISH
HE WEREN'T SO SMART

311
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,018
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE
SO MUCH TO TELL US.

312
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,351
All: DAVIS!

313
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:02,518
I'M SORRY, BUT IT
HURTS MY BRAIN

314
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,518
TO HOLD
ALL THAT INFORMATION.

315
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:06,358
CAN WE TRUST KEN?

316
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,491
I THINK.

317
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:10,458
WE HAVE TO LEARN
TO TRUST EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

318
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,525
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM THAT WORRIES ME.

319
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,525

TALK TO IZZY TOMORROW,

WHAT TO DO ABOUT KEN.

323

LOOK AT THIS.

358

WHEN TWO DIGIMON

359
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,494
THE MOST POWERFUL PART
OF ONE OF THEM

360

MERGES WITH THE MOST
POWERFUL PART OF THE SECOND,

HOW HE CAME INTO EXISTENCE.

378
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,201
GENNAI CALLED US BACK
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

379
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,467
IT WAS GREAT SEEING FRIENDS
WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER SEE AGAIN.

380
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,434
WE FIGURED THAT WHEN WE
DESTROYED APOCALYMON,

381
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:46,401
THE WARP WAS REPAIRED
AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT,

382
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,267
BUT GENNAI TOLD US
WE HAD TO RELEASE

383
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,367
THE POWERS THAT PROTECT
THE DIGITAL WORLD

384
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,334
IN ORDER TO DEFEAT
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS.

385
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:54,767
HE HAD A HABIT
OF TELLING LONG STORIES

386
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,267
THAT I'M NOT SURE
EVEN HE UNDERSTOOD,

387
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,267
BUT WE ALL LISTENED INTENTLY,

388
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,301
AND WHEN HE WAS DONE,
WE KNEW WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

389
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,101
THE POWERS THAT PROTECT
THE DIGITAL WORLD?

390
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,767
THAT'S RIGHT.
IZZY TOLD ME THE STORY ONCE.

391
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:10,274
HE THINKS THOSE POWERS
ARE THE SAME FORCES

392
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,274
THAT ORIGINALLY PICKED US
TO BE DIGIDESTINED.

393
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,774
TO DEFEAT THE DARKNESS,

394
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:16,241
WE HAD TO RELEASE
THE POWERS OF OUR CRESTS.

395
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,441
THE EIGHT OF US KNEW
THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY

396
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,441
TO SAVE THE DIGITAL WORLD
FROM THE EVIL FORCES.

397
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,207
OUR EIGHT CRESTS COMBINED
TO CREATE A POWERFUL FORCE

398
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,541
THAT SPREAD ACROSS
THE DIGITAL WORLD,

399
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:29,007
KIND OF A COATING
OF GOODNESS,

400
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:31,441
LIKE THE LAMINATION
ON A BASEBALL CARD

401
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,474
OR THE PLASTIC THAT COVERS
A NEW BOX OF FLOPPY DISKS.

402
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:38,207
IT BROUGHT PEACE AND BEAUTY
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

403
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,874
THE EVIL SHIELD STOPPED
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

404
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,374
FROM SPREADING.

405
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:49,174
IT WAS GREAT,
EXCEPT THERE WAS A SIDE EFFECT.

406
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:52,041
BECAUSE WE HAD TO GIVE UP
THE POWER OF OUR CRESTS,

407
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:55,707
OUR DIGIMON LOST
THEIR ABILITY TO DIGEVOLVE

408
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,374
TO THEIR ULTIMATE FORMS.

409
00:17:57,474 --> 00:18:01,574
IT WAS A SACRIFICE
THAT MEANT, IN A WAY,

410

THEY HAD TO SAY GOODBYE
TO A SPECIAL PART OF THEMSELVES.

411

412
