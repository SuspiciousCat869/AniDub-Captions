WHY DO THEY CALL
THOSE THINGS

161
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,528
ON TOP OF THE TV
RABBIT EARS?

162
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:41,462
WHY DON'T THEY
CALL THEM CAT EARS?

163
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,995
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW A RABBIT

164

A QUIET PLACE.

THEIR OWN BUSINESS,

170

AND THEN THE DIGIMON EMPEROR
CAME ALONG.

171
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:04,535
THERE'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT SCARED THE GATSUMON.

172
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:07,302
THE EMPEROR CALLS THEM

IN THERE WAITING FOR US,

OF AMBUSH.

ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS ARMOR DIGEVOLVE.

178
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:19,968
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

179
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:22,302
HE MIGHT BE USING
DIGIMON HOSTAGES

180
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,302
AS A SHIELD
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

181
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,602
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES

182

I'M HAPPY! I'M HAPPY!

312
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,632
YOU ARE? AAH!

313
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:16,099
HA HA HA HA!

314
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,065
LEAVE HIM ALONE NOW!
HE'S HAD ENOUGH.

315
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,632
I DON'T DOUBT HE'S FEELING
A LITTLE FULL,

316
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,132
BUT HE MUST'VE SAVED ROOM
FOR DESSERT,

317
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:26,532
AND I'VE COOKED UP
A SWEET SURPRISE!

318
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,665
IF ONLY I COULD DIGEVOLVE.

319
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,499
THERE MUST BE A WAY.

320
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,632
V-MON!

321
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:37,565
AND NOW HERE'S THE SURPRISE
I PROMISED YOU --

322
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,032
A DOUBLE HELPING OF...

323
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:40,165
SPIKED PUNCH!

324
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:42,099
V-MON!
DUCK! NO!

325
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,472
GABUMON DIGEVOLVE TO...

326
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,872
GARURUMON!

327
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,605
WHAT?

328
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,572
Davis: GABUMON,
HOW DID YOU DIGEVOLVE?

329
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:25,839
GRRAAH!

330
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:27,805
AAH!
AAH!

331
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,539
HOWLING BLASTER!

332
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:39,105
DIGIARMOR, ENERGIZE!

333
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,146
V-MON ARMOR DIGEVOLVE TO...

334
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,086
FLAMEDRAMON --
THE FIRE OF COURAGE!

335
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,120
NO!

336
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,953
FLAME FIST!

337
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,453
BOY, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU,
FLAMEDRAMON.

338
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:18,886
IT'S TIME
FOR A LITTLE PAYBACK.

339
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:21,353
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE
THIS OVERGROWN HOUSEPLANT

340
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:22,853
A REAL COOKING LESSON.

341
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:27,020
FLAMEDRAMON, GET HIM!

342
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?

343
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,153
AAH!

344
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,886
THAT HURT.

345
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,353
FIRE ROCKET!

346
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,453
AAH, I'VE HEARD OF GRILLED
VEGETABLES BEFORE,

347
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:44,086
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

348
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,820
YOU DID IT!

349
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,020
Yoli: DAVIS!

350
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:50,886
GARURUMON...

351
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,886
HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO DIGEVOLVE?

352
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,886
I'M NOT QUITE SURE.

353
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:57,386
WHEN RED VEGIMON'S PUNCH
CRACKED THE CONTROL SPIRE,

354
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,386
WE WERE FREED
FROM ITS POWER.

355
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,353
THEY'RE CERTAINLY GOING
TO NEED A LOT OF GLUE.

356
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:04,386
WE SHOULD DESTROY
THE SPIRE,

357
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:07,293
AND WHO BETTER TO DO THE JOB
THAN DIGMON?

358
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,926
DIGIARMOR, ENERGIZE!

359
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:23,260
ARMADILLOMON
ARMOR DIGEVOLVE TO...

360
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:43,326
DIGMON --
THE DRILL OF POWER!

361
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,426
ROCK CRACKING!

362
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:59,860
SORRY, I FORGOT
TO YELL "TIMBER!"

363
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,826
WHOA, DID I GET MARRIED
WHILE I WAS ASLEEP?

364
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:04,793
[ GRUNTING ]

365
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:06,800
OH, NOW I SEE HOW
IT WORKS.

366
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,866
MAY I INQUIRE AS TO WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

367
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:10,833
THE SPIRE.

368
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,266
IT ACTED LIKE
AN ELECTRICITY ROD.

369
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:16,333
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR SET IT UP
TO SEND OUT POWER

370
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,833
TO THE DARK RINGS,
MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM

371
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,233
TO CONTROL DIGIMON
THROUGHOUT THE AREA.

372
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,233
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, IZZY?

373
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,166
YEAH, I'M QUITE IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR THEORY, YOLI.

374
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,866
I WONDER HOW MANY MORE
CONTROL SPIRES THERE ARE

375
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,866
SCATTERED AROUND
THE DIGITAL WORLD.

376
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,866
WELL, WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS,
ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE

377
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:35,166
IS THEY ALL
HAVE TO BE DESTROYED.

378
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:38,200
QUITE A TOUGH MISSION
FOR THE NEW DIGIDESTINED.

379
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,866
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

380
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:40,400
YOU SAID IT.

381
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:41,866
SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE

382
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,366
THE GATSUMON BACK
TO THEIR HOMES NOW.

383
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,000
I'M ALL OVER IT.

384
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,700
COME ON!

385
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,133
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
BIG BROTHER.

386
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,833
GARURUMON WILL STAY HERE

387
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,133
AND PROTECT YOU GUYS
FROM THE EMPEROR.

388
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,100
GARURUMON!

389
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,191
I'M GLAD THE GATSUMON AREN'T
STAYING WITH US ANYMORE.

390
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,786
THEY CLAWED THE SINK
WHEN THEY BRUSHED THEIR TEETH.

391
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,793
THEY WERE
KIND OF COOL, THOUGH.

392
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:12,493
HEY, EVERYONE,
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

393
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,793
WOW, WHAT IS THAT?

394
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:17,259
I FOUND IT WHEN I WAS EXAMINING
YOUR DIGIVICE, YOLI.

395
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,259
IT SEEMS TO BE A MAP
OF THE DIGITAL WORLD.

396
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,493
DO YOU SEE THIS WHITE SQUARE?

397
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,726
IT USED TO BE BLACK UNTIL
WE DESTROYED THE CONTROL SPIRE.

398
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:27,226
THERE ARE A LOT
OF BLACK SQUARES LEFT,

399
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:29,493
AND THEY ALL HAVE SPIRES.

400
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:32,493
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO TURN
BLACK SQUARES INTO WHITE ONES.

401
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:36,193
AND HOW DO WE KNOW HE WON'T
BUILD NEW SPIRES?

402
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,193
THEY DON'T MAKE
CONTROL SPIRES

403
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,559
LIKE THEY USED TO.

404
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:44,759
WAY TO GO, GREYMON! YOU'RE
A ONE-MON WRECKING CREW.

405
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,199
WHAT? A SPIRE
WAS DESTROYED?

406
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,265
IT MUST BE
THOSE MEDDLING KIDS.

407
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,265
OH, WELL.
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

408
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,865
THAT AREA
WAS PRETTY UNIMPORTANT

409
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:56,432
IN THE GRAND SCHEME.

410
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,932
WITHIN A YEAR,
I WILL HAVE EVERY AREA

411
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,432
UNDER MY FULL CONTROL.

412
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,832
THEN, EVERY LIVING THING
IN THE DIGITAL WORLD

413
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:05,832
WILL BECOME MY SLAVE
FOREVER,

414
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:08,099
AND THAT INCLUDES
THOSE KIDS, TOO.

415
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,039
HA HA HA HA!

416
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,205
Man: <i>WHAT IS THE DIGIMON</i>
<i>EMPEROR'S MASTER PLAN?</i>

417
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:15,205

<i>TO THE PUZZLE REVEALED</i>

418
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:15,339
