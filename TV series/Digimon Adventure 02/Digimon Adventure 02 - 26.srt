WE REALLY LEARNED A LOT
FROM OUR MISTAKES.

167

THE CHANCE
TO MAKE NEW MISTAKES.

MY OLD MISTAKES BETTER.

170

WE SHOULD ASK KEN NOW.

All: KEN?

172

Davis: THANKS
FOR THE SUPPORT.

173
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:18,596
SERIOUSLY, I BET HE'D JUMP
AT THE CHANCE TO HELP US.

174
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,863
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

BUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN HELP.

177
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,496
WELL, I'M JUST NOT
COMFORTABLE AROUND HIM.

178
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,796
IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE
TO REALLY CHANGE.

179
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,163
I THINK IT'S TOO RISKY.

180

YOU GOT A POINT,

181
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,030
BUT I HAVE A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT HIM, CODY.

182
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,430
REALLY?
BUT WHY, DAVIS?

183
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,963
THE DIGIEGG.

184
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:43,030
IF YOU HAD SEEN WHAT I SAW,

185
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,830
YOU'D BELIEVE IN HIM, TOO.

186
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,730
I MEAN, HIS CREST OF KINDNESS
TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DIGIEGG.

187
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,363
IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING.

188
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:52,263
YOU'RE GOING
TO THINK I'M CRAZY,

189
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,763
BUT YOU ALREADY
THINK I'M CRAZY, SO HERE GOES.

190
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,263
THAT DIGIEGG BELIEVED IN HIM.

191
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:58,263
IT WAS LIKE
IT WAS TELLING ME

192
00:07:58,363 --> 00:07:59,663
I COULD BELIEVE, TOO.

193
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:02,163
IT ALMOST FELT LIKE
IT WAS ASKING ME

194
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:04,136
TO GO AHEAD AND TRUST HIM.

195
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,103
I KNOW THAT'S NOT VERY LOGICAL,
BUT NEITHER AM I.

196
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,436
ALL I KNOW IS

197
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:11,070
HE HAS THE CREST
OF KINDNESS FOR A REASON.

198
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,603
AND WHAT ABOUT HIS DIGIMON?
HE BELIEVES IN THEM, TOO.

199

202
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,203
HE'S MADE IT CLEAR

203
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:23,703
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE PART OF OUR TEAM.

204
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,170
I KNOW,
BUT I'M AN OPTIMIST.

205
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,670
REALISTICALLY, HE COULD
STILL BE BAD TO THE BONE.

206
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,136
I THINK CODY'S RIGHT.
HE USUALLY IS.

IT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM YOU.
CHECK IT OUT.

215

AND THIS IS IMPORTANT.

317
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,761
THE DIGITAL WORLD
IS IN TROUBLE, KEN.

318
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,594
THEY NEED YOU RIGHT AWAY.

319
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:55,394
THAT BOY DAVIS
IS SENDING E-MAILS.

320
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,361
[ GROANS ]

321
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:00,328
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

322
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,794
MAYBE I DID.

323
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:04,628
YOU NEED TO GET
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD

324
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:06,634
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND TAKE YOUR CREST.

325
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:08,768
I THINK DAVIS MAY
ACTUALLY BE RIGHT THIS TIME.

326
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,434
HIS THEORY IS THAT
THE POWER SOURCE OF YOUR BASE

327
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,601
CAN ONLY BE CONTAINED
BY YOUR CREST.

328
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:14,934
IT'S A GOOD THEORY.

329
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,268
OH, EMPEROR BOY...

330
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:18,734
I HAVE A LITTLE THEORY
OF MY OWN TO CHECK OUT.

331
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,734
HA HA HA HA HA.

332
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,268
VERY CLEVER,
BUT I'M STILL AHEAD OF YOU.

333
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:24,968

ANOTHER ONE?

335
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:31,234
DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD
ALL MOVE BACK A LITTLE?

336
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,201
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

337
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,168
YOU'RE THINKING
TOO MUCH AGAIN.

338
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:41,168
THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE TO
FIND A WAY TO END THIS.

339
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:44,168
SHE USED MY PAIN AND GUILT
TO CONTROL ME.

340
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,168
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

341
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,168
I'M GUILTY
OF TOO MUCH ALREADY.

342
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,168
MAMA, PAPA, WHERE'S SAM?

343
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:51,534
NOT THIS TIME!

IT'S GETTING WORSE!

345
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:57,701
SO WHERE'S KEN, HUH?

346
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,834
I'M SURE
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

347

DO THAT THING?

HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

421
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:03,109
I WAS THE DIGIMON EMPEROR.
I WAS A MONSTER.

422
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:06,576
AND I AM AS GUILTY AS KEN.
I DIDN'T STOP HIM.

423
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:08,543
YOU TWO NEED TO CHILL.

LIKE A HUMAN AGAIN

INSTEAD OF A MONSTER

426
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,049
IS TO ERASE ALL TRACE
OF MY EVIL, TO FIX THINGS,

427
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,383
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO DO THAT

428
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,216
IS WITH MY OWN HANDS.

429
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,516
BUT, KEN --

430
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,516
HE STILL HAS NIGHTMARES --
HORRIBLE ONES.

00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:24,716
BUT THEN, MINE ARE WORSE.

432
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,216
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME

ACCOMPLISH MY GOAL.

434
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,883

00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,283
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
DO THIS BY YOURSELF. GET IT?

439
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,283
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT YOU?

440
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:43,049

THINK OF YOUR DIGIMON.

HERE'S YOUR CHANCE

00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:51,649
TO STOP HIM
FROM DOING SOMETHING STUPID.

446
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:52,983
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

447
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,149
YOU'RE THE GENIUS, KEN.
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

448

IF I'M NOT HERE...

449
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,549
THEN WHAT?

450
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,383
DAVIS IS RIGHT.
THEN WHAT?

451
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:03,016
HOW WILL YOU FIX YOUR MISTAKES
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE?

452
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:05,016
I MAY NOT BE
THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED,

453
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,483
BUT I KNOW THAT MUCH.

454
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,983

00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:13,456
OKAY, SO YOU MESSED UP
A FEW TIMES.

457
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:15,956
YOU THINK I HAVEN'T?
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

458
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,423
DON'T GIVE UP.
FIX IT!

459
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,889
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

DO YOU THINK I DO?

461
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:23,856
YOU JUST KEEP TRYING
UNTIL SOMETHING WORKS,

462
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,856
AND WHEN IT GETS REALLY BAD,
YOU HANG WITH YOUR FRIENDS,

463
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,023
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
YOUR FRIENDS,

464

EVEN WHEN YOU MESS UP.

465
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:32,156
