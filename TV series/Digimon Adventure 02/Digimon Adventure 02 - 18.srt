1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:02,522
<i>WE HAD A COOL REUNION</i>

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:04,522
<i>TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY</i>
<i>OF OUR FIRST TRIP</i>

00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:06,022

00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:09,322

<i>FROM THE EARLY DAYS.</i>

6
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:11,822
<i>WE DIDN'T KNOW</i>
THERE WAS A STRANGE DARK SHADOW

7
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:14,322
<i>THAT HAD STARTED APPEARING</i>
<i>ALL OVER THE TV STATION.</i>

8
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:16,255
<i>IT WAS OUR OLD FRIEND</i>
<i>WIZARDMON.</i>

9
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:19,222
<i>HE'D COME TO WARN US</i>
<i>THAT THE DIGIMON EMPEROR</i>

10
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:21,189
<i>ISN'T THE ONLY EVIL</i>
<i>TO WATCH OUT FOR.</i>

11
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,255

00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,522

00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,289

THE DIGIMON EMPEROR.

39
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:33,562
I HOPE THE OTHERS
ARE HAVING LUCK.

40
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,829
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

41
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,862
I WONDER
HOW CODY'S DOING.
AAH!

42
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:40,362
YOU OKAY, CODY?

43
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:43,562
OH, OH, YES,
THANKS TO YOU.

44
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:47,029
YOU CAN MAKE IT.
WE'RE ALMOST AT THE TOP.

45
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:49,729
YOU TWO, GET UP HERE.
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.

46
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,929
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
TENTOMON.

47
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,229
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I TOLD YOU.

48
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,195
I'M SEEING THINGS,
I THINK.

49
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,969
DIG THIS.

50
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,969
WOW. LOOK AT ALL THOSE.

51
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,835
THERE'S HUNDREDS
OF CONTROL SPIRES.

52
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:09,269
AND HUNDREDS
OF EVIL DIGIMON SLAVES, TOO.

53
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,135
THOSE POOR DIGIMON.

54
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,002
IT SEEMS TO ME
THE DARK TYRANNOMON

55
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:20,002
ARE COMING OUT
OF THAT STRANGE DOME.

56
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:21,569
I'LL BET YOU THAT'S WHERE

57
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,602
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR'S
HEADQUARTERS ARE.

58
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,735
UH-OH.
WE BETTER TAKE COVER.

59
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:31,435
I HOPE WE DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP.

60
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:34,535
NO WAY YOU CAN DIGIVOLVE
WITH ALL THESE CONTROL SPIRES.

61
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:37,002
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T
SPOTTED US YET.

62
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:39,502
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT MY FLY SWATTER.

63
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:41,202
GET HIM, DIGMON.

64
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:43,835

[ BOTH SCREAM ]

68
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:56,969
MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

69
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,469
[ BOTH SCREAM ]

70
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,009
MY D-3 IS GOING WILD. WHOA!

71
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:03,042
GOING SOMEWHERE?

72
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,542
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR!

73
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,542
SO NICE OF YOU TO DROP IN
ON MY HEADQUARTERS.

74
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:10,475
IT SAVES ME THE TIME
OF HUNTING YOU DOWN.

75
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:12,175
I'VE GOT TO TRY
THE DIGIVOLVE.

76
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,642
GO.

77
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:15,842
TENTOMON DIGIVOLVE TO...

78
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,675
OH, FORGET IT.

79
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,842
I CAN'T DIGIVOLVE.

80
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,275
HA HA HA!

81
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,275
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU PEOPLE

82
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,809
YOU'RE SITTING IN
THE NO-DIGIVOLVING SECTION?

83
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,609
THANKS, DIGMON.

84
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,609
DO I KNOW HOW
TO DIG A HOLE OR WHAT?

85
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,942
OKAY, WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

86
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,642
THERE ARE NO
CONTROL SPIRES HERE.

87
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:44,142
TENTOMON!

88
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,142
I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT.

89
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:48,142
TENTOMON DIGIVOLVE TO...

90
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:51,075
KABUTERIMON.

91
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,375
SO THAT'S KABUTERIMON.

92
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:57,809
I THINK I'LL ADD HIM
TO MY COLLECTION.

93
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,549
HA HA HA!

94
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:08,925
THAT'S EVERYONE.

95
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,325
IS MY MOM HERE?

96
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,725
NO, WE WERE LUCKY.

97
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:12,679
WE MADE IT BACK
BEFORE SHE GOT HOME.

98
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,012
THAT WAS CLOSE.

99
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:16,179
WHAT DID YOU FIND
IN YOUR AREA?

100
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,645
THE PLACE WAS COVERED
WITH CONTROL SPIRES.

101
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:19,845
I KNEW IT.

102
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:22,212
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
A CONTROL SPIRE CONVENTION.

103
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,545
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
THERE WERE HUNDREDS.

104
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,379
WE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE,
TOO --

105
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,512
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR'S BASE.

106
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:30,479
HIS BASE?
YEAH.

107
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,479
<i>I'll keep my eyes</i>
<i>on things here</i>

108
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,179
<i>and report back</i>
<i>if there's trouble.</i>

109
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,178
RIGHT.

110
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:37,512
ALL RIGHT,

111
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,645
EVERYBODY SHOULD
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

112
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,978
All: HUH?

113
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:43,612
FIRST, LOOK AT THE AREA
DAVIS EXPLORED.

114
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:46,779
NEXT IS THE AREA
THAT T.K.'s GROUP WAS IN.

115
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,079
FINALLY,
HERE'S WHERE MY GROUP WAS.

116
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,045
IF WE CONNECT THEM
TOGETHER...

117
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,545
IT'S A CIRCUS CLOWN.
I LOVE THIS GAME.

118
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,245
NO, DAVIS, IT'S A PATH.

119
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,245
HE'S TAKING OVER
ALL THE AREAS.

120
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:59,745
THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT
OF OUR WORLD.

121
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,812
NOT TO MENTION
OUR FRIENDS.

122
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:04,319
THAT'S IT. NOW I'M REALLY
STARTING TO GET UPSET.

123
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,285
IF WE COULD ONLY
DESTROY THAT BASE.

124
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:08,385
THAT'S IT.

125
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:10,385
IF WE DESTROY
THE EMPEROR'S HEADQUARTERS,

126
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:12,985
THEN THE CONTROL SPIRES
WILL BE USELESS.

127
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:14,485
THAT MAKES SENSE.

128
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:17,485
SO WHY ARE WE SITTING AROUND
LIKE A BUNCH OF YAHOOS?

129
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,985
I SAY WE GO
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD,

130
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,985
FIND HIS BASE, AND RIP IT UP
LIKE A BAD CHECK.

131
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,985
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,
WALK UP THERE AND SAY,

132
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,985
"EXCUSE ME, DO YOU MIND IF
WE TEAR DOWN THIS BUILDING?"

133
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,485
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

134
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:33,485
I SUPPOSE WE HAVE TO COME UP
WITH SOME SORT OF PLAN.

135
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,985
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A LOT OF THINKING.

136
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,452
I ALSO THINK
IT'S GOING TO TAKE LONGER

137
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,452
THAN ONE DAY TO ACCOMPLISH.

138
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:43,452
I SUPPOSE IF WE ALL HAD TO
BE BACK BY A CERTAIN TIME,

139
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,419
WE WOULDN'T CONCENTRATE
ON DESTROYING THE BASE.

140
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,919
THEN WE ALL HAVE TO
AGREE ON ONE THING --

141
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,619
WE DON'T RETURN
UNTIL THE BASE IS DESTROYED.

142
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:52,819
YOU MEAN --

143
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,252
IF I'M NOT THERE
FOR MY MOM'S TUNA CASSEROLE,

144
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:56,752
SHE'LL KNOW
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

145
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:59,252
I HAVEN'T MISSED ONE
IN TWO YEARS.

146
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:01,585
MAKE UP SOME EXCUSE
TO TELL HER.

147
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:04,159
YOU GOT PICKED FOR A SECRET
MISSION TO MARS.

148
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,659
IF YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS THAT,
THEY'D BELIEVE YOU?

149
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,625
THEY DON'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING I SAY.

150
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:11,125
WITH ALL THESE CONTROL SPIRES
IN THE DIGITAL WORLD,

151
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:14,125
THERE'S NO WAY OUR DIGIMON
WILL BE ABLE TO DIGIVOLVE.

152
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,125
THAT MEANS US OLDER KIDS
WOULD BE USELESS IF WE GO

153
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,625
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD
WITH YOU GUYS.

154
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:23,325
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS WE CAN HELP
WITHOUT GOING WITH THEM.

155
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,825
WHILE YOU GUYS GO
TO THE DIGITAL WORLD,

156
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,159
THE REST OF US WILL GO
ON A CAMPING TRIP.

157
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,692
HOW DOES IT HELP

158
