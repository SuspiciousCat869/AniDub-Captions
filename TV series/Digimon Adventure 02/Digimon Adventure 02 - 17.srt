1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:06,042
<i>WE WERE ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN</i>
<i>THERE WAS A NEW DIGI-EGG</i>
<i>IN AN OIL PLATFORM.</i>
<i>BEFORE WE COULD GET IT OUT,</i>

2
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:08,108
<i>MEGASEADRAMON TRAPPED US</i>
<i>UNDERWATER.</i>

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,542
<i>THE ESCAPE POD ONLY HELD</i>
<i>ONE PERSON.</i>

4
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:12,442
<i>WE WANTED CODY TO GO FOR HELP.</i>

5
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:16,275
<i>HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE US.</i>
<i>WE DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHOICE.</i>

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,908
<i>WE FOUND THE DIGI-EGG WHEN</i>
<i>WHAMON CAME TO OUR RESCUE.</i>

7
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,575
<i>CODY LIFTED THE DIGI-EGG</i>

8
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:26,375
<i>AND ARMADILLOMON DIGIVOLVED</i>
<i>TO SUBMARIMON.</i>

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:30,242
<i>HE AND IKKAKUMON CERTAINLY</i>
<i>TAUGHT MEGASEADRAMON A LESSON.</i>

"WHEN PARAKEETS ATTACK,"
WILL BE A SMASH HIT.

36
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,715
YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.

37
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,882
DID YOU CHECK THE CAMERA
BEFORE YOU FILMED THIS FOOTAGE?

38
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,882
OF COURSE.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

39
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:51,382
OKAY, THEN WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT SHADOW?

40
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,415

IS THAT ALL YOU CAN
THINK ABOUT -- FOOD?

45
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,155
TRAVELING TO AND FROM
THE DIGITAL WORLD

46
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:13,155
CAN WORK UP
QUITE AN APPETITE.

47
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:15,322
HE'S RIGHT.
WE DESERVE TO CELEBRATE

48
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:18,155
FOR OUR LATEST VICTORY
OVER THE DIGIMON EMPEROR.

49
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,822
PIZZA -- THERE'S A RAD
NEW PLACE BY THE BEACH.

50
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:22,988
HALF ANCHOVIES,
HALF MUSTARD.

51
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,655
CODY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

52
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,488
NOTHING. I'M JUST NOT SURE
IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE

53
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:30,455
WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE DIGIMON EMPEROR IS UP TO.

54
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,822
MAYBE CODY'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY

55
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:35,488
HOLD OFF ON THE PIZZA
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT

56
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,155
OUR NEXT PLAN OF ATTACK.

57
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:39,322
WE CAN'T FIGHT HIM
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

58
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:40,922
HA HA HA.
YEAH, YEAH!

59
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,655
Cody: STARTING TOMORROW,

60
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,988
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO USE THIS CLASSROOM.

61
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,488
WHAT? WHY NOT?

62
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,155
THE DETENTION ROOM
HAS BEEN MOVED HERE,

63
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,655
AND ALL THE BAD KIDS

64
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,988
WILL BE PUT
IN THE COMPUTER LAB.

65
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,655
HEY, WE'RE NOT ALL BAD!

66
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:57,988
HOW CAN WE GO IF WE CAN'T
ACCESS THE COMPUTER LAB?

67
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,055
WAIT A SEC.
WE CAN'T GO

68
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,595
INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD
TOMORROW ANYWAY.

69
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,095
WE HAVE BIG PLANS.

70
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:06,428
WHAT PLANS?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WE"?

71
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,428
HE MEANS PLANS
WITH ME, DAVIS.

72
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:09,928
AAH!

73
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,562
ARE YOU TWO TALKING
ABOUT A DATE TOGETHER?

74
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,528
OF COURSE NOT, SILLY.

75
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,495
YOU GUYS HAVE A DATE
TO DO FRACTIONS?

76
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,095
WHAT GIVES?

77
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,762
NO, DAVIS.
THAT'S A DATE, NOT A FRACTION.

78
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,595
TOMORROW MARKS THE ANNIVERSARY

79
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,928
OF WHEN THE DIGIDESTINED
DEFEATED MYOTISMON.

80
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:29,262
DAVIS THOUGHT
IT WAS A FRACTION.

81
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,095
WELL, HOW SHOULD I KNOW

82
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:33,328
THEY STARTED PUTTING MATH
IN CALENDARS?

83
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:35,962
DO YOU WANT
TO COME WITH US?

84
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,595
ON YOUR DATE?

85
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,562
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NOT A DATE.

86
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,595
DO YOU PROMISE, KARI?

87
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,498
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY
BEEN FOUR YEARS
SINCE WE WENT
INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD.

88
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,680
I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING
IN SUMMER CAMP ONE SECOND,

89
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,680
THEN IN ANOTHER DIMENSION
THE NEXT.

90
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,013
THAT BEATS CANOEING
AND ARCHERY ANY DAY.

91
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:02,347
I WAS SICK.
I MISSED CAMP THAT SUMMER.

92
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:05,020
YOU WEREN'T THERE
THE FIRST TIME

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,187
WE SAW THE WEIRD STUFF.

94
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:11,487
WAIT. YOU GUYS LOOK
WEIRD TO US, YOU KNOW.

95
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,953
LOOK, IT'S TAI
AND THE WHOLE GANG.

96
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,420
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, GUYS.

97
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,353
HEY!
MIMI.
HI.

98
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:19,853
WOW,
WHAT A REUNION.

99
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,520
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME

100
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,387
SINCE WE'VE ALL
BEEN TOGETHER.

101
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:24,520
NO KIDDING.

102
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,020
THERE'S ENOUGH OF US HERE

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,853
TO START
OUR OWN SOCCER LEAGUE.

104
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:31,187
NOT ALL THE CORRUPTED DIGIMON
WE ENCOUNTERED WERE IN FACT BAD.

105
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,187
THEY WERE JUST
UNDER THE INFLUENCE

106
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,820
OF THE EVIL BLACK EARS.

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,520
WE FOUND OUT WE COULD
DESTROY THE BLACK EARS

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,520
WITH OUR DIGIVICES
AND FREE THEM.

109
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,020
THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS
AND EVENTUALLY HELPED US

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,853
DEFEAT THE FOUR DARK MASTERS.

111
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:47,353
THOSE DARK MASTERS SOUND
LIKE MY MATH TEACHER.

112
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,187
THEY SHOULD MAKE A MOVIE
OUT OF THIS STORY.

113
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,187
I HOPE THESE GRASS STAINS
WILL COME OUT OF MY CLOTHES

114
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,953
OR MY MOM WILL GROUND ME.

115
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,787
YOU GUYS HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER
NO MATTER WHAT.

116
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:00,453
REMEMBER THAT FRIENDSHIP
IS THE KEY.

117
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:02,487
THERE IT IS.

118
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,327
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

119
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:08,293
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
IMPOSSIBLE.

120
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,960
I'VE WATCHED THIS
STUPID TAPE 50 TIMES,

121
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,293
AND EVERY TIME, THAT SHADOW
DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

122
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:18,260
AND THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME
AS A DIRECTOR.

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,127
LOOK AT THOSE MONITORS.
IT'S NOT JUST US.

124
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,293
THAT SHADOW IS ON
EVERY PROGRAM

125
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:24,827
ON THIS TV STATION.

126
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,960
HAVE YOU CHECKED
FOR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES?

127
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,793
THIS ISN'T TECHNICAL,
BOSS.

128
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:30,793
THEN WHAT IS IT,
SMART GUY?

129
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,127
A GHOST.

130
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:34,293
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL MY BOSS

131
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:36,293
I CAN'T GET MY SHOW
ON THE AIR

132
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:38,760
BECAUSE OF A GHOST?
THEY'LL CAN ME FOR SURE.

133
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,427
I SHOULD HAVE GONE
TO ACCOUNTING SCHOOL.

134
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,427
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY.
I MUST ADMIT,

135
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,127
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T LIVE UP
TO THE ACHIEVEMENTS

136
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:52,127
OF YOU ORIGINAL DIGIDESTINED.

137
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,727
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF WE COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

138
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,060
I'M READY TO FIGHT
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

139
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,727
DAVIS,
YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

140
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:00,893
THAT'S THE SPIRIT --
TAKE NO PRISONERS.

141
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:01,893
OH, YEAH?

142
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:03,900
CAN THE REST
OF YOU HANDLE IT?

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
I'M NOT SURE.

144
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,300
JUST FOLLOW DAVIS.

145
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,567
AAH!

146
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,667
[ ALL LAUGHING ]

147
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,900
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
IN A WHILE.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
IT'S THE SAME,

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,733
INCLUDING THE SMELL
OF YOUR SOCKS.

150
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,567
I JUST FINISHED
CLEANING THE PLACE.

151
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,067
I SEE.

152
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,067
HOW LONG
HAVE THESE BEEN HERE?

153
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,567
QUIT NITPICKING, T.K.

154
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,067
DAD'S BEEN PUTTING IN
A LOT OF HOURS,

155
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,567
AND I'VE BEEN REHEARSING
WITH MY BAND.

156
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,567
OH, SORRY.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

157
