1
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,600
Cody: CAN YOU BELIEVE OWIKAWA
USED TO BE MY DAD'S BEST FRIEND?
GRANDPA KNEW ARMADILLOMON
WAS A DIGIMON

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,033
BECAUSE DAD AND OWIKAWA HAD SEEN
THE DIGITAL WORLD YEARS AGO.

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,066
OWIKAWA IS DESPERATE TO GO
TO THE DIGIWORLD,

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,833
AND SOMEHOW HE'S PLANNING TO USE
THE DARK BLOOMS TO GET THERE.

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,400
GRANDPA TRIED TO CONVINCE
OWIKAWA TO BE GOOD AGAIN.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,833
IT DIDN'T WORK!
THEN BLACK WARGREYMON SHOWED UP

7
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,533
TO FIGHT WITH OWIKAWA
AND WAS HURT PRETTY BADLY,

8
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,566
BUT BEFORE HE WAS COMPLETELY
RECONFIGURED,

9
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,000
BLACK WARGREYMON SACRIFICED
HIMSELF TO SEAL THE GATE.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,600
IT WAS HORRIBLE,
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,566
I TOLD HIM
HE HAD A HEART.

Yolei: WELL, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE MEETING PLACE.

36
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:35,506
Davis: YEAH,
BUT NO ONE'S EVEN HERE.

37
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:37,640
Kari: WAIT, LOOK,
THERE'S ONE OF THEM NOW!

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,440
Izzy: AND THERE'S
ANOTHER ONE, TOO.

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,673
Cody: THEY SEEM TO BE WAITING
FOR SOMETHING.

40
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:43,840
Kari: DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE WAITING FOR OWIKAWA?

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,806
Yolei: I WONDER IF THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE ALL HERE.

42
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,206
Cody:
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

43
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:49,806
MAYBE THIS'LL BE OUR CHANCE
TO CAPTURE HIM.

44
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:52,373
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS,
LET'S NOT RUSH INTO ANYTHING.

45
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:54,340
BUT WHY ARE THEY
AT HIGHTON VIEW TERRACE?

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,373
A GATE TO THE DIGITAL WORLD
HAS BEEN OPENED

47
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:58,006
IN THIS LOCATION
MANY TIMES BEFORE.

48
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,506
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE HERE.

49
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,913
BUT ACCORDING TO WHAT
GATOMON AND THE OTHERS SAID,

50
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:03,980
BLACK WARGREYMON COMPLETELY
SEALED THE GATE

51
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,813
BETWEEN THE WORLDS, UNLESS THOSE
CHILDREN DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

52
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:08,413
Cody: THEN OWIKAWA DOESN'T,
EITHER.

53
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:09,646
Davis: HEY, T.K.!

54
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:11,146
Cody: SHH! BIG MOUTH!

55
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:12,746
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
TAI AND SORA ARE?

56
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,046
THEY'RE KEEPING AN EYE
ON THAT GIRL FROM YESTERDAY

57
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:16,713
TO MAKE SURE NOTHING HAPPENS
TO HER.

58
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,379
Tai: BE VERY QUIET,
AGUMON.

59
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,880
WE CAN'T LET HER KNOW
WE'RE HERE.

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,213
Agumon: I AM BEING
VERY QUIET.

61
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,213
BUT YOU'RE NOT BEING VERY
INVISIBLE. GET BACK HERE!

62
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,813
Agumon: BEING A SPY
WOULD BE EASIER

63
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,613
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO
SO MUCH SPYING.

64
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,713
DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT SORA'S
WITH TAI INSTEAD OF YOU?

65
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:31,546
COME ON,
TAI'S MY BEST FRIEND,

66
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:33,246
AND HE KNOWS
HOW I FEEL.

67
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:35,246
BESIDES, I COMPLETELY
TRUST SORA.

68
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:37,046
I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL,
IZZY.

69
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,946
[ CELLULAR PHONE RINGS ]

70
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:41,413
HELLO?
HI, IZZY HONEY,
IT'S MOM.

71
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:43,913
I'M DOWN
AT HIGHTON VIEW TERRACE.

72
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,413
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

73
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:51,213
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
THINKING ABOUT THE FACT

74
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,146
THAT ALL THE OTHER PARENTS
ARE DOING THEIR PART

75
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:55,046
TO HELP OUT
ALL OF YOU KIDS --

76
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:57,880
YOU KNOW, EACH ONE LENDING
THEIR OWN EXPERTISE.

77
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,220
SO I SAT RIGHT DOWN
AND ASKED MYSELF,

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,520
NOW, WHAT'S MY EXPERTISE?
AND THE ANSWER IS SNACKS!

79
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,220
SO I MADE YOU GUYS SOME PB&J
WITH THE CRUST CUT OFF.

80
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,886
PB&J?
BUT, MOM...

81
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:12,186
IZZY, I KNOW HOW
YOU HATE THE CRUSTS.

82
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:16,153
AW, OKAY, HOLD ON.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

83
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:17,586
OKAY. BYE.

84
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:20,853
MY MOM.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, GUYS.

85
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,320
PB&J!
YEE-HAW!

86
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,986
DON'T YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE DIGITAL WORLD

87
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,653
JUST SEEMS TO BE GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE?

88
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,853
I MEAN,
WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA

89
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,486
OF WHAT OWIKAWA'S PLANNING,

90
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:36,253
OR WHAT THAT SHADOW
THAT CAME OUT OF HIM WAS,

91
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:38,720
OR EVEN IF HE'S MORE
THAN AN ORDINARY HUMAN.

92
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,220
I WONDER IF THERE'S REALLY
ANYTHING WE <i>CAN</i> DO

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,886
TO SAVE ALL THOSE CHILDREN.

94
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:45,886
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'VE JUST
GOT TO BELIEVE IN OURSELVES

95
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:47,853
AND KEEP TRYING.
WE CAN'T GIVE UP.

96
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:51,420
YOU'RE RIGHT. I GUESS
I'M JUST FEELING NERVOUS.

97
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,686
I JUST WISH WE KNEW
WHAT OWIKAWA WAS PLANNING.

98
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,653
THE TIME FOR HARVESTING
HAS COME.

99
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:59,420
Mummymon: OH, NO,
LOOK AT THAT!

100
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,793
IT'S THOSE PESKY KIDS!
THEY'RE GUARDING THEM!

101
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,826
HUH? WHAT IS THAT?

102
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,126
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
KEN?

103
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:10,293
NOTHING. I THOUGHT
I FELT SOMETHING.

104
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:11,460
WAS IT OWIKAWA?

105
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,993
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

106
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:14,960
MAYBE MY MIND
WAS PLAYING TRICKS ON ME.

107
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,160
I SURE HOPE SO.

108
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,293
Davis: YEAH,
I HOPE SO, TOO.

109
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,160
DO YOU THINK
THEY NOTICED US?

110
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,960
WELL, IF THEY DID NOTICE US,
THEN IT'S ALL OVER.

111
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,026
WHAT? IT'S OVER?

112
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,026
OVER FOR THEM,
NOT OVER FOR US!

113
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,626
OH, RIGHT, OVER FOR THEM!
SURE, I GET IT NOW.

114
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,526
YEAH, YOU'LL GET IT,
ALL RIGHT.

115
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,793
TERRIFIC! WAIT, ARE WE STILL
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING?

116
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:44,062
WELL, HELLO THERE,
EVERYBODY.
I BROUGHT YOU ALL SOME PB&J
WITH THE CRUST CUT OFF.

117
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:46,196
AW, YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

118
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:47,596
All: THANKS, MRS. IZUMI!

119
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,929
THANKS, BUT YOU BETTER
GO HOME NOW.

120
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,629
CAN'T I STAY
FOR A WHILE?

121
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,610
BUT, MOM, THINGS MIGHT GET
REALLY UGLY.

122
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,796
OKAY, THEN,
I BETTER GO.
SO GO THEN!

123
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:58,462
OH!

124
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,796
PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND
IZZY'S FEELINGS, MRS. IZUMI.

125
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:02,796
YOU'RE REALLY VERY IMPORTANT
TO HIM,

126
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,836
AND HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

127
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:08,702
I KNOW, IT'S JUST THAT...
THOSE CHILDREN --

128
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:11,702
I'M SURE THAT THEIR PARENTS
WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THEM

129
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:14,469
IF THEY KNEW
WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE DOING.

130
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,069
WAIT, THAT'S IT!

131
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,536
IF YOU DON'T NEED ME HERE,

132
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,402
I CAN GO TALK
TO THEIR PARENTS.

133
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,669
MAYBE I CAN GET THEIR FOLKS
TO COME DOWN HERE

134
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,569
AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES JUST
WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE DOING.

135
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,536
HEY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
THERE, MOM!

136
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,202
REALLY?
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

137
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:29,702
OH, I'LL GO DO THAT
THEN.

138
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,302
GOODBYE, EVERYBODY.
BE CAREFUL!

139
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:33,802
All: BYE, MRS. IZUMI!

140
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,836
I DON'T KNOW IF BRINGING
THEIR PARENTS HERE

141
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,236
IS GOING TO HELP, THOUGH.

142
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,336
AND I DOUBT THAT EVEN
THEIR PARENTS WILL BE ABLE

143
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:41,202
TO REMOVE THE DARK SPORES
FROM INSIDE THEM.

144
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,636
T.K.: DON'T GIVE UP HOPE,
GUYS.

145
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:45,169
MAYBE THE PARENTS CAN REACH
THEIR KIDS IN A WAY

146
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,536
THAT WE CAN'T.

147
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,702
JUST THE WAY KARI WAS ABLE
TO REACH ME

148
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,836
WHEN I WAS WORKING
FOR MYOTISMON.

149
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,069
YEAH...
BUT...

150
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,802
THEY'RE RIGHT. I MEAN,
LOOK AT HOW YOU GUYS

151
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:57,236
WERE ABLE TO HELP
TURN ME AWAY FROM EVIL.

152
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,202
IF I CAN BE SAVED,

FROM ENTERING.
