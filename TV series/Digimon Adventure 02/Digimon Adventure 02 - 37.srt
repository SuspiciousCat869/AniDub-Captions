1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,036
TK: We had to find
the last destiny stone

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,805
before Black Lord Greymon,
but troops travel better

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,040
on a full stomach,
so we went for Chinese food.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,643
Would you believe the restaurant
belonged to Digitamamon?

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,312
And having the house special
were Arukenimon and Mummymon.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,314
For some reason,
we couldn't digivolve,

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,983
but neither could they,
and they split.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,851
Those two noodlebrains
were still hungry,

9
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,320
so they drank from
Digitamamon's secret soup pool.

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,155
And inside wasn't a wanton.

11
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,857
The last destiny stone.

12
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,360
Cody and I were finally
able to DNA digivolve

13
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,896
just in time too, cause
Shikuamon is our last chance

14
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,398
against Black War Greymon.

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,262
‐ Give it all you got.
‐ Yeah!

39
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,201

42
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,642
BOTH: Here they
digivolve to:

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,577
VOICE: <i>DNA digivolve!</i>

44
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,250
Shakkuomon!

45
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,354
CODY: Shakkuomon
is the coolest thing out

46
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,788
since clumping glitter!

47
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,423
His enemies better
make travel plans,

48
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,692
because his kachina bombs
will send them flying.

49
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,160
We did it!

50
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,129
Finally!

51
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,531
Now we don't have to make
Paildramon and Silphymon

52
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,866
do all the hard work.

53
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,501
You said it.

54
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,803
Let him have it, Shakkuoman.

55
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,306
I'll prove my mettle.

56
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,308
GREYMON: You're
standing between me

57
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,076
and the last destiny stone.

58
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,745
Now get out of my way.

59
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,680
BOTH: Who's gonna make us?

60
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,148
Move or else.

61
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,784
We choose else.

62
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,119
Very well.

63
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,620
Terra Destroyer!

64
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,197
He's still too strong for us!

65
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,599
Ohh!

66
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,346
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Shakkuomon!

67
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,315
He swallowed up
Black War Greymon's terraforce!

68
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,517
Yeah!

69
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,385
Harmonious spirit.

70
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,555
Now, guys.

71
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,590
BOTH: Right.

72
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,225
You know the plan, Paildramon.

73
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,529
Right, no matter what,
protect the destiny stone.

74
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,398
Me first, static force!

75
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,169
You asked for it.

76
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,775
Hey, that's not fair!

77
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,146
‐ ( gasps )
‐ Now I'm angry.

78
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,148
Why do you persist this way?

79
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,383
You can't win.

80
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,854
Kachina Bomb.

81
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,360
Why do you keep trying to
protect the destiny stones?

82
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,864
BOTH: It's a little something
we call saving the world.

83
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,366
Desperado Blaster!

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,169
How can you be so certain

85
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,872
that what you
fight for is right?

86
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,308
Static Force!

87
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,845
I think we did it.

88
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,046
You're right.

89
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,681
I grow tired of this fight

90
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,184
I'm going to find my answer,
right here, right now.

91
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,387
It's over, we win!

92
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,391
I keep asking
questions of my enemies,

93
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,293
and yet I still
get no answers.

94
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,661
Why am I so different
from them?

95
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,096
Why was I created like this?

96
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,765
Well, if they won't answer me,

97
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,833
then why should I be
concerned about them anymore?

98
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,035
I've given every
opponent the chance

99
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,738
to convince me otherwise,
but now I am through talking.

100
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,207
Why should I care
if they are destroyed?

101
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,144
Or for that matter, their
whole precious digital world?

102
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,945
He seems so sad.

103
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,148
What he needs is a friend.

104
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,583
Destroying the destiny
stone means my own destruction

105
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,452
as well, but if
that's what it takes

106
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,589
to finally find my answer,
then so be it.

107
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,758
Don't take another
step or else.

108
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,794
I choose or else.

109
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,766
It's no use,
we can't stop him.

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,501
But if the destiny stone
is destroyed,

111
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,570
the whole digital
world will be lost.

112
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,605
I'm afraid it won't
only be the digiworld,

113
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,074
but our world
will be destroyed too.

114
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,010
Time for plan B.

115
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,913
By the way, does anybody know
what plan B is?

116
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,781
We could try moving the stone.

117
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,184
Good idea, let's do it while
the DNA digivolved digimon

118
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,953
are still able to hold
off Black War Greymon.

119
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,555
How can we lift that stone?

120
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,057
We'll never know
unless we try.

121
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,959
It's better
than doing nothing.

122
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,360
KARI: Davis is right.

123
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,396
Besides, no one has
any better ideas.

124
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,164
ARUKENIMON:
I have a better idea.

125
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,999
Say goodbye.

126
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,969
That's your cue to cry
and beg for mercy.

127
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,809
Ready to give up?

128
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,511
If you're ready to shut up.

129
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,947
Forget her, Davis,
she's not worth it.

130
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,682
( laughing )

131
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,218
You're trying to get me upset,
but it won't work.

132
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,986
Mummymon.

133
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,856
( cackling )

134
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,558
I'm going to put these kids
under wraps for the last time.

135
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,728
( evil laughter )

136
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,798
DIGITAMAMON:
Nightmare Syndrome!

137
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,669
I warned you not to drink out
of the Chinese soup spring.

138
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,404
You'll pay for that.

139
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,672
( grunts of pain )

140
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,008
Take care of
the destiny stone, kids!

141
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,376
Don't worry.

142
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,378
Thanks, Digitamamon,
thanks Tapermon.

143
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,713
Now's our chance, let's go.

144
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,718
How do we move that thing?

145
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,287
I got it.

146
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,257
Let's try using the old D3s.

147
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,960
( grunts of approval )

148
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,229
( beeping )

149
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,073
KARI: What are all those
lights doing?

150
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,843
CODY:
They're combining into one.

151
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,846
Just what I need,
another flashlight.

152
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,514
What are those kids
doing back there

153
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,782
with the destiny stone?

154
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,419
I just hope they
don't eat all the soup.

155
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,925
Mummymon, attack.

156
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,527
I'd rather not, thanks.

157
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,529
He came to life.

158
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,597
That's the same digimon
we saw when Black War Greymon

159
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,199
destroyed
the other destiny stone.

160
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,867
He's huge.

161
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:52,772
That guy's almost
as big as my appetite.

162
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,407
He better know how to fight,

163
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,244
cause Black War Greymon's
been looking for him.

164
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:02,082
Finally, my ultimate
opponent has appeared.

165
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,685
You.

166
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,190
You are the one with
the accursed soul of darkness.

167
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,558
Soul of darkness?

168
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,127
You can't mean me.

169
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,631
Tell me, why do you destroy
the destiny stones?

170
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,601
I did it to make you appear
so we can fight.

171
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:26,539
You are stronger than any
digimon I've ever seen before.

172
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,010
Do you have any idea who I am?

173
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,979
Only that you are
my ultimate opponent.

174
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,482
I am Azulonmon.

175
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,484
Azulonmon?

176
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,487
I am the guardian of the eastern
hemisphere of the digital world

177
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,689
and the keeper of the spheres
of light and hope.

178
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,724
Because you have destroyed
the destiny stones,

179
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,726
this world has
become unbalanced.

180
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,728
Do you understand
the consequences of

181
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,430
what you have done?

182
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,699
I don't care about
any of that nonsense.

183
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,368
Fight me, Azulonmon!

184
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,503
It is my destiny!

185
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,905
You fool.

186
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,375
You mean that's the reason
you caused all this suffering,

187
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,079
when it is your existence itself
that seals my power

188
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,482
and causes the unbalance
in this world?

189
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,284
My existence?
What do you mean?

190
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,385
I want the truth!

191
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,054
You can't handle the truth.

192
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,723
The control spires
here in the eastern region

193
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,592
were built to seal my power,
and you are made

194
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,528
from a hundred
of those spires.

195
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,630
You do the math.

196
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,898
What?

197
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,700
The control spires
seal his power?

198
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,670
And I was
the one that built them.

199
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,072
What does this mean?

200
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,673
All right,
so now you know, big deal.

201
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,375
It's Arukenimon.

202
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,511
Our plan was a simple one,
build as many control spires

203
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,247
as possible and destroy
the balance of the digital world

204
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,715
once and for all.

205
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,150
You got a problem,
so sue me.

206
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,919
And that's
the reason you chose me

207
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,954
to be the digimon emperor,
isn't it?

208
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,290
Because you knew I would build
those control spires for you.

209
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,724
You win the booby prize.

210
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,493
Unfortunately,
just as construction

211
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,128
was going along swimmingly,

212
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,764
you decided to join forces
with the other digidodos

213
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,467
and start destroying
all my precious control spires.

214
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,602
That's why I created you
to stop them,

215
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,604
but instead you wander
around the digital world

216
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,606
like a baby
looking for its bottle.

217
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,476
Didn't it ever occur to you
that digimon like yourself

218
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,945
have no souls of their own?

219
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,148
Put me down,
this is a brand‐new outfit.

220
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,784
Do you know how hard it is to
get wrinkles out of polyester?

221
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,620
Don't get mad at me because
fate has dealt you a bad hand.

222
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,522
Fate? Then why
am I standing here

223
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,524
within an inch
of destroying you?

224
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,960
Is that fate too?

225
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,595
AZULONMON:
Black War Greymon.

226
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,364
You ask more questions
than Cody does.

227
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,000
No one can answer them
but you.

228
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,237
You see, every life
has a purpose, a reason.

229
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,974
The circumstances surrounding
its birth don't matter.

230
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,944
You're saying that my life
has a meaning too?

231
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,347
Precisely. But it is up to you

232
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,783
to find out
what that meaning is.

233
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,825
Black War Greymon, I have
nothing more to tell you

234
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,561
unless you want to hear
a good joke Jenai told me

235
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,196
when I was in limbo.

236
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,533
Arukenimon!

237
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,469
I am grateful to have met you.

238
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,072
I now know that my existence
has meaning.

239
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,313
Even if that meaning is only
to be hated and loathed.

240
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,754
Where are you going?

241
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,724
Someplace where things
go to disappear.

242
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,227
He should try
my sock drawer.

243
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,662
Disappear?

244
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,064
‐ Mummymon, let's go.
‐ Where?

245
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,166
‐ To stop him, you fool.
‐ Oh, right.

246
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,534
Oh, don't go anywhere,

247
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,835
I'll be back to destroy
you in a minute.

248
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,137
Ditto that.

249
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,405
Destiny stones
can break my bones,

250
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,639
but you guys are real losers.

251
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,174
Oh, that's clever.

252
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,310
Did you write it yourself?

253
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,619
( laughing )

254
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,555
AZULONMON: And now for you,
digidestined.

255
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,525
I am one of the four megadigimon

256
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,695
who preserve the balance
of the digital world.

257
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,397
I protect the eastern region.

258
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,199
YOLEI: Hey,
that sounds like Kyoto.

259
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,534
Kyoto? How?

260
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,069
Remember
I told you about it?

261
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,704
I learned it
from Sora's dad.

262
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,540
The city is protected by
spirits in the east, west,

263
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,909
south, and north.

264
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,744
That's correct.

265
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,914
There are many similarities
between your world and ours.

266
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,216
After a long battle, we
guardians were sealed away

267
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,385
by each of the dark masters.

268
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,887
They didn't even
leave us something to read.

269
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,424
It was then that seven
of the eight digidestined

270
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,629
came to the digital world,
and once the seven had returned

271
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:46,065
to their own world,
the dark master dismantled it

272
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,768
and reshaped it
to fit their own needs.

273
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,971
KARI: Spiral mountain.

274
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,207
AZULONMON: The eight children
and their digimon

275
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,542
were able to defeat
the dark masters,

276
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,312
but we were still
trapped beneath the seal.

277
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,282
In order to break the seal,
we needed to take away

278
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,084
the power from
the digidestined crests.

279
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,153
Of course,
Joe complained about it,

280
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,022
but he complained
about everything.

281
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,491
Unfortunately, it meant that
digimon could no longer

282
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,926
digivolve to
their ultimate levels.

283
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,929
That is why our help
is needed now.

284
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,198
So that's the reason our
digimon could only digivolve

285
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,967
during certain times.

286
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,671
Hey, TK, this must be what
Izzy was talking about earlier.

287
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,840
Somehow he must have known
about Azulonmon.

288
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,976
Yes, Izzy is
quite intelligent.

289
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,811
In fact, without
that intelligence, he'd be,

290
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,613
well, he'd be Todd.

291
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,149
The dark power's control
spires kept the digimon

292
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,850
from being able to digivolve.

293
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,320
Those who wished for harmony
in the digital world

294
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,323
decided to use
an ancient form of digivolving.

295
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,792
You must mean
armor digivolving.

296
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,493
AZULONMON: Correct.
They chose several digimon

297
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,495
who still had
the ancient powers

298
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,231
and prepared them for
the arrival of the digidestined.

299
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,033
In other words,
they were drafted.

300
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,935
In order to combat
the powers of darkness,

301
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,337
they made three new digivices
and sent them

302
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,705
to the new digidestined.

303
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,040
Okay, now you're
talking about me, right?

304
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,209
Hello, the world doesn't
revolve around you.

305
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,178
He's talking
about all of us.

306
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,548
But something happened
that was not anticipated.

307
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,217
It seems you had
a device that was capable

308
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,853
of storing
several digieggs at once.

309
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,389
Sort of like
a digital egg carton.

310
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,858
I believe you called
it a D‐terminal.

311
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,861
So when the digieggs
of sincerity, friendship,

312
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,031
and reliability were needed,
they were given to you.

313
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,500
Also the crest
of kindness was hidden

314
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,136
by the powers of darkness,
so it was necessary

315
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,340
to rebuild it
into the digiegg of miracles.

316
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:39,145
It wasn't easy, so we hired
a general contractor.

317
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,347
( growling )

318
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,389
KARI: He sounds so sad.

319
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,759
My friend,
I feel your agony.

320
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:57,063
I hope that one day
you will find the answer

321
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,566
to your question.

322
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,069
Well, at least now
you can regain your power,

323
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,504
right, Azulonmon?

324
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,172
Uh, not right away.

325
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,074
The digital world
is too unbalanced.

326
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,009
First, I must plant
my seeds of light

327
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,044
where the destiny stones
once stood

328
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,713
and hope for the best.

329
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,948
I've never had much
of a green thumb.

330
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,950
What kind of seeds of light?

331
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:22,388
The seeds that will sprout
and take on the same purpose

332
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,793
as the destiny stones.

333
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,494
That's a relief.

334
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,263
And then the balance
of the digital world

335
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,831
will be restored
little by little.

336
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,633
How about that, guys,
we really did it.

337
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,401
Looks that way.

338
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,271
Now that's what I call‐‐ huh?
What's wrong with you, Ken?

339
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,273
‐ Why so quiet?
‐ Nothing.

340
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,707
Come on, if you've
got something to say,

341
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,309
then just say it already.

342
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,745
I was just thinking that
we might just have to find

343
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,980
and destroy every single
thing that has to do

344
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,816
with the powers of darkness.

345
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,185
Otherwise they will continue
to grow bigger and bigger

346
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,420
and before you know it, we'll
have a bunch more creatures

347
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,256
like Black War Greymon
roaming around.

348
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,524
Oh, no, Ken.

349
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,526
You can't be serious, Ken.

350
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,161
KARI: ( thinking )
<i>Ken understands</i>

351
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,996
<i>the powers of darkness</i>
<i>more than any of us.</i>

352
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,468
<i>After all, he's the one</i>
<i>that first created Chimeramon.</i>

353
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,104
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

354
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,940
What?

355
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,343
I agree that the powers of
darkness are a terrible thing.

356
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,745
And I think I speak
for all of us by saying

357
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,848
it would be easier
if they were destroyed.

358
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,950
But I just don't think
that it's possible.

359
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,451
But why not?

360
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,986
Because where there's light,

361
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,288
you'll always find
darkness as well.

362
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,657
TK's right, and the stronger
the light is,

363
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,359
then the deeper the darkness.

364
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,361
Exactly. So we have to
remember that no matter how

365
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,330
the powers of
darkness surround you,

366
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,966
the most important thing is
not to lose the light inside.

367
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,868
But I don't understand.

368
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,369
What is the light inside?

369
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,339
The light inside is hope.

370
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,640
What?

371
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,375
When all around you
is darkness,

372
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,477
you must keep the light on
inside your heart,

373
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,946
no matter how high
your electric bill gets.

374
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,815
It's the same
as the crest of hope.

375
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,316
KARI:
The light in your heart?

376
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,318
After the dark
masters were defeated,

377
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,921
those bearing the crests
of light and hope

378
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,357
were the ones
that broke my seal.

379
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,760
Hey, TK,
those were our crests.

380
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,663
When the dark digivice was
brought into the digital world,

381
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,734
the harmonious ones were only
able to find three digimon

382
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,570
who had the ancient power
of armor digivolving.

383
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,506
However, the digimon
belonging to the digidestined

384
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,709
with the crest of light
and hope also were capable

385
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,478
of the same power.

386
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,314
So their digivices
took on new form,

387
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,617
allowing them
to armor digivolve as well.

388
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,720
TK: Pegasusmon
and Nepherdimon!

389
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,690
These two crests,
light and hope,

390
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,959
are different
from the others.

391
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,629
The crest of courage,
the crest of love,

392
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,532
and the crest of knowledge
come from the power

393
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,535
inside the digidestined's
hearts.

394
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,939
But the crest of light
gives life to this world.

395
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,008
And the crest of hope
continues to shine

396
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,445
no matter how darkness
tries to hide it.

397
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,848
Once all the digidestined
joined their hearts together,

398
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:07,486
the power was born, and
the light shone even brighter.

399
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,490
Giving the digimon
the ability to digivolve.

400
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,594
It is because of you,
digidestined,

401
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,430
that the digital world
still exists.

402
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,734
But even though
Black War Greymon is gone

403
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:26,205
and my power will
soon be restored, beware,

404
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,375
for the threat is not over.

405
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,410
‐ ( gasps )
‐ What are you saying?

406
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:36,816
The evil that tried to seal
me away has not disappeared.

407
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,652
Are you talking about
Arukenimon and Mummymon?

408
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,922
No. They are merely pawns.

409
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,159
There is an even
greater hatred in existence.

410
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,129
You mean someone else
is controlling Arukenimon?

411
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,131
Then that's who was
controlling me too.

412
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,266
Your job is not finished.

413
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,769
You must not stop
until the digital world

414
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,505
is safe once and for all.

415
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,307
We'll keep one eye
on the digiworld

416
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,808
and one eye on our world.

417
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,810
And we'll keep the other eye
on each other.

418
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,746
AZULONMON:
Hm. You must be Davis.

419
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,782
Well, despite him, I wish you
all good luck in your quest.

420
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,752
ALL: Goodbye! Goodbye!

421
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,793
Thanks to you, I am able
to return to my restaurant.

422
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,728
How about some treats?

423
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,996
DIGITAMAMON:
I know they're not much,

424
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,666
but take them, please.

425
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,834
ALL: All right, free food!

426
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,469
What's the matter
with you, Davis?

427
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,705
Didn't you see me,
I was reaching for that one!

428
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,674
They're all the same,
aren't they?!

429
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,108
TK: Here, Ken.

430
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,777
They're really good.

431
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,079
Aren't you going to try one?

432
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,849
Okay, I'll try one.

433
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,054
( voracious devouring )

434
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,823
Is it good?

435
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,993
( approving grunts )

436
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,995
I agree.

437
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,364
I said that one's mine!

438
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,170
DAVIS:
Those Chinese buns were great.

439
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,571
YOLEI:
You had one more than me.

440
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,206
Well, I didn't know
you were counting.

441
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,041
Let me tell you something,
when it comes to food,

442
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,377
I always count.

443
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,748
What are you looking at?

444
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,383
Well, I'm not exactly sure,

445
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,418
but I think I just saw
a control spire.

446
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,921
You should try wearing
those goggles once in a while.

447
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,389
Control spire? Yeah, right.

448
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,560
DAVIS: ( thinking )
I don't care what Yolei says.

449
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,961
I know what I saw.

450
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,596
NARRATOR:
