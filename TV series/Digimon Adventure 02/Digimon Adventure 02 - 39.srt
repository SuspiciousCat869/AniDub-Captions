ALL THIS TIME?

YOU WERE VERY YOUNG
AT THE TIME, CODY,

341
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,475
BUT DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN
THE DIGITAL WORLD APPEARED

342
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,209
IN THE SKY
ABOVE THE EARTH?

343

YES,
I REMEMBER THAT.

344
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:26,375
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

345
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,509
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD
SAW IT, TOO,

346
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:31,875
AND THEY ALSO SAW THE FINAL
BATTLE WITH APOCYLAMON.

347
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,775
SINCE THEN, SCIENTISTS
AND MILITARY AROUND THE WORLD

348
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,075
HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

WHY, PEOPLE WOULD WANT
TO TRAVEL THERE

352
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,075
FOR A VACATION LIKE IT WAS
THE BAHAMAS OR SOMETHING.

353
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,475
SOON, THERE WOULD BE DIGIMON

BEGUN CHANGING
