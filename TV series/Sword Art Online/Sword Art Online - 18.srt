1
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:09,698
I want to see what virtual reality's like.

2
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,945
I wonder when I first thought that.

3
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,788
I used to hate virtual-reality games with a vengeance,

4
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:24,196
and I blamed them for stealing my brother away from me.

5
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:27,954
But later on, I got curious.

6
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:34,325
I didn't know why my brother loved them so much,
so I figured, maybe I should see why for myself.

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:46,856
I didn't know what to expect at first, but after a
while, I was surprised by how much I loved Alfheim Online.

8
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:50,059
It was amazing...

9
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,524
flying through the sky on my very
own wings, to fly as far as I wanted,

10
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:58,637
as high as I wanted, as fast as I wanted.

11
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,337
I'd give anything and everything for that.

12
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:04,896
I think I get it now.

13
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,607
I can see why my brother loves the virtual world.

14
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,854
Hold it, Leafa!

15
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:59,114
I thought I told you not to
call me that at school, Nagata.

16
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:00,258
Didn't I?

17
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:01,417
Yeah, you did.

18
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,031
Sorry, Suguha.

19
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:03,649
Idiot!

20
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:05,976
I'm sorry! I meant "Kirigaya"!

21
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,321
What do you want?

22
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:08,679
Uh...

23
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,395
Wait... why are you even here?

24
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,174
You got a release from taking
the high-school entrance exams.

25
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,447
They're not making you come anyway, are they?

26
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:16,439
Sugu...

27
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,629
Kirigaya!

28
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,014
I need to talk to you, so I've been waiting all morning.

29
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,758
Wait... you're not here for the exams, are you?

30
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:24,349
No.

31
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:27,308
The advisor for the kendo club
asked me to come in, that's all.

32
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,381
Well, what's up?

33
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:31,417
It's Sigurd and the others.

34
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:34,029
They all wanted to go hunting again this afternoon.

35
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:35,054
Sorry.

36
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,317
I won't be going out with those guys for a while.

37
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,606
Wait! What?!

38
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,630
Why not?!

39
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,457
I've got plans to head over to arun.

40
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,137
That's why.

41
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:45,304
But isn't arun at the base of the world tree?

42
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:46,314
Wait a second!

43
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,388
You... are you... you're not going with that Spriggan?!

44
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,523
Yeah...

45
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:52,447
Well... sort of.

46
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:54,624
I promised I'd show him how to get there.

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,062
But... have you thought about what you're doing, Lea...

48
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:01,393
...K-Kirigaya?

49
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:05,609
It's just so far away, and you guys
will be... Sleeping together, and...

50
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,112
don't get any weird ideas about it, you jerk!

51
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,604
Look, I've made up my mind, and that's that.

52
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,558
Say "hey" to Sigurd and the others for me.

53
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:17,830
See ya later!

54
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,947
All I'm doing is showing him the way.

55
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,836
That's all I'm doing.

56
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:54,962
Link, start!

57
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:13,860
Hey, there.

58
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,106
Been waiting long?

59
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,068
Not at all. I just walked in.

60
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,053
Actually, I was out shopping for gear.

61
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:20,270
Oh. That's right.

62
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:22,765
I should update my equipment, too.

63
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,433
I don't think thisis gonna be enough.

64
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:26,830
Okay.

65
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,095
I know a good weapon shop in town.

66
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:31,384
But do you have enough money? 'Cause they're not cheap.

67
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:34,188
Okay, money.

68
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:35,060
Wait.

69
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,946
This thing called "yuld"... is that money?

70
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:37,653
Uh-huh.

71
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:41,680
Hey, Yui?

72
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,395
Wake up. We're heading out now.

73
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:45,736
Okay.

74
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:55,155
Hm?

75
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:10,901
Why'd we come here?

76
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:15,883
Well, when flying long distances, it's
better if you start from a higher altitude.

77
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:17,559
That's what the tower's here for.

78
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,815
Oh. That makes sense.

79
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,342
You're kidding me!!

80
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,011
U-Uh... wait!

81
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,339
Come on! Let's go!

82
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,715
I want to get past the forest before dark.

83
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:34,913
Uh...

84
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:37,453
This way, slowpoke!

85
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:42,703
Leafa!

86
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:47,268
Oh. Uh, hello, Sigurd.

87
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:49,596
What's this I hear about you leaving the party?

88
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:50,677
Is that true?

89
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,782
Well... yeah, it is.

90
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,349
Do you have any idea how much that's
going to upset the other members?

91
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:00,472
You said it wouldn't be a problem
if I joined only when I had the time.

92
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:03,196
You also said I could quit whenever I wanted to.

93
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,319
Yes, I know what I said, but
you've been with us for a while now.

94
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,494
Everyone knows you.

95
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:10,958
If you leave us, it's going to
damage the reputation of the party!

96
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,594
Party members are not items.

97
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,036
What did you say?

98
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:30,306
Party members aren't items, so don't
expect them to be on call for you.

99
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:31,676
They're not your armor.

100
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,745
They're not your sword.

101
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:34,110
They're not your equipment.

102
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,333
You son of a...

103
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,758
I bet that big mouth of yours got
you thrown out of your own territory.

104
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:42,906
Let's see what you got, you piece of Spriggan trash.

105
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,679
Okay, that's it! Enough!

106
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,678
Kirito's my new partner, so leave him alone!

107
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,394
What?!

108
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:49,791
Leafa!

109
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,128
You're abandoning us to be a renegade, like him?

110
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:55,011
Yes.

111
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,520
I am.

112
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,570
And I'm not coming back... ever!

113
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,108
I don't give a damn about you
buzzing around my party members,

114
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:06,160
but if you think you can steal
them, then that's another story.

115
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:09,528
If you're stupid enough to waltz
into another race's territory,

116
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:12,370
then it's your own damn fault if you get killed, Spriggan!

117
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:21,992
This isn't the time or place, Sigurd.

118
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:25,805
If we gank this guy in front of all
these people, we're gonna look bad.

119
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,901
Once you cross our border, you better run and hide, Leafa.

120
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,850
I never expected you to betray me like this.

121
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:42,610
Never.

122
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,961
But you'll regret it soon enough.

123
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:55,465
I'm really sorry you got dragged into all that drama.

124
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,465
It's cool.

125
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,818
I'm worried about you, though.

126
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,543
Are you sure about this?

127
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:01,178
Uh...

128
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:05,697
Hey! Don't!

129
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:11,737
Wow.

130
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:14,402
This is an amazing view.

131
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,902
The sky's so close, it's like
I can reach out and touch it.

132
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:19,251
I know, right?

133
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,797
Whenever I look up at that sky,
everything else feels so small.

134
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:30,383
The timing couldn't have been any better.

135
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,449
I've been thinking about leaving here for a while now.

136
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:34,394
Okay, but... I feel

137
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,288
like it's sort of my fault you
left on bad terms with those guys.

138
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,688
Yeah, well, I don't think it
could have happened any other way.

139
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,637
What do you mean by "renegade"?

140
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:49,074
A renegade's a player who abandons their territory.

141
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,121
If you get branded as one,
everyone's gonna look down on you.

142
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,694
And you're cool with that?

143
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:55,766
Yeah.

144
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,158
I don't really care.

145
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:01,765
But I don't understand why everyone's
so quick to tie each other down like that.

146
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,830
I mean, what's the point in having wings, you know?

147
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,937
You humans are so complicated.

148
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,680
Honestly, your psychology is confusing.

149
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,280
Why do you act so horribly to each
other, when all you want is companionship?

150
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,210
What do you mean?

151
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,535
If it were me...

152
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,070
...I'd do that.

153
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:24,563
It's simple, straightforward, and efficient.

154
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,288
That's an amazing A.I.

155
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,568
Do allprivate pixies act like that, or just yours?

156
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,061
No, just mine, but she's a weirdo.

157
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,478
I guess you would know, huh?

158
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:39,087
"All we want is companionship."

159
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,008
Huh.

160
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,549
Leafa!

161
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,132
Hey, Recon.

162
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:45,656
How could you do this?!

163
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,764
You could have at least said somethingbefore you left!

164
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,756
Oh, sorry. I guess I forgot.

165
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,626
Why'd you quit the party all of a sudden like that?

166
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:59,432
Well... i didn't really think
too hard about it. I just did it.

167
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,276
What are yougonna do, though?

168
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,801
As if, Leafa!

169
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,390
It doesn't matter where you go.

170
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,472
My sword belongs to you and you alone.

171
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,637
I don't need it, but...

172
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,257
Thanks.

173
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,946
W-W-What I mean by that was,
I'm gonna go with you... wherever.

174
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:18,635
That is, I'd liketo go, but there's
something that's been bugging me.

175
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:19,405
What is it?

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,892
I can't really prove anything yet, but there's a few

177
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:27,087
things I want to look into some more, so I'm
gonna stay in Sigurd's party a little longer.

178
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,827
Hey, Kirito?

179
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,561
She has a habit of getting herself in trouble.

180
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,802
I'd appreciate it if you keep an eye on her.

181
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,073
Yeah. Sure.

182
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,345
Whatever you say.

183
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:40,301
And just to make sure we're
absolutely clear, Leafa is my...

184
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,997
we'll be in the neutral zone for a while.

185
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,467
Message me if you need anything.

186
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,791
Let me get this straight. In real life, he's your friend?

187
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,386
Yeah, something like that.

188
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:03,698
Mm-hmmmm.

189
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:06,132
Okay, what's that weird noise supposed to mean?

190
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:07,021
Nothing.

191
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,984
Just a little jealous, is all.

192
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,981
Now, that person's feelings, I can understand.

193
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,745
He must like you a lot, wouldn't you say, Leafa?

194
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,882
Do you feel the same way about him?

195
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,807
I-I don't know!

196
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,464
Geez!

197
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,282
Hurry up, you guys!

198
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,421
Let's try to make it all the
way to the lake without stopping!

199
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:39,246
Okay!

200
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,789
Unbelievable.

201
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,133
You can be so stubborn... seriously.

202
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:08,516
No matter what I do, I can't hurt you.

203
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,581
It's not like that body's real.

204
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,614
Why can't you just loosen up and enjoy yourself a little?

205
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:19,970
I don't expect you to understand, but to me,
it doesn't matter if my body's real or virtual.

206
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:22,291
You may not think that way, but I do.

207
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:25,364
Are you afraid you're going to be corrupted somehow?

208
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,414
Because if that's the case, you definitely need to
take things a little less seriously while you're here.

209
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:32,937
Well, I'm not planning on staying in this cage forever.

210
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:34,032
You'll see.

211
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:35,909
He'll come and save me.

212
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,600
Really? Who will?

213
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,102
That hero boyfriend of yours?

214
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:42,207
Goes by the name of Kirito?

215
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:45,853
Please.

216
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,531
You think I didn't know?

217
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,451
His real name's Kirigaya.

218
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:52,725
I met him the other day... in the real world.

219
00:13:55,873 --> 00:14:00,520
I couldn't believe that weak little boy
was the same one who beat sword art online.

220
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:02,649
It took me a second to collect myself.

221
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,216
By the way, where do you think I met him?

222
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,647
In your hospital room.

223
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:11,253
As you were lying there, I told
him I'd be marrying you next week.

224
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,828
My god, you should have seen his face.

225
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,053
It was like all the color drained out of it!

226
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,588
I could barely keep myself from laughing!

227
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:21,973
Do you want to know what I think?

228
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:27,032
I'll bet you anything that brat won't have
the guts to put on the nervegear ever again!

229
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:33,301
That reminds me... I promised him I was
going to send along a wedding invitation.

230
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:34,938
I'm pretty sure he'll come.

231
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:37,392
He's going to want to see you in your wedding dress.

232
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:42,969
I know... I'm generous. The least I can
do is leave the little hero a few crumbs!

233
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:51,716
Well, I have to get going now, Titania.

234
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:54,290
I hope you don't miss me too much.

235
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,106
He's alive.

236
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,402
Kirito's alive!

237
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,411
8... 1, 1...

238
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:36,645
3, 2... 3, 2... 9.

239
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:51,367
Say-ah sleeta fim-glown veendo!

240
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:57,966
Hm.

241
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,259
Nice job.

242
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,037
Thanks for the awesome backup.

243
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,568
Our wings aren't gonna last much longer.

244
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,713
I think we should land down there for a bit.

245
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:09,388
Okay.

246
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,853
Hey, you getting tired yet?

247
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:20,463
Nope.

248
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:21,688
I'm good to go.

249
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,403
Okay, Mr. Tough guy.

250
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,366
I hate to break it to you, but flying's
out for both of us for a little while.

251
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,989
Huh? How come?

252
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,109
You see that mountain way over there?

253
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:34,367
It's above the altitude limit, so we can't fly over.

254
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:37,472
The only way anyone can pass
it is to go through the caves.

255
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:42,382
It's the toughest part of the trip between
Sylph territory and arum... or so I've heard.

256
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:44,662
I've never even been this far myself.

257
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:46,083
Guess we walk.

258
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,533
These caves... are they long?

259
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:49,509
Pretty long.

260
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:51,645
There's a mining town about halfway.

261
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,879
It's neutral territory, so we can rest there.

262
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,347
That reminds me... are you good

263
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,374
for time, or do you have to get back?

264
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,441
It's 7:00 at night in the real world.

265
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:01,728
Yeah, I can keep going for a while.

266
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,314
Cool.

267
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:04,247
I can, too, so let's keep going.

268
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,669
But since we're here, we should rotate out.

269
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:07,862
Wait... rotate?

270
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,398
Yeah.

271
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:12,055
We take turns logging out and
resting while the other keeps watch.

272
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,710
You can't log out when you're in the field, remember?

273
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,722
So we have to take turns logging out.

274
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:19,598
The person who stays behind guards the other's avatar.

275
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:20,503
Okay.

276
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:21,673
Sounds like a plan.

277
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:23,128
Ladies first.

278
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,848
Okay. Don't mind if I do.

279
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,843
See you in about 20 minutes.

280
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,186
Waaah!

281
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:53,850
Hey, Kazuto! What do you want to do for dinner?

282
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:58,505
I wonder if he's asleep.

283
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:23,111
I can't wait to get back there.

284
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,106
Kirito.

285
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:43,203
It's not that I'm in love with him or anything,
or that I've got someone to go on adventures with.

286
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:44,433
No.

287
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:48,128
I'm just excited I get to go places in a new world.

288
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,492
Hey, I'm back!

289
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:03,215
Did you see any monsters?

290
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,589
No, I didn't.

291
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,518
It's been pretty quiet this whole time.

292
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:07,965
What are you eating?

293
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:10,910
I bought a bunch at a shop before we left Sylvain.

294
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:15,323
I don't know what they're called, but
an NPC said you can only get them there.

295
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,204
I've never seen them before.

296
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:31,108
Sorry to leave you like this, but it is my turn.

297
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:32,818
Keep me safe, okay?

298
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,812
Get out of here before I hurt you!

299
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:54,231
No way! You can move when your master's logged out?!

300
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,994
Well, of course I can move.

301
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,987
You know, I'm my own person.

302
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,601
And for your information, he's
not my master. He's my daddy!

303
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,605
Yeah, about that...

304
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:06,497
I was gonna ask you before.
Why do you call him your daddy?

305
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:10,175
Did he, you know, um, set you that way or something?

306
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,670
He didn't do anything to my settings. He saved me.

307
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,681
He told me I was his daughter.

308
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,396
That makes him my daddy.

309
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,137
You see how that works?

310
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,059
Yeah, I... Guess.

311
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:24,714
Do you, you know... like him?

312
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,407
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,680
I don't understand what you mean by "like."

314
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:31,920
Are you serious?

315
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:37,555
It means you want to be with him all the time, and when
you're together, you get excited about being near him...

316
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:39,977
Or... something like that.

317
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:44,053
What's wrong, Leafa?

318
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,736
Nothing! It's nothing!

319
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:46,674
What's nothing?

320
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:47,785
What's going on?

321
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:49,660
What is it?

322
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:51,521
Did something happen?

323
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:53,127
Welcome back, daddy.

324
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:56,487
Leafa was just explaining to me what
it means when someone says they like s...

325
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:57,281
N-o-o-o!

326
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,355
I said it's nothing!

327
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,205
It's nothing!

328
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:01,524
You weren't there for very long.

329
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,484
I hope you got something to eat.

330
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:03,923
Yeah.

331
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,458
My family left something for me, so I'm good.

332
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,356
Sweet!

333
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,213
Well, come on, then. Let's get going.

334
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,146
Oh. Okay.

335
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,140
All right. Lead the way.

336
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,780
Is something wrong?

337
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:19,652
I don't know.

338
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:22,403
It sort of felt like someone was watching us.

339
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:25,595
Hey, Yui, there any players nearby?

340
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,947
No, I'm not sensing any other players.

341
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:28,964
Hmm.

342
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,285
It's possible someone put a tracer on us.

343
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,682
What the heck's a tracer?

344
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:34,319
A kind of tracking magic.

345
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,933
It looks like a small animal or an insect.

346
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:39,118
It tells the caster a target's position.

347
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,278
Can you dispel it?

348
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,081
Sure... if you can find it.

349
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,959
The thing is, if the caster's magic skill is
high, the tracer can track you from far away.

350
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:50,002
In a field this size, it'd take forever to find it.

351
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:51,113
Great.

352
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:53,681
Eh, maybe it's just my imagination.

353
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,603
Come on. Let's go.

354
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,365
Okay.

355
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:38,940
Next time: "The Legrue Corridor".
