1
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,407
How about you?

2
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:27,669
Feel like fighting?

3
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:29,734
No, thanks, pal.

4
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,935
My magic skill's gonna reach 900
soon, so I'd rather not die just yet.

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,651
At least you're honest about it.

6
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:37,455
How about you, miss?

7
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:40,322
Guess I'll pass, too.

8
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:42,746
But next time, you're going down!

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,571
Oh.

10
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:46,718
Then, next time, I'll make
sure to bring more friends along.

11
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,390
Hey, what's up with those flames?

12
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:28,392
Shh! They're remain lights.

13
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,561
The players you killed can still hear you.

14
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,407
Okay, nowwe can talk.

15
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:39,259
So, what do you want? You want
me to thank you, run away...

16
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,128
Or do you want to fight?

17
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:42,819
Hmm.

18
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:47,776
If we break down what just happened, it's one of those
"knight in shining armor saves the Princess" moments.

19
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:48,235
Huh?

20
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:51,227
You couldburst into tears and throw your arms around me?

21
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:52,852
Oh, piss off, loser!

22
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,214
Nah, I was just kidding.

23
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:57,775
No way!

24
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,845
I won't let her do that!

25
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,752
Oh! Watch it!

26
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,793
Stay out of sight!

27
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,557
Mommy and me are the only ones allowed to hug daddy!

28
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,057
Wait... "daddy"?!

29
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,162
Who? What?

30
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,434
N-Nothing. No.

31
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:09,918
No way.

32
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,246
Is that one of those private pixies?

33
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:12,587
Uh...

34
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,303
Sort of, I guess.

35
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,187
Mm-hmm.

36
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,629
Then, how about you tell me what a Spriggan
like you is doing wandering around here?

37
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,981
I... guess I got lost.

38
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,996
Oh, how could you get that lost?

39
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,554
Spriggan territory's way to the east.

40
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,810
God, you're weird!

41
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,992
Anyway, thank you for saving me.

42
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,002
I guess I should introduce myself.

43
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,655
I'm Leafa. Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,051
I'm Kirito.

45
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,576
And this is Yui.

46
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,943
Okay, then... Kirito.

47
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:57,881
Do you have any plans today?

48
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:02,315
I mean, 'cause if you don't, I
can buy you a drink as... Thanks.

49
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:03,705
A drink sounds awesome!

50
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,954
And if you don't mind, I'd like
to pick your brain about some stuff.

51
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,710
Like, what kind of stuff?

52
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,976
Just more about this world, and especially...

53
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,395
About the tree.

54
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,027
Oh. You mean the world tree?

55
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,287
Yeah, sure.

56
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,898
I might not look like it, but
I know a lot about this game.

57
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:24,737
There's this neutral village to the north of us.

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,024
It's a little out of the way, but we can fly there.

59
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:31,178
Okay, but what about Sylvain? Isn't thattown closer to us?

60
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,300
You really don't know anythingabout this game.

61
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:36,198
Sylvain is Sylph territory.

62
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:36,952
So?

63
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,439
You're not a Sylph. If you're in their territory,

64
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,879
you can't attack them, but they can attack you.

65
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,006
Hyah!

66
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,652
As long as I don't do anything to
provoke them, no one will attack me.

67
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,549
And you'll be there, miss Leafa.

68
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,362
Just call me Leafa.

69
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:53,986
And if you reallywant to go there, I'll take you.

70
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:56,336
I can't guarantee your safety, though.

71
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:58,425
Let's get flyin'.

72
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,082
Uh... wait.

73
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,624
You mean you can fly without using the controller?

74
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:07,473
Of course. Can't you?

75
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:11,342
I just learned how to use this thing, so
I'm still trying to figure everything out.

76
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:14,026
Well, there's a little trick to doing it.

77
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:14,733
Come on.

78
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:17,131
Turn around, but don't access your controller.

79
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:17,996
O... kay.

80
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:21,460
Can you feel where my hand is touching you?

81
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,063
Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:26,251
Imagine you've got virtual bones and
muscles here, spreading out into your wings.

83
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:27,322
Then try and move them.

84
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,872
"Virtual bones and muscles."

85
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,423
Yeah! Just like that!

86
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,044
You got it!

87
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:39,338
Okay, now try doing the same thing, only harder.

88
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:47,681
Go!

89
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:50,675
Wh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oa!

90
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:55,996
Oh, no!

91
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:57,109
Daddy!

92
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:59,180
Kirito! Are you okay?

93
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,137
Aaaah!

94
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,287
Whoa! Aah!

95
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:09,651
How do I make it stop?!

96
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm sorry, daddy, but that's hilarious!

97
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,920
Wow! This is awesome!

98
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:28,959
I know, right?

99
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,368
Looks like you're starting to get the hang of it.

100
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,989
Now... follow me!

101
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,592
Okay.

102
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,033
Take it slow until you get better at it.

103
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,242
Don't worry about me.

104
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,482
We can go faster.

105
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:44,958
Okay.

106
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,162
Huh?!

107
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,347
Is that as fast as you can go?

108
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,677
Well, don't blame meif you crash.

109
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,453
I can't go on! I need a break!

110
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,022
You're the only person I know
who can handle flying at this speed.

111
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:36,690
We made it!

112
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:40,853
Hey, we're gonna land at the
base of the central tower, okay?

113
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:42,012
Wait.

114
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:45,198
Kirito, you doknow how to land, right?

115
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:47,986
No, not really.

116
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:48,755
Uh...

117
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,459
Oh, crap. Too late now.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,284
You're on your own!

119
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,483
Wait... what?!

120
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,548
You're kidding me-e-e-e-e!

121
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,710
That was so not cool.

122
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:09,474
Stop whining, already. I can heal you.

123
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:13,711
Soo. Feelah. Haydl. Astaloo.

124
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,651
No way!

125
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,167
This is magic?

126
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:23,300
The undine are the only ones who
specialize in high-level healing spells.

127
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:26,407
But that's an important one
anyonecan do, so you should learn it.

128
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,379
Different races have different skills, huh?

129
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,850
Does the Spriggan race have anything they're good at?

130
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:36,441
Well, you guys are good at
treasure hunting and illusion magic.

131
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:39,213
Neither of those things are much help in battle, though.

132
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,351
So, thisis a Sylph town.

133
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:50,726
Man, it's beautiful.

134
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,226
I know, right?

135
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,768
Leafa!

136
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,331
Huh?

137
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,193
Thank god you're okay!

138
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:58,669
Oh, hey, Recon.

139
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,433
I knew you'd survive.

140
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,416
A Spriggan?!

141
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,148
No, It's okay!

142
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,151
He saved me from those salamanders.

143
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:08,667
Huh?

144
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:10,206
This is my friend.

145
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,422
His name's Recon.

146
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:12,701
Hey, there.

147
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,068
My name's Kirito.

148
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,514
Oh. Hi! Nice to meet ya.

149
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:20,340
Wait! What am I talking about?! I take that back!

150
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,562
You sure about him?

151
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,452
He could be a spy or something!

152
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:25,152
No, he's cool.

153
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,479
I'm pretty sure if he really was
a spy, he wouldn't be such a ditz.

154
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,046
Gee, thanks a lot.

155
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,518
Anyway, Sigurd and the others
are waiting for you at the tavern.

156
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:34,908
Oh, that's right.

157
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:36,578
Hmm.

158
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:39,798
On second thought, I can't go today.

159
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,158
Huh? You're not going?

160
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:42,594
Nope.

161
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:46,115
I sort of promised Kirito i'd
buy him a drink for saving me.

162
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,219
See you later!

163
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:47,680
Wait.

164
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:48,634
You don't have to...

165
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,054
uh...

166
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:52,518
Leafa!

167
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,699
Is that Recon guy your boyfriend?

168
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,254
Yeah, are the two of you in love?

169
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,700
No! We're not in love!

170
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,632
W-We're just in the same party, is all!

171
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:13,728
I don't know.

172
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,763
From where I was standing, you guys seemed tight.

173
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:16,384
Whatever!

174
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:17,678
I know him in real life.

175
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:20,538
We go to the same school, and
we're classmates, but that's it!

176
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,014
Mm-hmmmmm.

177
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,963
Anyway, bottoms up!

178
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,433
And thanks again for saving me.

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,192
Those guys in the forest were playing pretty rough.

180
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:38,014
Are gangs of pkers normal for this game, or what?

181
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:41,435
Well, for one thing, the salamander
and Sylph races never got along,

182
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,382
but those guys were organized, and
thatwasn't happening until recently.

183
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,445
I don't know.

184
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,894
If you ask me, they're gearing up
to try to clear the world tree soon.

185
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,572
Actually, I was hoping you could tell
me what you knew about the world tree.

186
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:55,455
Oh, yeah, you mentioned it before.

187
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:56,912
Why do you want to know?

188
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:59,365
I want to get to the top soon as I can.

189
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,369
Join the club. Everyplayer wants to get to the top.

190
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,975
You could say that's the grand quest of Alfheim Online.

191
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:08,316
What do you mean?

192
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:11,312
You know how you're limited in how high you can fly?

193
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,880
The fact is, none of the races can fly
continuously for more than 10 minutes at a time.

194
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:21,966
However, at the top of the tree is the floating
city, and in it lives oberon, the fairy king.

195
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:27,354
The first race to reach him will be reborn
as an advanced class of fairy known as alfs.

196
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:31,683
And what's cool about that is they'll be
able to fly around for as long as they want.

197
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,128
That is cool.

198
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:36,139
It'd be sweet to fly for as long as I want.

199
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:39,605
So, how does someone get to the top of the tree?

200
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,638
At the base of the tree, there's a big dome.

201
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,679
That's the gateway to the floating city.

202
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:49,423
But then, you have to get past the NPCs
that guard it, and they're super-powerful.

203
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,401
They're that strong, huh?

204
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:54,920
Let me put it this way... the game's
been around for a year now, right?

205
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,390
No one's got past them.

206
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:59,466
Maybe everyone's missed that one key quest.

207
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:00,218
No, wait.

208
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:03,571
Maybe it's designed so that one race can't reach it alone.

209
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:07,145
Hey, you got good instincts.

210
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:11,323
For now, everyone seems to think it's a
missing quest, so they're out there looking for it.

211
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:14,605
But if we have to work together
to beat it it'll never happen.

212
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,684
Why not?

213
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,781
Because it doesn't make sense.

214
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:21,889
Why would you help another race with a
quest if they're the ones who get the reward?

215
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:24,844
Can you imagine anyonebeing cool with that arrangement?

216
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:28,325
Then, getting to the top of the tree is impossible.

217
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,534
What's the point in even trying?

218
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,917
No arguments here.

219
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,242
Flying is pretty addictive, though.

220
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,723
Once you get a taste for it, you can't give it up.

221
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:41,813
You think, "even if it takes years, someday..."

222
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,783
But I can't wait around that long!

223
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:44,211
Uh...

224
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:51,427
Daddy?

225
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:53,921
Sorry.

226
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:58,424
It's just that I have to get to the
top of the world tree as soon as I can.

227
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,691
Uh... okay. What's the rush?

228
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,187
I'm sort of... Looking for someone.

229
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:06,776
What do you mean?

230
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:10,407
No offense, but it's hard to explain.

231
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,243
Thank you, Leafa.

232
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,864
All the info you gave me is really gonna help.

233
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:28,404
Wait.

234
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:31,628
Are you heading for the world tree right now?

235
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:32,859
Uh-huh.

236
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,704
I need to see for myself.

237
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,058
Alone? That's crazy.

238
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:41,370
It's really far away, and...

239
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,784
You'll have to fight a bunch of monsters.

240
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:45,905
I know you can handle yourself, but...

241
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:51,563
hey, if you want, I can take you there.

242
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:59,593
Thanks, but we just met, and I wouldn't
feel right, you coming all that way.

243
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,855
Right... then maybe you already know how to get there?

244
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:02,177
Uh...

245
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,211
Whatcha gonna do about the guardians?

246
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:07,419
Well... I'll think of something when I get there.

247
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:09,046
Too late!

248
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:10,723
My mind's made up.

249
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:11,613
Uh...

250
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:14,711
Okay.

251
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,205
So...

252
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,574
Do you want to meet up tomorrow?

253
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:19,957
Yeah. Sure.

254
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,379
Then I'll meet you here tomorrow at 3:00 P.M. sharp.

255
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,048
Um, I have to log out now.

256
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:27,003
So, when you're ready, you can log
out in one of the rooms upstairs, okay?

257
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,331
Well, see you, then.

258
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:29,212
Uh, wait!

259
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,002
Thank you, Leafa.

260
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,883
Hey, if you want, I can take you there.

261
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:08,015
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

262
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,792
Talk about a weird guy.

263
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,818
Kirito.

264
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:29,071
I guess this means goodbye till tomorrow, doesn't it?

265
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:30,763
Yeah, but I'll be back soon.

266
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,257
It won't be that long.

267
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:34,686
Daddy?

268
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:40,583
Would it be all right if I slept
next to you... just until you log out?

269
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,083
Yeah.

270
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,099
Sure.

271
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:45,273
I don't mind.

272
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,701
You and me, we're gonna save Asuna.

273
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,274
Then we'll all go buy a house somewhere again.

274
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:58,737
That would make me so happy.

275
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:02,796
You know, living with you and mommy
again would be a dream come true.

276
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:07,238
It's not a dream.

277
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,937
I promise you I'll make it a reality.

278
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,535
Good night... Daddy.

279
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:56,387
Right now, your face is more
beautiful than anything, Titania.

280
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,592
The way you look like you're about to cry, I
wish I could preserve it and hang it up on a wall.

281
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,933
What are you waiting for... permission?

282
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:17,073
You can do whatever you want. I have no say in the matter.

283
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,099
You're the system admin, after all.

284
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:21,816
Such cold words from such a pretty mouth.

285
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,347
Now, have I ever laid a hand on
you when you didn't want me to,

286
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:26,583
Titania?

287
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:28,871
Stop calling me by that stupid name.

288
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:31,524
My name is Asuna, Sugou.

289
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,765
You're spoiling the fun.

290
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,895
In this world, I'm known as oberon, the fairy king.

291
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:41,876
There's not a player who wouldn't give
everything to be the ruler of Alfheim.

292
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:45,586
And you are queen Titania, my breathtaking bride.

293
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,517
What more could you ask for?

294
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:50,776
So, as my queen, as my bride,

295
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:52,904
when will you give your heart to me?

296
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:54,353
Never.

297
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:57,226
The only things I'll give you are disgust and hatred...

298
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:58,350
and nothing more.

299
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,799
You're a stubborn girl.

300
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,834
I'll give you that.

301
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,965
But, you know,

302
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:09,600
for a while now, I've been thinking... romance
is nice and all, but it might be more fun...

303
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,322
If I just took you by force.

304
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,409
Mmmmm.

305
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,299
Ohhh.

306
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,324
Stop it.

307
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,007
Of course, my dear.

308
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:46,168
It was a joke.

309
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,424
I'd never really force myself on you.

310
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:50,132
I don't have to.

311
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:53,857
You'll start wanting me soon enough... I promise.

312
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:55,579
You're insane.

313
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:59,459
You won't be talking like that for much longer.

314
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:07,118
Right now, in this world, tens of
thousands of players are enjoying this game,

315
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:12,122
but none of them have a clue about the
true potential of the fulldive system.

316
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:16,611
Did you know that by expanding
the brain's control regions,

317
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:21,211
one could influence a person's
thoughts, emotions, and memories?

318
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,113
You can't!

319
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,033
Technology like that is illegal!

320
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:26,511
Oh, but you're wrong.

321
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,626
In fact, several countries are researching it as we speak.

322
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:35,284
The only thing standing in the way
is finding people to experiment on.

323
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:39,088
But one day, I was watching
the news, and there they were...

324
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,567
10,000 ideal Guinea pigs!

325
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,512
Mr. Kayaba was a genius, but he was also a fool.

326
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:52,317
All he wanted to use his technology for was his game.

327
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,453
He couldn't see the potential in it.

328
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,883
But I did.

329
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,203
It wasn't too difficult to adjust the routers.

330
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:02,254
The minute S.A.O.'s players were logged
out, I just grabbed a few from the flow.

331
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:06,473
Just like that, I had 300 of my very own test subjects.

332
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,328
My research has taken great strides the past two months.

333
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:15,977
I've been developing a technology that seeds
memories with objects and uses them to control emotion.

334
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:18,382
My work is almost finished now.

335
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:21,229
You arecrazy.

336
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:24,223
My father would neverallow that kind of research.

337
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,295
He wouldn't if he knew about it, but it's being
done in secret... just a small team and myself.

338
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,949
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to sell it off.

339
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,957
To who?

340
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,836
An American corporation.

341
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:41,135
You won't believe how anxious
they are to get their hands on it.

342
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:45,209
And soon, I'm going to sell it
andrct to them for as much as I can.

343
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,758
That won't happen.

344
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,068
I'll see to that.

345
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:53,732
As soon as I get back to the real world, the
first thing I'll do is report you to the police.

346
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,253
You want to bet?

347
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,826
You're in the same boat as the other Guinea pigs.

348
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,493
Huh?

349
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:02,274
What, you haven't figured it out?

350
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:05,165
If I wanted, I could alter your memories, too.

351
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,391
I'm on the way.

352
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:16,764
Wait for my orders.

353
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,013
Don't worry.

354
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,858
The last thing I'd ever want to do
is turn you into a porcelain doll.

355
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:28,753
But the next time we meet, I hope
you'll be... Just a bit more submissive...

356
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:30,991
Titania.

357
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,033
Farewell, my love.

358
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:02,182
Kirito,

359
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:03,968
please save me.

360
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,848
Next time: "To the World Tree".
