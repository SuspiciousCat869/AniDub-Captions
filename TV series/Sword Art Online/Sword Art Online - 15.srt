1
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:55,103
Asuna!

2
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:56,654
Asuna!!

3
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,047
Oh, Asuna.

4
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:54,218
I've turned into the biggest crybaby.

5
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,187
Haven't I?

6
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:41,887
Me and him, we look nothing alike.

7
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:51,727
I'm off to practice!

8
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,511
I'll see you later, okay?

9
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:40,600
Hu...

10
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,517
Good morning, Sugu.

11
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,069
U-Uh, g-g-good morning.

12
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:50,166
Uh... oh, eh, eh, uh!

13
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:51,906
God, seriously?

14
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:54,370
Instead of lurking, you should have said something.

15
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:58,373
Yeah, well, you were practicing,
and I didn't want to bother you.

16
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:00,716
I wasn't really practicing.

17
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:02,807
I guess it's just habit, is all.

18
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:04,777
Oh. Huh.

19
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,259
At least you've been keeping it up.

20
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,355
It's light.

21
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,236
What?!

22
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:13,800
It's not light.

23
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,255
It's timber bamboo.

24
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,122
Oh. Yeah, right.

25
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,765
I meant, like...

26
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,943
It's lighter than I thought.

27
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,532
It's not as heavy as what I'm used to.

28
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:24,453
Oh.

29
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,730
What the heck's he comparing it to?

30
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:32,811
Ahh.

31
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:35,974
Hey, you think maybe we could give it a go?

32
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:37,294
What, you mean a match?

33
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:38,746
Like, seriously?

34
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:39,500
Yup.

35
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,355
A real match with pads and stuff?

36
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,450
Mm...

37
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:46,565
Yeah, on second thought, no contact.

38
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,831
I mean, I'd feel like crap if I ended up hurting you.

39
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,574
I still got to dig out grandpa's old gear.

40
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,611
How 'bout we spar in the dojo?

41
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:56,615
Whoa!

42
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:01,160
You sound pretty darn confident for
someone who's been asleep for two years.

43
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:05,704
For your information, I was a
quarterfinalist in the middle-school nationals.

44
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:10,217
Seriously, though, are you sure you're feeling up to this?

45
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,084
You might want to take it easy.

46
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:19,243
I've been doing rehab in the gym every
day, so I think I'm gonna be good to go.

47
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,061
Eh... hm.

48
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:36,038
What kind of stance is that supposed to be?

49
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,785
Don't you worry about

50
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:41,503
this is my own style. Okay.

51
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:42,488
Ready?

52
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:43,384
Uh-huh.

53
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,038
His head's wide open.

54
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,153
That'll be my first strike.

55
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:53,933
Huh?

56
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,992
It's an odd stance, but he looks composed.

57
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,794
Okay, then.

58
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:35,377
Oh, my god!

59
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:36,968
A-A-Are you okay?

60
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,615
Okay, okay. You win.

61
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,765
You sure are strong, Sugu.

62
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:46,034
You'd mop the floor with Heathcliff.

63
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:48,775
Maybe you should sit down or something.

64
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,752
I'm good.

65
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,571
Thanks for the match.

66
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:55,660
Uh... huh.

67
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,430
Uh...

68
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:06,661
D-Did I hit you too hard?

69
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:07,797
No, I'm okay!

70
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,266
Just years of habit.

71
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,853
Let's see.

72
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,053
My footwork was okay, but the attack sucked.

73
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:19,756
I guess I can't use the sword skills I
acquired, unless I got the system helping.

74
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,998
I have to say, I'm really surprised.

75
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,852
I mean, how long have you been practicing behind my back?

76
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,081
Oh, you know...

77
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,506
It iskinda fun, after all.

78
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,433
But you never know... maybe I'll take it up again.

79
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:32,334
Really?!

80
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:33,700
Oh, seriously?!

81
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:34,757
Yeah, sure.

82
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,306
You want to be my teacher?

83
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,331
Are you kidding? Of course!

84
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,492
We'll train together, like we used t...

85
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,744
After I build up some more muscle, okay?

86
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:48,684
I've been practicing, too.

87
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,226
Want to know what?

88
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:50,948
Huh?

89
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:54,207
Nope. I'll keep it a secret.

90
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:56,064
That is so not cool.

91
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:01,912
You going anywhere today?

92
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:03,047
Oh.

93
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,200
I don't know.

94
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:08,073
I guess... The hospital.

95
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,263
Oh, you are?

96
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:14,208
That's nice.

97
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:16,897
Her name's Asuna, right?

98
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,732
You... visit her a lot.

99
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,621
Uh-huh.

100
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:22,687
As much as I can.

101
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,309
It's the only thing I can do for her.

102
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,807
Anyway, Sugu, it's myturn to make breakfast today.

103
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,332
It'll be ready by the time you finish your shower.

104
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,777
Okay.

105
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,397
It's been two months since I beat Heathcliff.

106
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,228
Two months since I beat the death game.

107
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,693
When I woke up, I talked to someone
from the ministry of internal affairs.

108
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:56,831
I told them everything I knew
about S.A.O., and in exchange,

109
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,446
they told me where Asuna was.

110
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:09,268
I found out she was nearby, in Saitama.

111
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:13,302
Asuna's family admitted her
to to korozawa general hospital.

112
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,242
I also found out that besides her, there's
about 300 other players who haven't woken up yet.

113
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:31,171
Akihiko Kayaba's still missing.

114
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:35,581
And people think he's keeping the
players in their comas as part of his plan.

115
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,472
S.A.O. isn't over.

116
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,425
Not by a long shot.

117
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,742
Asuna.

118
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:04,865
Kazuto.

119
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,232
Sorry... I didn't know you were here.

120
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:08,963
Thank you for coming.

121
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,783
Hello, Mr. Yuki.

122
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,673
I hope it's okay I'm here.

123
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:13,849
Please.

124
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:15,687
You can visit whenever you like.

125
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,736
I know it makes her happy.

126
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,604
Sir.

127
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:29,360
Oh.

128
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,370
I don't think the two of you have ever met.

129
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:32,735
This is Sugou.

130
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:35,175
He's our company's director of R&D.

131
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,196
I'm Nobuyuki Sugou.

132
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,458
It's a pleasure.

133
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:41,383
I'm Kazuto Kirigaya.

134
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:44,098
You're the Kirito?

135
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,307
You're a hero. It's an honor!

136
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,411
Oh. I-I'm sorry.

137
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,464
I know we're not supposed to talk about
what happened inside the S.A.O. server.

138
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:55,396
But he's my partner's son, so it's fine.

139
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:58,940
Besides, I've always thought of him as part of my family.

140
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,856
Uh, actually, sir...

141
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,596
Speaking of family...

142
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:07,473
If I may, I'd like to make it
official as soon as possible.

143
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,949
This is sudden.

144
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,429
Are you sure this is really what you want?

145
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,335
I mean, you're still young.

146
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,258
You have your whole life ahead of you.

147
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:17,934
Thank you for your concern,

148
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,541
but my heart's set on it.

149
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:24,808
It sounds strange, but even though
she's like this, she's still beautiful.

150
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,715
I'd like to see her in that wedding dress.

151
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:30,677
You have a point.

152
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:35,866
The sooner we prepare ourselves
for the inevitable, the better.

153
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:40,913
Sorry to cut the conversation short.

154
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:42,730
I have a meeting to get to.

155
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:45,433
We can talk more about this later.

156
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:48,396
Kazuto, take care.

157
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,927
I heard you and Asuna were lovers in the game.

158
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,308
Is that true?

159
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:05,333
Uh-huh.

160
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,025
That is unfortunate.

161
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:10,815
It's going to make for one complicated
relationship between you and I.

162
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:24,976
In case you're curious, her father and
I were discussing her marriage... to me.

163
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,089
No way.

164
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,052
You can't do that.

165
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:32,674
You have a point.

166
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,142
It's true. We can't legally marry.

167
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:39,920
But if the Yuki family adopts me, it'll
be as if we are... on paper, that is.

168
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:41,946
Just like we're married.

169
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,402
The truth is, she's always hated
me... ever since we were kids.

170
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:49,072
Neither my parents nor hers know that.

171
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:53,640
If I proposed and she could speak,
I'm pretty sure her answer would be "no."

172
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,089
For me, this situation is...

173
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,545
Very favorable.

174
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:01,553
Stop it!

175
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,880
Who do you think you are?

176
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,755
You can't take advantage of Asuna like this.

177
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:12,588
"Take advantage"?

178
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:13,891
Oh, please.

179
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,577
If anything, I have a right to her.

180
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,303
Perhaps I should explain why.

181
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,273
Any idea what happened to argus?

182
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:26,144
They're the company that developed S.A.O.

183
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:28,358
I heard they closed it down.

184
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:29,422
Very good.

185
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:33,945
The lawsuits and damages they had to pay took their toll.

186
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:36,599
The company was forced into bankruptcy.

187
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:41,285
But the maintenance of the S.A.O.
servers was given to another company...

188
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:45,703
an electronics manufacturer,
where Asuna's father, shouzou Yuki,

189
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:49,365
is the C.E.O.... Rct progress.

190
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:54,079
And I work for the company's
full-dive technology R&D division.

191
00:14:54,802 --> 00:15:01,260
In other words... and without getting into specifics...
you could say I'm the one keeping Asuna alive.

192
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:06,885
Now, I ask you... is it wrong for me to
expect a little compensation for my trouble?

193
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:12,653
I don't know what kind of promises you made to
each other in the game, and I don't really care.

194
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:15,784
But I don't ever want to see you here again.

195
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:16,998
Understood?

196
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:21,289
And from now on, stay away from the Yuki family.

197
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:25,675
We're having the ceremony here
on January 26th... a week from now.

198
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:26,968
Save the date.

199
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,760
Even though you're not welcome here
anymore, you should come to the wedding.

200
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,418
No need to thank me.

201
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:38,593
Well, Mr. Hero, you've got the room all to yourself now.

202
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,674
Say "goodbye" and get out.

203
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:48,779
Kazuto!

204
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,581
The bathroom's all yours!

205
00:15:58,685 --> 00:15:59,931
Geez. What's wrong?

206
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,737
Why didn't you say something?

207
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,636
And turn on the heat. It's freezing in here!

208
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:10,429
Sorry.

209
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,383
I just... Want to be left alone.

210
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,967
Hey, how come you didn't turn the heater on?

211
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,022
What's wrong?

212
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:19,136
Are you okay?

213
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,186
Yeah, it's nothing.

214
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:22,463
Okay, but...

215
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,027
You're freezing.

216
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,174
You're gonna catch a cold.

217
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,106
I could run you a hot bath, if you want.

218
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,928
I'm so hopeless and weak.

219
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,436
I didn't want you to see this.

220
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,426
I swore, no matter what, you'd
never see me being such a crybaby.

221
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:45,892
Is it Asuna?

222
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,717
Is she okay?

223
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,389
Did something happen to her?

224
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:53,997
She's leaving...

225
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,842
Somewhere far away.

226
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:01,202
And I'll never... I'm never gonna see her again.

227
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:20,018
Hey.

228
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:21,867
Hang in there, okay?

229
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:27,740
If you really love someone that much, even
when things look hopeless, you can't give up.

230
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:34,628
I know I can't.

231
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:39,657
And I won't lie to myself anymore.

232
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:47,825
Gosh.

233
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,009
I remember it like it was yesterday.

234
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:56,133
Kazuto stood there looking at me, and then he
told me he wanted to know who his real parents were.

235
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:59,440
I was so shocked, I didn't know what to say.

236
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,809
He was only 10, but here's the thing...

237
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,534
somehow, he logged on to the citizen's
registration network and found the file!

238
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,852
That figures.

239
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,054
Sounds just like something he'd

240
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,248
I was so stunned, I couldn't think of a way to deny it.

241
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:16,551
So what do I do instead?

242
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:20,110
I tell him how my big sister and
her husband are his real parents.

243
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:20,780
Wow!

244
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,615
Mom?

245
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:25,759
I was wondering...

246
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:26,854
About what?

247
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,423
I guess about the way he's been since middle school.

248
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,728
He'd go into his room and play games online for hours.

249
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:36,549
You think it's 'cause he found out about his real parents?

250
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:37,860
No, not at all.

251
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,477
He was always into computers and technology.

252
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:44,495
By the time he was 6, he'd already
built his own computer out of spare parts.

253
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,818
If anything, he's like that 'cause
he's a huge computer nerd, like me.

254
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:50,690
Or so he thinks.

255
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:55,435
Well, I'm heading home and get dinner ready.

256
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,129
Don't stay too long, okay, Suguha?

257
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,358
Don't worry. I won't.

258
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,224
Happy birthday, kiddo.

259
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,462
He's my cousin, not my big brother.

260
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:21,265
I still have a hard time believing it.

261
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,302
My big brother.

262
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:53,910
But...

263
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,873
In the end, your heart...

264
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,295
In the end, your heart...

265
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,030
Belongs to her.

266
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,297
Come on.

267
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:21,821
Wake up, Sugu.

268
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,392
It's morning.

269
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:32,793
I said you got to wake up now.

270
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,732
Not gonna have time to practice if you don't wake up.

271
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,209
Uh... Wha...?

272
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,310
Oh. Hey.

273
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:44,922
Morning.

274
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:46,343
Rise and shine.

275
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,452
Hiya, sleepy.

276
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,773
Um, I...

277
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:08,769
Oh, my god!

278
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,052
As weird as ever.

279
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,378
Just hang in there, okay?

280
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,079
She's right.

281
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:28,859
Yeah, she's right.

282
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,681
What the hell?!

283
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:03,784
Asuna.

284
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,929
Next time: "Land of Fairies".
