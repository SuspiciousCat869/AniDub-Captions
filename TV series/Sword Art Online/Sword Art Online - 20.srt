1
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,317
There's the exit!

2
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:28,866
Are you trying to kill me?!

3
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,935
No, just trying to save us some time.

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,571
You and your shortcuts.

5
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,147
Uh, wait a sec.

6
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,274
Do you even know where this meeting's happening?

7
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:54,401
Yeah, I'll check.

8
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,189
Mm...

9
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:59,056
Northwest... inside that mountain.

10
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:00,575
How much time we got?

11
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:01,966
20 minutes.

12
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:03,782
Then we're not going fast enough.

13
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:51,438
I wish we could go faster, 'cause at this rate,
we're not gonna make it before the salamanders.

14
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,121
I know.

15
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,032
Even if we can warn them, it doesn't
mean we'll get the commanders out in time.

16
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,979
We just might end up dying with them all in battle.

17
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:02,928
I've got player readings...

18
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:05,351
68 of them flying in formation.

19
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,782
From what I can tell, it could
be the salamander attack squad.

20
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:18,077
There are 14 more players on the plateau.

21
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:21,859
Most likely, they're the diplomats
from the sylphs and cait siths.

22
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,507
The two groups of players will make contact in 50 seconds.

23
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:28,419
We didn't make it after all.

24
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,069
Thanks for trying, Kirito, but this is far enough.

25
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:36,223
I'm gonna try and save Sakuya.

26
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,519
Get out of here and head for the world tree.

27
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:41,943
We didn't get to hang out for long, but it was fun.

28
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,620
Hope we meet again someday.

29
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:48,029
Sorry, but running away from
a fight's not really my style.

30
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,845
Why are the salamanders here?

31
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,840
Salamanders, stand down!

32
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:27,097
Who's that?

33
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:29,724
Sakuya!

34
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:31,345
Leafa?

35
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,750
W-What are you doing here?

36
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:36,683
It's too complicated to get into
now, but you see that guy out there?

37
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:40,577
Believe it or not, the fates of
our races depend on his next move.

38
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,270
You have got to be kidding.

39
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,677
I want to talk to your commander!

40
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:58,255
What the hell is a Spriggan like you doing here?

41
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:03,950
I'm gonna kill you no matter what your answer,

42
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:07,558
but since you're brave enough to
face me, I might as well hear you out.

43
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:09,248
My name is Kirito.

44
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:11,983
I'm an ambassador for the spriggan/undine alliance.

45
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,765
Since you're on the offensive today, I'm assuming
you want to wage a full-on war between all our races.

46
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:18,257
Huh?

47
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:19,527
Huh?

48
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:20,386
Uh...

49
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,779
Mnh-mnh! Mnh-mnh!

50
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:26,059
The undines are allied with the spriggans, huh?

51
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,366
And you're supposed to be their ambassador,
but you've come here without a guard?

52
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:31,454
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:32,469
So what?

54
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:36,335
I was sent here to negotiate trade
terms with the sylphs and cait sith,

55
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:40,065
but if you interrupt our talks, you're
gonna get to feel some serious hurt.

56
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:45,008
All of our races are gonna team up, and we'll
bring the fight straight to the salamanders.

57
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,755
You're kidding me, right?

58
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:52,810
You're all alone and you've got crappy gear, so
there's no way you could be anyone's ambassador.

59
00:05:55,266 --> 00:06:00,851
If you can survive my attacks for 30 seconds,
then I'll believe you are who you say you are.

60
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,059
Gee, thanks.

61
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:03,410
That's mighty generous.

62
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:04,537
This is bad.

63
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:05,402
Why?

64
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,731
Do you see that salamander's sword?

65
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,851
It's the demon sword gram.

66
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:13,239
You need a two-handed sword skill of 950 to equip it.

67
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,024
950?!

68
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:15,722
Yes.

69
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,418
And there's only one person I know who can use it...

70
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,886
General Eugene.

71
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:20,952
Have you heard of him?

72
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,962
Yeah, I know the name.

73
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:26,887
He's the younger brother of
Mortimer, the leader of the salamanders.

74
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,904
They're brothers in real life, too.

75
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:35,441
Mortimer's a brilliant strategist, but in terms of sheer
power, they say Eugene is the game's strongest player.

76
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:36,830
Oh, no.

77
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,977
He's the strongest player?

78
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:41,251
Kirito.

79
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,408
Mngh!

80
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,728
Oh! What was that?!

81
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:03,631
The ethereal shift... the sword's bonus skill.

82
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:09,138
Whenever someone tries to block it with a shield or a
sword, the demonic sword gram can phase right through it!

83
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:11,193
Really?! No way!

84
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,121
Can't believe you're not dead.

85
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,194
What the hell kind of attack was that?!

86
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,352
Damn, he's good.

87
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,967
Hey, big red, I think your 30 seconds are up by now.

88
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:37,343
I've changed my mind.

89
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,075
I've decided to kill you anyway.

90
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:41,537
Now you have to survive until I do.

91
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,101
Yeah, that figures.

92
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,160
But I won't go down that easy!

93
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,434
This won't end well.

94
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:54,280
They both seem like equally skilled
fighters, but Eugene's weapon is far superior.

95
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:55,696
He can do it.

96
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,541
Kirito can beat him. I know it.

97
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:26,419
What the...

98
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,722
I need to borrow this for a sec.

99
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,397
K-Kirito?

100
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:34,584
Aah!

101
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:38,040
A few seconds... that's all you bought!

102
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,057
Hey, where'd he go?

103
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:48,249
Do you think he... Ran away?

104
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:49,998
Of course he didn't!

105
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:56,091
As long as I'm alive, I'm not
gonna let anyone in my party die.

106
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:58,467
I won't let that happen again.

107
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,401
Kirito would never run away and leave us.

108
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:08,933
Huh?

109
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:13,625
Kirito!

110
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:32,854
Aaaaaaaaah!

111
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,799
Die!

112
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,343
Yaaaaah!

113
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:50,705
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

114
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,791
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

115
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,849
Splendid! Marvelous!

116
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:23,939
That was the most amazing fight ever!

117
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,989
Nicely done, Spriggan!

118
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:26,982
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

119
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:28,813
That was good!

120
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,758
Yeah, seriously!

121
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,466
You're an excellent fighter.

122
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,752
In fact, you're the most powerful player I've ever seen.

123
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:13,793
Well done.

124
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,399
You're not so bad yourself.

125
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,783
I didn't know the spriggans had
someone like you in their ranks.

126
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,921
This world's a bigger place than I thought.

127
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,201
Are we cool, then?

128
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,376
Will you withdraw?

129
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,674
Mm.

130
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,925
Eugene, may I have a word?

131
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,415
Kagemune, what is it?

132
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,459
Him again.

133
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,086
Oh.

134
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:41,992
The next time, I'll make sure

135
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,301
to bring more friends along.

136
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,559
You might find this interesting.

137
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,077
You know how my party was wiped out yesterday?

138
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:49,981
So?

139
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:53,772
Well, this Spriggan... he's the
same guy who took everyone out.

140
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,148
And he was traveling with an undine.

141
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:57,879
Hmm.

142
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:03,528
Interesting.

143
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,896
Then I guess I have to believe you.

144
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:13,697
But just for the record, the last thing our leader and
I want is to go to war with the spriggans and undines.

145
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:15,731
We'll withdraw for now, but I'm

146
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:19,077
gonna be looking forward to fighting you again.

147
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,846
Then that makes two of us.

148
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,689
I guess so mesalamanders can be cool after all.

149
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:28,554
Who knew?

150
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,875
You really are insane, you know that?

151
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,726
Yeah, I get that a lot.

152
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,025
Excuse me, but could either
of you explain what's going on?

153
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:42,881
I see.

154
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:46,876
I could tell there was something
off about Sigurd's attitude recently.

155
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,570
He seemed so irritated.

156
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,032
Irritated?

157
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:51,803
About what?

158
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,431
My guess... he was dissatisfied about the state of things,

159
00:12:55,704 --> 00:13:00,048
that in terms of power, he couldn't
accept we'd fallen behind the salamanders.

160
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,841
Power is very important to a man like Sigurd...

161
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:08,351
and not just for his abilities and
character stats, but also as a player.

162
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,218
He craves power.

163
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,112
Yeah, but even so, why would
he turn spy for the salamanders?

164
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,054
It must have something to do with the
5.0 update that's going to be released soon.

165
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:23,900
I heard a rumor that they'll be
putting in a reincarnation system.

166
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:25,762
No way!

167
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,824
I'm sure Mortimer made him an offer.

168
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:32,670
"Bring me the head of your leader, and
I'll reincarnate you as a salamander."

169
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:34,656
So, now what?

170
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,174
What'll you do, Sakuya?

171
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,833
Ru, have you raised your dark-magic skill yet?

172
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,547
Mm-hmm.

173
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,670
Open a moonlight mirror to Sigurd.

174
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:52,686
Hmm.

175
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,244
Sigurd.

176
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,406
S-Sakuya!

177
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:01,028
Nice to see you, too.

178
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:02,990
Unfortunately, I'm still alive.

179
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:06,350
How... I-I mean... What happened at the meeting?

180
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:07,947
It went very well.

181
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,696
There's still the matter of signing the treaty, though.

182
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:15,264
By the way, we had an unexpected guest.

183
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:16,532
W-What guest?

184
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:20,890
His name is general Eugene, and he sends his regards.

185
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:24,908
Leafa.

186
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:26,599
So that's it.

187
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,232
Oh, those incompetent lizards.

188
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:32,797
Well, it's your move now, Sakuya.

189
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,347
Are you gonna fine me?

190
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,119
Or maybe you want to take away my command.

191
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:42,219
If so, remember... without me running
your military, your rule won't last very long.

192
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:45,477
Actually, I was thinking of
granting the request you made them.

193
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:48,307
Since you can't stand being a Sylph, you're free to go.

194
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:49,442
Wait... what?!

195
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:54,712
Hold on.

196
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:55,974
Are you crazy?!

197
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:59,095
Me?! You... you're banishing me?!

198
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:03,070
I'm letting you live to wander
the neutral territory as a renegade.

199
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:07,168
With any luck, you'll find something
there that'll occupy your precious time.

200
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,464
You bit...

201
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:26,325
Sakuya?

202
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:28,319
Thank you for saving us, Leafa.

203
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:31,353
You've no idea how grateful I am having you around.

204
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,085
Oh, well... I didn't really do anything.

205
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:36,383
If you want to thank someone, thank Kirito.

206
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,345
She's right. Whoever you are, you have my thanks.

207
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:45,026
Hey, handsome, about this Spriggan undine
ambassador business... you aren't ,are you?

208
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:45,638
Mm...

209
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,433
Uh...

210
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,968
Yeah, that was a big, fat lie.

211
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,498
I was bluffing, conning... you know, negotiating.

212
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,582
Oh, god. You must be insane.

213
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,457
You have to be, to make all
that stuff up at the last minute.

214
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,011
Yeah, but it worked, didn't it?

215
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,857
Whenever I'm dealt a bad hand, I always raise the pot.

216
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:09,736
You know, for a big, fat liar,
you're pretty freakin' strong, handsome.

217
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,887
You're like the mvp of spriggans.

218
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,407
Are you their secret weapon?

219
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,605
Nah, of course not.

220
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:17,242
All I am is your friendly neighborhood mercenary.

221
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,455
I like the wandering type.

222
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:25,306
Have you ever thought about
being a merc for the cait sith?

223
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,951
You get three meals a day, plus snacks and a nap.

224
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:34,142
So, Kirito, I was thinking... how about
we get to know each other a little better?

225
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,223
I know a cute little pub in Sylvain... my treat.

226
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:38,215
Wait...

227
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,329
Aw, come on, Sakuya.

228
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,390
That's not fair.

229
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:44,230
You're totally seducing him with those things.

230
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,876
I'm seducing him? If you were any
closer to him, he'd be wearing you.

231
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,605
Would you guys chill out?!

232
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,631
For your information, he's my...

233
00:16:57,847 --> 00:16:59,149
I mean, he's...

234
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:02,637
What?

235
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:03,940
He's my...

236
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,235
Uh... never mind.

237
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,412
Look, I appreciate the offers, really.

238
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:19,521
But the thing is, she promised to
take me to the world tree, so... sorry.

239
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:20,562
Really?

240
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:21,896
Oh, well.

241
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:23,335
That is a shame.

242
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:26,424
Are you going there for a little sightseeing, Leafa?

243
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,433
Or... what?

244
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,357
I'm leaving the sylphs.

245
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:32,677
Or planning on it, anyway.

246
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,195
But I want to return to Sylvain at some point.

247
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:37,407
I just don't know when that's gonna be.

248
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,241
Not a problem. I understand.

249
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,171
Just make sure you come back, okay?

250
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:42,554
And bring your friend.

251
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:44,619
On the way back, stop by my place.

252
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,953
We'll throw you a party.

253
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:54,392
Thank you so much for coming today, Leafa, Kirito.

254
00:17:55,202 --> 00:18:00,344
If you hadn't been here to stop them, the salamanders
would have become even more powerful than ever.

255
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:02,481
I'd like to pay you back somehow.

256
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,062
Oh, no. It was nothing.

257
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,384
Hey, Sakuya, Alicia...

258
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,180
Wasn't the point of you guys getting
together to make a tribe for the world tree?

259
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,880
Ultimately, yes, that was our goal.

260
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,745
If you're okay with it and it's no
trouble, we'd like to go with you.

261
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,101
We're kind of in a hurry to get there, though.

262
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:21,801
Hmm.

263
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:22,851
Hmm.

264
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,237
Well, I can't see why not. In fact, the
truth is, we'd be grateful to have you along.

265
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:31,065
But why are you in such a hurry to get there?

266
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:35,593
She's not in a hurry.

267
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,367
I'm the one who has to get to the top of the tree.

268
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,108
I think someone I know is up there, waiting for me.

269
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,411
Hmm.

270
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,715
Is it oberon, the fairy king?

271
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:48,235
No. It's not him.

272
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,769
It's someone I can't reach in real life.

273
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:55,226
But in here, I might be able to.

274
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:59,154
We want to help, but storming the
tree's gonna take some time to set up.

275
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:04,238
We got to gear up the raiding party and stuff,
and that'll take us way more than a few days.

276
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:05,166
I see.

277
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:07,677
Never mind, then.

278
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,599
I don't want to raid the tree, like you.

279
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:12,157
I just want to get to the base of it as soon as possible.

280
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,231
So it's cool. We'll figure it out.

281
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,701
Oh, by the way...

282
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:20,477
Maybe this will help you guys
get some new gear for your raid.

283
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:21,564
Mm.

284
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:27,706
Whoa! Sakuya, look!

285
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:28,634
Check it out!

286
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:34,140
$100,000 pieces of mithril yuld?!

287
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:35,778
You don't want it?

288
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:38,278
You could build a castle on prime land with this.

289
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,455
Nah, it's yours.

290
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,948
I don't need it anymore.

291
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,490
You are so awesome.

292
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:45,756
With this bag of loot, we've
got just about enough for new gear.

293
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,805
We'll get ready as fast as we can.

294
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,465
When we're set to go, we'll message you, okay?

295
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:51,918
Yeah. You got it.

296
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:56,211
Thanks, guys!

297
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,655
We'll be seein' ya!

298
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:07,097
I don't know about you, but I
can't believe you pulled that off.

299
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:13,762
Oh, honestly!

300
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:16,851
I thought I told you... no more flirting, daddy!

301
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,861
I wasn't flirting with anyone.

302
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,849
When those girls were clinging to you,
I noticed that your heartbeat increased.

303
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:24,708
I'm a guy.

304
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,759
That's what happens when girls get too close.

305
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:27,784
Seriously.

306
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,030
What about me? I'm a girl.

307
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,907
Isn't that a problem?

308
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,711
No, you seem pretty safe to me, Leafa.

309
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,307
What do you mean, "safe"?!

310
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,490
Mm...

311
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:43,346
I think what she means is, most of the
time, you don't really seem much like a girl.

312
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,617
Okay, whoa!

313
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,756
Say that again! I dare you!

314
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:50,934
No, like... like, you're easy to get
along with. I meant it in a goodway.

315
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:51,761
Yeah.

316
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:52,943
Come on.

317
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,455
We still got a ways to go before we get to arun.

318
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,036
The sun's starting to go down.

319
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,519
Okay, I'm coming!

320
00:20:58,544 --> 00:20:59,372
Wait up!

321
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,618
8, 1, 1...

322
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,224
