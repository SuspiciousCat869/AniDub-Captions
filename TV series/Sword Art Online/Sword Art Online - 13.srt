1
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:25,947
You catch anything?

2
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:33,557
Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that.

3
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:43,875
My name's Nishida, and I'm a
fisherman... in the game, anyway.

4
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:49,541
Back in Japan, I was the head of network security
for a company called Toto high-speed Internet.

5
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:50,882
I'm Kirito.

6
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,043
Wait.

7
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,640
Wasn't Toto the company that... yup.

8
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:58,512
We were the folks in charge of
network security for this game.

9
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:04,660
It's a big one!

10
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:05,375
Yeah!

11
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:07,391
But I've caught bigger!

12
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:10,808
Whoa!

13
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:13,360
Awesome!

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,432
Thanks.

15
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,166
I'm good at catching 'em, but cooking 'em?

16
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,387
Yeah, not so good.

17
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:21,820
I'd love to make sashimi or a nice stew out of 'em.

18
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:24,943
But what's the point when I don't have any soy sauce?

19
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,135
I could go for fish baked with soy sauce
right now or with radishes and soy sauce, yeah.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,577
Hey, uh, if you want, I just might
be able to help you out with that.

21
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:37,431
Wait! Say whaaaaaaaaat?!

22
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,212
Ahh!

23
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,268
That was an amazing meal.

24
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:19,411
I had no idea you could get soy sauce in this world.

25
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,971
Actually, I made it myself.

26
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,036
If you want, you can take some home with you.

27
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:24,798
Really?

28
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:28,271
Ma'am, my taste buds bow down before you!

29
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,759
Glad you liked it. By the way,
how high is your fishing skill?

30
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,622
I'm asking because Kirito hasn't
been able to catch anything yet.

31
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:43,168
Yeah, well, maybe if all the
lakes on this floor weren't so hard.

32
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,146
Well, actually, that's not true.

33
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:50,690
As far as fishing goes, the only lake that's tough
to catch anything in is the big one you were at today.

34
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:51,389
What?!

35
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:54,331
Why would someone design it like that?

36
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:56,119
Yes! Good question!

37
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,557
That lake is the home of...

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,427
The king of all fish.

39
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,554
Seriously?

40
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:08,178
Yup. We're old pals. I've had him on
the end of my hook quite a few times.

41
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,452
But he's so strong, he yanks the
pole right out of my hands every time.

42
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,474
I was wondering...

43
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,738
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

44
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:30,312
I don't mind helping the old guy out, but how am
I supposed to do a switch move with a fishing pole?

45
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:33,014
You're the only one I know who can figure it out.

46
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:38,791
What if you catch it?

47
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:39,920
Will you keep it?

48
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,795
Is that even possible?

49
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:50,167
He is pretty cool, though, don't you think?

50
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,640
When you both showed up, I was like, "who is this person?"

51
00:04:56,549 --> 00:05:00,612
Isn't it funny how people are
living normal lives in this world?

52
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:07,400
And since we're the ones on the front lines, their lives
have sort of become our responsibility, haven't they?

53
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:13,066
For me, I wasn't getting stronger for anyone else.

54
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,609
It was just about me staying alive.

55
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,838
Everyone expects great things from you now.

56
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:24,800
And guess what. So do I.

57
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,238
Talk about pressure, huh?

58
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:30,766
Yeah.

59
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:32,839
I promised I'd save everyone.

60
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:35,288
Hell of a thing to live up to.

61
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:38,957
Oh, well.

62
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,905
They'll understand if you take tonight off.

63
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,230
Yeah.

64
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,181
Oh, my god.

65
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,248
Can you believe all the people who showed up?

66
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,331
Well, here we go!

67
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,469
Thanks for your Patience, everyone.

68
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:05,424
Here comes today's main event!

69
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:06,686
It's about time!

70
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,055
Kirito, let's catch us a fish.

71
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,047
Yeah. Hmm?

72
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:15,697
How big's this thing supposed to be, anyway?

73
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,524
Okay, here goes nothin'!

74
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,111
Um, shouldn't you reel it in?

75
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,140
No, not yet.

76
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,374
Uh, Nishida?

77
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,432
Hang on. Not yet.

78
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,294
Now! I got the sucker!

79
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:57,058
Here!

80
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,855
Uh, switch?

81
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,895
Come here, you bastard!

82
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:11,740
Look! It's coming up!

83
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,862
I think I tired him out.

84
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,277
W-Where you goin'?! Hey!

85
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:26,515
Aah!

86
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:31,513
No! No! No! No!

87
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,174
Kirito!

88
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,138
Look out!

89
00:07:36,553 --> 00:07:37,894
For what?

90
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,574
Aaaaah!

91
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:54,085
You ran away! You left me there to die!

92
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,247
Here it comes!

93
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,363
Whoa. It can run?

94
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:02,213
It's like a crazy lungfish.

95
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:05,647
Kirito! This is serious! That thing's comin' for us!

96
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,149
Hurry! Do something!

97
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:08,921
Yeah, I'm still thinking.

98
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,415
Guess I'll take care of this.

99
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,421
Run while you still can!

100
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,016
Nah, she'll be fine.

101
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,163
Save your wife, Kirito!

102
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,261
No! Watch out!

103
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:37,609
Wow.

104
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,303
That was badass!

105
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:41,843
You're Asuna, right?

106
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,096
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,513
Man, this is awesome!

108
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,021
I'm a big fan of yours!

109
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,484
Can I shake your hand?

110
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,583
Nice job, honey.

111
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,548
Heathcliff?

112
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,742
Come on, you've moped long enough already.

113
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:06,956
I know.

114
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:08,952
But it's only been two weeks.

115
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,123
If he needs us on the front lines,
then something must've happened.

116
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:14,117
Why else would he interrupt our vacation?

117
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,840
Yeah, but still...

118
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:19,217
Let's at least hear what he's got to say.

119
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,300
Come on. Time to go.

120
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:30,246
We'll take care of this, then come back.

121
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,357
You got it.

122
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:36,317
Thanks for seeing us off.

123
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,970
I know we didn't get to spend
much time together, but it was fun.

124
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,682
Oh, well, it was an honor and a privilege.

125
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:49,742
Actually, before I met the two of you, I couldn't imagine
what the folks working to clear the game were like.

126
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,499
You might as well have been from another planet.

127
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,463
Being trapped in here for the past two years...

128
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:59,364
...even if I made it out alive,

129
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:03,072
I don't know if I can go back to my old job, my old life.

130
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,493
Maybe deep down inside, I've
given up hope of ever gettin' out.

131
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:12,899
I figured spending my time with a fishing
pole between my mitts was the best thing for me.

132
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,472
Pretty sad, huh?

133
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:15,631
Unh-unh.

134
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,524
That isn't sad. I get what you mean.

135
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,759
I used to feel the same as you... at first, anyway.

136
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,049
I felt lost and hopeless.

137
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:27,694
Every night, I'd cry myself to sleep.

138
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:32,689
It felt like each day that went by in
here was another day lost from my real life.

139
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:38,610
So I'd cry, and afterwards, I'd
go and fight as hard as I could.

140
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:42,901
All I cared about was winning, getting
stronger, and getting to the next floor.

141
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:48,413
But then, I was walking along and I
saw someone taking a nap in the shade.

142
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,384
I was so mad.

143
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:53,348
I told him he shouldn't waste his time like that.

144
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,774
And then he said... and I'll

145
00:10:55,828 --> 00:11:00,691
never forget it... "this is Aincrad's best season,
and today's weather is at its optimal setting!"

146
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:04,479
He said it'd be a waste to go into
some dungeon on such a beautiful day.

147
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:08,047
So I tried lying down, too, and you know what?

148
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:09,515
I slept like a baby.

149
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:14,418
When I woke up, it was evening and
he was giving me the weirdest look.

150
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,709
Anyway, we formed our own party.

151
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,869
And that's when I realized something.

152
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,865
Even in a world like this, <i>he</i>

153
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:24,738
was really living.

154
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,693
He wasn't losing a day in the real world.

155
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,481
He was gaining a day <i>here.</i>

156
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,229
I learned so much from him.

157
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,485
And by "him," I mean Kirito.

158
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:41,307
When I thought about him before falling
asleep, I noticed I wouldn't have nightmares.

159
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:44,293
I began looking forward to seeing him again.

160
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:47,625
It was like, for the first time,

161
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,523
I was glad I was here.

162
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,780
Kirito is everything to me.

163
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:56,529
He's what the last two years were about.

164
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,635
He's proof I'm alive.

165
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:02,838
Why'd I put on the nervegear that day?

166
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:06,557
It's obvious. So I could come here and meet him.

167
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,273
You're still alive, right?

168
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,920
You must have something to live for, too.

169
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,278
Yeah, you're right.

170
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,717
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

171
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,308
Life isn't so bad here.

172
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:22,375
No, it's actually pretty damn good.

173
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,596
I wish there was something I could
do to help, but well, there it is.

174
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,280
Good luck and be safe.

175
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,328
Don't worry.

176
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:32,973
We'll go fishing again.

177
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:34,817
Take care, okay?

178
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,281
Teleport... Grandzam.

179
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,355
The recon team was wiped out?

180
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,849
They were scouting for the upcoming boss fight.

181
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:02,504
It was a party of 20 members,
taken from five different guilds.

182
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:05,689
10 of them reached the center of the room...

183
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,479
Then the boss appeared.

184
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:12,215
And that's when the entrance closed,
cutting them off from the rest of the party.

185
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:16,514
They walked into an anti-crystal zone.

186
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:21,479
Precisely. And it couldn't have been more than
five minutes or so when the door finally opened.

187
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,531
The room was empty.

188
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:29,179
There wasn't any trace left behind
of the 10 soldiers or the boss.

189
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:30,281
You're kidding!

190
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:34,150
Now more than ever, clearing the game
should be everyone's number-one priority.

191
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:37,782
We're going to launch an attack
with the largest group we can assemble.

192
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:39,793
You can count on us to fight with you.

193
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,501
But this needs to be clear.

194
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,519
Asuna's safety is my priority.

195
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:48,198
If things start to get hairy
in there, I'm gonna protect <i>her.</i>

196
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:49,875
That's not negotiable.

197
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:53,966
A person with something to
protect is a strong ally to have.

198
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:56,673
I'm expecting a good fight from you.

199
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:03,066
Three more hours of waiting.

200
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,099
What should we do?

201
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,383
What's wrong with you?

202
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,458
There's something I have to ask you.

203
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,809
But I don't want you getting mad at me.

204
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,645
Instead of going to the boss
fight, could you please stay here?

205
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,289
Why would you ask that?

206
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:29,502
We won't be able to use teleport crystals,
so there's no telling what could happen.

207
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,799
I'm scared.

208
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,786
If anything happened to you, I...

209
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:36,923
So you want to go to someplace dangerous... Alone.

210
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,976
And you expect me to stay here, where it's safe?

211
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,942
You know what would happen if you didn't come back, huh?

212
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,961
I'd kill myself!

213
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:54,951
I'd never forgive myself for staying
behind, so what would be the point in living?

214
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,422
I'm sorry!

215
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,568
I guess I'm losing my nerve.

216
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:03,055
All I want to do is run away with you.

217
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,393
I don't care if we never make it back to the real world.

218
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:10,166
I just want to live with you
in our little house in the woods.

219
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:16,752
It'd be nice if we could do
that... be together every day forever.

220
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,099
Have you ever thought about
what's happening in the real world?

221
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:25,221
About what's happening to our bodies while we're in here?

222
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:30,730
A few weeks after the game was
launched, do you remember what happened?

223
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,293
Most of the players suddenly went
offline and stayed that way for a few hours.

224
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:37,495
My guess is that's when all the

225
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,220
players' bodies were being moved
to hospitals in the real world.

226
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:45,845
If that's where we all are right now, in hospitals,

227
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:51,264
barely being kept alive by machines, it's hard to
believe we're gonna survive like that for much longer.

228
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:57,032
So that means it doesn't matter
whether we clear the game or not anymore.

229
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,241
Everyone here's on a time limit.

230
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,122
And once that's up...

231
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:10,053
I-I want to... to stay with you forever!

232
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:14,932
I want us to go on real dates

233
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,028
and to really get married

234
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:19,643
and for us to grow old together!

235
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,030
That's why... that's why...

236
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,637
We don't have a choice.

237
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,750
We have to keep fighting.

238
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:43,030
Whoa.

239
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,331
Hey!

240
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:56,458
No way.

241
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,173
You guys are coming, too?

242
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,354
That's the best you got, "no way"?

243
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,422
Hey, man, I shut my shop down to
come out here and help get this done.

244
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:08,101
Brother, you're lookin' at a player
who's about as philanthropic as they come.

245
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,422
Then seeing as how you're so philanthropic, you're
not gonna mind if we take you off the drop list.

246
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,066
Hey, now!

247
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,464
Let's not be too hasty, man!

248
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:18,897
Hmm?

249
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,977
Corridor... open.

250
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,621
Well, here we go.

251
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,426
Feel that?

252
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,149
There's a bad vibe in here.

253
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,133
Yeah.

254
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:00,551
Everyone ready?

255
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,072
The knights of the blood oath will be out in front,

256
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,494
distracting the boss and blocking its attacks.

257
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:13,006
In the meantime, the rest of you have to stay
sharp and try to figure out its attack patterns.

258
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:14,907
I won't lie.

259
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,446
This battle will be hard.

260
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:19,362
But I have faith that we can and <i>will</i> prevail.

261
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,981
For our day of liberation!

262
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,650
Everything's gonna be fine.

263
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:41,778
I won't let anything happen to you... promise.

264
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,289
Make sure you protect me, too, okay?

265
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:45,733
Yeah.

266
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,337
You know I will.

267
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,020
Don't die, guys.

268
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,775
Same to you, buddy.

269
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,407
I'm gonna make a fortune off today's drops.

270
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:01,248
No way am I missin' out on that!

271
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:06,213
Forward to battle!

272
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:31,981
Nothing's happening.

273
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,821
Where is it?

274
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:40,768
Up there!

275
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:46,985
It's the skull...

276
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,059
Reaper!

277
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,643
Stay away from it!

278
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:53,591
Spread out!

279
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:56,228
This way!

280
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:57,894
Hurry! Run!

281
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:04,682
Ugh!

282
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:12,850
That was one hit!

283
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,017
Man, we are so dead!

284
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,670
Aah!

285
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:38,560
We can't even get in close enough to hit the damn thing!

286
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,688
Aah!

287
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:41,435
Look out!

288
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,020
It's too strong!

289
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:54,137
If we block it together, we have a chance.

290
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:56,625
Come on, we can do this.

291
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,380
Okay.

292
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,360
Me and Asuna will deal with the scythes!

293
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,980
Everyone else, flank it and attack!

294
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:05,982
You heard the man!

295
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,280
Okay!

296
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:08,978
Aaah!

297
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,300
Hold still, baby!

298
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,123
Damn you!

299
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:32,497
Ready, Kirito?

300
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,013
Yeah!

301
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,889
Next time: "The End of the World".
