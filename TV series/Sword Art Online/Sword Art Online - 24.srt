1
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:04,984
Hey, Yui, see if this will work.

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,446
I'm transferring the code.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,860
We're gonna teleport! Daddy, give me your hand!

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:19,763
Daddy.

5
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,326
Daddy!

6
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,769
Yui. Where are we?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,009
I don't know.

8
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:28,265
There's no mapping data available.

9
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,856
Then do you know where Asuna is?

10
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:31,555
Yes.

11
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:35,352
She's close... very close, in fact.

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:37,921
This way!

13
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:08,395
Is this it?

14
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:10,971
Is this the top of the world tree?

15
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,990
There's supposed to be a floating city up here.

16
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,113
There was never any grand quest.

17
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,988
The whole damn thing was a lie.

18
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:22,768
He's gonna pay for this.

19
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:25,984
Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:28,480
We've got to get Asuna out of here first, right?

21
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:29,385
Mm-hmm.

22
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,036
Mommy!

23
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,253
Mommy!

24
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:51,511
Mommy!

25
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,015
Yui!

26
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:56,509
Mommy!

27
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:57,750
Yui!

28
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,477
Mommy! Mommy!

29
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,078
Kirito.

30
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,644
Asuna.

31
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:28,033
Hey. Sorry I took so long.

32
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:33,363
Mnh-mnh. No, it's okay, really.
I always knew you'd save me.

33
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:41,094
Well... ready to go home?

34
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:42,207
Mm-hmm.

35
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:47,277
Hey, Yui, can you log Asuna out from here?

36
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,562
Unh-unh.

37
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:52,518
Her status is locked by complicated
codes that I don't have access to.

38
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,378
We'll need to find a system console to bypass them.

39
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,484
I found a console in the laboratory.

40
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,468
I can...

41
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:02,521
what's that?

42
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:11,160
Yui, what's happening?!

43
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:17,140
Daddy! Mommy! Be careful!

44
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,906
Something... something bad's coming!

45
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:22,567
Yui!

46
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,256
Asuna.

47
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:40,133
What a surprise.

48
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:45,272
The last thing I expected to find was
a cockroach in my little bird's cage.

49
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,765
You got to be kidding!

50
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,114
It's Sugou!

51
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:50,708
Mnh-mnh.

52
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:53,694
I'd prefer it if you didn't
call me that name in this world.

53
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,888
You should address me as his
highness, the fairy king, oberon!

54
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:00,096
Kirito!

55
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:02,084
How do you like it?

56
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,095
Want to know why you can't move?

57
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:08,027
It's a little something called "gravity
magic," coming out in the next update.

58
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,237
You think the players will go for it?

59
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:12,524
Leave him alone, you coward!

60
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:14,826
Tell me something, Kirigaya,

61
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:18,062
or should I call you "Kirito" instead?

62
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:21,630
How did you manage to get all the way up here?

63
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:24,450
I saw a strange program running.

64
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,388
Is that how?

65
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,929
I flew up here with my wings.

66
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:31,156
Ha! Suit yourself.

67
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:36,136
If you don't want to tell me, that's
fine. I'll just go ask your mind instead.

68
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:36,971
What?

69
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:43,923
Oh, please. You don't really think I went to all that
trouble setting this whole thing up just for fun, did you?

70
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:51,407
I have 300 former players of S.A.O. under my
thumb, and now, thanks to their dedicated cooperation,

71
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,077
the technology I developed for total
control of emotions and thought is 80% complete.

72
00:06:57,713 --> 00:07:03,797
I'm about to achieve what no one else has... the
total control of the human soul, the power of a god!

73
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,206
It's so close, I can almost taste it!

74
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:09,528
Seriously, thank god for virtual reality, huh?

75
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,407
Sugou!

76
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:17,338
You're never gonna get away with this, you hear?!

77
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,608
You monster!

78
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:21,374
Ah, who do you think's going to stop me?

79
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:22,884
Oh, maybe a god.

80
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:27,032
But, sadly, there's none in
this world, except for yours truly!

81
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:34,482
I know... before I start tinkering with your
little souls, why don't we have ourselves a little fun?!

82
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,396
You bastard!

83
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:46,917
Leave her alone!

84
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,587
Yes!

85
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:10,403
Ha ha! Great!

86
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:16,338
That's what I was hoping for! You can't
get NPC girls to make faces like that.

87
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:27,977
Ahh. You smell lovely. Figuring out how to replicate
the way you smell in real life was a challenge.

88
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:34,904
And don't even get me started on how hard it was to
get an analyzer into your hospital room undetected.

89
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,344
Get away from her, Sugou!

90
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,661
Give me a break.

91
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:48,713
Why don't you stay down and
grovel like a good little doggy?

92
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,273
Ohh!

93
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,696
Kirito!

94
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,896
System command, change the pain
absorber from level 10 to level 8.

95
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,376
Aaah!

96
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:09,435
Hurts, doesn't it?

97
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:13,279
I'll increase the pain gradually to
give you something to look forward to.

98
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:19,323
By the way, once it drops below level 3,
it'll start affecting your body in the real world.

99
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:21,722
As for you...

100
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:29,001
Stop it, Sugou!

101
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,091
It's okay, Kirito.

102
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,278
Whatever he does, he's not really hurting me.

103
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,786
I was hoping you'd say that,

104
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:42,676
but I wonder how long your pride's
going to last... 30 minutes, an hour?

105
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,434
Why don't we see how long you can hang on to it?!

106
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:07,329
Now that that's out of the way, would
you like to know what I'm thinking?

107
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:13,127
Once we've had our fun here, I'm
going to pay you a visit at the hospital.

108
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:17,401
I'll set up a big monitor and
play back a recording of this,

109
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:20,586
and we can enjoy ourselves all over again

110
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:24,875
but this time, with your real body.

111
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:40,831
Ah. Yummy. How sweet.

112
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:44,186
Sugou, you bastard!

113
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,799
You bastard!

114
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,195
Mmm!

115
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,609
I'll kill you!

116
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:56,634
You hear?!

117
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,827
I'm gonna kill you!

118
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,413
Why is this happening?

119
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:19,271
Am I being punished for thinking I was some kind of hero,

120
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:23,386
for thinking I was the only one who could save Asuna,

121
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,121
for thinking I was strong enough, even though I'm not?

122
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,509
Are you giving up?

123
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,762
Are you giving up?

124
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:41,333
No.

125
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,722
I'm facing reality.

126
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:48,544
Then you aregiving up... to the
power of a system you once defied.

127
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,111
What choice do I have?

128
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,863
I'm just a player, and he's the G.M.

129
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,644
Then our battle was, what, a joke?

130
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:04,469
Do you remember how you showed me the power
of the human will was superior to the system,

131
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:07,218
how you showed me the possibilities of the future?

132
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:08,408
You're...

133
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,414
Get up, Kirito.

134
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:13,652
Get up!

135
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:26,421
Ahh.

136
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,615
Your attacks are weak.

137
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,429
The blades in S.A.O. hit way harder!

138
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:37,225
And they hurt way more!

139
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,100
Unbelievable.

140
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,888
I've got a few bugs left to deal with.

141
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,181
Yah!

142
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,551
System log-in.

143
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,978
I.D. Heathcliff.

144
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:56,827
Wh-what?

145
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:58,876
Whose I.D. Are you using?!

146
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,260
System command,

147
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:02,602
enable administrator privileges.

148
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,114
Set I.D. Oberon to level 1.

149
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,334
An I.D. That outranks mine?

150
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,135
That's impossible!

151
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:13,614
This is my world! I'm the creator!

152
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,173
I'm its ruler, its king, its god!

153
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,596
No, I don't think so.

154
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:22,647
You stole everything in this world...
everything... including its people.

155
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:27,161
You're nothing but a king of thieves,
sitting alone on your stolen throne!

156
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:29,026
You little punk.

157
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:32,767
You dare... you dare talk to me like that?!

158
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:38,393
System command, generate object! I.D. Excalibur!

159
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:42,885
Do as I say, you piece of crap!

160
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:46,260
System, your god is ordering you to comply!

161
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:50,541
Think you can wait a little bit
longer? This will only take a sec.

162
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,280
Mm-hmm.

163
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:59,445
System command, generate object! I.D. Excalibur!

164
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,353
A simple command summons a legendary weapon.

165
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:05,162
Who knew?

166
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,259
Huh! Uh!

167
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:09,379
Huh?

168
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,404
It's time to settle the score...

169
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:20,200
the king of thieves versus the gilded hero!

170
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,683
System command, set pain absorber to zero!

171
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,469
No, not that!

172
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,008
Did you just flinch?

173
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:32,698
'Cause the other guy never
flinched, no matter how bad things got.

174
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:35,471
You know him... Akihiko Kayaba!

175
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:38,618
Oh, my god! Kayaba?!

176
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:39,887
Oh, I get it.

177
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,256
That was his I.D.

178
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:42,462
Why?

179
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,204
You're supposed to be dead!

180
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,365
Why are you still getting in my way?!

181
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,438
You are always doing this,

182
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:53,861
acting all high and mighty, like some big
shot, taking everything that was rightfully mine!

183
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,984
Sugou, in a way, I get where you're coming from.

184
00:14:57,228 --> 00:15:00,742
I lost to him, too, and then I had to go work for him.

185
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:07,645
But whatever happened, I never
wanted to be him, unlike you.

186
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:09,075
Damn you!

187
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,664
God damn you!

188
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,929
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

189
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:24,933
Aaaaaah!

190
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:25,987
Aah! Aah!

191
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,785
Hurts, doesn't it?

192
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:34,149
But it's nothing like the pain you
made Asuna feel... not even close!

193
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,167
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

194
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:41,437
My hand!

195
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,682
My hand! My hand!

196
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:51,616
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

197
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,954
I had faith in you.

198
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:39,552
I have faith in you.

199
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,039
Always have, always will.

200
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,932
And I know you'll always save me

201
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:47,011
because you are my hero.

202
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:50,687
I-I don't have any power.

203
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:52,877
I'm not a hero.

204
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:00,879
But, I-I'll do my best to be one.

205
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:01,966
Mm-hmm.

206
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:06,240
Come on. Let's go home.

207
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:14,925
It's got to be nighttime already back there,
but I'll see you at the hospital as soon as I can.

208
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:16,750
I'll be waiting for you.

209
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,985
I want you to be the first person I see when I wake up.

210
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,568
It's finally over, isn't it?

211
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:28,398
We're going home... back to the real world.

212
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:30,329
That's right.

213
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,960
But a lot's changed, so try not to freak out.

214
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:38,744
Let's go places and do fun things, just the two of us.

215
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:39,672
Sound good?

216
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,458
Yeah... real good.

217
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:10,580
That's it.

218
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:12,223
Game over.

219
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:14,272
Or is it?

220
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,507
What do you think, Heathcliff?

221
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,852
Good to see you again, Kirito.

222
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,743
So, you arealive.

223
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,730
You could say I'm alive, in a way.

224
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:34,163
Ultimately, I'm the afterimage of the
mind that was Akihiko Kayaba... an echo.

225
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:38,026
And, as usual, I have no idea what you're talking about.

226
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,061
I guess I should thank you, though.

227
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,436
That's not necessary.

228
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:43,589
What do you mean?

229
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:47,283
We're not exactly friends, so we
shouldn't expect favors from each other.

230
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,563
There's always a price... always.

231
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,843
Okay. What do you want me to do?

232
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:03,365
What's this?

233
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:05,113
The beginnings of a new world.

234
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,755
I call it "the seed."

235
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,046
Once it sprouts, you'll know what it is.

236
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,239
What you do with it is up to you.

237
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,518
You can even delete it if you want.

238
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:22,032
However, if you still have a tiny bit of fondness
left for the virtual world, you'll take care of it.

239
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,490
I should get going now.

240
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:29,342
I do hope we meet again, Kirito.

241
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,139
Yui! Are you okay?!

242
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,052
Where are you?!

243
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,396
Daddy!

244
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,205
Thank god.

245
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,438
You're safe.

246
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:45,509
Uh-huh.

247
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:48,982
I hid myself inside the local
memory of your nervegear rig.

248
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:50,625
Where's mommy?

249
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,292
Don't worry. She's safe.

250
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,127
She's back home now.

251
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,350
Mommy's back?!

252
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:57,388
Thank goodness!

253
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,065
I'm so happy...

254
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,058
really!

255
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:06,921
I promise we'll be back to visit soon, although I
don't know how much longer this world's gonna be around.

256
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:12,737
It doesn't matter because my core program's inside
your nervegear now, so we'll always be together.

257
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:14,578
All right.

258
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,713
I'd better head out.

259
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,185
I'm gonna go see mommy.

260
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:18,830
Okay, daddy.

261
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:20,640
I-I love you!

262
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,567
Aah!

263
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,132
I-I'm sorry!

264
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:51,398
When you didn't log out right
away, I got worried, and then I...

265
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,974
sorry I took so long to come back.

266
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:57,310
Is it really over now?

267
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,439
Yeah, it is.

268
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,058
It's all over.

269
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,575
That's awesome!

270
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,418
Hey, Sugu, thank you for all the help you gave me.

271
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,500
I couldn't have done it on my own.

272
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,923
You're the reason I was able to finish it.

273
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:15,885
No.

274
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:18,784
Ugh!

275
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,241
You don't have to thank me for a thing.

276
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,929
I'm just happy I got the chance
to help my big brother in his world.

277
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,842
What happened with Asuna?

278
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:37,495
Did you get her back?

279
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:39,338
Uh-huh, finally.

280
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,809
She's back in the real world.

281
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,457
Sugu, I, uh...

282
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,255
Unh-unh. You get going.

283
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:49,348
She's got to be wondering where you're at by now.

284
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,501
Ohh. It's cold.

285
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,813
Look... snow.

286
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,360
Be careful out there and say Hi to Asuna for me.

287
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:08,131
You got it.

288
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,635
I can't wait for you guys to meet for real!

289
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,008
Next time: "The World Seed".
