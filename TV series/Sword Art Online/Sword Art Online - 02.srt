1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,461
Since the game began,

2
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:18,567
a whole month has gone by, and
2,000 people have died so far.

3
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:23,516
After all this time, none of the
players have been able to clear floor 1.

4
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,610
I used to be a beta tester, and even I
haven't found out where the boss's lair is.

5
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:39,390
And today, finally, we're having a meeting to
figure out how to find and defeat the floor 1 boss.

6
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:18,784
Okay, people.

7
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,342
Now that everyone's here, let's get this meeting started.

8
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:26,282
So, anyway, I want to thank everyone for coming.

9
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,379
Good to see you.

10
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:32,169
My name is Diabel, and in this
game, the job I rolled is knight.

11
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,029
Dude, there's no job system in this game.

12
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:35,583
Knight.

13
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,422
You guys want to hear this or not?

14
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:40,662
Right.

15
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,302
Anyway, here's the deal... our party found
the boss room at the top of the tower today.

16
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,512
First, we need to defeat the boss and make it to floor 2.

17
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:55,225
The next step is we have to tell
everyone waiting in the town of beginnings

18
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,465
that it is possible to beat this game.

19
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,478
Fact is, it's our duty as the most capable players here.

20
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:03,581
Do you agree or not?

21
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:07,476
Mm-hmm.

22
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,277
Okay.

23
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,336
Glad to hear you're all with me on this.

24
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,172
Now let's figure out how we're gonna beat the boss.

25
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:23,523
First off, we'll team up into parties of six.

26
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:27,908
A typical party doesn't stand
a chance against a floor boss.

27
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:31,040
We need a raid group made up of multiple parties.

28
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:42,680
You got left out, too, huh?

29
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:46,397
Not even. I wasn't left out.

30
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,273
It's just everyone seems like they're already friends.

31
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,864
So, you're solo, too?

32
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,651
You want to form a party with me?

33
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,027
You heard what the guy just said.

34
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,657
We can't beat the boss on our own.

35
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,613
And it would only be for this fight.

36
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:17,719
All right!

37
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,618
Looks like everyone's teamed up.

38
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:20,563
Now, then...

39
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:21,740
Hold up a sec!

40
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:31,557
My name's Kebaou. Got that?

41
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:35,229
Before we take on the boss, I
want to get something off my chest.

42
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:39,177
We all know about the 2,000
people who've died so far, yeah?

43
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:42,363
Well, some of you need to apologize to 'em right now!

44
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:48,907
Kebaou, I think I know who you're referring to.

45
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,998
You mean the ones who are ex-beta testers, right?

46
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,453
'Course I mean them!

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,157
The day this stupid-ass game started,
the beta guys just up and vanished, right?!

48
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,040
They ditched all us beginners!

49
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,758
They snagged all the good hunting spots,
and they grabbed all the easy quests, too.

50
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,412
They were the only ones getting stronger in here.

51
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:10,003
This whole time, they've ignored us like we're nothing.

52
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,324
Hell, I bet there's some of them here!

53
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,367
Come on out, beta testers!

54
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,983
We should make them apologize to us, and we should
make them all give up their money and the items they got.

55
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:24,510
They can't expect the party to
trust them when they don't trust us.

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,883
Why should we?!

57
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:31,931
Can I say something?

58
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,108
Hey. My name's Agil.

59
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,302
Kebaou, right?

60
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,658
I want to make sure I'm on the same page.

61
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,933
You say the ex-beta testers should be blamed for
the rookies' deaths because they didn't help them

62
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,208
and you want them to apologize and give up their winnings.

63
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,829
I leave anything out?

64
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,528
No. You didn't.

65
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,405
The item store hands these out for free.

66
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,868
It's a guide book.

67
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,187
You got one, didn't you?

68
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,245
Sure, I got one.

69
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,675
So, what about it?

70
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,487
You know who was handing these out?

71
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,520
The ex-beta testers.

72
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:13,508
Listen up.

73
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:16,123
Everyone had equal access to this information.

74
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,601
Even so, lots of players still died.

75
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,221
Now, I didn't come here to point fingers at anyone.

76
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:23,900
I'm here 'cause I want to
learn from those players' deaths.

77
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,999
I'm here because I want to find
out how we're gonna beat the boss.

78
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:39,496
Okay.

79
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,942
Can we get back to the meeting now?

80
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:49,338
For info on the boss, it's all in here... the
latest issue of the guide book you just heard about.

81
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,227
Huh?

82
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:54,916
According to the book, the boss's
name is illfang the kobold lord.

83
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:59,141
Also, he'll be surrounded by his
minions, the ruin kobold sentinels.

84
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,224
Illfang carries an ax and a buckler.

85
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:09,414
He has four health bars, and when the last one turns red,
he switches to a curved sword-type weapon called a tulwar.

86
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,925
He can change his patterns of attack, too.

87
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,340
That's it for the briefing.

88
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,745
As for the distribution of loot,

89
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:25,551
money will be divided equally among everyone.

90
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:31,509
The party that defeats the boss gets the
xp, and whoever gets an item gets to keep it.

91
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,518
Any objections?

92
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:37,961
Good!

93
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,464
We leave tomorrow at 10:00 in the morning.

94
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,513
Meeting adjourned, people!

95
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,676
Those are pretty good, aren't they?

96
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:23,629
Mind if I sit down?

97
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,198
You really think these taste good?

98
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:37,926
Uh-huh.

99
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,499
Since I came to this town, I
end up eating at least one a day.

100
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,936
'Course, I got a trick to make it taste better.

101
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,501
What trick?

102
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:49,990
Try it with some of that.

103
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,550
Cream.

104
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,864
I got it from "the heifer strikes back."

105
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:30,561
That's the quest in the village
before you get to this one.

106
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,645
You want to know how I did it?

107
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:33,679
Mnh-mnh.

108
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,954
I appreciate the offer, but I didn't
come to this town to eat good food.

109
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:40,168
Okay.

110
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,281
Why are you here?

111
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:44,603
So I don't lose sight of who I am.

112
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:49,811
I don't want to lock myself in a room in
the town of beginnings and slowly rot away.

113
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,868
I'd rather stay the way I am till the last moment...

114
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,158
Even if a monster beats me and I die.

115
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:03,043
I won't lose... to this game
or this world, no matter what.

116
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:13,856
I wouldn't want a party member dying
on me, so try not to die tomorrow.

117
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,576
Let's go over it again.

118
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:25,765
We're the backup, so our target's
gonna be the boss's minions,

119
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,877
the ruin kobold sentinels.

120
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:29,107
I know.

121
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:33,117
I'll use a sword skill to knock
their weapons up and out of the way.

122
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,730
When I do, switch and jump in.

123
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:37,843
What's a switch?

124
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,892
Okay, level with me.

125
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,269
Is this the first time you've ever been in a party?

126
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:43,277
Uh-huh.

127
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:04,055
Listen up, everyone. I've only got
one thing to say to you... let's win!

128
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:06,580
Come on!

129
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,804
Commence attack!

130
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:54,202
Squads "a" and "c," switch in!

131
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,849
Here it comes! Squad "b," block!

132
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,249
Squad "c," keep guarding and prepare to switch.

133
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,667
Everyone else, when you fall back, regroup and flank them.

134
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:09,726
Squads "d," "e," and "f," keep those minions off us!

135
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:10,743
Yeah, you got it!

136
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:13,262
Switch!

137
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,169
I'm on it!

138
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:19,664
I thought she was a beginner, but she's got good skills.

139
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,454
I can't even see the tip of her sword.

140
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:27,927
Right on.

141
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,812
Looks like the guide book was right.

142
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:47,918
Stand back!

143
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:48,449
Huh?

144
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,814
I got it!

145
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:54,652
I thought the plan was for
everyone in the group to surround it.

146
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:10,199
That's not a tulwar. It's a
nodachi! This isn't like the beta!

147
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,564
Wait! Stop!

148
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:13,030
Huh?

149
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:15,343
It's no good! Get out of there!

150
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,475
Aaah!

151
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:25,853
Diabel, no!

152
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:31,438
Diabel!

153
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:37,275
What the hell were you thinking?

154
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,513
You know...You were a beta tester, too, weren't you?

155
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,382
You were after the last attack bonus... the rare item.

156
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,700
You're just like me... a beta tester.

157
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:05,410
Please, you have to...Defeat the boss...

158
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,929
For everyone here.

159
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:20,790
When this death game started, the only thing
I thought about was how I was gonna survive.

160
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:22,356
Nothing else mattered.

161
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:25,032
Take care.

162
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,383
I'll be seeing you, Klein.

163
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,323
But you weren't like that,

164
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:30,086
Diabel.

165
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,812
You never abandoned the other players.

166
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,336
You brought them together.

167
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,911
You led everyone, and you fought brilliantly.

168
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,097
You tried to accomplish something I couldn't.

169
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,088
I'll go, too.

170
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:52,796
Okay.

171
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,142
We'll hit 'em just like we did the minions.

172
00:14:58,451 --> 00:14:59,397
You got it.

173
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,182
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

174
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:09,229
Switch!

175
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,562
Asuna!

176
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,827
Hyah!

177
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:33,983
He's coming back!

178
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,651
Yah! Ugh! Ugh!

179
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:46,233
Oh, no.

180
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:48,251
Aah!

181
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:11,490
We can hold this bastard off until your health's back up.

182
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,222
You got it.

183
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:24,687
Watch out!

184
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:30,644
You're going down!

185
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:38,637
Come on, Asuna! Help me beat this sucker! One last attack!

186
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:39,637
You got it!

187
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:57,092
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

188
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:12,459
Uh...

189
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,312
Yeah!

190
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:18,848
That's what I'm talking about!

191
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,289
Come on, baby!

192
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,028
Whoo! Yes! Come on!

193
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,210
They ain't got nothin' on us!

194
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,366
Nice job.

195
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,440
That was some fine swordsmanship.

196
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,852
Congratulations.

197
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,205
Today's victory is all thanks to you.

198
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:43,324
No.

199
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,177
Yeah! You rock, man!

200
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,273
Stop cheering!

201
00:17:57,655 --> 00:17:58,855
Why'd you do it, huh?

202
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:02,026
Why'd you let Diabel die?

203
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,378
Let him die?

204
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:04,908
Ugh!

205
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,498
That's what I said.

206
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,822
Admit it... you knew the technique the boss was gonna use.

207
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:11,665
You could've told us!

208
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,841
Then Diabel would've stood a chance.

209
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,889
He wouldn't have had to die!

210
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:23,065
I know why he knew!

211
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,710
He used to be a beta tester!

212
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:25,618
Think about it!

213
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,365
He knew the boss's attack patterns.

214
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:29,724
He knew, but he kept it from us!

215
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:34,180
And I bet he's not the only beta tester here.

216
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,127
Come on! Show yourselves!

217
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,770
This is bad.

218
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,325
At this rate...

219
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,838
... for everyone here.

220
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,254
Hey, calm down.

221
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:10,027
Hmm?

222
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,568
So, you guys think I used to be a beta tester.

223
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:24,479
It's not cool to put me in
the same class with those noobs.

224
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,625
W-What'd you say?!

225
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:33,306
You heard me. Most of the thousand people who
scored a slot in "S.A.O.'S" beta were rookies.

226
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:36,573
They were so green, they didn't even know how to level up.

227
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:39,955
Hell, even you guys are better than they were.

228
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,533
But me... I'm nothing like those guys, man.

229
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,317
During the beta, I made it to floors that
were higher than any of the other testers.

230
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,421
That's a fact.

231
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:59,967
I knew about the boss 'cause I fought tons of
monsters with way more sword skills on higher floors.

232
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:06,907
I know a bunch of other things, too... more
than you can imagine, more than any info broker.

233
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,555
Wh-what the hell?

234
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:12,862
If that's true, then you're worse than a beta tester.

235
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:14,500
You're a cheater!

236
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,636
That's what you are!

237
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,905
He's a beta tester and a cheater!

238
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:20,149
He's a beater!

239
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,334
A beater.

240
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,543
Yeah, that's good. I like it.

241
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:26,243
Okay.

242
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:28,284
You can call me a beater.

243
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:32,034
Just be sure you don't confuse
me with those beta testers anymore.

244
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,011
Wait.

245
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:58,475
When we were fighting the boss, you called me by my name.

246
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,453
I wasn't trying to be rude.

247
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,138
Did I mess up the pronunciation?

248
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,150
How'd you even know it?

249
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:10,528
If you look right about here, you'll
see another HP gauge under yours.

250
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,887
There's a name written right next to it, yeah?

251
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:17,775
Kirito.

252
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,308
Kirito?

253
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:21,659
Your name's Kirito.

254
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:22,928
Yeah.

255
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,007
I'm so dumb.

256
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,821
It was there the whole time, and I never knew.

257
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,365
You can become powerful here on your own,

258
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:39,726
but if the day comes when someone you trust
invites you to join a guild, don't turn it down,

259
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,969
'cause there are limits to what a solo player can do.

260
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,439
But you're solo.

261
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,570
Next time: "The Red-Nosed Reindeer".
