1
00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:05,857
But now, if this is how it is, I
wish you'd kept on being a jerk to me.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,106
If you had, I wouldn't have realized how I felt about you.

3
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:16,056
I wouldn't have felt sad and
jealous when I found out about her,

4
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:20,734
and I wouldn't have tried forgetting about
you and falling in love with Kirito instead!

5
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,113
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:36,411
Go on.

7
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:38,244
Leave me alone.

8
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,009
I remember the day when everything changed...

9
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:29,560
the day I found out I wasn't really part of this family.

10
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:35,696
It felt weird, like I didn't fit in with them anymore.

11
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,784
And I found this out when I was 10.

12
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,058
I'd wonder, "who is she?" And

13
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:54,030
"do I really know anything about her?"

14
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,213
Maybe that feeling I had of not fitting in
was the thing that drove me to online gaming.

15
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:07,606
I guess I figured in the virtual
world, no one knows anything about anyone,

16
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:11,518
so I dove right in and thought it was where I belonged.

17
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:17,262
But those two years I spent
trapped in S.A.O. taught me something.

18
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:22,108
The difference between a real
and a virtual world is slim at best.

19
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:26,063
It's a waste of time asking people who they really are.

20
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:30,593
All you can do is accept them
as is and have faith in them,

21
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:35,541
'cause, in the end, whoever you think
they are... that's who they really are.

22
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:43,587
When I got back to the real world and saw
Suguha's face, I was really, truly happy.

23
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:51,598
Right then and there, I swore I'd do whatever I
could to try to close the gap that had grown between us

24
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,934
over the last couple of years.

25
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:58,115
But how do I do that?

26
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:06,886
What can I do for Sugu?

27
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:14,924
Sugu, I'll wait for you in arun, on the north terrace.

28
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:32,684
How could I be so horrible to
you, and how could you be so strong?

29
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:36,680
I wish I could be as strong as you, big brother.

30
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:41,893
I told you to hang in there, to
not give up on the one you love,

31
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:43,879
but I can't do that.

32
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:47,470
And now I can't stop crying.

33
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,858
I guess this is how it is.

34
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:22,405
Leafa?

35
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:25,733
Uh, hi.

36
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,869
Y-You know, I've been looking all over for you.

37
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:28,622
Wait.

38
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,068
What are you doing here?

39
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:32,706
I thought the salamanders caught you.

40
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,430
Yeah. Well, I sort of poisoned them all and escaped.

41
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,955
No way. You poisoned them?

42
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:39,778
Big-time, and after I got away, I tracked you here.

43
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:40,635
Hang on.

44
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,008
What are you doing here alone?

45
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,103
Where's that Spriggan?

46
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:45,591
Oh, yeah. Well...

47
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,636
I kind of... Said something really mean to him.

48
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:54,616
It wasn't cool, and I shouldn't have said it.

49
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,664
It was... Pretty stupid of me.

50
00:05:58,615 --> 00:05:59,962
Oh, never mind.

51
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,605
I'm just being weird.

52
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:05,649
I'm not gonna be seeing him around anymore.

53
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:06,975
Come on.

54
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,500
Let's go back to Sylvain.

55
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,290
Don't cry like that.

56
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,444
Wait!

57
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,184
You shouldn't be crying like that!

58
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,131
Uh, sorry?

59
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:25,137
The Leafa I know is always smiling and happy,
and I... well, I'd never leave you like that!

60
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,722
I'd stay with you always, in here and in the real world!

61
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:34,250
I-I, uh... Leafa... I mean, Suguha... I love you!

62
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,434
You what?

63
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:40,098
Wait. Don't do that. No! What are you doing?!

64
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:41,384
Aaah!

65
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,060
Uh... oh.

66
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,482
Uh, are you okay?

67
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,059
Ohh, where did I go wrong?

68
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,843
After everything I've said and done, I thought all I
had to do was find the guts to confess my feelings to you.

69
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,543
You really are a moron, aren't you?

70
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:03,125
Huh?

71
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,967
Even so, I could learn a thing or two from you.

72
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:30,964
Hey.

73
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:32,607
Here I am.

74
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,251
Suguha...

75
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,803
Kazuto, I want a rematch.

76
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:39,433
Huh?

77
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,161
Let's finish what we started.

78
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,692
And this time, no holding back.

79
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:05,240
Now I know why he looked so composed.

80
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,046
Here I come!

81
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,246
What are you doing?

82
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,182
What are youdoing?

83
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,518
Mm.

84
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:18,094
Look...

85
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:23,964
I wanted to apologize, but I just
didn't know how to go about doing it...

86
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,125
So, I was gonna throw the duel.

87
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,457
You were?

88
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:34,947
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:46,180
I'm sorry, too. I think my problem is I never
really came back to the real world after S.A.O.,

90
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:53,529
and I can't come back until she wakes in
a way, the game hasn't ended for me yet.

91
00:09:54,709 --> 00:10:00,709
And I guess that's why I still haven't figured out
how I fit in at home or with you... not yet, anyway.

92
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:02,719
Mm.

93
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,154
And when you do, I'll be there.

94
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:09,931
It doesn't matter how long it takes. I'll be
waiting for the day you come back to us for real.

95
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:13,570
Until then... I'll help you in here.

96
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:25,513
So, uh... Wait.

97
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,049
What's going on again?

98
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,678
Three players are gonna raid the world tree today.

99
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:34,182
He's player 1, you're player 2, and yours truly makes 3.

100
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,152
Oh. Okay.

101
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,058
Wait. What?!

102
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,745
Yui, you there?

103
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:45,384
Hi, daddy. What is it?

104
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,474
I need some info on the guardians.

105
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:48,664
You learn anything?

106
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,025
The stats for one aren't very
high, but that's not the problem.

107
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:53,693
There's just too many of them.

108
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:58,150
As I see it, this quest was designed
to be next to impossible to finish.

109
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:02,392
So, what you're saying is they all
add up to one unbeatable boss, huh?

110
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:05,896
Yes, but don't forget your skills and xp are really high,

111
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:09,590
so maybe, with a burst of speed,
you can smash right through them.

112
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:10,431
Mm-hmm.

113
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,119
Hey, guys...

114
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,276
This isn't your fight.

115
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,240
The only way I'm gonna get through is with your help.

116
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:19,554
But time's running out,

117
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,395
so we have to go now.

118
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:26,782
Don't worry. I'll do whatever I can to get you up there.

119
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:27,822
You ready?

120
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:29,348
Let's see that game face.

121
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:30,158
Huh?

122
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,783
Well, I guess I don't have a choice,
since we were destined to be together forever.

123
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,832
Okay! Don't talk stupid.

124
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,264
Ow! Sorry! Geez!

125
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:40,102
We're in this together.

126
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:57,101
Thanks, guys. I mean it.

127
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,597
I'll draw the guardians' attention.

128
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:04,536
While I do, stay back and heal
you shouldn't be in any danger then.

129
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:05,475
Mm.

130
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,429
Mm-hmm.

131
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:12,895
Let's go.

132
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,051
Soo fillah haydle astaloo prottoh supaal baani!

133
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:39,504
Aaaaaaaah!

134
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,562
That's awesome!

135
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:58,181
There's a lot more coming.

136
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,375
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

137
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:22,827
There are so many of them!

138
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:33,132
Now, Recon!

139
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:33,822
Right!

140
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:45,765
Why are the guardians targeting us instead of him?

141
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:50,540
My guess is they're using a different targeting
algorithm than any of the other bosses in the game.

142
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,725
It looks like we're gonna be
doing some fighting after all.

143
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,040
Wait!

144
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,010
What are you doing?!

145
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:01,781
Wait a second.

146
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:07,692
Listen, I'm not sure what's going on
here, but, like, is this raid that important?

147
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

148
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:14,446
I don't think it's just a game... not now, anyway.

149
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:20,229
Then I'm gonna help you help that Spriggan!

150
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,367
Wait! Recon!

151
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,679
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

152
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:31,891
Se-ahh mareeta fimm glown vin-doh!

153
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,719
No! You idiot!

154
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:42,531
Heal!

155
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,273
Recon! That's enough!

156
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,931
Go on! Get outside!

157
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:06,548
Ekku kalla svalt tu-garli belfa hi-mun!

158
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,580
No way!

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,148
He's using a dark magic spell!

160
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:17,987
Blotoh leggin' garpah! Kneeza fall!

161
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:30,468
A self-destruct spell!

162
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,948
He used it even though the
penalty's worse than a normal death!

163
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:35,472
That dummy!

164
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,744
What was he thinking?!

165
00:15:58,804 --> 00:15:59,554
No!

166
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:06,982
Oh, no.

167
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,423
Now what?! He can't keep this up! It's impossible!

168
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,531
What are the sylphs doing here?

169
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:38,309
No way! They made it!

170
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:44,587
Dragons.

171
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:48,090
It's the cait sith, and they brought the whole ar...

172
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:52,660
Hello, there!

173
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:54,050
I hope we're not late.

174
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,320
Yeah, sorry!

175
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:58,371
It took us a while to get ready, but we're here now!

176
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,192
Sakuya! Alicia!

177
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,516
Okay, dragoons!

178
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,129
Get ready to toast these suckers!

179
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:14,038
Sylph warriors, prepare to engage the enemy!

180
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:18,344
Fire breath... Atta-a-a-a-ck!

181
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:29,244
Fenrir storm... Fire at will!

182
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:35,657
Ohh.

183
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:37,976
Thank you!

184
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,780
Thank you so much for coming!

185
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,687
You don't have to thank us.

186
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:44,658
We can't even begin to repay
that Spriggan for all he's done.

187
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,374
Sakuya's got a point, you know.

188
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,166
I mean, the only reason we're here for this
little raid's 'cause of all the money he gave us.

189
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,286
warriors, forward to battle!

190
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:10,478
Destroy them all! Keep going!

191
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:31,327
Sugu!

192
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:33,366
Yeah?!

193
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,448
Watch my back, okay?!

194
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,429
You got it!

195
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,334
Follow their lead!

196
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,105
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

197
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:09,701
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

198
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,813
Kazuto!

199
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,910
You can do it!

200
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,080
Go, Kazuto!

201
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,510
G-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

202
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:46,816
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

203
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,498
We're clearing out!

204
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:02,952
Everyone, fall back!

205
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,036
Keep going.

206
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:11,783
Fly!

207
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,210
Keep flying as long as you can...

208
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,437
To the very end.

209
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,200
Damn it!

210
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:32,642
Now what do I do?

211
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,924
Hey, Yui!

212
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,061
Yes, daddy?

213
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:48,124
Daddy, something strange is going on.

214
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,732
This door isn't locked by a quest flag.

215
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,465
It's locked by the system administrator.

216
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,785
What's that supposed to mean?

217
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:57,432
Restricted access.

218
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:00,360
This door was never intended to be opened by a player!

219
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,242
No. Wait.

220
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:23,545
That's it!

221
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:27,143
Hey, Yui, see if this will work.

222
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,659
I'm transferring the code.

223
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:55,733
We're gonna teleport!

224
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,186
Daddy, give me your hand!

225
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:38,627
Next time: "Gilded Hero".
