1
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,762
Everyone! Attack!

2
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,369
How many did we lose?

3
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,516
14 of us died.

4
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,892
Oh, my god.

5
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:59,449
And we still got 25 floors to go.

6
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,311
25 more floors?

7
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,796
How the hell are we even gonna make it that far?

8
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,026
What's wrong?

9
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:43,603
Kirito! What are you...

10
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,893
An "immortal object"?

11
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,310
Commander Heathcliff, w-what's going on?

12
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,788
I think I got the answer to that.

13
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:03,814
The reason why the commander's
HP never hits yellow is 'cause

14
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,022
he's protected by the system.

15
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:11,954
You know, ever since day one, something's
always bugged me about this whole thing.

16
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:14,737
I was always wondering...

17
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:18,788
"where is he hiding while he watches us
and controls everything in this world?"

18
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,567
Well, the answer's pretty simple.

19
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:23,855
It's basic psychology.

20
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:27,541
In fact, it's so simple, every kid knows it.

21
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,751
There's nothing more boring than
watching someone else play an RPG.

22
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,740
Is there... Akihiko Kayaba?

23
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:43,453
Just for my curiosity's sake, would you
mind telling me how you figured it out?

24
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:47,155
The first time I knew something
was up was during our duel.

25
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,421
Remember when you turned the tables on me?

26
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,573
That move was way too fast.

27
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,599
Yes, I thought so.

28
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:57,738
It was a mistake to think that would go unnoticed by you.

29
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:03,555
But you were so strong and so fast, the only
choice I had was to engage the system's assist mode.

30
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:11,342
Yes, I am Akihiko Kayaba.

31
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:17,313
And now that my identity's been revealed, it should come
as no surprise that I am the final boss on the top floor.

32
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:25,487
So, the strongest player in the
whole game ends up being the final boss.

33
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,996
Kind of Clichã©, isn't it?

34
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:29,196
Actually, I kind of like that angle.

35
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:34,891
One thing's for sure... I always thought you'd
be the one standing before me at the very end.

36
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:41,038
You know, dual-wielding is a rare skill... the kind that's
only given to the player with the fastest reaction time.

37
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:46,100
He is the hero of this story... the one
who rises up to challenge the demon king.

38
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:50,502
But you... the power you've
displayed exceeded my expectations.

39
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:56,675
I guess these unexpected twists and turns
are what makes mmorpgs so thrilling to play.

40
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,614
Our loyalty...

41
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:00,890
Our hope...

42
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:01,989
How dare you?

43
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:03,180
How dare you?!

44
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,825
How dare you?!!

45
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,636
Unh!

46
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:11,985
Paralysis?

47
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,336
Kirito.

48
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:24,492
What's the plan now,

49
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:24,928
huh?

50
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,044
You gonna kill everyone here and cover it up or something?

51
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,266
Oh, god, no.

52
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,611
That wouldn't be sporting of me, now, would it?

53
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:34,138
No, I have a better idea.

54
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,499
I'm going to head for the top
floor and wait for all of you there.

55
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:42,425
I'll be inside the Ruby palace. It's a
shame I have to leave you all so soon.

56
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,723
I've spent lots of time developing the
knights of the blood oath and other elite players.

57
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:47,557
Oh, well.

58
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:51,862
You're all strong, so I'm sure
you'll reach me... eventually.

59
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,032
But before I go...

60
00:06:55,463 --> 00:07:00,825
Kirito, I feel you deserve some kind of
reward for discovering my identity, so...

61
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,413
I'll give you a chance.

62
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:03,588
Chance for what?

63
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,663
To fight me one-on-one... right here, right now.

64
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:09,833
Oh, and my immortality will be deactivated.

65
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:15,258
Defeat me and you clear the game, and all of the
players will be able to log out from this world.

66
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,791
No strings attached.

67
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,196
What do you say?

68
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,853
Don't do it, Kirito.

69
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:23,473
I don't like it. We should fall back.

70
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,939
I have to.

71
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:57,545
Okay, then.

72
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:58,942
Let's finish it.

73
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:00,085
Kirito!

74
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:01,616
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,271
I can't run away if it means ending this.

76
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,773
You better not die.

77
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:08,013
You hear me?

78
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:09,196
No.

79
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:10,539
I'm gonna win.

80
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,502
I promise I'm gonna end this world.

81
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:14,503
Okay.

82
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,116
I believe in you, Kirito.

83
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,775
Kirito! Don't!

84
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:30,759
Kirito!

85
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:34,262
Agil.

86
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,737
Thanks for supporting all the
players in the game since day one.

87
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,533
Yeah, I knew.

88
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,601
You act like you're all about the money,

89
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,698
but I know you spent every penny you had
on helping the intermediate players level up.

90
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:50,698
Klein.

91
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:54,791
I'm sorry I bailed on you that day.

92
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,762
I think about it all the time.

93
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:00,810
D-Damn it, Kirito!

94
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,851
Don't you apologize!

95
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,130
Don't you dare apologize now!

96
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,774
I won't accept it!

97
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:12,041
I'll never accept it until we're on the other
side and you're buying me dinner, god damn it!

98
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:13,288
You got it.

99
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:15,352
See you on the other side.

100
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,855
If it's okay, I have a final request to make.

101
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,878
What is it?

102
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,454
I'm not planning on going down easy.

103
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,512
So if I die today...

104
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:36,478
I want your word that you'll fix
it so Asuna doesn't kill herself.

105
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,798
As you wish.

106
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,103
No, Kirito! That's not fair!

107
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,552
You can't do that! It's not fair!

108
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:45,405
No!

109
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,842
Kirito!!

110
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,145
This isn't some in-game duel.

111
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,393
It's a fight to the death.

112
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,055
That's fine with me.

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,774
'Cause I'm gonna kill him!

114
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,687
Rrrrrrrah!

115
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:19,685
He can block whatever I throw at him
'cause he designed the dual-wielding skill,

116
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:22,027
and he knows all its combos.

117
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:26,675
I have to beat him with my own
power... without using the sword skills.

118
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:28,669
Faster!

119
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:31,345
I got to go faster!

120
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,956
Rrrrah!

121
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,372
I'm sorry, Asuna.

122
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:06,898
Please... keep living.

123
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,846
Rraaaaaaaaaaaah!

124
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,332
Game over...

125
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:19,935
Kirito.

126
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:45,470
Asuna.

127
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,019
Asuna.

128
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:48,172
You can't...

129
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,894
You can't be...

130
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,746
Goodbye.

132
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,017
Now, that was a surprise.

133
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:26,394
I'm sure I never programmed a way for
players to neutralize their own paralysis.

134
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,279
I guess sometimes, these things just happen.

135
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,001
It's... over now.

136
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,745
I believe in you... Kirito.

137
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,169
Not yet.

138
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:48,550
Huh?

139
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,640
Not yet!

140
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,681
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

141
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:22,229
We did it... Didn't we?

142
00:14:56,728 --> 00:15:01,709
On November 7th at 2:55 P.M., the game has been cleared.

143
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,797
Repeat... the game has been cleared.

144
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:22,637
Where am I?

145
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:35,256
Kirito?

146
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,837
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,091
I guess I ended up dying, too.

148
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,805
Dummy.

149
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:12,810
Where are we?

150
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:14,485
Do you know?

151
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,939
A stunning view, isn't it?

152
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:42,204
Akihiko Kayaba.

153
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:48,435
At argus headquarters, the S.A.O. Mainframe
is in a room five floors below street level.

154
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,796
And right now, it's deleting all the data from its drives.

155
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:57,612
In about 10 minutes, everything in
this world will disappear forever.

156
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,344
And all the players?

157
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:01,812
What happens to them?

158
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:04,761
You don't have to worry about them.

159
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:11,785
The 6,147 players who survived the game
up to now were logged out a few seconds ago.

160
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,186
And what about the 4,000 people who died?

161
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:17,940
What about them?

162
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:20,405
They'll never return.

163
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:24,934
In any world, real or virtual,
once you're dead, you're gone.

164
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:28,683
Why?

165
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,661
What's the point?

166
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:32,163
Why did you do this?

167
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,252
That's a good question.

168
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,478
It's been so long, I've forgotten the reason.

169
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,013
Isn't that strange?

170
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:45,805
Even before I developed the system for the
full-dive environment, I dreamed of this...

171
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:51,137
a castle in a world that wasn't
governed by earthly laws and restrictions.

172
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,347
I poured my life into making that world a reality.

173
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,183
I created this world.

174
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,630
And I got to see something that surpassed
anything I could have imagined for it.

175
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:08,057
My steel castle floating in the sky.

176
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:11,384
I don't remember how old I was
when I became obsessed with it.

177
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:14,325
I wanted to leave the earth,

178
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,031
to fly to that castle.

179
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:21,090
I wanted that more than anything
else... for as long as I can remember.

180
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,823
You know what, Kirito?

181
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:29,714
I want to believe it's still out there.

182
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:35,355
That somewhere, in some other world, my
castle is still standing, taller than ever.

183
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,579
Yeah.

184
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:39,969
Maybe it still is.

185
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,494
Before I forget...

186
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:52,180
congratulations on clearing the game, Kirito, Asuna.

187
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,229
Well, then, I should probably get going now.

188
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,037
Guess this is goodbye.

189
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:21,457
Mnh-mnh.

190
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,134
This isn't goodbye at all.

191
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,955
We're gonna be together when we finally disappear.

192
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,356
So we're gonna be together forever.

193
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:32,645
Hey, you never told me your real name.

194
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:35,044
Would you please tell me before we go?

195
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,097
Kazuto.

196
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,002
Kazuto Kirigaya.

197
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,664
And last month, I turned 16.

198
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:46,192
"Kazuto Kirigaya."

199
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,513
So, you're younger than me, huh?

200
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,167
My name is Asuna Yuki.

201
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:54,756
I'm 17 now.

202
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,964
"Asuna Yuki."

203
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,446
"Asuna Yuki."

204
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:07,824
Sorry.

205
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:08,737
Sorry.

206
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:14,760
I swore, I promised I'd save
you... get you back to the real world.

207
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:15,461
But I...

208
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:17,582
I couldn't.

209
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:22,080
It's okay.

210
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,317
It's okay.

211
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:28,675
I'm happy I got to meet you, Kazuto, and to be with you...

212
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:30,254
And to live with you.

213
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:33,995
This is the happiest I've ever been in my whole life.

214
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,489
Thank you for that.

215
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:37,420
And I love you.

216
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:58,437
I love you...

217
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,635
So very much.

218
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,673
A... su... na.

219
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,376
Asuna.

220
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,762
Next time: "Return".
