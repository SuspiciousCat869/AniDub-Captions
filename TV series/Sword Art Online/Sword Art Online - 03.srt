1
00:00:00,611 --> 00:00:03,111
Here's to us, the moonlit black cats.

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:04,209
Cheers, everyone.

3
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:05,595
Cheers!

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,208
I got another.

5
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:10,297
Here's to the guy who saved our lives.

6
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:11,549
To Kirito!

7
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:12,535
To Kirito!

8
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,920
Uh, cheers, guys.

9
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:15,430
Thanks.

10
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:16,954
Yeah, man. Thank you.

11
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:17,797
You saved us back there.

12
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:19,823
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:21,031
No, it's cool.

14
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,788
I can't tell you how scared I was.

15
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,808
And it made me so happy when you came to save us, I...

16
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,006
Oh, well...

17
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:29,585
Uh, Kirito, sir.

18
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:34,609
I hope I'm not out of line asking this,
but I was wondering what level you're at.

19
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,878
Level 20.

20
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:38,492
Really?

21
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:40,615
You're at our level and still a solo player?

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,242
You're an inspiration, sir.

23
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,642
Keita, I'm not your superior.

24
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:48,122
And being solo means I'm always
hunting enemies out in the boonies.

25
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:49,505
It's not very efficient.

26
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,045
Oh. Right.

27
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:57,512
Well, in that case, I hate to spring this on you
here, but if you want, we'd love to have you in our guild.

28
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:02,304
Our mace-wielder, Tetsuo, is the the
only one we can put out front right now.

29
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,194
And then we've got Sachi over here.

30
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:06,728
I was thinking of having her
switch to the sword and shield.

31
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:09,065
That way, she can fight on the front lines.

32
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:12,061
The thing is, she says she's not sure she can handle it.

33
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:14,874
If you join us, maybe you can teach her a thing or two.

34
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,937
Oh, come on.

35
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:17,542
I'm not that useless.

36
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:18,502
Uh...

37
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,552
Seriously.

38
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,548
You can't just put me up front and
expect me to know what to I'd be terrified.

39
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:24,682
It's no big deal.

40
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:25,821
Just hide behind your shield.

41
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:26,656
Yeah, right.

42
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:29,554
Ever since I can remember,
you've always been a scaredy-cat.

43
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,551
We always joke around like that.

44
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:38,048
See, in real life, we all go to the same
high school and are members of the computer club.

45
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:40,418
But if you're worried about fitting in with us, don't.

46
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:43,086
As far as I'm concerned, you're already part of our group.

47
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:43,824
Right?

48
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,582
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,848
Well, I'm really flattered.

50
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:54,702
And thanks for the offer.

51
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:56,910
I'll do it.

52
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:00,279
Welcome to the guild.

53
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:02,159
Nice to have you on our side.

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,555
I knew he'd join.

55
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,221
Sachi!

56
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,768
Get back. I got this.

57
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,530
Come on, Tetsuo! Switch out!

58
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,419
Got it!

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,276
All right!

60
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:10,833
Congrats, man.

61
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,432
You totally owned that sucker.

62
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:17,610
The assault team made it through to floor 28.

63
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,364
That's amazing.

64
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:24,632
Hey, Kirito, what the heck does
the assault team have that we don't?

65
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:27,262
Well, access to information?

66
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:32,600
With that, they can find out the easiest
ways to get xp, and they don't share that info.

67
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:35,978
Yeah, you're probably right.

68
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:39,028
But I think what really sets them apart is willpower.

69
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:40,164
What do you mean?

70
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:46,480
I guess what I mean is, they have the will to stick
up for their friends or any player, for that matter.

71
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:50,083
Truth is, I like to think we have that same kind of drive

72
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,256
even though we still need their protection.

73
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:56,276
That said, our first priority
is looking out for each other.

74
00:04:56,538 --> 00:05:00,855
But someday, if we get strong enough,
we'll join the elites in the assault team.

75
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,569
I see.

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,944
That's a good goal.

77
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:06,303
I don't know. I guess.

78
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:09,045
Hey, leader, give me some love.

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,710
Hey! Come on!

80
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:14,614
So you really think we can be as strong as the
holy dragon alliance or the knights of the blood oath?

81
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,078
Yeah. What if I do?

82
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,058
Nothing wrong with setting our sights high.

83
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,112
But we have to be level 30 first.

84
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,184
That's impossible.

85
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,870
I like the way Keita thinks.

86
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,288
If the black cats can level up
fast and get to the front lines,

87
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:30,666
his ideals could change the
elitist attitude of the assault team.

88
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:38,210
I have an announcement to make.

89
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,922
Uh... after our latest hunts in
the field, we've got 200,000 col.

90
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,249
Whoa-ho-ho!

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,634
Buying a house of our own doesn't
seem like such a pipe dream anymore.

92
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:51,376
I know... we should upgrade Sachi's equipment.

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,468
Good idea.

94
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:53,577
Mnh-mnh.

95
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,364
I'm fine with what I have.

96
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:56,985
Oh, come on.

97
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,822
You know, it's not fair to make
Kirito be out in front forever.

98
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:02,608
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,452
Ah, don't worry about me.

100
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:05,687
I'm cool with it.

101
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,266
Thanks, Kirito.

102
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:11,921
Sachi, I know switching jobs isn't
easy, but, seriously, you're almost there.

103
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:13,700
You can do it. I know it.

104
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,057
Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,061
Klein.

106
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:49,913
What's up, Kirito?

107
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,036
The trash mob's all yours, guys.

108
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:52,823
Sure!

109
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,572
Man, it's been a while since I've seen you.

110
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:56,373
What?

111
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:58,352
You doing some late-night leveling or something?

112
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,895
Uh... what's up with that icon?

113
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:02,951
Did you join a guild?

114
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,770
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

115
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,145
It's all clear!

116
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,697
We can move on!

117
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,618
See ya.

118
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:12,096
Yeah.

119
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,060
Oh, come on.

120
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,063
Is it still bugging you?

121
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:27,271
It's Keita.

122
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,036
Sachi went off somewhere and hasn't come back yet.

123
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,006
We're heading to the dungeon now.

124
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,515
Please let me know if you find anything out.

125
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,660
Sachi.

126
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:58,853
Sachi?

127
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:01,602
Kirito.

128
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,531
Everyone's worried about you.

129
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:11,081
Hey, Kirito.

130
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,094
Yeah?

131
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,860
We should run away.

132
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,146
Run away?

133
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:17,742
From what?

134
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:19,530
From this town.

135
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:21,159
From the monsters.

136
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,399
From the moonlit black cats.

137
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:26,402
And from sword art online, too.

138
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,605
Are you talking about suicide?

139
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,505
That's not such a bad idea.

140
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,080
Hmm. Sorry. No.

141
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,880
If I had the guts to die, I wouldn't be
hiding in town where it's safe, would I?

142
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:44,779
But really...

143
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,805
Why can't we just leave?

144
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:51,342
Why do we have to die when it's just a stupid game?

145
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,153
What's the point of going through this?

146
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:56,652
Yeah.

147
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,326
There is no point, I guess.

148
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:05,324
I... am so afraid of dying in here.

149
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:09,115
It's really that bad for you, huh?

150
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,724
I'm so scared. I haven't been
able to get any sleep lately.

151
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,212
You're not going to die.

152
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:20,689
Really?

153
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,090
How can you be so sure about that?

154
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,021
The black cats are strong enough as a guild.

155
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:29,573
Besides, our margin of safety is well above the norm.

156
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,052
Plus, you got Tetsuo and me up front.

157
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:35,110
So there's no reason to be on the front lines with us.

158
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,518
You honestly don't think I'll die?

159
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,219
Will I make it back to the real world?

160
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,229
Yeah.

161
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:42,650
You're not gonna die.

162
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:46,782
You'll see. We'll clear this game and go home soon.

163
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:02,565
Come in.

164
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:06,757
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,886
I can't seem to get to sleep.

166
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:14,368
If I stay in this guild, she'll be safe, and

167
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:17,204
we'll all make it back to the real world someday.

168
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,336
There must be a lot of players
like her who are afraid of dying here.

169
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:27,413
But still, they laugh and cry
and try to live as best they can.

170
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,846
I never thought about it like that before.

171
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:32,330
Kirito?

172
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:34,570
It's okay.

173
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,039
I promise you're going to survive.

174
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,276
And no matter what, I promise I'll protect all of you.

175
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,669
Okay, I'm heading out.

176
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,030
Teleport... town of beginnings.

177
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,005
Can you believe it?

178
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,544
I never thought buying a house would be so exciting.

179
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,752
Dude, you sound like an old man.

180
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:12,024
Hey, while Keita's off buying the house, what do
you guys say we go out and raise some extra cash?

181
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:12,675
Oh!

182
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,146
Then we can buy furniture!

183
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,481
Come on. Let's go to a dungeon on a higher floor.

184
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,762
We should stick to our usual hunting spots.

185
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:22,519
But up there, we could make more and faster.

186
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,306
Yeah, and at our levels, we
don't have anything to worry about.

187
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:31,322
You see? I told you guys this was gonna be cake.

188
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,372
We might even be able to reach the front lines sooner.

189
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,112
That's what I'm talking about.

190
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:36,969
Look!

191
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:44,636
No way!

192
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:45,861
A hidden door?

193
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:51,471
A treasure chest! Whoo-hoo!

194
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,064
No! Wait!

195
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:12,095
It's a trap, guys! Hurry!

196
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,279
Let's get out of here!

197
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,527
Teleport... taft!

198
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:16,863
Teleport... taft!

199
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,090
We can't use our crystals.

200
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,279
They're probably being blocked by the walls.

201
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:40,616
Tetsuo!

202
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:57,906
Sachi!

203
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,583
Kirito!

204
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:02,566
Sachi!

205
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:36,191
I hear someone's been taking
risks with their level-raising.

206
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,828
You got any new info for me or what?

207
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:41,545
Nothing worth charging you money for.

208
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,247
You give info-brokers a bad name.

209
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:44,857
Hey.

210
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:47,735
This wasn't in the beta test. It's a first-time event.

211
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:50,023
How am I supposed to know what's gonna happen?

212
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:55,114
All I know is that tonight, on Christmas
Eve, the event boss is gonna appear.

213
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:59,461
He's called Nicholas the renegade, and
he's gonna show up under a fir tree somewhere.

214
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:04,180
The major guilds are searching
everywhere for the tree as we speak.

215
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,929
Hmm.

216
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:08,631
You wouldn't happen to know where it is, would you?

217
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:09,653
Maybe.

218
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,609
Are you thinking of going solo on this one?

219
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:21,467
In this world, the dead can never return to life.

220
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,146
I heard a rumor, though.

221
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:30,549
If you beat Nicholas the renegade, he'll
drop an item that can revive a dead player.

222
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:36,523
I'm going alone, and I'll probably die alone.

223
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:39,717
No one will see me. No one will know.

224
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,731
Nothing will be left behind.

225
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,412
That's how I'll die.

226
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:44,985
You're a beater!

227
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,367
You had no right to be with us!

228
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:00,525
That's right.

229
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,359
It's my fault.

230
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:06,173
My arrogance killed you... all of you.

231
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:12,363
If only I hadn't kept my true level
as a player secret from everyone.

232
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,544
I have to figure out a way to beat Nicholas.

233
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:20,805
Then I can revive Sachi.

234
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:24,592
And then I'll find out what she was trying to tell me.

235
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:33,336
And if it turns out she was cursing me, fine. I accept it.

236
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,105
What's up?

237
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,616
You followed me?

238
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:48,692
Of course.

239
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,843
You're after the revival item, aren't you?

240
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:52,335
Yeah.

241
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:56,618
Don't be risking your life for some
rumor that could turn out to be bogus.

242
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,581
Man, you can't be messing around in this death game.

243
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:04,808
Once your HP hits zero, that's
in the real world, your brain...

244
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,920
Shut up.

245
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,973
I'm trying to get you to stop
with all your stupid soloing.

246
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:11,632
Come on. Join up with us.

247
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:14,359
Whoever gets it to drop the revival item keeps it.

248
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:15,536
No hard feelings.

249
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,157
Hey, that's fair, isn't it?

250
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,786
But then there'd be no point.

251
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:23,081
I have to do this... alone.

252
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,785
Think about what you're doing, Kirito.

253
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:29,233
It's suicide, and I can't let you die like that.

254
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:30,036
Come on!

255
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,205
Huh?

256
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,765
I guess youwere being followed, too, huh, Klein?

257
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:38,734
Uh-huh.

258
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,205
It sure looks that way.

259
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:42,191
It's the holy dragon alliance.

260
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,337
They'll do anything for a rare
item... no matter how shady.

261
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:46,760
What do we do?

262
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,960
You bastards.

263
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:52,766
Screw these guys!

264
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:54,315
Get out of here, Kirito!

265
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,237
No way.

266
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:56,581
Leave them to us.

267
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,591
We can hold them off. Get going!

268
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,167
Huh?

269
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,224
Let's do this.

270
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,397
Kirito! Hey!

271
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,504
W-Wha...?

272
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:16,315
There.

273
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,039
That's the revival item.

274
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,989
Let's see. It says, "must administer to affected player...

275
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,492
Within 10 seconds?!"

276
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:29,534
If someone dies in front of
you someday, make sure you use it.

277
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,661
Kirito, listen.

278
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,506
Stay alive, you hear? I don't care how you do it.

279
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:51,733
Just stay alive to the end.

280
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:58,684
See ya.

281
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,660
Sachi?

282
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,634
Merry Christmas, Kirito.

283
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,614
By the time you hear this,

284
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:40,347
I'll probably be dead.

285
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:43,755
How can I explain this?

286
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,120
Let's see.

287
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:50,173
To tell you the truth, I never really
wanted to leave the town of beginnings.

288
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,267
And I knew if I fought with an attitude
like that, I would end up dying someday.

289
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,126
But that's not anyone's fault.

290
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:00,177
That's something ihave to deal with.

291
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:07,628
Kirito, ever since that night you found me, you
kept telling me I wasn't going to die, no matter what.

292
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,449
But what if I got killed anyway?

293
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,070
I knew that if I died, you'd blame yourself.

294
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:16,250
That's why I decided to record this for you.

295
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:20,444
By the way, I know how powerful you really are.

296
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:21,698
Sorry.

297
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,249
I sort of peeked when you weren't looking.

298
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,770
I wondered why you weren't telling the
truth about what level player you really were.

299
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,566
I wondered why you decided to fight with us.

300
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,631
I never figured it out, though.

301
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:36,826
You know what?

302
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,894
When I found out how strong you were...
I don't know... it made me so happy.

303
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,546
I felt relieved.

304
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,002
So even if I die, promise me

305
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,852
you'll go on living.

306
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,003
Okay, Kirito?

307
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:53,129
Stay alive so you can see the end of
this world and find out why it was created.

308
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,958
Find out why a weakling like me ended up here.

309
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:58,833
Find out the reason you and I met.

310
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:03,012
Please. That's what I wish.

311
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:10,153
Looks like I still have time, so seeing how
it's Christmas and everything, I'll sing you a song.

312
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:45,858
Anyway, Kirito.

313
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:52,015
I'm so glad I met you and that I could
be with you, even for a little while.

314
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,022
Thank you. Goodbye.

315
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:38,355
Next time: "The Black Swordsman".
