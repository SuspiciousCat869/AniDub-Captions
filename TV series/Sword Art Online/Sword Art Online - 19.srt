1
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:08,166
Oas narza Noh-toh raisa auga.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,396
Whoa!

3
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,067
Everything looks way brighter now!

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,339
So thisis night-vision magic.

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,332
I guess spriggans aregood for something after all.

6
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:21,928
I don't know if that was a compliment or a diss.

7
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,685
You're practicing the magic you can use.

8
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:25,858
That'sthe important thing.

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,813
And projecting illusions is one of your specialties.

10
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:29,655
Illusions?

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,123
Yeah, to trick people with.

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,167
It's cool, but it's not gonna help anyone much in combat.

13
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:36,036
But you never know.

14
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:40,483
In a life-or-death situation, your lame
Spriggan magic might actually come in handy.

15
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:44,812
Now, thatwas a diss.

16
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,766
Se-ah uraaza Noh...

17
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:22,782
Noh-toh?

18
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,005
No, you're just memorizing the words.

19
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:29,564
You have to learn what the words of power mean
first, then match them with the effects of the magic.

20
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,345
That's how you memorize spells.

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,487
Ugh!

22
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:36,992
I never thought I'd be in a game and have
to memorize words from a different language.

23
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:39,145
Oh, and just so you know,

24
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,705
the higher-ranked spells have about 20 words.

25
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,817
Holy crap.

26
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,755
I'll just stick to fighting, then.

27
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,557
Would you quit complaining?

28
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:49,449
Oh, someone's messaging me.

29
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,330
Sorry... I have to get this.

30
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:51,974
Sure.

31
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,183
It's Recon again.

32
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,798
It's probably nothing, but I'll check anyway.

33
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,380
It says, "I was right.

34
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,237
Be careful. S."

35
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:02,285
That's it.

36
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:03,842
What's that mean?

37
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:04,582
"S"...

38
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:06,829
Sa... shi... su...

39
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:08,014
ohhhh.

40
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:08,840
What's wrong?

41
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:10,365
Oh... nothing.

42
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:13,068
Daddy! I'm picking up movement behind us.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,370
Are they monsters?

44
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:15,489
Unh-unh.

45
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:17,221
They're players... a lot.

46
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,645
12 total.

47
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:19,613
You're kidding.

48
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:20,947
Ohh.

49
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,488
I've got a bad feeling about this.

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,068
We better take cover.

51
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,798
Okay, but where?

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,840
Ha!

53
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,396
Just leave everything to me.

54
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:33,092
Hey! Easy!

55
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:38,860
Shick shaalu ohbis grown loputoh!

56
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:45,360
We can talk, but we have to be really quiet about it.

57
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:48,497
Anything louder than a whisper,
and it's gonna break the spell.

58
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,220
Okay.

59
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:51,388
They'll be coming into view soon.

60
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,121
What is that?

61
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,026
You see it?

62
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:57,660
Huh?

63
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,591
No, I can't see anything.

64
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,309
I can tell it's not a player.

65
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:02,833
It's got red eyes...

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,216
kind of like a bat.

67
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,176
Why'd you break our cover?

68
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:19,594
Because that thing out there's
a high-level tracing searcher!

69
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:20,920
We have to destroy it!

70
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:24,359
Ekku skeetoh tutoogue sumahl streeda!

71
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,273
Come on! We got to go!

72
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,352
Can't we just hide behind one of your spells again?

73
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:36,373
They already know we're here.

74
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:37,859
That tracer had us pegged.

75
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:39,648
Hiding's not gonna do us any good.

76
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:43,143
Besides, that bat was a fire element familiar.

77
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,764
That can only mean the ones who are tracking us are...

78
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,193
The salamanders.

79
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,811
What's a party of salamanders doing way down here?

80
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:54,670
Whoa!

81
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,599
Check out the lake!

82
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,735
Looks like we're gonna get away!

83
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,047
Watch where you're going, or you'll fall in!

84
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:11,202
Oh, crap!

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,831
Oh, damn it!

86
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:16,500
Unh!

87
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,766
That won't work.

88
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,776
Why didn't you tell me that before?

89
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:24,676
Oh, right... like it's my fault you're in a hurry.

90
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,644
It's an earth-magic barrier,

91
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,083
you can bash on it all day, and it won't destroy it.

92
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:31,180
Can we jump in the lake and swim around it?

93
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:31,887
Nope.

94
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,628
At least, not unless you want to be lunch.

95
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,941
The water's filled with high-level monsters.

96
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,405
The undines are the only ones who
can take those kinds of things on.

97
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:43,925
Then I guess the only option left is to fight.

98
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,435
I'm not gonna argue with that, but it won't be easy.

99
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:51,664
If the salamanders have high-level
earth magic, it can only mean one thing...

100
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:53,937
they have a powerful mage on their side.

101
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,897
Leafa...

102
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:00,298
I know you're good with a sword,
so don't take this the wrong way,

103
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:03,016
but could you back me up from here on in?

104
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:07,155
I need you to stay behind and focus on healing me.

105
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,221
That way, I can fight harder and not worry about my HP.

106
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,998
They're targeting him with everything they got!

107
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,142
Leeza foruk!

108
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:43,377
Randol dorotoh!

109
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:51,730
Kirito!

110
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:03,284
Soo fillah haydl astaloo prot-to su-paal bhaa-ni!

111
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,701
Uh-oh.

112
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,547
Prottoh supaal baani!

113
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,011
What do we do?

114
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,347
He's gonna run out of HP at some point!

115
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,531
That's enough, Kirito!

116
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,773
If we lose, it'll just mean a
couple extra hours of flying!

117
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,363
Let's give up while we can!

118
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,180
No way.

119
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:42,912
As long as I'm alive,

120
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:45,314
I'm not gonna let anyone in my party die.

121
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,659
I won'tlet that happen again!

122
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,986
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

123
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:06,120
What the hell?!

124
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:07,163
What's he doing?!

125
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:08,913
Hurry!

126
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,396
This is your only chance!

127
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:11,523
What do you mean?

128
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,708
You have to use all the mana you have!

129
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:16,912
Hurry and focus on shielding
him from the next magic attack!

130
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,450
Uh, okay.

131
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:20,150
But I don't think it's gonna help.

132
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:28,815
Ekku balpa eh-in brandoh muspeeeek karrah breasta.

133
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:37,158
Soo shalu lindoh ashee-nya baatoh Aimee oh-gu!

134
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,524
Baa-ni stay-pah.

135
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,532
Sveldoh!

136
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,197
Raahn-dol doro-toh!

137
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,323
Do it now, daddy!

138
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:57,019
Se-ah uraaza no-toh deeptoh!

139
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,481
He's using illusion magic.

140
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:03,286
But all that's gonna do is make
him look like a giant monster.

141
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,834
Is that... Kirito?

142
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:39,226
Idiots!

143
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,726
Don't break formation!

144
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,632
It's not real! Don't be afraid!

145
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:46,023
He can't hurt us if you stick
to the plan and stay in formation!

146
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:02,270
Hit him with an explosion spell!

147
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,621
Ecku balpa!

148
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,064
Eh-han!

149
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:17,492
Yay!

150
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,525
Retreat! Retreat!

151
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,233
Retre-e-e-e-e-at!!

152
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:45,872
Aah! Aah!

153
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,562
No!

154
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,027
Stop!

155
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:01,997
Wait, Kirito!

156
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,835
Hold on! Don't kill him!

157
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,167
Isn't my daddy amazing?!

158
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,382
Ow, my...

159
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:12,311
aah!

160
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:16,547
Okay, if you want to live, you better
tell me who sent you ass-hats after us.

161
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:17,909
Never.

162
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,297
Kill me if you want!

163
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:20,323
You got it.

164
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:21,553
Oh, man!

165
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,040
Now, that was cool!

166
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,775
That was an awesome fight!

167
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:29,544
Hehhh?

168
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,492
Your plan wasn't shabby, either.

169
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:34,907
If I was alone, I wouldn't have
lasted a minute against you dorks.

170
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:36,711
What are you telling him that for?!

171
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:37,968
Let me handle this.

172
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:38,906
Listen up.

173
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:41,083
I want to see if you and me can make a deal.

174
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:45,118
Check it out. Those are all the items
and yuld I won after beating your asses.

175
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,678
All you have to do is answer my
questions, and they could be yours.

176
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:49,496
Sound good?

177
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,460
Seriously?

178
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:54,803
Totally.

179
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,192
Ugh. Men.

180
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,765
M it's like they forgot we're even here.

181
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:07,747
Earlier this evening, I got an urgent text from G-Takusu.

182
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:10,535
He's the leader of the mage squad... or usedto be.

183
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:14,085
Anyway, I got this text telling us all to meet him here.

184
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:18,472
And when I showed up, he said he needed
12 of us to go on a hunt for two players.

185
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,993
At first, I thought it was overkill, but,

186
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:24,948
well, he said you guys took
out Kagemune, so it made sense.

187
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:26,806
Who's this Kagemune guy?

188
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:30,333
He's the leader of the lancer squad,
and he's known for hunting sylphs.

189
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:34,012
Yesterday, he got creamed in a fight and had to retreat.

190
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,244
That was you guys, wasn't it?

191
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,349
Wait.

192
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:41,423
Why's G-Takusu so interested in getting us out of the way?

193
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,270
The order came from the top.

194
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,611
Something about you "interfering with the plan."

195
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,063
Yeah? Whatplan?

196
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,957
Hey, I'm just a grunt.

197
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,234
They don't tell me anything.

198
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:54,279
But I'm pretty sure something
really big's about to go down.

199
00:12:54,616 --> 00:13:00,126
When I logged on today, I saw this big-ass
swarm of salamander troops heading up north.

200
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:01,221
No way.

201
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:04,257
They're gonna go try to clear the world tree, aren't they?

202
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,383
I doubt that.

203
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,214
Someone figured that to take
the tree, the whole army would need

204
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,461
ancient-weapon-class equipment,
and we can't afford that stuff.

205
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:12,891
Hmm.

206
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,627
That's everything I know. I promise.

207
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,653
You weren't lying about your end of the deal, were you?

208
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,280
No.

209
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,790
I'm a man of my word, partner.

210
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,136
Hey.

211
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:26,876
That big, ugly monster that was tearing everything up...

212
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,693
was that you or an illusion?

213
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:29,863
Yeah...

214
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:30,912
I don't remember.

215
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,191
Wait... you don't know?

216
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,193
Not really. It just happens sometimes.

217
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:38,777
In the heat of battle, I'll snap
and can't remember a thing after.

218
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,340
Whoa. Scary.

219
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:43,263
I think I remember most of what
happened this last time, though.

220
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,951
Like, I know I used that spell Yui suggested.

221
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,012
Do it now!

222
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,392
I also remember getting huge.

223
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:50,574
That was cool.

224
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:54,721
I remember losing my sword and then... grabbing people.

225
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:57,072
And you were chomping down on them. Remember that?

226
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,779
Oh, yeah.

227
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,403
I totally felt like a monster...

228
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,517
all eating people and everything.

229
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,051
So, uh... What did they taste like?

230
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:09,856
Kinda like grilled meat just before
it gets burnt... all crispy and...

231
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,826
Okay, good! Sorry I asked!

232
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:16,268
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

233
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:27,687
Wow!

234
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,020
So, this is legrue!

235
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,261
Ow! That hurt.

236
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,127
Then you shouldn't be biting people.

237
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,016
I'll say.

238
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,433
Why is everyone ganging up on me?

239
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,125
I was trying to break the
tension with a stupid joke, is all.

240
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:42,390
Bite me again, and I'll cut you in half.

241
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:44,583
Yes, ma'am.

242
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:46,912
Ugh.

243
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,999
Oh, look!

244
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,687
Hey, I just remembered something.

245
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:53,425
Hmm?

246
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:57,479
Right before those salamanders attacked
us, you got a message from your friend.

247
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:59,767
Oh! I totally forgot!

248
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,148
Recon's not online.

249
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,616
Maybe he's asleep.

250
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,901
Okay, well, why don't you log out and give him a call?

251
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,538
Hmm.

252
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:09,499
Yeah, I think I better check in with him.

253
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,785
I'll only be gone a sec.

254
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,277
Wait for me here, okay?

255
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:15,862
Yui, would you please keep an eye on my avatar?

256
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:16,672
Me?

257
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:20,494
Yeah, I need to make sure your dad
doesn't mess around with it while I'm out.

258
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:21,719
Copy that, ma'am.

259
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,299
You got to be kidding.

260
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:52,253
Hey, Nagata.

261
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,626
What's with all the calls?

262
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,817
What do you want?

263
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,803
You picked up! Finally!

264
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,201
Where were you, Suguha?

265
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,434
I was dealing with some in-game stuff.

266
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,168
W-We got trouble! Like... like big trouble!

267
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,527
Sigurd's coming after us!

268
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:06,815
A-And that's not all!

269
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,483
He betrayed Sakuya, the Sylph commander!

270
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,819
Betrayed her?

271
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:11,668
How?

272
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,815
Start from the beginning and
tell me everything that happened.

273
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,952
But we're running out of time!

274
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:18,047
Okay.

275
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:21,257
Remember when the salamanders
ambushed us in the ancient forest?

276
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,475
Well, didn't that whole setup
seem a little... Weird to you?

277
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:26,524
I don't know. Not really.

278
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:27,860
Why do you think it was weird?

279
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,104
Remember how Sigurd said he'd be the
decoy and then he lured three of them away?

280
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,147
Yeah, now that you mention don't
you think it was out of character?

281
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,744
I mean, usually, he'd make someone else do it, right?

282
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:41,073
Yeah... i guess.

283
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:44,973
I mean, you're right... it's
weird... but what's your point?

284
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,842
Okay, here it is.

285
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,531
I found out he's been working as a spy for
the salamanders... probably for a while now.

286
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,562
What?!

287
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:57,160
Do you have proof, or did you just hear about it?

288
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,728
Remember how I said something was bugging me?

289
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:03,851
Well, I used a transparency spell,
and I've been following Sigurd all day.

290
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:07,195
I tracked him to a back alley.

291
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,493
And I saw him and a couple
others put on invisibility cloaks.

292
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,195
They were up tosomething.

293
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,130
That's for sure.

294
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:19,216
I followed them down into the sewers, where
these two sketchy guys were waiting for them.

295
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,021
I couldn't believe it.

296
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,581
They were salamanders!

297
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:27,075
They were a little ways away from
me, so I couldn't hear everything.

298
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,006
But I heard the salamanders say they put a tracer on you.

299
00:17:31,268 --> 00:17:32,167
Uhhh!

300
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:41,581
Keep going.

301
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:42,584
Then what?

302
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,735
The salamanders caught me.

303
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:48,218
I'm still in the sewers, paralyzed by the poison arrow.

304
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:51,901
Well, now I know why you kept calling me I.R.L.

305
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,452
There's something else.

306
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:58,170
Sakuya is supposed to form an
alliance with the cait sith today.

307
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:02,206
The meeting's in neutral territory, and
she's heading there right now... in secret.

308
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,820
Sigurd knows about it, too.

309
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,284
He's gonna show up at the signing
ceremony with his goons and attack it!

310
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,306
Ahhh...

311
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,768
We have to hurry!

312
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,376
Hey, welcome back, Leafa.

313
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,495
Yeah, welcome back.

314
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,990
Kirito, I have to leave.

315
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:21,744
Why?

316
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:25,669
Sorry, but there's something I
have to take care of right away.

317
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,632
If I had time to explain, believe me, I would.

318
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,322
But I can't.

319
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,842
And I don't think I'll be coming back here, either.

320
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,361
Then I guess you'll just have to explain it me on the way.

321
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:36,728
Huh?

322
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:39,318
It'll take a while to get out of here 'cause we can't fly.

323
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:40,756
That's enough time, right?

324
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,417
Yeah, right.

325
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,738
40 minutes from now, in the valley of the butterflies,

326
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:57,575
the leaders of the sylphs and the
cait siths are gonna have a meeting.

327
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,895
Mind if I ask a couple questions before we get there?

328
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,558
Go ahead.

329
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:06,171
If the salamanders attack the sylphs and the
cait siths, what are theygonna get out of it?

330
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,834
For one, they'd stop the alliance from happening.

331
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:13,510
And if the cait siths find out their
leader died because a Sylph turned traitor,

332
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,512
they'd be pretty pissed, wouldn't they?

333
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:16,715
Superpissed.

334
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:20,694
It's a good way to start a war between the
cait siths and the sylphs, that's for sure.

335
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:22,856
It's also a good way to get rich.

336
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:26,526
If you take out the leader of a
territory, you get 30% of its money.

337
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:30,752
You can invade its hometown for 10
days and charge whatever tax you want.

338
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:31,610
No way.

339
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:32,729
Really?

340
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:33,851
Seriously!

341
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,043
Would I lie to you?

342
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,524
This isn't your problem, Kirito. It's a Sylph problem.

343
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:41,944
You don't have any reason to get
involved and risk your life over it.

344
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:45,488
If we go to the meeting, chances
are we won't make it back alive.

345
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,433
And we'll probably have to start over from Sylvain again.

346
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,665
But... this could work for you.

347
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:58,233
You want to get to the top of the world tree, so...
You might be better off working with the salamanders.

348
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:05,887
If they can pull this off, it'll give them the power and
resources they need to make an attempt at the world tree.

349
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,843
And since you're a Spriggan,

350
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,845
they might hire you as a mercenary.

351
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,283
So... if you wanted to kill me, you could.

352
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,459
I wouldn't hold it against you.

353
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:20,122
It's just a game in the end.

354
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:21,902
Anything goes, right?

355
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:24,142
If you want to kill, you kill.

356
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:26,359
If you want to steal, you steal.

357
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:29,687
A lot of people think like that.

358
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:31,483
More than I care to know.

359
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,994
And in a way, I get it.

360
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,202
Even I used to think like that.

361
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,950
But none of it's true.

362
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:44,958
In a virtual world, there's things you
have to protect becauseit's a virtual world.

363
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,952
Someone special taught me that.

364
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:53,863
If you give in to your impulses in here,
it's gonna change who you are in the real world.

365
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,200
The player and the character are one and the same.

366
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,537
Leafa... you're a good person.

367
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,991
And I want to be your friend.

368
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:09,768
So it doesn't matter what the reason is... there's no
way in hell I'd ever attack a friend for my own benefit.

369
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,126
I couldn't live with myself.

370
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:16,734
Kirito, I...

371
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:24,558
Thank you.

372
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:27,554
Oh. Wow. I sounded pretentious, didn't I?

373
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,557
Sorry about that.

374
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:29,749
Unh-unh.

375
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,363
That was pretty cool.

376
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:33,583
Oh, crap!

377
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:35,510
We're wasting time just standing here.

378
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:36,623
We got to go.

379
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:37,665
Yui, lead the way.

380
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,467
You got it, daddy!

381
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:40,881
Here... give me your hand.

382
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,623
Okay, but, uh...

383
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:43,290
come on!

384
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,371
M-Monsters!

385
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,519
There's the exit!

386
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,179
Next time: "General of the Blazing Flame".
