1
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:28,048
It's amazing.

2
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:30,782
I know. Isn't it?

3
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:32,401
Welcome to arun.

4
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,065
It's the center of Alfheim.

5
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:36,296
It's also the biggest city in this world.

6
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:37,200
Yeah.

7
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:38,946
We finally got here.

8
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,624
How exciting!

9
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,223
I've never been to a city this big before!

10
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,500
Me, neither.

11
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,715
The ore light's so beautiful,

12
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:48,807
like a bunch of twinkling stars.

13
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:53,647
Attention, players.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,415
The server will be down today,

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,056
January the 22nd, from 4:00 A.M.

16
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,559
To 3:00 P.M. for scheduled maintenance.

17
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:06,065
We ask that all players please log out
no later than 10 minutes before shutdown.

18
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:07,136
Repeat...

19
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,239
I guess that does it for us for today.

20
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:14,009
Let's go find an inn and log out.

21
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:16,136
Sure.

22
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,655
Uh... uh...

23
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:22,443
Well, I hope we can find someplace
good... nothing too pricy, though.

24
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,896
I sort of blew threw all my cash today.

25
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:25,992
And why is that?

26
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:29,120
Oh, right... you were showing off
and you gave all your money to Sakuya.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,775
You should have saved a little for the inn, big spender.

28
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,779
Your dad's financially challenged.

29
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,718
Do you know if there's a cheap inn anywhere?

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,607
Hmm?

31
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:43,572
Um... there's one there, and from
what I can tell, it's supercheap!

32
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:45,877
Great. Supercheap. Yay.

33
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,427
Come on. Let's go.

34
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:49,648
Hey, wait for me!

35
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,489
An opening.

36
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:24,870
Hey, Sugu. Good morning.

37
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:27,483
Morning, Kazuto.

38
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,855
Someone looks sleepy today.

39
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,094
When did you get to bed last night?

40
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,816
I don't know.

41
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,636
Around 4:00, I think.

42
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,734
Whoa.

43
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:41,133
A kid like you shouldn't be up that late.

44
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,538
What were you doing?

45
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,145
Oh, uh, tooling around online.

46
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,404
Just don't go too overboard, okay?

47
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,617
Right. Like I'm one to talk.

48
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:57,476
Hey, Suguha, turn around for a sec.

49
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,222
Why?

50
00:04:58,357 --> 00:04:59,669
Go on. Turn around.

51
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,480
Okay.

52
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,208
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

53
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,699
How far does this hallway go?

54
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,200
No way.

55
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:37,375
It's a map.

56
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,822
Where is it?

57
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:44,544
There's got to be a console where I can log out.

58
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,995
Experiment hangar?

59
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,268
To make up for that water gag you pulled,
you owe me one green tea raspberry parfait.

60
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,402
You cool with that?

61
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:14,336
All right.

62
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,729
Then we're even.

63
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,513
We could go get them today if you're not too busy.

64
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,425
I can't today.

65
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:26,334
I have to do something in the afternoon, and
I was also planning on going to the hospital.

66
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,694
Oh, right.

67
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:35,978
Hey, I was wondering... is it okay
if I go with you to the hospital?

68
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:37,566
Huh?

69
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:40,180
Sure. Why not?

70
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,667
I'm sure it'll make Asuna happy.

71
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,320
Hmm.

72
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,045
Come on. Let's eat. I'm starving.

73
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,164
Is that a...

74
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:21,867
Did you know that by expanding
the brain's control regions,

75
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:26,443
one could influence a person's
thoughts, emotions, and memories?

76
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,146
It's suffering!

77
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,382
They're all... Players.

78
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:42,913
Oh, my god.

79
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,899
This is horrible.

80
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:56,281
He won't get away with this...
not if I can do anything about it.

81
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:58,041
Don't worry.

82
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:00,685
You'll be okay. I'm gonna save you.

83
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:05,953
Time to see what everyone's up to.

84
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:09,632
Ooh. This guy's dreaming about spica again.

85
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,457
His b-13 and b-14 fields are way off the scale.

86
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:15,587
Look at 16 getting up there too.

87
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,178
He's really excited.

88
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,017
It's only the third experiment.

89
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,742
Maybe it's a coincidence.

90
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,602
No, it's definitely the induced emotion circuit.

91
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:27,939
He's over the threshold now because of the
frequency at which the imagery's occurring.

92
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:31,506
Hmm. Then we have to keep monitoring him.

93
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,023
I'll put him on the list.

94
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,312
Hey, I was wondering...

95
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,916
what's happening with school?

96
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,487
What about it?

97
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:42,317
It's just that you were supposed to start high
school last year, and it'd suck if you got too far behind.

98
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,899
Yeah, well, I don't know.

99
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,236
They said something about me
having to go to school in the city.

100
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:51,551
It's kind of a temporary thing
they set up in an old building.

101
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,401
Middle-schoolers, high-schoolers... everyone's from S.A.O.

102
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,308
Now departing.

103
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:02,076
You can get in without taking the test, and once
you graduate, you can take the college entrance exams.

104
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:03,737
Really? Huh.

105
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:07,464
If you ask me, that's a pretty good deal.

106
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,617
But it sucks they're cramming you together like that.

107
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,782
I get why they're doing it.

108
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,262
When you think about it, we were all trapped
inside that death game for more than two years,

109
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,359
so no one knows what that experience did to our minds.

110
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,220
This is how they keep an eye on us.

111
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,704
Seriously?

112
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,756
If I wanted to get into a normal
high school now, it'd be way too hard.

113
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:33,726
I'd have to spend a whole year in cram school,
but then i'd basically be starting over from scratch.

114
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:38,472
I could always just take the exams now
and see what happens, but I doubt I'd pass.

115
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,165
What are you saying? You'd totally pass!

116
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,374
You're smart, and you've got good grades.

117
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:44,914
My grades used to be good.

118
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,274
I haven't studied for two years, remember?

119
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,291
I've got a great idea! I can be your tutor!

120
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:54,089
Oh, sweet. Then you can help me
with math and information technology.

121
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,224
There it is...

122
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,342
...the system console.

123
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,887
They didn't see me. Good.

124
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:30,526
Please work.

125
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,296
This is it.

126
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,502
Wow!

127
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:54,538
That's a big hospital!

128
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,204
The inside's amazing, too...

129
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:57,411
like a hotel.

130
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,359
"Asuna Yuki."

131
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,829
She used her real-life name for her avatar.

132
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,562
That's not something a lot of people do.

133
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,364
I can't believe you know that.

134
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:30,828
Asuna's the only person I ever
met who played under her real name.

135
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,017
I'll introduce you.

136
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,644
This is Asuna,

137
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,077
knights of the blood oath, second in command.

138
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:42,958
They call her "lightning flash."

139
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,464
I could never match her speed in
battle or her accuracy with the sword.

140
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:51,038
Asuna, this is my sister, Suguha.

141
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,392
Uh... hello, Asuna.

142
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:55,748
Nice to meet you.

143
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:06,009
Aaah! Ohh! Ugh! Ohh!

144
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,001
Who are you?

145
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,353
You want to tell us what you're doing here?

146
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,168
Hey, let me go of me.

147
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,455
Sugou's a very good friend of mine.

148
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:20,682
I have his permission to be here and was
just about to leave when you grabbed me.

149
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,885
No one told me you were gonna be here today.

150
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:26,014
Did you know about her?

151
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,308
Uh, no.

152
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:31,099
All I know is that he doesn't
want anyone seeing this stuff ever.

153
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:32,289
Hmm.

154
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,220
Hang on a sec.

155
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:38,869
This is the girl... you know, the one Sugou
keeps locked up at the top of the world tree.

156
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,647
Right. Right.

157
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:41,926
I heard about her.

158
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:47,608
I don't think it's fair how the boss
gets to have all the fun with this cute girl.

159
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:49,030
Aah!

160
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,038
Oh, come on.

161
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,272
Stop struggling.

162
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,058
Stop it!

163
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,217
Let me go, you monster!

164
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:56,492
Oh, don't be so mean.

165
00:12:56,677 --> 00:13:00,273
After all, you interrupted our
deep-sense mapping experiment.

166
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:02,380
You're supposed to be scientists, right?!

167
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,722
All this... it's wrong!

168
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:08,806
It's illegal to mess with people's
minds... illegal and unethical!

169
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:14,191
Well, it's more ethical than sticking electrical
probes into the brain of some poor animal,

170
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:15,217
wouldn't you say?

171
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:18,464
Our experiments are just dreams,

172
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:19,020
that's all.

173
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:20,417
He's right.

174
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:25,543
Sometimes we show them the most wonderful
dream... dreams you wish you'd never wake up from.

175
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,325
I wish I could have that.

176
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:30,246
You're insane.

177
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,741
The boss is out on business,

178
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:33,290
right?

179
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,968
Log out and go see what he wants us to do with her.

180
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:38,048
Ah, fine. Whatever.

181
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:41,989
Listen, though... until I get
back, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

182
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,118
Oh, yeah, sure.

183
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,421
Hurry up and get going.

184
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,523
You can't keep me here!

185
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,223
Put me down right now!

186
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,549
I'm sorry, but I can't.

187
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:56,831
The boss would kill me if I let you go.

188
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,308
Oh, wait, I have it.

189
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,462
Why don't you and I take electro-drugs?

190
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:04,497
I'm so bored with dolls, but you
look like someone I can have fun with.

191
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,505
Stop it!

192
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,441
No!

193
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,136
Stop!

194
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:22,739
Aaaaaaaaaah!

195
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:23,652
Okay!

196
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,830
I'm putting you down! Here's me putting you down!

197
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:28,660
Geez!

198
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:32,096
Next time I'll remember to turn my pain sensors off.

199
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:35,442
Okay. What happened here?

200
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,222
Hmm? What? Nothing.

201
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,621
Uh, nothing happened. So, what did the boss say?

202
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,258
Oh, he was so pissed.

203
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:46,548
He said we had to put her back in the cage upstairs,
change the passcode, and keep an eye on her 24/7.

204
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:48,179
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

205
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,829
I was just about to have some fun.

206
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:53,348
Okay. I say we walk her back instead of teleporting her.

207
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,687
I want to enjoy this feeling as long as I can.

208
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,305
You know what I think?

209
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,015
You're a perv.

210
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:01,110
Huh?

211
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,860
Stop struggling. It won't do you any good.

212
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,278
Don't fall off him!

213
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,065
Let me go!

214
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,867
Good one.

215
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:11,710
She's really pretty.

216
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,573
I feel sorry for her that she hasn't woken up yet.

217
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,984
I don't know if coming here was such a good idea.

218
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,105
I'm so confused.

219
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,085
I don't know how I feel.

220
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,239
I thought if I met her, i'd figure it out.

221
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,330
But now I don't know what I want.

222
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,086
Do I want to be a good sister...

223
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,893
Or... what?

224
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,803
Kazuto.

225
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,997
Don't go anywhere. I hope we
have another chance to hang out.

226
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,707
This won't stop me, Kirito...

227
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:22,056
No way.

228
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,237
I'll never give up.

229
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:26,656
I'll find a way to get out of here.

230
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,495
Hey, Leafa.

231
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:50,357
What's wrong? You okay?

232
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,066
Unh-unh.

233
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,046
I'm not okay at all.

234
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:01,622
I just... I just... I just got my heart broken!

235
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:05,061
I...

236
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:07,731
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:10,956
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

238
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:16,882
We just met. And I know it's not cool for players
to drag their real-life problems into the game.

239
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:18,711
It's okay to cry.

240
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,467
Doesn't matter if you're here or in the real world.

241
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:23,287
There's no rule.

242
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,672
Even in a game, you can show your feelings if you want.

243
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:29,460
Kirito...

244
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,308
I'm in love with my brother.

245
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:40,107
And that's something I can't tell anyone about... ever.

246
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:44,859
I have to Bury these feelings deep in my heart.

247
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:49,244
Maybe then, someday, I can forget.

248
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,591
I'm okay now.

249
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:03,659
Thanks for the pep talk, Kirito.

250
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,882
You're really sweet. You know that?

251
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:10,967
Uh, yeah, well, you're probably the
only person who thinks that about me.

252
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,374
You want to log off for today?

253
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:15,875
I can make it the rest of the way myself.

254
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:16,954
No.

255
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:20,852
I mean, I've come this far, so
I might as well go all the way.

256
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:26,388
Come on. Let's go.

257
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,442
Yui, you here?

258
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,480
Good morning.

259
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,314
I hope you both slept well.

260
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,944
Good morning, Yui.

261
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:50,053
Hey, I didn't get the chance to ask you
yesterday, but, like, do navi pixies ever sleep?

262
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,124
Oh, no.

263
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,379
See, whenever daddy logs out of the game, I shut down
my input circuits and process the data I've acquired.

264
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,804
You could consider it a little
like human sleep, but it's not.

265
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,790
Then how come you yawned?

266
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:06,890
Oh. Well, that's what humans
do during their boot-up sequence.

267
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:10,019
When daddy yawns, it usually lasts for eight seconds.

268
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:12,418
Please keep the weird trivia to yourself.

269
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,279
You ready to go?

270
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:16,295
Yep.

271
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,986
There's tons of people here!

272
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,869
I guess it really is the center of Alfheim.

273
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:28,437
It seems all the fairy races the world over are here.

274
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,389
Look how they're all getting along.

275
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:33,261
And he flew right off!

276
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:43,309
Whoa.

277
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,679
There it is... the world tree.

278
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:01,385
Yeah, and it looks even more amazing up close, doesn't it?

279
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:05,627
Um... i heard there's supposed
to be a city up there at the top.

280
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:07,088
What else?

281
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:11,958
Oberon, the fairy king, lives there,
along with the alf, the fairies of light.

282
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:16,614
And they say the first race to get to
the top and see the king will become an alf.

283
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:20,523
Has anyone ever tried climbing up the side of that thing?

284
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:25,861
They made the whole perimeter of the trunk off
limits so a player can't even get close enough to try.

285
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,790
And if you just fly straight up,

286
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:31,440
the flight limit of your wings would
expire before you even got halfway.

287
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,942
I heard about some players who tried.

288
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:37,143
They got more than halfway up
by piggybacking on each other.

289
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:42,950
Yeah, I heard about them, all right, but they could
only make it up to the lowest branches before bailing.

290
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:47,162
The g.M.S freaked out and fixed
it so no one could ever do it again.

291
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:48,329
Know what they did?

292
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,325
They put a barrier up there just above the clouds.

293
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:52,635
Interesting.

294
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,270
All right, then.

295
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,036
Let's head to the base of the trunk.

296
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,448
Right behind you.

297
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,810
Once we pass through that gate,

298
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:20,238
we're in the world's heart...

299
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:22,175
the central district of arun.

300
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,014
What, Yui?

301
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:34,197
Is something wrong?

302
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,295
Mommy.

303
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,799
It's mommy! She's here!

304
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,773
Are you sure?

305
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,005
Yes, I'm positive!

306
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,663
Hey, I...

307
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:48,673
I scanned again, and it's mommy's player I.D.!

308
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,646
Her coordinates are above us in the tree!

309
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:56,931
Kirito!

310
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:59,369
Wait!

311
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,107
Kirito!

312
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:04,277
Kirito!

313
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,518
Next time: "The Grand Quest".
