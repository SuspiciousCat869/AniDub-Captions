1
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:56,882
It's been almost two years since this game of death began.

2
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:59,608
I'm still going it alone,

3
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,301
fighting solo on the front lines.

4
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:09,118
Akihiko Kayaba's out there somewhere, watching.

5
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,652
I wonder what he's thinking right now.

6
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:18,158
Guess I'll head home.

7
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,958
You got to be kidding.

8
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,137
No way!

9
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:46,690
Th-this is an S-class rare item!

10
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:50,408
Holy crap, this is the first time I've ever seen one!

11
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:55,285
Hey, Kirito, don't you already
have all the money you need?

12
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,129
I'll buy it, but I'm saying
wouldn't you rather have it for dinner?

13
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:00,463
Sure. It's just...

14
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:03,428
well, who knows if I'll ever get another one?

15
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:04,460
So keep it!

16
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,500
What's the point?

17
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:10,276
Look, to prepare an item like this, you
need to have a high-enough cooking skill.

18
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:12,246
Yeah, you're right.

19
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,770
If we try, we'll just burn it.

20
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,621
Hmm.

21
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,575
Kirito.

22
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:24,933
I've got my chef.

23
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,466
Uh, what chef?

24
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,557
Uh... hey!

25
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:30,597
Asuna's here!

26
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,195
Seeing you in a dump like this is beyond weird!

27
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:34,848
Oh, save it!

28
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:36,604
I came to see if you were still alive!

29
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,059
You know, it's almost time for the next boss raid!

30
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,529
I'm on your friend list.

31
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,753
If you want to know I'm alive, just check that.

32
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,009
Whatever. Now I know you're alive.

33
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:46,988
Anyway, what are you up to?

34
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,722
What's all this about a chef?

35
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,388
Oh, yeah... that.

36
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:53,384
I was wondering what your cooking skill level is.

37
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,035
Hmm.

38
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,640
Totally maxed it out last week.

39
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:57,506
What?!

40
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:58,569
Cool, huh?

41
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:02,020
Well, if you're that good, I need a favor.

42
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:02,665
Hmm?

43
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,760
Y-You got a ragout rabbit?!

44
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,712
I'll trade you.

45
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:15,200
All you have to do is cook it up for
me, and I'll let you have a little bite.

46
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,187
Half.

47
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:19,418
Deal?

48
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:22,883
Yeah. Deal.

49
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:24,837
All right!

50
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,081
Sorry, pal.

51
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,298
You heard the lady.

52
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:31,291
Guess I'm keeping it.

53
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,856
Yeah, but you could at least let me taste it, right?!

54
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,277
I thought we were tight, man!

55
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,835
I'll write a review for you, but only two pages.

56
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:38,732
Promise!

57
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,220
Damn! That is cold!

58
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,067
So, where am I gonna cook it?

59
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,181
Oh. Well...

60
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,341
I'm guessing not your place, right?

61
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,032
You even own any cookware?

62
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:54,224
Okay.

63
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:59,015
Because the main ingredient is special, I
won't have a problem if we used my place this time.

64
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,672
Thank you for escorting me.

65
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,086
You may go.

66
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:06,008
I'm sorry, ma'am.

67
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,431
But I can't allow you to go
home with such a shady character.

68
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,058
I don't know the extent of his
shadiness, but I know he's quite skilled.

69
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:18,664
In fact, he's 10 levels above you, Kuradeel.

70
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,572
Are you implying I'm inferior to him?

71
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:23,464
Oh, I know.

72
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,436
He's one of those beaters, isn't

73
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,296
yeah? What if I am?

74
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,091
You shouldn't go with him, ma'am!

75
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,429
All him and his kind care about are themselves!

76
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:35,496
You can't expect anything good
to come from scum like that!

77
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:37,864
Hey! What's going on?

78
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,676
That's lightning flash Asuna!

79
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:40,485
You're right!

80
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:41,826
She's really cute!

81
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,384
Listen.

82
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,131
I'm second-in-command here.

83
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,331
I am ordering you to go home.

84
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,091
Are you sure about this?!

85
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,504
Of course!

86
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:03,934
Whoa.

87
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,183
There's hardly anyone around.

88
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,464
It's... really cool.

89
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,975
If you like it so much, why don't you move here?

90
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,733
I don't know. This floor seems way out of my price range.

91
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,341
Anyway, what's the deal with that guy back there?

92
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,509
He was mad-dogging me like crazy.

93
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,805
Oh, he's just my bodyguard.

94
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:26,182
The guild's new policy says all
higher-ups have to have an escort.

95
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:28,796
It's lame.

96
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:31,625
The guild didn't have all these
rules and regulations before.

97
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,579
We used to be really small.

98
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:36,648
Then more and more people joined

99
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:41,262
after that, when we became the strongest
guild, everything started getting weird.

100
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,728
Well, I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it than it

101
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,906
anyway, we better hurry! It's getting dark.

102
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh. Okay!

103
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,811
Wow. You've got a killer pad!

104
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:04,538
Hey. How much did all this cost?

105
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,418
Mm.

106
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:09,604
The room and the furniture cost around 4 million col.

107
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,980
Anyway, make yourself at home.

108
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,957
Uh, sure.

109
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,397
Holy moly!

110
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,591
4 million!

111
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,941
Man, that's a lot of col!

112
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,509
I'm sure I've earned that much,
too, but blowing it all on a flat?

113
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,560
Are you gonna take off your coat, or what?

114
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,860
Oh! Yeah. Sorry.

115
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,920
So, this is a legendary s-class ingredient.

116
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:47,898
Okay!

117
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,321
How do you want this cooked up?

118
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,061
I thought I'd leave that decision up to the chef.

119
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,466
In that case...

120
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,923
How about we make it into a stew?!

121
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:57,438
"Ragout!"

122
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:00,139
That's pretty much the definition of a stew.

123
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:15,641
In real life, there'd be a lot
more steps involved in preparing this.

124
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:19,135
Cooking in S.A.O. Is so simple.

125
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,369
Believe it or not, it's kind of boring.

126
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,380
That takes care of that!

127
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:26,653
Now for the next step.

128
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:30,012
I was thinking about making a couple side dishes.

129
00:09:56,151 --> 00:10:00,718
I've been here two years, and this is
the first time I've ever eaten s-class food.

130
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:04,239
I'm so happy I survived long enough to eat that.

131
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,035
Yeah. Me, too.

132
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,537
It's so weird.

133
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:14,290
Sometimes... I don't know... I get this
feeling that, like, I've lived here my entire life.

134
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,808
You ever feel like that?

135
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:18,072
Yeah, almost all the time.

136
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:21,519
In fact, there's days I don't even
think about the real world at all.

137
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:23,545
And it's not just me.

138
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:28,803
These days, more and more people don't seem to care about
clearing the game and getting back to the real world.

139
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:33,309
I noticed there's not that many players
out there fighting on the front lines...

140
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,621
maybe 500, if that.

141
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,115
I guess they're used to it.

142
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:40,171
They don't care anymore.

143
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:44,638
Yeah, well, I want to go back.

144
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,476
I mean, there's things I haven't done yet.

145
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,715
I have to!

146
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:51,820
I know how you feel.

147
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:57,246
And when you stop to consider it, there's everyone
else, right... all the people who still count on us?

148
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,113
If we give up, it's not fair to them.

149
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:03,150
Mm? Uh...

150
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,533
unh-unh! Don't go there!

151
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,201
Uh... what?

152
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:09,816
I've seen that same look on guys's faces before,

153
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,000
and always right before they propose to me.

154
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,460
Mm?

155
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:18,701
You should see your face. I guess
you never had a girlfriend before!

156
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,544
Eh, whatever! I'm a solo player.

157
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,126
And you're okay with that?

158
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:31,897
You don't ever want to join a guild?

159
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:32,819
Uh...

160
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,512
I know how the beta players don't fit in with the guilds.

161
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:37,274
But...

162
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:42,343
Ever since we got to floor 70,
things are getting more dangerous.

163
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:45,236
The monster algorithms are even more irregular.

164
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:47,586
Mm.

165
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,749
There are things a solo player can't handle...

166
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,528
unexpected things.

167
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:55,302
Sometimes, warping out isn't an option.

168
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,202
Yeah, well, I'm pretty careful.

169
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,388
I work better by myself, anyway.

170
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:05,273
Besides, most of the time, instead of
helping, party members just get in the way.

171
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:06,498
Oh, yeah?

172
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,041
M-My bad.

173
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,846
Everyone except for you.

174
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:12,671
Good.

175
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,153
So, what do you say you and me team up again?

176
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,511
Black's my lucky color this week, anyway.

177
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,889
Hold up a sec! Don't you have stuff you have to
do for your guild?! You can't just bail on them!

178
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,448
It's not like we have any leveling quotas to meet.

179
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,171
Well, then, what about your bodyguard?

180
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,356
I'll just ditch him!

181
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:31,047
Uh...

182
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,876
The front lines <i>aredangerous,</i> though.

183
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,604
Okay! Fine!

184
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:08,322
Mm!

185
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:14,997
Well, I suppose thanks are in
order for the meal, so thank you!

186
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,951
Thank <i>youfor cooking</i> maybe next time...

187
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:19,598
what am I saying?

188
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,251
I'll never get my hands on something like that again.

189
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,485
No way! You can make anything
yummy if you have the skills to cook!

190
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:33,199
Looking at this world...

191
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:39,753
And seeing what it's become since we got here...
is this really what Akihiko Kayaba wanted to create?

192
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:51,562
Where is she?

193
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:55,381
Huh?

194
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:58,375
Aah! Watch out!

195
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:06,172
What is this thing?

196
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,001
Hmm. Squishy.

197
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:34,114
Um, hey! Good morning, Asuna!

198
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:41,860
What's wrong?

199
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,802
Why are you behaving like this,
ma'am? I'm only following orders.

200
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,321
Please, let's go back to headquarters.

201
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,840
I won't, especially not with you!

202
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,565
And why were you lurking around
my house in the morning, huh?!

203
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:00,299
You have a bad habit of leaving without any warning.

204
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,644
So for the past month, part of my mission
has been to keep an eye on you in selmburg.

205
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:05,359
W-What?!

206
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,561
Who ordered this?

207
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:07,959
It wasn't the commander!

208
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,607
With all due respect, ma'am, my mission is to
guard you, no matter where you are, including your home.

209
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,655
No, it doesn't, you idiot!

210
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:20,289
I wish you would be a little more
understanding about this, ma'am.

211
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,253
Now, then, let's return to headquarters.

212
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,093
Sorry.

213
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:33,931
But I'll be borrowing your second-in-command for
the day, so you'll just have to make do without her.

214
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,411
I'll take responsibility for her security.

215
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,643
Don't worry... it's not like we're going on a boss raid.

216
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,996
You can go. She'll be fine with me.

217
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,457
Insolent punk!

218
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,199
Do you know who I am?!

219
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,961
I'm a member of the glorious knights of the blood oath!

220
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,837
A low-level player like you couldn't protect her!

221
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,166
I can do a better job of it than you.

222
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,236
You've got a big mouth, kid.

223
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:02,078
So I'm going to give you a chance to
prove just how tough you really are.

224
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:07,877
Mm-hmm.

225
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,348
Are you sure?

226
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,411
Don't worry.

227
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,376
I'll tell the commander how this happened.

228
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:21,408
Please move to a safe distance, ma'am.

229
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:25,834
I'm going to prove beyond any doubt
that I am the only one who can protect you!

230
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:32,959
Kirito's gonna duel a guy from
the knights of the blood oath!

231
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,264
This'll be fun to watch!

232
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:21,923
I can't believe it!

233
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:29,145
Holy crap!

234
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:30,393
He destroyed his sword!

235
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:31,650
How did he do that?!

236
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:36,479
If you want to try again with another
weapon, I'll be glad to take you on.

237
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,566
Or we can call it a day.

238
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,143
Asuna!

239
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:54,045
I don't know how, but he cheated!

240
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:56,166
You saw how he destroyed my sword!

241
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:58,184
He must've used some kind of trick!

242
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:02,293
There's no other way I could've
lost to a pathetic beater like him!

243
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:04,144
Kuradeel.

244
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,244
As second-in-command of the knights of the blood oath,

245
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:10,152
I'm relieving you of your duties as my bodyguard.

246
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:13,917
You're to return to headquarters
and wait for further orders.

247
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,539
You... you can't be serious!

248
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:17,920
Damn you!

249
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,675
Teleport... Grandzam.

250
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:48,723
I'm so sorry.

251
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,852
I didn't mean to drag you into that.

252
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:52,688
No, it's no big deal.

253
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,179
I'm worried about you.

254
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:55,483
Are you okay?

255
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:56,627
Yeah, I am.

256
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:59,385
The guild's getting on my nerves, is all, maybe 'cause

257
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,151
I've been so focused on clearing the game,

258
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,847
or maybe 'cause I'm so demanding
of the other members in the guild.

259
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:08,969
Yeah, I get that.

260
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,369
But you didn't have much of a choice.

261
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:16,634
Think about it. If you'd done things any different,
you think your guild would've gotten as far as they have?

262
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:22,330
I mean, what do I know? I just
mess around as a solo player, right?

263
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:27,216
The thing is, if you take a day off to
team up with a loser like me, so what?

264
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:28,963
That's your decision to make.

265
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:32,038
In my opinion, no one's got the right to complain.

266
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,231
Screw.

267
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:35,963
Em.

268
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:37,297
Wow!

269
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:39,341
Thank you for your opinion on the subject!

270
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,125
Okay!

271
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,502
I accept your offer, and I'll be
taking a day off from the guild!

272
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:45,155
You can play forward today.

273
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,640
Huh?!

274
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:46,857
W-Wait a second!

275
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,825
Aren't we supposed to take turns as forward?!

276
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,486
Sorry!

277
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,122
It's my day off, remember?

278
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,567
Oh, come on!

279
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:22,752
Having someone along who knows how
to fight sure makes things easier.

280
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,268
Switch with me, Kirito!

281
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,818
Uh... yeah! Right!

282
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,869
Kirito, look.

283
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,588
Is that what I think it is?

284
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:56,937
Uh-huh.

285
00:20:58,327 --> 00:20:59,870
We found the boss room.

286
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:01,998
What do we do?

287
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,191
You think we should look inside?

288
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,259
Well, we came all this way.

289
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:09,183
Besides, boss monsters never leave the rooms they guard.

290
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,636
I think we'll be okay if we just take a peek.

291
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,232
O-Okay.

292
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:16,641
Have a teleport crystal ready, just in case.

293
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:17,640
Right.

294
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,709
Okay. Are you ready?

295
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:22,328
Mm-hmm.

296
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:38,182
Next time: "The Blue-Eyed Demon".
