1
00:00:00,524 --> 00:00:04,873
If you want her, you'll have to use
your dual blades to take her from us.

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,588
If you can defeat me in combat,
you'll be free to take Asuna.

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,653
On the other hand, if you lose,

4
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:13,998
you will join the knights of the blood oath.

5
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:19,012
Yeah, okay.

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,919
If you want to settle this with swords, that's fine by me.

7
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:23,937
We'll have ourselves a duel, then.

8
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:30,221
Better hurry, folks! The good seats are going fast!

9
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:31,460
Who's next?!

10
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:33,907
My god, you're such an idiot!

11
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,521
How could you agree to a duel?!

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,633
Okay! Calm down! I'm sorry!

13
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,912
It's not like he gave me any other choice!

14
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:43,893
The other day, when you used your dual-wielding skill...

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,404
I've never seen anything like that before.

16
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:49,883
The thing is, the commander has his own unique skill, too.

17
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:50,687
I know.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,840
I've seen it a bunch of times myself.

19
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:54,395
The divine blade.

20
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,709
It maximizes his offensive and defensive moves.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,808
His attack is strong, but his defense is incredible.

22
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:05,454
No one's ever seen the commander's h.P.
Bar dip down into the yellow zone before.

23
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:09,680
His invincibility is way beyond the normal game balance!

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,967
I know.

25
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:12,908
What if you lose?

26
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:15,615
I don't care if I don't get my leave of absence.

27
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,952
I care about you having to join
the knights of the blood oath.

28
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:22,464
Well, I'm not planning on losing easily.

29
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,328
Hmph.

30
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:03,257
I'm sorry about this, Kirito.

31
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,117
I didn't think this would be such a big deal.

32
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:07,253
This is crazy.

33
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,224
Maybe I can get a cut of the tickets?

34
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:10,891
No.

35
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,203
But when we're finished, you'll
become an official member of the guild.

36
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:16,617
I'll consider this your first mission.

37
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,317
His shield?!

38
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,855
Your reaction time is very impressive.

39
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:13,404
Yeah, and your defense is impregnable.

40
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,149
Not yet!

41
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:26,617
Give it time!

42
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:40,412
Be careful.

43
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,124
Now's my chance!

44
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:40,155
Uh... don't you guys have uniforms that aren't so flashy?

45
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:43,397
Actually, that's one of our less-flashy ones.

46
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:45,059
You look great!

47
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:50,836
I'm in a guild.

48
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,292
I guess it's sort of my fault, isn't it?

49
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:56,804
No, this is a good opportunity.

50
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,797
As a solo player, I got as far as I could go.

51
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,260
That makes me feel a little better.

52
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,201
Hey. Kirito?

53
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,571
Why do you avoid guilds...

54
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:09,839
And people?

55
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,343
I hope you don't mind my asking.

56
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:18,079
I mean, it's not because you're a beta
tester or because you have unique skills, is it?

57
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,764
You do care about people.

58
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,796
It was a long time ago...

59
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,331
About a year or so.

60
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:33,605
Up to now, that was the only guild I was in.

61
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,610
It was small. Including me, there were six of us in it.

62
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,857
They called themselves the moonlit black cats.

63
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:44,257
As players, they were good.

64
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,648
But their levels were way lower than mine.

65
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:51,296
And I thought if I told them what my level
was, they wouldn't have wanted me around.

66
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:54,433
So I decided to keep my mouth shut about it.

67
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,084
And I joined up with them.

68
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:02,122
I'd watch them messing around, having fun,
and I guess I wanted to be part of that, too.

69
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,875
Then one day...

70
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,037
I'm the reason the whole guild was wiped out.

71
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,077
If I hadn't hidden the fact that I was a beater,

72
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:23,785
I could've convinced them how
dangerous that trap really was.

73
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:25,476
I killed them.

74
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,401
Sachi... all of them!

75
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:48,640
I'm not gonna die. Got that?

76
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,436
I can't die, because...

77
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,962
I have to protect you.

78
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:14,298
I got to train?

79
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,553
That's right.

80
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,081
You, me, and one other guy are gonna form a party.

81
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:22,188
Then we're all gonna go clear the dungeon on this floor.

82
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:23,951
Uh, hold on, Godfrey!

83
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,420
Kirito and I are already in...

84
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,272
I can't do anything about it, ma'am.

85
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,720
Besides, as second-in-command,
you know we can't ignore the rules.

86
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,621
If he's gonna be joining us,

87
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:37,195
then it's my job as commander of the front
lines to take the kid out and evaluate his skills.

88
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:41,587
But that's ridiculous! He doesn't
need evaluation! He's stronger than you!

89
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:45,552
Kid, in 30 minutes, I want to see you at the western gate!

90
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:46,514
Ooh-ah!

91
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:55,238
We finally had a chance to be alone.

92
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,137
I'll be back soon.

93
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,589
Think you can wait for me?

94
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,895
Mm-hmm.

95
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,223
Just be careful.

96
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,701
Hey, kid! We're waiting for you!

97
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,375
Are you serious?

98
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:20,089
Yep.

99
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,431
Look at it this way...

100
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:26,636
we're all in the same guild, so I figured now's a
good time as any for you guys to bury the hatchet!

101
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:34,184
About the other day... I apologize for my behavior.

102
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,550
I was rude to you, and I...

103
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,776
I promise it won't happen again.

104
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:40,857
Yeah. Sure.

105
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,448
All right, ladies. Time to focus.

106
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:48,665
Today, I'll be checking out how
you react to dangerous situations.

107
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,989
So I'm gonna need you to hand over
all the crystals in your storage.

108
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,229
Even my teleport crystals?

109
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:56,142
Mm-hmm!

110
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:06,481
Yeah, okay.

111
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:11,086
Awesome!

112
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,797
Now, let's go clear a dungeon!!

113
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:15,847
Yay.

114
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,502
This looks like a good place to take a break!

115
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,727
Chow time, ladies!

116
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:44,562
Say "ah!"

117
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,283
We've been poisoned!

118
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,107
The hell's going on.

119
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,641
You packed the water, Kuradeel.

120
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,206
What'd you do?

121
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:29,557
You bastard!

122
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,644
Antidote crystals. Hurry!

123
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:39,749
Poor, sad, old Godfrey.

124
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,497
I always knew you were a colossal idiot.

125
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,278
But this proves you're even dumber than I thought!

126
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,522
D-Don't do this!

127
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,746
No! Stop it!

128
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,612
Here's my plan.

129
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:04,360
Our party was walking along, when...

130
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:09,882
We were attacked by this gang of criminal
players who appeared out of nowhere!

131
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,267
You both fought hard, but you were killed in battle.

132
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:19,590
It was just me against all of them, and, somehow, I
courageously and single-handedly fought them all off!

133
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,537
You know, I just killed an
innocent bystander because of you.

134
00:12:57,562 --> 00:13:00,126
How am I gonna live with myself?

135
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,661
From over here, you looked like
you were having a blast doing it.

136
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:07,476
Why the hell would a guy like you
join the knights of the blood oath?

137
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:10,980
You'd be more at home with one of the criminal guilds.

138
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,363
What an interesting observation.

139
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,666
You have sharp eyes.

140
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,003
You're with laughing coffin, the murder guild!

141
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:25,081
That's where I got the skills
to paralyze bastards like you.

142
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:26,996
Where's my head?

143
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:30,121
I better stop talking, or the poison will wear off.

144
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,730
And we wouldn't want that.

145
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,370
Time to finish you off for good!

146
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,051
The poison's not wearing off!

147
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,510
How's it feel?

148
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,397
Come on!

149
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:53,525
I want to know how it feels,
knowing you're about to die like a dog.

150
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:54,497
What?

151
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,949
Is your tongue paralyzed, too?

152
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,188
Is this it.

153
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,883
Is this where I'm gonna die?

154
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,335
Come on, now!

155
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:11,150
It's your last chance to say something.

156
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:13,963
You really are going to die!

157
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:37,828
Huh!

158
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,584
Why do you keep struggling?

159
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,744
Are you afraid of dying after all?

160
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:42,632
No.

161
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:44,827
I'm just not...

162
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:46,059
Ready yet!

163
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,733
Is that so?!

164
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:51,559
That's the way I like it!

165
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:02,553
Die.

166
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,174
Die!

167
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,840
Di-i-i-i-i-e-e-e-e!!

168
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,673
Heal!

169
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:24,928
I made it!

170
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,256
I made it in time!

171
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:28,701
Thank god.

172
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,774
I made it!

173
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:37,106
I was tracking your position on the map the whole time.

174
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,394
And then I saw Godfrey disappear.

175
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,086
I got worried something happened!

176
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,597
But you're alive!

177
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:46,336
I'm not dreaming, am I?

178
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:47,846
No.

179
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,458
You're not.

180
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,384
Hang on.

181
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,353
I'll finish this.

182
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,911
Uh, A-Asuna, I-I can explain everything!

183
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:06,406
We were just training when all
of a sudden, there was this...

184
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,345
Damn you!

185
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,995
I give up! I surrender!

186
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,501
Please don't kill me!

187
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,729
I'll leave the guild! You'll
never see me again! I promise!

188
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:26,777
Please!

189
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,814
I don't want to die!

190
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:44,862
The oldest trick in the book, and you fell for it, bitch!

191
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:05,183
God damn you. You murdered me.

192
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:25,817
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:27,454
This was...

194
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,957
All my fault, wasn't it?

195
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,448
Asuna.

196
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,816
I'm sorry!

197
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:41,571
But I...

198
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,295
I should...

199
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,924
Stay away from you...

200
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,413
for your sake.

201
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,577
Asuna...

202
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,896
My life belongs to you.

203
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,698
I'll give it up for you.

204
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:17,499
I want to stay with you until the end.

205
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,964
And I promise I'll do anything to protect you, too...

206
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,191
Forever... no matter what.

207
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:26,819
I swear.

208
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:32,270
I'll do everything I can to make
sure you get back to the real world.

209
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,821
Asuna, could I...

210
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:39,243
Stay with you for the night?

211
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,681
Mm-hmm.

212
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:01,268
Okay.

213
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:26,958
D-Don't look.

214
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,254
Not yet, anyway.

215
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,144
W-What are you waiting for? Get undressed.

216
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:36,892
Don't just sit there!

217
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,643
I-It's embarrassing!

218
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:40,833
No, wait! I didn't...

219
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:43,049
I mean, I-I just...

220
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:48,358
All I wanted was to spend the night
with you tonight, and not the, uh...

221
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,833
The other thing.

222
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:50,366
Hm?!

223
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,158
You... y-you...

224
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,948
You <i>dummy!!</i>

225
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,839
Hey.

226
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,318
Whatcha smiling about?

227
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:28,341
Mm...

228
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:33,166
I was just having a dream about my old life.

229
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:35,636
It was weird.

230
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:43,683
In the dream I had, everything in Aincrad, everything
that happened, and meeting you, was just that... a dream!

231
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:45,169
And I was so scared!

232
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,822
But it wasn't.

233
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:48,571
Thank god it wasn't.

234
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,391
Now, that sounds weird.

235
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,084
Don't you want to go back?

236
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:53,624
Of course I do.

237
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:58,135
I do! It's just, I don't want
my life here to disappear, is all.

238
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:01,480
The last two years have been very special to me.

239
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,481
I realize that now.

240
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,108
Listen. Kirito?

241
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:10,807
I was thinking...

242
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,557
Maybe we could leave the front lines for a while.

243
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:14,454
What?

244
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,528
I'm scared.

245
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:22,057
I feel like if we return to the battlefield
now, something bad's gonna happen again!

246
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:25,046
Or maybe I'm just tired of it all.

247
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:27,922
I know what you mean.

248
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,361
I guess I am, too.

249
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:35,779
In the southwest of floor 22,

250
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,688
there's this tiny, little village by a lake and a forest.

251
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,374
We could get a house together.

252
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:43,969
And then...

253
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:45,916
And then what?

254
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:49,007
Then...

255
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:51,993
We get married.

256
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,324
Okay!

257
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:38,920
Next time: "The Girl of the Morning Dew".
