00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,525
Hi, there!

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,757
Time for this week's mmo stream. You
just saw a promo of today's featured game,

3
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:25,434
and this is what last week's launch day looked like.

4
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:27,777
Can you guess what everyone's waiting in line for?

5
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:29,619
"Sword art online"!

6
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:33,140
The first person in line said
they camped out for three days.

7
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,217
Hey, but, if you're a hard-core gamer, that's what you do.

8
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,737
On today's episode of the mmo stream,

9
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:41,769
we'll be covering the internationally
famous "sword art online",

10
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:42,933
A.K.A.

11
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:43,897
"SAO"!

12
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:49,289
Up to now, none of the nervegear software we've seen
has taken advantage of the possibilities of the hardware.

13
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:49,994
Hey!

14
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:51,499
I'm off to practice now!

15
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,145
See you later, okay?

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,078
But "SAO" was made by the inventor
of nervegear, Akihiko Kayaba.

17
00:00:56,103 --> 00:01:00,843
Heck, this is the vr mmorpg that me
and everyone else have been waiting for!

18
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:03,036
The beta testers say it's incredible!

19
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,773
I wish I could have gotten one!

20
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,969
The first pressing was limited to only 10,000 copies.

21
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:12,672
Those fans in line snapped them up,
and online, the game sold out in seconds.

22
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:29,545
Link start!

23
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,572
Hello, world.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,408
I'm back.

25
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,544
Well, I told him, so it's his deal.

26
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:35,830
Why don't we form a party?

27
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,077
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

28
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:40,310
Oh, come on. It'll be great.

29
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:44,086
Huh?

30
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:47,446
Hey, bro! Wait up!

31
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,870
What's up?

32
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,005
Hoo!

33
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:56,202
You act like you know your way around here.

34
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,006
You were in the beta test, weren't you?

35
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,357
Uh, yeah.

36
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:00,238
Cool.

37
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,811
Today's my first day.

38
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:04,575
So, could you give me some tips on the lower floors?

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,895
Yeah, I don't know if...

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,420
Oh, please?! I'm begging you!

41
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,962
Look, my name's Klein. Good to meet you.

42
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:14,348
All right. I'm Kirito.

43
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:16,072
Aaaaaah!

44
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:16,802
Ugh!

45
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,155
Kill me now!

46
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,723
Oh, come on. Seriously?

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,041
You can't feel any pain.

48
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,067
Uh? Oh, yeah. You're right. Sorry. Habit.

49
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,599
Remember what I said?

50
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,914
The first move is the most important.

51
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,011
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

52
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,125
But he won't stand still.

53
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,621
If you do your initial motion right

54
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:44,532
and active a sword skill at the right time...

55
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:53,951
The system pretty much guarantees
you'll always hit your target.

56
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:56,056
Initial motion?

57
00:03:57,297 --> 00:03:59,449
Here's an easier way to look at it.

58
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,254
Right after you start your move,

59
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,328
wait for a little bit.

60
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:07,338
When you feel the skill start to activate, drive it home.

61
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:09,512
Drive it home?

62
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,687
Hyaaaaaaaaaah!

63
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:33,516
Hoo hoo!

64
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,987
Ye-e-e-e-e-e-ah!

65
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,655
Congratulations.

66
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:38,377
Hmm?

67
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:39,687
Ha ha!

68
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,811
That was nice.

69
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:45,744
But that boar's about as weak
as slimes in other games are.

70
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,532
Holy crap! You got be kidding!

71
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,870
I thought that thing was a mid-level boss!

72
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:51,872
Yeah, as if.

73
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,294
Whoa!

74
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,765
Addictive, isn't it?

75
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:57,829
I'll say.

76
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:04,589
So, these skills, there's a ton of
them, like blacksmithing and stuff, right?

77
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:05,368
Uh-huh.

78
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,896
I heard the game has an unlimited number of them,

79
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,249
all except for magic, though.

80
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,903
An RPG without magic?

81
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:18,033
That's bold decision, man.

82
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,258
Oh, yeah!

83
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,687
So, what do you think?

84
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,111
It's kind of fun to move your body as you fight, isn't it?

85
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,430
Ha ha! Oh, hells, yeah!

86
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,740
You ready to move on?

87
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,302
Yeah, man!

88
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,643
Let's keep going.

89
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:44,465
When I look around, I can't believe it.

90
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:47,554
We're inside a game, bro!

91
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,637
Whoever made it's a genius.

92
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:52,893
This thing's amazing.

93
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:55,762
Makes me glad I was born when I was, you know?

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,686
It's not that big a deal.

95
00:05:57,772 --> 00:06:00,616
Cut me some slack. It's my first full dive.

96
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:03,262
You never used nervegear before today, huh?

97
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:05,256
This is your first time ever?

98
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,050
Uh-huh.

99
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,487
As soon as I got the money together, I rushed
out and bought all the hardware to play "SAO".

100
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,727
Stood in line and scored one of the 10,000 hard copies.

101
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,660
Guess you could say I was pretty lucky,

102
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:20,522
although, you sir, were 10 times
as lucky getting to beta-test it.

103
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,049
Hmm?

104
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,876
Dude, only a thousand people got the chance.

105
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,963
Yeah, I guess I was lucky.

106
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:29,396
Hey, mind if I ask how far you got in the beta?

107
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:32,550
Eh, two months and I couldn't get further than floor 8.

108
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:33,074
Hmm?

109
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:36,362
But now I think I can get there within a month, easy.

110
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,550
Sounds to me like you're really into this.

111
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,376
Yeah, you could say that.

112
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:46,182
During the beta test, "SAO" was the
only thing on my mind, day and night.

113
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:51,361
In this world, a single blade can
take you anywhere you want to go.

114
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:55,947
And even though it's a virtual
world, I feel more alive in here

115
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,907
than I ever did in the real one.

116
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:03,892
Anyway, you want to go do some more hunting?

117
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,052
Oh, you know it.

118
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:06,991
But the thing is...

119
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:09,812
...I'm really hungry.

120
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:14,600
I have to log out. Too bad the food you
eat here only satisfies your hunger virtually.

121
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:15,929
Yeah, for reals.

122
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,859
That's why I ordered a pizza for 5:30.

123
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:19,908
Wow. You're so prepared.

124
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:20,766
You know it.

125
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:23,768
Besides, the game can wait until I get my pizza on.

126
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,576
I guess.

127
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,972
Hey, I was gonna go meet up with
some people I know from another game.

128
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:32,806
I don't know what you're up to after this, so,

129
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:35,617
you know, if you want, you can
friend them and hang with us.

130
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:36,261
Uh... mnh.

131
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:38,763
No.

132
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:40,345
It's cool if you don't want to.

133
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:40,939
No pressure.

134
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,100
I can always introduce you to
them another time or something.

135
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,373
Yeah. Sorry.

136
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,612
Thanks anyway.

137
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,620
No way.

138
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:50,466
I should be doing all the thanking.

139
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:55,222
Hey, one of these days, I promise I'll pay
you back for all your help virtually that is.

140
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,851
Yeah, right.

141
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,061
Thanks for everything, man, really.

142
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,516
Guess I'll see you around, then.

143
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,758
If there's anything else you want to know,

144
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,789
message me.

145
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:07,767
Sweet! I'll do that.

146
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,077
Huh?

147
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:18,556
Where'd the logout button go?

148
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:20,090
It should be there.

149
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:20,986
Hmm.

150
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,188
No, it's not there.

151
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,699
It should be at the bottom of the main menu.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
See? Not there.

153
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:32,643
You're right.

154
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,572
It's not.

155
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:36,974
Oh, well. Today's, what, the first day out of beta?

156
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,658
There's bound to be some bugs.

157
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,485
I bet the server people are freaking out right now.

158
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,593
You will, too.

159
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:44,109
Huh?

160
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,317
Look. It's 5:25.

161
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,002
Aah! Oh, my god! My teriyaki Mayo pizza and ginger ale!

162
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,760
Why don't you just contact the game master?

163
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,261
Huh?

164
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,761
Yeah, I did that, but nothing's happening.

165
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,970
He's not picking up.

166
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:01,125
Do you know if there's another
way to log out of this thing?

167
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:02,347
Hmm.

168
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:04,838
No.

169
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:10,201
Whenever a player wants to log out of "SAO", the
only way they can do it is by going through the menu.

170
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,686
That can't be right.

171
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,418
There's got to be some other way out.

172
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,872
Return! Log out! Escape!

173
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:23,659
Told you so.

174
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:27,433
And there was no emergency logout in the manual, either.

175
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,203
No way.

176
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:30,014
You're kidding.

177
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:33,526
I know, I'll just rip the nervegear off my head.

178
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,916
Don't bother.

179
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,617
Once you're hooked in, you can't move
your body in the real world anymore.

180
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:44,567
The nervegear intercepts all the commands you give from
inside the game using an interface built into the rig.

181
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:46,808
Seriously?

182
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,535
So, now we got to wait until
someone gets around to fixing the bug?

183
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:55,619
That or until someone in the real world
comes along and takes the nervegear off us.

184
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:56,290
That's it.

185
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,312
Well, I live alone.

186
00:09:58,956 --> 00:09:59,622
You?

187
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,524
I got a mom and a sister,

188
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,933
and I'm pretty sure they'll notice
by dinnertime and come looking...

189
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:09,349
You got a sister? How old is she? What's she like?

190
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:13,487
She's into sports and hates games,
and she's totally not your type, man.

191
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,419
She wouldn't date a gamer if he's the last guy...

192
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:16,477
Who cares? I want to...

193
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,360
Ahh! Ohh! Ohh! Mnh! Gah!

194
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,651
Oh, right, getting kicked in the balls doesn't hurt.

195
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,627
Get serious.

196
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,429
Don't you think this is weird?

197
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:27,232
Yeah, totally, but it's just a bug.

198
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,450
This isn't just a bug.

199
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,470
If we can't log out, it's gonna cause
some serious problems for the game.

200
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,305
Yeah, I guess you're right.

201
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,794
I wonder if the developers even know what's happening,

202
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:43,887
'cause they could just shut down
the server and log everyone out.

203
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:46,041
But why haven't they made an announcement?

204
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,247
Uh... hmm.

205
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,272
Do you know what's going on?

206
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:18,994
Unh-unh.

207
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,529
Someone forced a teleport.

208
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:26,828
What's going on?

209
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,853
Huh?

210
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,853
Look, up there.

211
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:36,520
Now what?

212
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:55,376
What the hell is that thing?

213
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:02,916
Is that the game master?

214
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,226
Why doesn't he have a face?

215
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,244
Is this an event?

216
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,514
I'm scared.

217
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,539
Don't worry.

218
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,598
It's just part of the opening ceremony.

219
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:12,401
Attention, players.

220
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,578
I welcome you to my world.

221
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:17,351
What's he mean by that?

222
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:24,134
My name is Akihiko Kayaba, and as of
this moment, I am in control of this world.

223
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:26,646
Seriously?

224
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:27,848
Is that really him?

225
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,562
Wow. That's some entrance.

226
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:34,050
I'm sure most of you have already noticed
an item missing from your main menus,

227
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,361
the logout button.

228
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:39,780
Let me assure you this is not a defect in the game.

229
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,949
I repeat, this is not a defect.

230
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,375
This is how "sword art online" was designed to be.

231
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,296
He's kidding, right?

232
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:51,505
You cannot log yourselves out of "SAO",

233
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:57,051
and no one outside will be able to shut
down or remove the nervegear from your head.

234
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,911
If anyone attempts to do so,

235
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:04,616
a transmitter inside the nervegear will
discharge a microwave signal into your skull,

236
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,858
destroying your brain and ending your life.

237
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,187
What are you talking about?

238
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:11,314
Come on! That's such b.S.

239
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,639
Let's get out of here.

240
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,465
Ugh! Hey, I can't get out!

241
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,201
Are you listening to this crap?

242
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:21,020
He's got to be nuts, right?

243
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,324
Right, Kirito?

244
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:23,436
He's not.

245
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:26,956
The transmitter signals in the
headgear work just like microwaves.

246
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,650
If the safety's disabled, it could fry your brain.

247
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,071
Couldn't someone cut the power or...

248
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:32,987
That won't work.

249
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:35,187
The nervegear's got an internal battery.

250
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,365
Ugh! Ugh!

251
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:41,224
This is crazy! It's totally crazy!

252
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:42,688
Despite my warning,

253
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:46,778
the families and friends of some of the
players have attempted removing the nervegear,

254
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,559
an unfortunate decision, to say the least.

255
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:55,613
As a result, the game now has
213 less players than when it began.

256
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,522
They've been deleted from both Aincrad and the real world.

257
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:01,325
213?

258
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:02,419
No way.

259
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,004
I don't believe it!

260
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:05,354
As you can see,

261
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,223
international media outlets have
'round-the-clock coverage of everything,

262
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,921
including the deaths.

263
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:17,675
At this point, it's safe to assume the likelihood
of a nervegear being removed is minimal, at best.

264
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:22,387
I hope this brings you a little
comfort as you try to clear the game.

265
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:26,996
It's important to remember the following,

266
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:30,874
there is no longer any way to
revive someone within the game.

267
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:37,354
If your h.P. Drops to zero, your avatar
will be deleted from the system forever.

268
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:43,513
And the nervegear will simultaneously destroy your brain.

269
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,470
There's only one way for a player to escape now.

270
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,430
You must clear the game.

271
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,968
Right now you're gathered on floor 1,

272
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,073
the lowest level of Aincrad.

273
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:14,142
If you can get through the dungeon and defeat
the boss, you may advance to the next floor.

274
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,613
Defeat the boss on floor 100, and you will clear the game.

275
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:19,297
Clear?

276
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:20,807
What's he talking about?

277
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:21,300
What?

278
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:23,572
Why should we believe any of the crap you're saying?!

279
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:26,075
We can't clear all 100 floors.

280
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,234
That's freaking impossible.

281
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,372
Even the beta testers never made it that high!

282
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,795
Last but not least,

283
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:37,705
I've placed a little present in
the item storage of every player.

284
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,722
Please have a look.

285
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,723
A mirror?

286
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:52,235
Coin!

287
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:58,917
Ugh!

288
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,652
You okay, Kirito?

289
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:07,504
Yeah. Wait.

290
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,037
Who are you?

291
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:11,201
I'm me. Who are you?

292
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:16,721
Son of a... you're a guy?!

293
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,264
You're not 17!

294
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:19,869
Wait a second.

295
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:20,687
Is that you, Klein?

296
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:21,879
Is that you, Kirito?

297
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,284
But how...

298
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:25,986
The scan.

299
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,680
There's a high-density signal
device inside the nervegear rig.

300
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,960
It can see what my face looks like.

301
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:34,725
But how's it know my height and body type?

302
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:39,525
When you first put the nervegear on,
it had you do this calibration thing.

303
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,987
It asked you to touch your
body all over like this, remember?

304
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:43,895
Oh, yeah.

305
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:44,864
You're right.

306
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,969
That's where it got our physical data.

307
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:48,699
But this is, what's

308
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:50,478
the point?

309
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:52,544
Why would anyone do this to us?

310
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,109
I think he's about to tell us.

311
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:58,895
Right now, you're probably wondering why.

312
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:05,256
Why would Akihiko Kayaba, developer of
"sword art online" and nervegear, do this?

313
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,054
Ultimately, my goal was a simple one.

314
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,042
The reason I created "sword art online"

315
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:15,267
was to control the fate of a world of my design.

316
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,205
Kayaba.

317
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:22,047
As you can see, I have achieved my goal.

318
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:30,615
This marks the end of the tutorial and
the official launch of "sword art online."

319
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:34,100
Players, I wish you the best of luck.

320
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,706
It's not a game.

321
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,581
It's real.

322
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:16,077
Akihiko Kayaba created a virtual world.

323
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,287
He designed the nervegear rig.

324
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,011
The man's a genius.

325
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,736
I've been a fan of his for a long time, so I know

326
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:27,796
everything he just said is the truth.

327
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:32,652
If I die in the game, I'll die in real life.

328
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:37,749
My god! No!

329
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:42,344
Let me out!

330
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:43,376
Let me out of here!

331
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,607
I can't stay here!

332
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,568
I have a meeting after this!

333
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,968
Stop pushing!

334
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:51,047
You have to let us go!

335
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:51,957
Wait, seriously?!

336
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:53,811
What did we ever do to you?

337
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:54,738
We just wanted to play a game!

338
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:55,524
Come back!

339
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:58,217
Come on, Klein.

340
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:00,568
Aah!

341
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:05,143
Okay, listen, I'm heading out
right now for the next village.

342
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,400
I want you to come.

343
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:07,074
Huh?

344
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,953
If what he said is true and I think it is,

345
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:14,481
the only way we're gonna survive in here
is by making ourselves as strong as possible.

346
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,549
In an mmorpg, the money you can earn, the xp,

347
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:22,108
once the game starts up, there's
only so much of that stuff to go around.

348
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,821
Look. The fields around the town of
beginnings are gonna be hunted clean soon.

349
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:31,379
If we head to the next village now, we'll
have an easier time collecting cash and points.

350
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,765
Don't worry. I know all the
paths and places we should avoid.

351
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,622
Even if I'm level 1, I can get there easy.

352
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:43,534
Well, thanks, but you know those
friends of mine I was telling you about?

353
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,429
We stood in line for a whole night to buy this, and

354
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:51,076
they're back at the Plaza somewhere.

355
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,354
And I can't leave 'em.

356
00:19:58,003 --> 00:20:03,199
If it were just Klein, but two more or even one more...

357
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,119
Sorry.

358
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:08,815
Can't ask a guy I just met to risk
his life for a bunch of strangers, can I?

359
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,102
So don't worry about me.

360
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,336
Get your ass to the next village.

361
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:18,245
I'll be fine. Last game I played, I
ran a guild, so I'm more than prepared.

362
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:21,844
And with all the stuff you
taught me, I'll get by, no sweat.

363
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:23,663
Okay.

364
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,931
If that's what you want, I'll get going.

365
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,618
But if you're in a jam, message me, okay?

366
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:30,428
Sure.

367
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,105
I'll be seeing you, Klein.

368
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,114
Take care.

369
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,240
Kirito!

370
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:35,853
I...

371
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,391
Hey, Kirito.

372
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:46,373
Uh... you look better like this,

373
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:49,922
way cooler than your avatar.

374
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:55,651
Yeah, and I think that scruffy
face fits you 10 times better, too.

375
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:29,394
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

376
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,744
I got this. I can do this.

377
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,714
This world can't beat me.

378
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,349
Aaaah!

379
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:40,406
I will survive.

380
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:46,265
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

381
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:38,452
Next time: "Beater".
