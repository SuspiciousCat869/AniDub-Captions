1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,697
Mommy!

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,888
It's mommy!

3
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:07,055
She's here!

4
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:10,145
Are you sure?

5
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:11,536
Yes, I'm positive!

6
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,148
Hey, I...

7
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,937
I scanned again, and it's mommy's player I.D.!

8
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:17,977
Her coordinates are above us in the tree!

9
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:22,813
Kirito!

10
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:25,734
Wait!

11
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:27,696
Kirito!

12
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:34,026
Why are you acting like this, Kirito?

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,086
Is this person that important?

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,186
Are they worth all this trouble?

15
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:44,238
Watch out, Kirito!

16
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:46,296
You're gonna hit the barrier!

17
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:51,038
Aah!

18
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:51,795
Aah!

19
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,879
Kirito!

20
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,256
No!

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,669
Aah!

22
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:03,104
Stop it, Kirito! It's impossible!

23
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,338
You can't get any higher from here!

24
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:06,211
I have to.

25
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,722
Damn it, I have to try!

26
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,241
Mommy!

27
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:14,662
I'm here, mommy!

28
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,609
Momm-y-y-y-y-y!

29
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,154
Mommy!

30
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:23,219
Ohh.

31
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,908
Mommy!

32
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:32,960
Y-Yui! Is that you?!

33
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,472
Mommy! Mommy! I'm here!

34
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:40,508
I'm up here!

35
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,358
Where are you?!

36
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:44,770
Yui, I'm up here!

37
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:50,127
Kirito!

38
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,367
Come on... think.

39
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,369
There's got to be something I
can drop to let them know I'm here.

40
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,380
Why can't I bust through it?! I used warning
mode to contact her, but I don't know if it worked.

41
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:22,629
What's that?

42
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,319
A card?

43
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,482
Leafa, do you know what this thing does?

44
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:36,986
Unh-unh. I've never seen an item like that before.

45
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:41,985
I can't access the menu on it.

46
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:43,874
Let's see.

47
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,229
I got it! This is a system admin access code!

48
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:49,553
Really?

49
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:51,919
Do you think we can access the G.M. Controls with it?

50
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,158
No.

51
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,083
You need the right console to access the controls,

52
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:01,817
and the way to find it is through the
system menu, and even I can't bring that up.

53
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:03,190
No one can.

54
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,365
I see.

55
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:10,523
Although... i doubt something like
this would just fall out of the sky.

56
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:12,613
I wonder...

57
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,227
Yes! It's from mommy!

58
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,269
She must have heard us and dropped it!

59
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:27,230
Asuna.

60
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:40,023
Leafa, I got a plan. I need to know where the
gate is that will get me inside the world tree.

61
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:44,337
Well, the gate's in the dome
at the base of the tree, but...

62
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,427
Ahh! You're not thinking about going in there!

63
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:49,738
The biggest raiding parties couldn't even get through!

64
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,784
The whole thing's protected by guardians!

65
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,609
It doesn't matter. I have to try.

66
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,326
It's okay.

67
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:00,193
Thank you for everything.

68
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:03,412
I'll be going on my own from here on.

69
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:04,436
Ohh.

70
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,572
Kirito.

71
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,550
Should we get going now?

72
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,329
Yeah, sure.

73
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:40,863
Aah!

74
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:42,655
What the hell?

75
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,814
Is this an event?

76
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,787
Yui, do you know how to get to the dome?

77
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,347
Yes. Just go up those stairs and then g... yah!

78
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,424
A-Are you sure about this, daddy?

79
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:01,537
I'm only asking because, based on
everything we've been told about the gate,

80
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:04,120
breaking in sounds like it's going to be really hard.

81
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,895
We don't have any other choice.

82
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,857
Besides, it's not like we'll die if we fail.

83
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:11,162
Yeah, I guess you're right.

84
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:17,968
If I have to spend another second waiting
around, doing nothing, I'm gonna lose my mind.

85
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,284
And I know you want to see
mommy, too, just as bad as I do.

86
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:24,744
I do.

87
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:03,214
Thou knowest not the heights of heaven above.

88
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:07,075
Dost thou seek entry to the castle of the king?

89
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,238
I'm coming, Asuna.

90
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,479
I'm almost there.

91
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,409
Go, then.

92
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,404
Prove thou art worthy of thy wings.

93
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,971
Prove thou art worthy of flight.

94
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:33,073
Here we go, Yui. Keep your head down, okay?

95
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,432
Okay. Good luck.

96
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:30,989
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

97
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,207
Get out of my wa-a-a-a-a-y!

98
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:49,510
I can do this.

99
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:10,021
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

100
00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:26,093
Die!

101
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:32,156
Die, damn you!

102
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,431
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

103
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,329
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

104
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,165
Ugh!

105
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,073
Asuna.

106
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:29,703
Asuna.

107
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:31,236
Asuna.

108
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:32,739
Asuna.

109
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:34,253
Asuna!

110
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,328
Asuna!

111
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:36,982
Asu...

112
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,527
Almost there.

113
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,650
I'm almost there!

114
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,667
Aaah!

115
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,578
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

116
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,519
Just a... Little further.

117
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:33,967
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

118
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:43,289
I...

119
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,643
I...

120
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:50,862
I died?

121
00:12:55,422 --> 00:13:02,220
I always believed that, deep
down, this world was just a game.

122
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:07,051
Is this my punishment for thinking that?

123
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:15,091
My strength in the game is a lie...
nothing more than a bunch of skills and stats.

124
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:22,727
I didn't give a damn about its rules or its limits.

125
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:25,580
I thought I could do anything.

126
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,576
A game where it's okay to die
shouldn't be that big a deal.

127
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:20,884
Asuna.

128
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,106
Huh?

129
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,691
Get away! Stay back!

130
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,779
Kirito!

131
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,312
Aaah!

132
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,664
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

133
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:51,628
Kirito.

134
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,070
Mm.

135
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:16,037
Kirito!

136
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,669
Thank you, Leafa.

137
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,737
I-I didn't...

138
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,659
Promise me you won't do that again.

139
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,058
I can do this on my own.

140
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:38,189
But I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

141
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,008
Trouble?! But it's not!

142
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:41,540
I was just...

143
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:47,753
hold on. Where are you going?

144
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:48,909
Wait!

145
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,107
You can't do this alone, Kirito!

146
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:53,757
Yeah.

147
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,918
Maybe you're right.

148
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,943
You know I'm right! Listen!

149
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,127
I'm going anyway.

150
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,184
Please... stop.

151
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,806
Just go back to how you were.

152
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:13,136
I-I just... you mean so much to me.

153
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,847
Leafa...

154
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:22,543
Sorry.

155
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:27,039
If I don't get up there, nothing will end.

156
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:28,834
Nothing will begin.

157
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,377
I have to see her again, just once.

158
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:35,025
I have to see Asuna.

159
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,760
What... what did you just say?

160
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,232
Her name's Asuna.

161
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,672
She's the one I've been looking for.

162
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,829
But... but then...

163
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,681
Then you're...

164
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:56,690
Oh, my god.

165
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,733
Is that you...

166
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,593
Kazuto?

167
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:12,521
Huh?

168
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,153
Sugu?

169
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:18,298
Suguha?

170
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,794
I can't believe it.

171
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,932
It's not fair!

172
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:25,323
No!

173
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,553
S-Sugu.

174
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:29,888
Sugu!

175
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:09,878
Sugu, it's me.

176
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,188
Go away!

177
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:13,294
Just go!

178
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,624
Leave me alone!

179
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,334
I want to know what's wrong, Sugu.

180
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:23,196
I mean, it was kind of a shock for me, too.

181
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:27,232
And if you're mad because I'm
using the nervegear again, I'm sorry.

182
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,940
I just... I didn't have a choice.

183
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:31,845
You're wrong.

184
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,125
That's not why.

185
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,103
It's not.

186
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,210
Sugu?

187
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:42,815
I...

188
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:44,434
I...

189
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:45,838
I...

190
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,555
I betrayed the feelings I had!

191
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,280
I betrayed the love I felt for you.

192
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:59,255
When I met Kirito, I thought finally I could
give up on all these feelings I have for you.

193
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:00,423
What the hell?

194
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:02,099
I already had!

195
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,300
But... i think now I...

196
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,606
Well, I mean, love?

197
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,109
But you and me... we're...

198
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,164
No, we're not.

199
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:11,697
Huh?

200
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,588
I said, "no, we're not!"

201
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:17,320
I know you're not really my
brother and I'm not your sister!

202
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:21,562
I've known all along... for the last two years, anyway.

203
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,770
That's why you quit kendo, isn't it, and why you started
avoiding it's because you knew the whole time, didn't you?

204
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:33,552
You pushed me away 'cause I'm
not your real sister, didn't you?!

205
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:35,373
You did.

206
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:39,345
Well, if that's how it is, why do you care about me now?!

207
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,871
I just... I was so... happy you came back from S.A.O.

208
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:52,408
I was happy 'cause you were being nice
to me again, just like when we were little.

209
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,713
It felt like you were finally giving me a chance.

210
00:20:56,043 --> 00:20:57,286
That's what I thought.

211
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:04,000
But now, if this is how it is, I
wish you'd kept on being a jerk to me.

212
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:10,314
If you had, I wouldn't have realized how I felt about you.

213
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,249
I wouldn't have felt sad and
jealous when I found out about her,

214
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:18,951
and I wouldn't have tried forgetting about
you and falling in love with Kirito instead!

215
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:25,327
I'm sorry.

216
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,592
Go on.

217
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:36,459
Leave me alone.

218
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:03,949
Sugu.

219
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,802
Next time: "Bonds".
