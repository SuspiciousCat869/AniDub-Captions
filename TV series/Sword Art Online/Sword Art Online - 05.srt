1
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:15,707
Lure it to the village.

2
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:17,359
That's how we get the boss.

3
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,719
W-Wait... you can't be serious.

4
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,538
If we do, the boss'll go after the villagers.

5
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,817
Yes, that's the idea.

6
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:27,967
And while the boss is busy killing NPCs, we can attack it

7
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,110
and kill it.

8
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:30,716
But they're not just objects.

9
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,058
NPCs are different than rocks and trees!

10
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:33,679
L-Look, they're...

11
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,092
You think they're alive?

12
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,044
Really?

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:36,711
Uh...

14
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:43,528
In this game, they are just objects, and unlike
us, if they are killed, they can always respawn.

15
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:47,135
Sorry, but I'm not cool with that plan.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,615
I'm running this operation, okay?

17
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:54,952
In case you forgot, I'm still
second-in-command of the knights of the blood oath.

18
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:58,202
You'll obey my orders, like it or not.

19
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:07,546
Hey.

20
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:09,628
What's with you guys?

21
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:10,351
Huh?

22
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:15,133
You and the second-in-command... you're
always getting into it, and not in a good way.

23
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,257
I guess we just don't click, Agil.

24
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,626
You can become powerful here on your own,

25
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:25,661
but if the day comes when someone you trust
invites you to join a guild, don't turn it down.

26
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:31,675
Well, she took my advice, but who knew she'd
join the top guild and be a floor-clearing bad-ass?

27
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,847
What are you doing?

28
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:21,751
Hmm?

29
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,783
Oh, hey. What's up?

30
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:32,628
Everyone in the assault team's working
their butts off to clear the dungeon,

31
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,202
and where do I find you?

32
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:35,894
Out here, taking a nap.

33
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,707
Even if you're a solo player,
you should take this more se...

34
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:41,456
Bet you didn't know this is Aincrad's nicest season.

35
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,992
Today's weather is at its optimal setting.

36
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,698
Huh?

37
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,171
It'd be a waste to have to go to work on a day like this.

38
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,179
Whatever.

39
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:50,498
I can't believe you.

40
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,627
Do you even understand what's going on?

41
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,780
Every day here is another one lost in the real world.

42
00:03:55,821 --> 00:04:00,649
Yeah, but right now we're not in the
real world, are we're alive in Aincrad.

43
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:05,163
See?

44
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,237
Doesn't that breeze feel good?

45
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,538
And the sun?

46
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,008
Oh, come on.

47
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:12,147
The weather is always the same here.

48
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:17,398
If you laid down on the grass
for a little bit, you'd understand.

49
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:29,149
Hmm.

50
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:33,810
Mm.

51
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:59,618
Damn, would you look at that?

52
00:04:59,675 --> 00:04:59,951
Oh.

53
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,019
Taking a nap in the middle of the day.

54
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:03,751
Some people sure got it easy.

55
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,148
Couple of lazy losers, man.

56
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,955
I can't believe she fell asleep.

57
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:21,893
Oh.

58
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:35,239
Huh?

59
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,557
What? Uh, uh...

60
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,525
Good morning.

61
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:44,458
You slept like a rock.

62
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:55,823
You get one meal.

63
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:56,826
Huh?

64
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,855
One meal... all you can eat, my treat.

65
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:03,062
Then we'll be even. Deal?

66
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,559
That's Asuna from the knights of the blood oath.

67
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:18,170
Really?

68
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,077
Yeah, they call her the lightning flash.

69
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,205
Who is the shady-looking guy dressed in black?

70
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,177
Well, anyway...

71
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:25,852
Mm-hmm.

72
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,067
Thank you for today.

73
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:28,785
Why?

74
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,779
For keeping an eye on me.

75
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,263
Oh. Sure.

76
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,305
The towns are supposed to be safe zones,

77
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:39,412
and unless you've agreed to a duel,
a player can't attack or kill you.

78
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,275
But when you're asleep, you're vulnerable.

79
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,529
Yeah.

80
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,684
Now we've got player-killers
who can cheat the duel system.

81
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:51,235
Duels are normally supposed to be tests
of strength, not a fight to the death.

82
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:56,979
But even if you duel in a safe zone, your h.P. Is
still gonna go down based on the damage you take.

83
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:02,898
All a sleep PKer has to do is manipulate a
sleeping player's finger to click the "okay" button...

84
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,715
the duel begins like normal.

85
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,791
But the sleep PKer is doing all of the attacking.

86
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,238
God knows how many times it's happened.

87
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,663
So, anyway, thank you.

88
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,874
Uh, sure. Anytime.

89
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:19,152
Well, you'd do the same for me.

90
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:40,872
Hurry! Pull it out!

91
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,700
I'll cut him down. You catch him.

92
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:51,408
Got it.

93
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:53,848
Help's on the way!

94
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:57,930
Damn it.

95
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:17,745
The only way he could have died in a
safe zone is if he was beaten in a duel.

96
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:19,183
That means...

97
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:22,329
Everyone, look for the player with the "winner" icon!

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,279
There's no one here! The room's empty!

99
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,503
So, any idea how this could have happened?

100
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,578
Well, there is always the obvious... there was a duel,
and the other guy impaled the victim with that spear.

101
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,924
Then he put a noose around his
neck and pushed him out the window.

102
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,096
Wouldn't you say that's about right?

103
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,027
Yeah, but I couldn't see the "winner" icon on anyone.

104
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,425
It hadto be a duel...

105
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,697
it's a safe zone, and a player died.

106
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:02,699
A duel is the only thing it could have been.

107
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,465
Or maybe not.

108
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:11,922
Either way, we can't ignore this.

109
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:12,924
I know.

110
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:16,485
As it is, a player takes huge
risks going outside a safe zone,

111
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:19,169
but if someone's found a way to PK Inside,

112
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,631
no one's going to be safe in the towns, either.

113
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:23,401
Yeah, you're right.

114
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:27,040
I guess we won't be going back
to the front lines anytime soon.

115
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:33,803
Listen, you're going to work
with me until we solve this thing.

116
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,290
Until we do, there won't be any time for napping, okay?

117
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,848
Okay, but you'rethe one who was napping.

118
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,763
Ow!

119
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,945
Listen up... did anyone see what
happened before that player died?

120
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:59,080
If someone did, please speak up.

121
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:06,542
Sorry.

122
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,767
I can imagine how frightened you are.

123
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,745
Could you tell us your name?

124
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:12,549
Sure.

125
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,114
My name is Yoruko.

126
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:14,653
Oh.

127
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,949
Was that you?

128
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,937
I mean, were you the one who screamed?

129
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,875
Uh, uh-huh. I-I knew him.

130
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,832
His name was Kains, and the two of
us used to belong to the same guild.

131
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,703
Anyway, we came here together today.

132
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:30,562
We were going to have dinner somewhere in town.

133
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:33,381
But we got separated in the Plaza.

134
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:38,658
I looked around for him, and then I
saw him hanging from that balcony, and...

135
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:44,061
Was there anyone else up there?

136
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:50,932
For a second there... I'm not sure... but I
think I did see someone standing behind Kains.

137
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:51,573
Mm.

138
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:55,182
And this person, had you seen them before?

139
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:57,559
Mnh-mnh.

140
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:02,945
Um, I know this is hard for you,
but think back and try to remember...

141
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:06,370
Could therebe someone, anyone,
with the reason to kill him?

142
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:10,516
Mnh-mnh.

143
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,122
Thank you for walking me back.

144
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,050
Sorry if it's out of your way.

145
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:23,879
No worries.

146
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:27,502
But we'd like to talk to you again
tomorrow if you're feeling up to it.

147
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,621
Okay.

148
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,511
So, what do we do?

149
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:39,286
Simple... we follow the only solid clue we have.

150
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:44,163
If we can find out where that spear came
from, it might lead us straight to the killer.

151
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,999
We'll need to find someone with an appraisal skill.

152
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:50,170
I mean, it's pretty obvious you don't have one.

153
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,656
No, I don't, and neither do you.

154
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:56,358
Oh, and by the way, try not to be
so rude when you're speaking to me.

155
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:56,985
Oh.

156
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,711
Uh, okay. Should I call you miss next time?

157
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:01,464
Mm.

158
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,620
Second-in-command?

159
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:05,899
Lightning flash?

160
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:09,570
Oh, never mind.

161
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,572
Call me Asuna.

162
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,882
Okay. Sure.

163
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:16,737
Back to the appraisal skill,
though... Do you know anyone who has it?

164
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,785
Hmm.

165
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,471
I've got a friend who does.

166
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,781
She's a weapons merchant.

167
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:24,733
But she's really busy these days, so I
don't think she'll have time to help us.

168
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:29,265
No worries... I happen to know an item
merchant who might be able to help us out.

169
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,365
Thanks, my man. Come back anytime.

170
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,428
Yeah. Whatever.

171
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:44,933
Looks like you're still running all the
suckers down with those hard deals of yours.

172
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,999
No way... Kirito!

173
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:50,932
Buy cheap and sell cheap...
that's my motto. I'm a businessman.

174
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:51,712
You know that.

175
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:54,054
That "selling cheap" part's a lie, though.

176
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:56,389
Don't go slandering my good name, brother.

177
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:57,399
Uh...

178
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,038
What the hell has gotten into you?!

179
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:03,322
You're supposed to be a solo player, man!

180
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:04,851
What are you doing hanging around with Asuna?!

181
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:07,837
I thought you guys hated each other's guts, straight up!

182
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,489
What's the deal?!

183
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:12,487
His h.P. Dropped to zero in a safe zone?

184
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,002
You sure it wasn't a duel?

185
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:16,385
Well, no one saw a "winner" icon.

186
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,548
And we can also rule out the murder being a sleep PK.

187
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,258
He was walking with Yoruko before it happened.

188
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,572
And, besides, his death was too
elaborate to be some random duel.

189
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,066
The PKer who did this had it planned out.

190
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:29,534
We're pretty sure of that.

191
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,894
And then there's this.

192
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,159
Hmm.

193
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,535
A player made this.

194
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:43,295
Really?

195
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:44,209
Who was it?

196
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,320
Can you tell?

197
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,012
"Grimlock."

198
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,857
Never heard that name before.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,734
It's not one of the top blacksmiths. That's for damn sure.

200
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,514
Far as I can tell, there is nothing special about this.

201
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,786
Yeah, but it's something to go on, right?

202
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:57,398
Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:00,045
Is there, like, an item name listed?

204
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,005
You'll love it...

205
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:02,156
"Guilty Thorn."

206
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:06,329
There's a name for you. It kind
of fits, though. Don't you think?

207
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:07,726
Hmm.

208
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,619
Seriously? Guilty Thorn?

209
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,106
Here goes.

210
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:24,934
Wait! Stop!

211
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:29,441
What's the matter?

212
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,117
What do you mean, what's the matter?!

213
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:32,848
Are you out of your mind?!

214
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,818
That thing's already killed one person!

215
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:35,716
I know.

216
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,538
But we need to find out what
this thing's capable of, don't we?

217
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,366
Would you stop being so reckless?!

218
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:41,438
Oh.

219
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:41,962
Agil.

220
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,323
Would you please hold onto this for us?

221
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,212
Uh... yeah.

222
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,338
Mm.

223
00:14:57,128 --> 00:15:02,967
So, uh, Yoruko, we, uh... we were wondering
if you had ever heard the name Grimlock.

224
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,026
Yes. I have.

225
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:11,060
Actually, until a few months ago,
he was in the guild with me and Kains.

226
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:11,425
Mm.

227
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:11,912
Mm.

228
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,918
Listen, we took the spear that
impaled Kains to an appraiser.

229
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:20,110
We had him go over it pretty carefully,
and we found out Grimlock made it.

230
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:24,758
Can you think of any reason why he did?

231
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:29,047
Yes. I can.

232
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,578
I should have told you everything yesterday.

233
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:35,166
It's just... I couldn't.

234
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:38,391
It's something I've been trying very hard to forget.

235
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,197
But now I have no choice.

236
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:47,068
I should tell you about how my guild was destroyed.

237
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:54,727
When we formed it, "golden apple" was the name we chose.

238
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:59,390
Six months ago, we killed a rare monster.

239
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,652
It dropped a powerful ring that
raised a player's agility by twenty.

240
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,181
Some of us wanted to keep it for the guild.

241
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:10,071
Others wanted to sell it and split the earnings.

242
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:14,631
We couldn't agree, and in the end, we put it to a vote.

243
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,445
It was five to three in favor of selling it.

244
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,950
Our leader, Griselda, took it to
a large town on the front lines.

245
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:27,533
She was going to sell it to a
broker and was staying overnight.

246
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:32,642
We waited and waited, but she never came back.

247
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,864
It wasn't till later we learned
our worst fears had come true...

248
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,318
Griselda was dead.

249
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:45,719
To this day, I still don't know how she died.

250
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,390
No one's gonna leave a safe
zone with a rare item like that...

251
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:50,312
Too risky.

252
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,433
You think someone could've pulled a sleep PK On her?

253
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:57,017
Not if it was six months ago...
that method's still sort of new.

254
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:58,200
You're right.

255
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,439
But she wasn't a random victim, either.

256
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,578
No, the killer was after the ring.

257
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:06,661
It has to be someone who knew she had it, which means...

258
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,696
The killer is one of the seven others in our guild.

259
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:11,013
Yes.

260
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:13,559
We have our suspects.

261
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,350
Now we just have to figure out
who didn'twant to sell the ring.

262
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,667
I doubt the killer waited till
after Griselda sold the ring.

263
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,672
She was killed before she sold that's my guess.

264
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:23,560
Probably.

265
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:26,260
Tell us what you know about Grimlock.

266
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:29,716
Well, I guess, for starters, he was Griselda's husband...

267
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:32,736
Oh, but not in real life, just in the game.

268
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:36,312
Griselda was a powerful swordswoman.

269
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,076
She was beautiful and smart.

270
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:44,573
Grimlock was kind, and I can't
remember a day when he wasn't smiling.

271
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:48,275
They made a great couple and
got along as husband and wife.

272
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,780
If Grimlock is really the one
who murdered Kains yesterday, then

273
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:58,087
he's probably going after the three guild
members who voted against selling the ring.

274
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:03,340
Kains was one of the three who
wanted to keep the ring for the guild.

275
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,007
I was the other one.

276
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,423
Then who's the third person?

277
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,459
The other's a tank named Schmidt,

278
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:14,717
and he, the last I heard, is on the front
lines now with the holy dragon alliance.

279
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:15,838
Schmidt, huh?

280
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,642
I've heard that name before.

281
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:20,820
He's leader of the defense
unit of the holy dragon alliance.

282
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,846
He's an exceptional lancer.

283
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,322
Oh, yeah. Him.

284
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:27,619
Wait... do you really know Schmidt?

285
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:31,226
Well, I've run into him a couple
times while clearing bosses, so...

286
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,673
I need to see him right away.

287
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,285
Could you please take me to him?

288
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,673
If he is on the front lines, he
probably hasn't heard about the murder.

289
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:42,014
He needs to know before what
happened to Kains happens to him.

290
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,400
We'll help you get in touch with Schmidt.

291
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,020
I know someone in the holy dragon alliance.

292
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,628
He'll help us out. We'll visit their HQ.

293
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:52,549
Okay.

294
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,021
But first we should make sure she gets back to the inn.

295
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:58,191
Yoruko, you have to stay there, okay?

296
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,751
Seriously, don't go anywhere until we get back.

297
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:01,814
All right.

298
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,143
Okay, so, how do you think a murder
like this happened in a safe zone?

299
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,320
I can see three ways it could've.

300
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,562
Right off the bat, it's possible it was a fair duel.

301
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:22,765
Or maybe someone took advantage of a bug
that combines a bunch of different kill methods.

302
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,727
Yeah, I can see that happening.

303
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,110
And the third?

304
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,740
Used something to bypass the protection of a safe zone...

305
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:32,152
Some kind of skill, or maybe an item.

306
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,975
No, on second thought, that third idea is impossible.

307
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,185
What do you mean?

308
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,592
Because it's unfair.

309
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:41,120
I kind of hate to admit it, but it's true...

310
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,344
The rules of SAOare essentially
fair for every player in the game,

311
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:49,571
so there is no way the game
would allow murders in safe zones.

312
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:52,335
I see.

313
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:04,357
So that's what killed Kains. And you're
sure about the spear? Was it really Grimlock's?

314
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,192
There is no doubt.

315
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,512
But then why would he wait six months to kill him?!

316
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,627
Unless... wait... could he have stolen the ring?!

317
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,758
Do you think it's possible he killed Griselda after all?!

318
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:22,072
Does Grimlock want to kill the three of us
because we didn't want to sell the damn ring?!

319
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,424
Is that why he's after you and me now?!

320
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,642
Maybe Grimlock made the spear
for someone else from our guild,

321
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:29,858
and maybe they'rethe ones who killed Kains.

322
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,145
Or maybe...

323
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,529
Griselda has come back from the dead to get her revenge.

324
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,466
Huh?

325
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:38,360
A player can't kill another player inside a safe zone,

326
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:41,116
but something else, like a ghost, could.

327
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:41,880
Uh...

328
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:42,491
Oh.

329
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:47,975
I couldn't sleep at all last
night, so I stayed up thinking.

330
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,573
It was everyone's fault!

331
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,408
Everyone in the guild is guilty!

332
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,155
Her blood is on all our hands!

333
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:56,547
Our fate was sealed when that ring dropped!

334
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,049
We shouldn't have voted!

335
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,830
We should have done whatever Griselda told us to do!

336
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,179
Grimlock was the only one...

337
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,206
The only member of the guild who said
we should leave the decision to Griselda.

338
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,621
You see?

339
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,553
He's the only one of us who can avenge Griselda.

340
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:20,612
He's the only member of our guild
who has the right to avenge her.

341
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:22,956
You got to be kidding.

342
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,330
You got to be kidding!

343
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,810
Why now? After all this time, why kill us now?

344
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:34,875
You can't be okay with this, Yoruko! How can
you accept being killed over some stupid vendetta?!

345
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,300
Yoruko!

346
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,889
Next time: "Illusionary Avenger".
