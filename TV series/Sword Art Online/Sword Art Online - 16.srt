1
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:16,665
Yo.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,230
You're early, man.

3
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,203
What'd you do, scare all your customers away?

4
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,434
Very funny.

5
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,732
Man, at night, it's off the hook in here.

6
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,969
Well, I'm here. What's the
deal with that picture you sent?

7
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,904
Yeah, that's gonna take a little explaining.

8
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,995
But first, check this out.

9
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:42,963
A game?

10
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,425
It's an mmo for the amusphere.

11
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:47,604
It's what replaced nervegear on the market.

12
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:48,763
Huh.

13
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:51,020
So, it's a VRMMO...

14
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:52,530
Just like sword art.

15
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:56,025
Alfhaim Online?

16
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,116
Uh, actually, it's pronounced "Alf-Heim."

17
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,953
Yeah, it means "land of the fairies."

18
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:04,503
Fairies, huh?

19
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,046
Land of the fairies?

20
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,961
Sounds like a cute game.

21
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,368
Yeah, that's not what I hear, brother.

22
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,073
For one, P.K.ing's allowed, and
it's got this hard-core skill system.

23
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,926
What do you mean "hard-core"?

24
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,903
I mean the game's not level-based. It's skill-based.

25
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:06,503
You got to use your skills over and over to improve them,
and combat depends on your real-life physical abilities.

26
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:07,998
That is hard-core.

27
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,783
There's no sword skills.

28
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:12,478
Other than that, it's like SAO with magic.

29
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:16,642
What I hear... people are going
nuts for it, 'cause in the game,

30
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:18,206
you feel like you're flying.

31
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,190
Say what?

32
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,486
You know how fairies have wings?

33
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:26,240
Well, the game's got this flight-engine
thing, and once you figure it out, you can fly.

34
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,168
Whoa.

35
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,075
How's the player control it?

36
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,584
No idea, man.

37
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,262
I do hear it's a pain to get used to, though.

38
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:34,675
Yeah, I bet.

39
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,631
How are you supposed to control something you don't have?

40
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,515
Maybe you have to use the muscles in your back.

41
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:41,602
Ahem!

42
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:43,796
Right.

43
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:45,465
Okay, getting back to Asuna.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,714
What does she have to do with this game?

45
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,208
Look familiar?

46
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:53,940
It looks like...

47
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:55,378
Asuna.

48
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:56,642
I kind of figured you'd

49
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,368
say that.

50
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,660
Would you cut the crap?

51
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,137
Where the hell is this?

52
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:01,989
Alfheim Online.

53
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,374
That was taken in the game.

54
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:06,853
Right in the middle,

55
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,289
you got the world tree.

56
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:11,859
At the top of that, there's this legendary castle.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,578
Players are divided up into nine races.

58
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:19,478
Each one of those races is trying
to be the first to get to the castle.

59
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,083
Why don't they just fly up to it?

60
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:23,632
It's already been tried.

61
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:26,389
But the game's got a limit to
how long you can stay airborne.

62
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:27,897
Check it out.

63
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:31,064
These five players stacked up
bigger players on the bottom.

64
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:33,182
They tried launching themselves like a rocket.

65
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:35,613
Good idea.

66
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,718
It's insane but kind of clever.

67
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:42,040
Yeah, well, those cats didn't
even make it past the lowest branch.

68
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:47,743
They did manage to snap a couple shots, though, and
when they checked out the pics, they saw something weird.

69
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:50,285
A birdcage?

70
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:51,699
You could call it that.

71
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:56,125
And after zooming in on it as
far as they could, they saw her.

72
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:58,016
Okay.

73
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,702
But if it's really Asuna, what's she doing there?

74
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,057
"Rct progress"?

75
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:10,698
Without getting into specifics, you
could say I'm the one keeping Asuna alive.

76
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,735
Agil, can I borrow this for a couple days?

77
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:17,965
Sure. It's cool.

78
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,506
You thinking about going?

79
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:21,390
Yeah, I got to check this out.

80
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:25,529
A game where it's okay to die
shouldn't be that big a deal.

81
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:32,878
Crap. I still got to buy the hardware for it.

82
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,904
It's compatible with what you got.

83
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:38,981
The amusphere is just a nervegear
rig but with better security.

84
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:40,847
That's a relief.

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,470
The battle's not over till it's over.

86
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:44,946
You feel me?

87
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,387
Get her out and come back safe.

88
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:48,482
Sure.

89
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,103
And when I do, let's all meet up here.

90
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,521
God, what am I doing? I'm so stupid!

91
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:09,593
Hey, I'm back.

92
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:10,498
Huh?!

93
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:12,729
Hey, where'd you go?

94
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,247
Here.

95
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:33,421
I... I thought I was gonna die!

96
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,522
You're such a spaz.

97
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:36,742
Those muffins aren't going anywhere.

98
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,612
Sugu, about last night...

99
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,335
Yeah? What?

100
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,400
I just... I don't know.

101
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,119
Thanks a lot.

102
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,926
Thanks to you, Sugu, I feel better.

103
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,441
You're right.

104
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:54,568
I can't give up.

105
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:57,333
And I'll get Asuna back, no matter what.

106
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,015
Well, good luck.

107
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,677
I'm looking forward to getting the chance to meet her.

108
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,879
When you do, I'm sure you'll hit it off.

109
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,920
Anyway, I better get going.

110
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:31,148
We're having the ceremony here
on January 26th, a week from now.

111
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:32,688
Save the date.

112
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:37,694
I need your help again... one more time.

113
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:50,893
Link, start!

114
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:05,190
Welcome to Alfheim Online.

115
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,127
Oh.

116
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:11,899
Please enter your gender and the
name you wish to be identified as.

117
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,525
Oh, you're the Kirito?

118
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,582
You're a hero. It's an honor.

119
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,929
There are nine races of fairies to choose from.

120
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,861
Please select which race you wish to play as.

121
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:35,916
Hmm.

122
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:37,527
Huh?

123
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,928
That one looks good.

124
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,794
You have selected Spriggan.

125
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:46,125
Your character's appearance will be decided at random.

126
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,103
Do you wish to continue?

127
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:54,070
You will now be teleported to
your hometown in Spriggan territory.

128
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,784
Good luck, player.

129
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:23,812
Now what?

130
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,281
Huh?

131
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,315
What's going on?!

132
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,407
Aah!

133
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,206
I'm back in another game...

134
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,442
Even after everything I just went through.

135
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:10,785
Wait?

136
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,246
Where am I?

137
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:13,594
Hmm?

138
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:18,269
Hmm?

139
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,199
There it is.

140
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:24,227
Thank god.

141
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:32,478
Okay, where's the status window?

142
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:34,478
Huh?

143
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:36,843
What is this?

144
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:38,922
Oh, please don't be a bug.

145
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,638
It's all my skills and stats from SAO.

146
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,523
The hell's going on?

147
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:51,310
Am I back inside SAO?

148
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,150
Uh-oh.

149
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,154
Oh, crap.

150
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,260
Come on.

151
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:05,108
Please be here.

152
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:49,245
Hey, Yui.

153
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:50,412
It's me.

154
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,944
You remember?

155
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,444
I do. I remember you, daddy.

156
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:02,208
Yui.

157
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:05,695
Mommy!

158
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,771
You must be hungry.

159
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:08,890
How about breakfast?

160
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,361
Okay.

161
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,194
Uh, mmm. Mmm.

162
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:15,462
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

163
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,265
I like it.

164
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:21,192
Mommy... daddy.

165
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:24,471
Daddy!

166
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,150
Daddy.

167
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,994
Daddy.

168
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,895
You're back. It's a miracle.

169
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,373
So, do you know where you are or what's going on?

170
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:50,445
Mnh-mnh.

171
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:51,215
Oh.

172
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,495
Well, we're not in SAO anymore.

173
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,023
We're in a totally different game now.

174
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,083
It's called Alfheim Online.

175
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,305
I need a few seconds to assess it.

176
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:08,543
From what I can tell, this world has been
copied from the sword art online servers.

177
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:09,526
Really?

178
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,608
Yes.

179
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:15,484
The engine, programming, and
graphics format are exactly the same.

180
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,388
The cardinal system needs updating, but
that's the only thing that sticks out to me.

181
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,420
Oh.

182
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:25,369
That makes sense, 'cause argus
was the company running SAO.

183
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,228
They folded, and rct took over.

184
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,213
Yeah.

185
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:33,027
And if rct has already got all of argus'
technology, it figures they'd port it over...

186
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:37,159
Although, when I checked, I
still had my old skills and stats.

187
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:38,201
Strange.

188
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:40,694
I'll take a look at your data and see what I find.

189
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:44,763
Very interesting.

190
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:49,435
You're right, this is the same character
data you used when you were in SAO.

191
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,804
The formatting for saved data is almost identical.

192
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,768
Whatever skills you had that were similar
in both games were ported over and merged.

193
00:13:58,316 --> 00:13:58,927
Oh.

194
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,730
That's why my dual-wielding skill is gone.

195
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:02,926
Not just that.

196
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,083
All your items seem to be lost, too.

197
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,646
You might want to delete them before the
error-detection program finds out about it.

198
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,695
Yeah, I better.

199
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:18,068
Hmm.

200
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:20,848
Hmm.

201
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:27,697
Hmm?

202
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:31,559
Okay, what am I gonna do about my skill level?

203
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,262
No one else can see them.

204
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:37,913
Well, no one except the game master, and
as long as he doesn't, you should be okay.

205
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,647
Oh. Awesome.

206
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,021
Hmm.

207
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,040
I guess I'm not a beater anymore.

208
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:44,931
Just a plain old cheater now.

209
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:48,079
How are you being identified by the system?

210
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:49,910
Let's see.

211
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:53,795
It's classifying me as a player-support program.

212
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,734
In the world of the game, I'm a navigation pixie.

213
00:14:59,079 --> 00:14:59,921
Hey!

214
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,236
This is what I look like as a pixie.

215
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,705
Whoa.

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,129
No, daddy! That's annoying!

217
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,512
You had admin privileges in SAO.

218
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:18,935
Do you still have them?

219
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:20,269
No.

220
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:25,060
The system will only allow me to access
the wide-area maps and the reference database.

221
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:26,114
Oh.

222
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,498
Listen, Yui...

223
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:33,012
I think your mommy might be stuck in here somewhere.

224
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:36,491
Mommy? Really?! What do you mean, she's stuck?

225
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:41,720
After SAO was cleared, Asuna
never woke up in the real world.

226
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,698
I found out she was seen in Alfheim.

227
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,602
There's a picture, but it's too blurry to tell.

228
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,638
What are we going to do?

229
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:52,808
Well, I got a pretty good idea where she might be.

230
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,305
It's something called the world tree.

231
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:57,347
I think it's over there.

232
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,174
Mommy's there? Really?

233
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,294
Uh, hang on a second.

234
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:09,822
I was supposed to start the game
in a town in Spriggan territory.

235
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:13,469
So, how come I ended up here, in this forest, instead?

236
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:14,953
I don't know.

237
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,535
Your location data may be corrupted.

238
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,769
Or perhaps there was some interference?

239
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:24,265
Either way, it would've been nice if the game
dropped me a little closer to the world tree.

240
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:26,434
Well, let's go.

241
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:28,984
Wow!

242
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:30,828
These are my wings, huh?

243
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,472
How do I fly with them?

244
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,190
You have to access your controller first.

245
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:40,743
Raise your left hand. Then, position
your fingers like you're grabbing something.

246
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,338
Pull it toward yourself to elevate.

247
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,166
Push it away to descend.

248
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,399
And move it left or right to turn.

249
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:52,707
Okay.

250
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:54,489
Oh!

251
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,643
Hold down the button to accelerate.

252
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:01,391
To decelerate, just ease up on it a little.

253
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,891
As long as your wings are shining, you can stay airborne.

254
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:13,388
But you can't fly forever. After a
while, you'll need to rest your wings.

255
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,883
This is great! I think I've got it down.

256
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:26,792
Do me a favor. Scan the map
and see where the nearest town is.

257
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,478
There's one in Sylph territory, west of here.

258
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,663
It's a town called Sylvain. It's the closest one.

259
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:35,588
Something wrong?

260
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,399
There are other players near here.

261
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:38,065
Oh.

262
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:57,548
Hey! Wait up for me!

263
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,011
Leafa!

264
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:00,472
Hurry it up, Recon!

265
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:03,505
A little further and we'll be in Sylph territory!

266
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,696
Watch out, Recon!

267
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,197
Geez! They never give up!

268
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:16,138
Okay, then. Prepare for battle!

269
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,489
Ohh! What are you doing?!

270
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:21,041
Sigurd and the others are already there by now!

271
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:22,750
I'll keep these guys busy.

272
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:24,927
You try to knock one of them down, okay?

273
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,752
If you say so.

274
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:29,453
Show me how useful you can be.

275
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:48,256
Aah! Oh!

276
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,015
Hyah!

277
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:52,159
Damn it!

278
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:03,498
We can win this!

279
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,635
Aah!

280
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,804
Idiot! Don't stop!

281
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,186
Ugh!

282
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:12,894
Sorry!

283
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:15,285
Recon!

284
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:24,401
Hyah!

285
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,072
Aah!

286
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,267
Sorry about this.

287
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:47,687
We're on a mission, though.

288
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,898
Give up your money and items, and we'll let you go.

289
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:54,036
What are acting like such a gentleman for, Kagemune?

290
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:56,466
Yeah, we haven't fought a chick in forever.

291
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,934
Come on, let's waste her!

292
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:03,117
Go on, try it, but I'm taking one of you with me.

293
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,555
Whoever is not afraid of dying, come on!

294
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:06,977
Step up and get some.

295
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:08,635
You're a stubborn girl.

296
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,345
Suit yourself.

297
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,658
Aaaah!

298
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:30,765
Oh!

299
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:35,968
Ohh.

300
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:39,407
Damn.

301
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:41,578
Got to work on those landings.

302
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:42,428
Uh...

303
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:48,158
What are you doing?!

304
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,451
Go! Get out of here!

305
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:53,658
Would someone tell me why three
big guys are fighting one single girl?

306
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,941
That's pretty uncool, if you ask me.

307
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,269
What did you say?!

308
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,256
Better get your ass out of here, new, fast!

309
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:05,960
You asked for it.

310
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:07,907
Get ready to die!

311
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,304
Hyah!

312
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:14,682
Huh?

313
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:20,475
See ya.

314
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,452
Aaah!

315
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:22,365
Ugh!

316
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:23,923
Ugh!

317
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:25,631
Excuse me.

318
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:29,484
Hate to interrupt, but you mind if I take care of this?

319
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:32,878
Uh, I guess, if you really want to.

320
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:36,428
It's not like they were gonna let
you walk out of here alive anyway.

321
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,884
Then sit back and let me at them.

322
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:46,542
Huh?

323
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:48,846
Where'd he go?

324
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:50,395
Aah!

325
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,434
Uh, uh...

326
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:04,338
Okay, who's next?

327
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:38,801
Next time: "Captive Queen".
