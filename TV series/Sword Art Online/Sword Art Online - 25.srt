1
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:16,767
Asuna.

2
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,528
You're late, Kirito.

3
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:03,626
Who's there?

4
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:05,645
I've been out here so long.

5
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,050
I might catch cold.

6
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:10,695
Sugou!

7
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:13,118
You did a very bad thing, Kirito.

8
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,130
You know, I can still feel the pain.

9
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:17,633
It's over, Sugou.

10
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,515
You better turn yourself in.

11
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,079
You're finished.

12
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,246
Finished?

13
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:23,198
Hardly.

14
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:26,902
There are lots of companies that
would kill to have me and my research,

15
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:30,773
and once it's complete, there won't be
anything or anyone standing in my way.

16
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:33,331
Then I'll be the god of this world.

17
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,995
Oh, but first... first, I'm going to kill you.

18
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:40,434
Kirito!

19
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,212
Come on, get up.

20
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,849
I said, "get up"!

21
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,152
You think a piece of trash like you can get in my way?

22
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,909
Did you think I'd let you slow me down?

23
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,705
Want to know what the punishment

24
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:04,930
death.

25
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:08,258
I won't accept anything less.

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,878
Damn.

27
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,142
My right eye is all foggy.

28
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,493
But I won't miss again... Promise.

29
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:28,534
You... bastard!

30
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,421
You little boy, you're a piece of scum!

31
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:34,351
You don't have any real power!

32
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:38,094
And neither do you,

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,848
Sugou.

34
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,376
Die, damn you!!

35
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,579
Aah!

36
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:50,120
Aah!

37
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:57,145
Such a weak weapon... too light,

38
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:03,156
no reach... and it's all I'm gonna
need to kill you once and for all.

39
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:05,706
Aah!

40
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:08,726
Aah!

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,216
Hurry up... she's waiting for you!

42
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:40,825
Asuna.

43
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:44,478
Kirito.

44
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,394
It's okay now.

45
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,323
It's over.

46
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:05,106
I fought the final boss just
now, and the last battle's over.

47
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:07,544
It's all over.

48
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:14,599
I'm sorry, but I can't hear too well right now.

49
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:21,671
I think I know what you said though,
what you meant... that it's really over.

50
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:27,414
And finally... finally... I get to meet you.

51
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:35,065
So, anyway, I'm Asuna...

52
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,231
Asuna Yuki.

53
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,545
And I'm finally back.

54
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:44,151
I'm Kazuto Kirigaya.

55
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,886
Welcome home, Asuna.

56
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,889
Looking at this sentence, could anyone tell me how...

57
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,914
well, looks like that's all for today.

58
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:12,000
Keep an eye out for homework files 25 and 26,
then make sure to upload your answers by next week.

59
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:28,818
Huh?

60
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:34,413
Thanks for waiting for me.

61
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,856
I'm tired... tired and hungry.

62
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,803
You're starting to sound like an old man, Kirito.

63
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,554
Yeah, well, I feel like I've gotten
about five years older in the last month.

64
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,812
And, by the way, it's not Kirito.

65
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:51,724
It's Kazuto.

66
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,153
This is real life.

67
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:55,601
You shouldn't call someone by their avatar's name here.

68
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,381
I'm sorry! I forgot.

69
00:08:57,627 --> 00:09:00,829
Oh, no, now what am I gonna
do? Everyone will know it's me.

70
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:03,879
That's what you get for using
your real name for your avatar.

71
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,665
Eh, I guess it doesn't really matter 'cause
everyone at our school is stuck in S.A.O. same as us.

72
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,332
My cover's probably blown, too.

73
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:17,688
Asuna, are you getting around okay?

74
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,112
I mean, is the rehab you're doing helping?

75
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,750
Mm-hmm. I finally got the okay
to walk around without my crutches,

76
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,826
although the doctors say I shouldn't run just yet.

77
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:27,865
You will.

78
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:30,878
By the way, Kirito...

79
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:31,640
What?

80
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:36,383
...do you know that everyone in the cafeteria can see us?

81
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:42,262
Seriously.

82
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:45,344
That little oversight is gonna cost you lunch.

83
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,071
Sorry!

84
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,011
I didn't know.

85
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,487
Ta-da!

86
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,803
I was wondering about your dad.

87
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:00,599
Is he okay?

88
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,210
Mm-hmm.

89
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:04,102
He is, but he's still not over this whole thing.

90
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,080
He quit as c.E.O. And took an early retirement.

91
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:10,195
And now that he's got all this free
time, he doesn't know what to do with it.

92
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,931
Hopefully, dad can find a hobby,
and maybe that'll cheer him up.

93
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:15,664
I hope so.

94
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,936
That night in the parking lot,

95
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,298
the police came and arrested Sugou.

96
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:31,020
Later, when they interrogated him, he denied
everything and tried to pin the blame on Akihiko Kayaba.

97
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:36,622
But after the police questioned one of
his employees, Sugou confessed to everything.

98
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:44,097
As for those 300 S.A.O. Players, when they came to,
they couldn't remember anything about the experiments.

99
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:48,753
The good thing is they didn't suffer any
neurological or psychiatric after effects,

100
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,057
so everyone can go back to their lives.

101
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,355
But the fate of virtual mmos was a different story.

102
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,255
This latest incident practically
destroyed the industry all together.

103
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:03,588
In the end, rct progress was dismantled.

104
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,623
Its parent company also suffered a big hit.

105
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,961
A.l.o. Was shut down... no surprise there.

106
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:16,871
And as for the five or six other vrmmos, with
all the negative press and the public outcry,

107
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,581
their days were numbered, too.

108
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:22,688
You know who I was just thinking about?

109
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:23,673
The commander.

110
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:24,687
What happened to him?

111
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,000
Hmm? Oh.

112
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:27,548
Yeah.

113
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,192
Kayaba's dead.

114
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,194
They say it was suicide.

115
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:32,569
No way.

116
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,357
Yeah.

117
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:38,401
When the world of S.A.O. Collapsed, he did a high-output
scan on his brain and fried it when it was over.

118
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:39,466
So, wait.

119
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,827
Was he trying to copy his
consciousness to the net or something?

120
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,284
Well, it's a one-in-a-thousand shot for
it to work, but I know he pulled it off.

121
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,456
That day, Kayaba spoke to me,
or his consciousness did anyway.

122
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,737
What's this?

123
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,557
The beginnings of a new world.

124
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,273
I call it the seed.

125
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:03,435
Once it sprouts, you'll know what it is.

126
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,730
What you do with it is up to you.

127
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:07,847
You can even delete it if you want.

128
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,327
However, if you still have a

129
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,383
tiny bit of fondness left for the
virtual world, you'll take care of it.

130
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:16,602
Kirito?

131
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:20,160
Kirito, don't forget... we're meeting the others later.

132
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:20,676
Huh?

133
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:22,194
Oh, yeah, right.

134
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,662
Sorry. I was spacing out.

135
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:24,695
As always.

136
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:30,312
It doesn't matter whether you're in the game or
irl. The minute you relax, you space out like a champ.

137
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,601
Seriously.

138
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,645
Rika, you're driving me crazy with all that slurping.

139
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:45,820
Leave me alone.

140
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,150
He's all over her, and it's driving me nuts.

141
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:52,490
Acting like that at school, it's so tacky.

142
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,862
Spying on them's kind of tacky, too, you know?

143
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:02,601
If I'd have known it was gonna be like this, I
wouldn't have let you talk me into a month-long truce.

144
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:05,039
I didn't talk you into it! It was your idea!

145
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:08,573
You said we should let them have their
little romance for a month, remember?

146
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,793
I mean, god, talk about naive.

147
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:18,411
It's gonna be cool meeting everyone today, isn't it?

148
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,329
Yeah, I can't wait!

149
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,731
Sugu.

150
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:36,892
I forgot to ask before... did you ever meet Agil?

151
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:37,439
Yeah.

152
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,291
We went hunting together a couple of times in A.L.O.

153
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:42,137
His avatar is ginormous!

154
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:45,188
Yeah? Well, get ready 'cause
he's that big in real life, too.

155
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,950
Prepare to have your mind blown.

156
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,136
Hold on a sec.

157
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,336
Were we supposed to get here earlier?

158
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:06,753
We gave you a later time to make
sure everyone else got here first.

159
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:10,041
It wouldn't be right for the guests of
honor to show up before all the guests.

160
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,066
Don't just stand there. Come on in.

161
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:12,894
Uh, hey...

162
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:15,253
okay, let's get this party started.

163
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:16,478
You all know what to do.

164
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:18,319
Ready, and...

165
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:22,134
Congratulations on beating S.A.O., Kirito!

166
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:28,180
Cheers!

167
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,855
Cheers!

168
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,057
Bartender, bourbon on the rocks.

169
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:45,993
Whoa, dude.

170
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,154
This is oolong tea.

171
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:49,258
Agil, slide me a big-boy drink.

172
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,374
Klein, seriously?

173
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,612
Aren't you supposed to go back to work?

174
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:58,664
Alcohol makes the overtime go by faster.

175
00:14:58,894 --> 00:14:59,545
Uh-oh.

176
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,140
Chick alert.

177
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:03,818
Long time, no see.

178
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:04,891
Hi, thinker.

179
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:06,265
How have you been?

180
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,872
I heard that you and Yulier are married now.

181
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,612
I know it's late, but congrats.

182
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:17,401
Thank you. But ever since we got back, it's been
taking everything we've got to adjust to life here.

183
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:20,385
The good thing is I'm settling in to work mode again.

184
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,539
Congratulations on getting that far.

185
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,272
Hey, I've been reading the new MMO today.

186
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,131
Nice job.

187
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,774
Yeah, I wish it were better.

188
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,831
It could have used a bit more content.

189
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,014
Oh, well.

190
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:34,884
With the way mmos are now,
who needs walkthroughs and news?

191
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,071
Those things are gonna be irrelevant soon anyway.

192
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,660
You know what they say about how the universe was born...

193
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:41,233
first, there was chaos.

194
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:44,713
By the way, Agil, has the seed been doing okay?

195
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:46,381
It's doing amazing.

196
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,185
We got 50 mirrors already set up.

197
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,918
It's been downloaded 100,000 times.

198
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,939
And check this out... it's got 300
big-ass servers actually running it.

199
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,601
After I visited Asuna at the hospital, I took the thing

200
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:04,749
Kayaba called the seed over to
Agil and asked him to check it out.

201
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:09,430
Turned out it was a full-dive mmo that Kayaba developed.

202
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:12,363
It came in a program package called the world seed,

203
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,579
a stripped-down version of the cardinal
system that could run on small servers.

204
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:22,240
Kayaba had modified the program so that
anyone with access to an ordinary server

205
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:26,304
could easily download it and use it
to create their very own online world.

206
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,835
After Agil said it was safe to use,

207
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:34,188
I had him upload it to servers across the
globe so that everyone could access it for free.

208
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:41,807
It turned out that was exactly what
virtual mmos needed to keep the genre going.

209
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:48,862
As for Alfheim Online, all the data was transferred to
a new company that decided to keep it online and running.

210
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:53,366
But the new Alfheim wasn't the
the only world born out of the seed.

211
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:58,150
Everyone from individual gamers to
a few hundred small companies were

212
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,272
suddenly creating brand-new worlds
on their very own virtual game servers.

213
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:05,664
The best part is they were all connected to each other.

214
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:09,437
It's almost to the point where you
could create a character in one world,

215
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,496
then transfer it to another with all its skills intact.

216
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:15,684
Hey.

217
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,704
Has anything changed for tonight's after party?

218
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,220
Nope.

219
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,753
We're still on for 11:00.

220
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,239
We're meeting up in Yggdrasil city.

221
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:23,462
You know, I had a feeling you were gonna fly too high up.

222
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:26,265
It's almost 11:00, so I came to get you.

223
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:29,127
Oh. Okay, thanks.

224
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:30,056
Uh...

225
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,616
Hey, Kazut... Kirito,

226
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:41,432
you know how a.L.O.'S got a new company running it now
and how you can use your old S.A.O. avatar if you want?

227
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:46,000
Everyone else is using theirold
avatar, so how come you're not?

228
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:46,833
Hmm.

229
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,714
I guess 'cause, in that world,
that Kirito's mission is over now.

230
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:55,789
I guess so.

231
00:18:57,892 --> 00:19:03,092
Then I was the first to meet the Spriggan version
of Kirito and show him the way to the world tree.

232
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,181
That's pretty cool.

233
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,829
Hey, Kirito, dance with me.

234
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:11,385
Huh?

235
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:14,656
Dance! It's an advanced technique I just mastered.

236
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:18,155
You just hover, then slowly spin on your "X" axis.

237
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:19,108
Uh...

238
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:21,862
That's it.

239
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,499
Yeah, you're doing great.

240
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:24,462
Leafa?

241
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,427
Anyway, I think I'm gonna go home now.

242
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,438
But w-why?

243
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,654
Because...

244
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:41,255
It's too far away, like everything
and everyone else, and even you.

245
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,802
I couldn't go that far even if I tried.

246
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:45,968
Sugu.

247
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,193
That's so not true.

248
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,600
You can go anywhere... anywhere that you want.

249
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,653
Aah!

250
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,523
It's coming.

251
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:16,327
Huh?

252
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,133
Okay.

253
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:24,872
What's up with the moon?

254
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:46,293
No way.

255
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,367
No way. Is that...

256
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,111
Isn't it awesome?

257
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:57,939
That's Aincrad... the floating castle.

258
00:21:59,098 --> 00:21:59,955
How?

259
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,986
I mean, what's it doing here?

260
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,194
I'm gonna beat it.

261
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,723
I'm gonna go floor by floor,
all hundred of them, and this time,

262
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,836
I'm gonna conquer it.

263
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:19,304
Leafa, I went ahead and reset all my
stats so I'm starting from scratch again.

264
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,838
Do you want to help me beat it?

265
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,822
Mm-hmm. I will.

266
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:30,809
I'll go anywhere... with you.

267
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:40,233
Hey, Kirito!

268
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,479
You're late, man.

269
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:55,732
We're gonna leave you behind!

270
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,075
See you there!

271
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:57,971
Come on!

272
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:58,861
Hurry!

273
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,017
Come on, Kirito,

274
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,770
Leafa.

275
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,773
Let's go.

276
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:10,885
Hurry, daddy.

277
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,330
Everyone's waiting.

278
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,693
Okay, let's go!
