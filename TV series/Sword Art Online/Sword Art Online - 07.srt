1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,615
Hmm!

2
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,133
There you go! All done.

3
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,153
You're the best, Liz. Thanks.

4
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:20,759
Sure! Anytime.

5
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:25,328
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
out hunting with the guild today?

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:31,190
Yeah. I had to take the day off, 'cause I
sort of have this little meeting with someone.

7
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:31,896
Oh.

8
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,126
I bet you have a little meeting!

9
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,120
No! It's not like that!

10
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,694
Uh, I have to get going!

11
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,756
I bet he must be pretty special, whoever he is.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,399
Huh?

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,861
Did you say something?

14
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,255
Mm. Get going!

15
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:55,034
It's rude to keep your date waiting!

16
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:58,464
It's not like that! I... uh, whatever! See you!

17
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,391
I wonder if I'll ever find someone special.

18
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:57,457
Hmm.

19
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:59,102
Good enough, I guess.

20
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:04,940
I better get ready for the customers!

21
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,238
Perfect!

22
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:15,434
Welcome to Lisbeth's blacksmith shop!

23
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,771
Oh. Hi.

24
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,709
Uh, I was wondering if you do custom orders.

25
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:24,912
Hmm.

26
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,558
He doesn't look like he has that much money.

27
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,221
I can. The thing is, metal
prices are kind of high these days.

28
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:32,649
Oh.

29
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:34,716
Well, I'm not worried about the cost.

30
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:37,352
I just want the best sword you
can make as soon as possible.

31
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,696
Well, I make a lot of different swords.

32
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,993
But if you have any idea of the
quality of sword you want, I can make it.

33
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:44,449
Uh, sure. One sec.

34
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:45,078
Hmm?

35
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:49,633
So, I'm looking for something either
the same quality or better than this.

36
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:50,105
Oh.

37
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:54,984
An Elucidator!

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,219
This is the gnarliest magic sword a
person can get from a monster drop!

39
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,142
What do you think?

40
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:01,896
Mm.

41
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,243
How about this?

42
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,031
It's the best sword I ever forged.

43
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,913
I call it my masterpiece.

44
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,955
I don't know. It's a little light.

45
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,409
It should be.

46
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,427
I used a speed-type metal to forge it.

47
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:18,961
I'd like to test it, if it's cool.

48
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,153
Test it how?

49
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,861
You know, its durability.

50
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,350
What the heck are you doing?!

51
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:27,479
If you break your sword, I'm not responsible!

52
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,861
If it breaks, then that's too bad!

53
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:41,985
Uh...

54
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:45,870
You broke my masterpiece.

55
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,589
What the hell were you thinking?!

56
00:04:57,636 --> 00:05:01,764
I'm sorry! I didn't think yours
was gonna break so easy, honest!

57
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:05,916
Are you saying my sword, my masterpiece
of a sword, was lamer than you thought?!

58
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:08,704
Yeah... something like that.

59
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,401
For your information, if I had the
right materials, I could make a butt-load

60
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:17,426
of swords that would shatter yours
into a million tiny, little pieces!

61
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:18,398
You got that?

62
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,034
Oh, yeah?

63
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:24,276
That sounds like the kind of sword I'm looking
for, as long as it can shatter mine, though.

64
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,430
Okay, smarty pants! But you have to
help me make it every step of the way!

65
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,370
Seriously?

66
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,154
Absolutely.

67
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,206
And we'll start by getting the metal for it.

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,568
I think I can handle that myself.

69
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:36,876
I'd rather not have you slowing me down.

70
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:38,436
Don't you dare insult me!

71
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:41,232
Believe it or not, I'm an expert mace-user.

72
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:44,416
Suit yourself. So, where do we find the metal?

73
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:47,172
Floor 55 on the western mountain.

74
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,319
There's a dragon there that eats crystals.

75
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:53,370
According to the legends, it's supposed
to store a rare metal in its body.

76
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,055
Floor 55, huh?

77
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,352
Yeah, I should go alone.

78
00:05:56,377 --> 00:06:00,576
And they say that in order to get the
metal, you need to bring a master Smith along.

79
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,857
Still think going alone's a good idea?

80
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,027
I...

81
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,311
fine. Just keep quiet and stay out of the way.

82
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,862
Wha... keep quiet and...

83
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,641
by the way, my name's Kirito.

84
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:17,976
Looks like we're a party until we make that sword.

85
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,763
Yeah, whatever, Kirito!

86
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:22,655
Well, if you're gonna be like that, I can roll with it...

87
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,878
Lis-s-s-s-Beth!

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,210
It's cold!

89
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,761
Well, you should've brought a coat or something.

90
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,145
I didn't know floor 55 was going to be this freaking cold!

91
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:47,790
Huh?

92
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,217
Are you going to be okay without this?

93
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,362
You don't feel cold if you're disciplined.

94
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,493
If you're trying to piss me off, it's working.

95
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,733
It's warm, though.

96
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:03,423
I can't believe I'm out here all alone with this guy.

97
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:07,919
This is getting weird. What's wrong, Lisbeth?

98
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,548
Giving up already?

99
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:10,905
Not on your life!

100
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:14,546
And if you're gonna be a jerk about
it, you might as well call me Liz.

101
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:15,543
Okay, okay!

102
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,830
Got it, Liz.

103
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:18,602
Yeah, well, don't wear it out!

104
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,943
It's beautiful!

105
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,856
What's your problem?!

106
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:40,032
You should get your teleport crystal ready.

107
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,543
I know, I know. I'm doing it.

108
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,711
And I'm handling this part on my own.

109
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,826
Once the dragon appears, you're gonna
hide under one of those crystals over there.

110
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,749
Don't come out no matter what.

111
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,980
Oh, come on!

112
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:52,932
I'm not a noob!

113
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:54,316
If I want help you, I'll darn well...

114
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,356
Do what I say!

115
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,164
Mm-hmm.

116
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:02,839
Good.

117
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,032
Okay. Let's get going.

118
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:17,120
Hurry up and take cover!

119
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:17,834
Okay!

120
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,382
Watch out! It's a breath attack!

121
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:41,908
Wow.

122
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:44,775
And with that skinny sword!

123
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:46,602
Who is he?

124
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:59,184
Come on! Stop playing with it and finish it off already!

125
00:08:59,184 --> 00:08:59,790
Damn it!

126
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,107
Don't come out yet!

127
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,782
What's the big deal? You've got it right where you...

128
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,230
Liz!

129
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:23,687
Hang on to me, Liz!

130
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,940
Are we still alive?

131
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,293
Yeah. Looks like it.

132
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:50,766
Drink one of these just in case.

133
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:51,854
Mm.

134
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:06,561
Thank you, you know, for... for saving me.

135
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,689
It's a little early to be thanking anyone.

136
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,072
We have to find a way to get out of here first.

137
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:11,612
Huh?

138
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,527
Can't we just teleport out?

139
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:17,047
Teleport... lindas!

140
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,065
No way!

141
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:24,340
Well, if we can't use crystals, that
means there should be another way out.

142
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,374
How can you be so sure there is?!

143
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:30,314
I mean, maybe this is some kind of trap
rigged to kill anyone who falls into it!

144
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:31,116
Good point.

145
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,483
Maybe it is.

146
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:36,942
Would it kill you to at least try to cheer me up?!

147
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,539
I think I have an idea.

148
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:39,777
Really?

149
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,713
Yeah.

150
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,988
We could try running up the wall.

151
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:43,447
Uh...

152
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:46,910
You're insane.

153
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,374
Maybe.

154
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,287
But that's all I got for ideas right now.

155
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,033
No way!

156
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:10,452
If I had more of a running
start, I probably would've made it.

157
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,551
Yeah, I don't think so.

158
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,858
This is kind of weird, isn't it?

159
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,272
This wouldn't happen in real life...

160
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:27,748
You know, going to strange places, meeting a
total stranger, and then sleeping next to them!

161
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,833
I mean, you actually tried running up that wall!

162
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,138
You really are a weirdo! You know that?

163
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,098
Well, excuse me.

164
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,020
Kirito, can I ask you something?

165
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:44,125
Ask away.

166
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:45,269
I'm all ears.

167
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:48,527
Why did you risk your life like that to save me?

168
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,910
I can't just sit back and watch someone die.

169
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,858
I'd rather die alongside them than do nothing...

170
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:59,457
Especially if that someone's a girl like you, Liz.

171
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,461
Wow, you really are an idiot.

172
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,915
You're the only person who'd think like that.

173
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:10,332
Hey.

174
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,294
Hold my hand?

175
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,184
Uh...

176
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:20,139
Okay.

177
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,125
It's so warm.

178
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:31,403
Huh?

179
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:36,673
Even though you and me are just
these 1's and 0's in a virtual world.

180
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:38,587
I know.

181
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,269
What the...

182
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,203
Whatcha doing?

183
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:08,155
Hmm? Here. Look.

184
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,051
Is this... What I think it is?

185
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:14,678
Uh-huh.

186
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,619
It's that special metal we came all this way for.

187
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:21,892
Like you said, the dragon eats crystals,
and they turn to this in its stomach.

188
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:25,016
No wonder it's hard to find.

189
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,558
Yeah, but you found it.

190
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:29,146
What's it doing down here, though?

191
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:31,402
This hole isn't a trap like we thought.

192
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,133
It's the dragon's nest.

193
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:34,246
Re-really?

194
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:35,008
Uh-huh.

195
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:36,820
And that's not just an ingot.

196
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,156
That's dragon excrement.

197
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,283
You know, poop?

198
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,125
Huh

199
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,555
well, I guess this means we got what we came here for.

200
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,055
Still stuck, though.

201
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:51,728
Wait.

202
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:54,283
This is supposed to be a dragon's nest, right?

203
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,791
Yep.

204
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:58,462
'Cause dragons are nocturnal,
so it won't be long before it

205
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,017
comes... home?

206
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:05,111
It's here!

207
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,077
Wha... Wha... Wha-what are you doing?!

208
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,036
Hang on to me, Liz!

209
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,754
Almost there!

210
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:47,991
Wow.

211
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:49,619
Look at that!

212
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,443
Kirito!

213
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,214
You know what?!

214
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:04,740
No, what?!

215
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:09,116
Don't freak out, but I'm falling in love with you!

216
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,978
I can't hear a thing!

217
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,646
What did you just say?!

218
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,688
Never mind!

219
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,626
A one-handed longsword, right?

220
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,166
Yep.

221
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:31,747
Make it awesome.

222
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:45,506
I didn't imagine

223
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,057
the warmth of Kirito's hands...

224
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:49,701
The way I feel?

225
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,412
As soon as I've made the best sword I can...

226
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:54,888
I'll tell him.

227
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,647
Whoa.

228
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:16,181
The sword is called dark repulsor.

229
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:17,715
One of a kind.

230
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:20,854
And it's not even in the info brokers' directory.

231
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,747
Go on. Try it.

232
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,769
Okay.

233
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,920
Good? Bad?

234
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:33,351
It's real heavy.

235
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,057
It's a good sword!

236
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,043
Yay!

237
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,584
It feels like you forged your soul into it.

238
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:46,474
Okay.

239
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,547
You held up your end of the deal.

240
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:50,328
It's time for me to pay up.

241
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,368
So how much?

242
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,514
Um... well...

243
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,833
I don't really need any money.

244
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,267
Instead...

245
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,279
I'd like to be your exclusive blacksmith from now on.

246
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,528
What do you mean, exclusive?

247
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:11,287
What's wrong?

248
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:18,135
I mean any time you get back from the field,
stop by and let me do maintenance on your gear,

249
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,470
every day, from now till the end!

250
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:22,847
Uh...

251
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,166
Liz, I...

252
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:26,556
Kirito...

253
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:27,891
I just...

254
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,671
I...

255
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,984
Liz! I was so worried!

256
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:34,605
Asuna?

257
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:35,805
Liz!

258
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,332
Where were you last night?! I tried messaging you, but
you didn't answer, and I couldn't track you on the map!

259
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:42,048
Uh, sorry.

260
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,136
I kind of got stuck in a dungeon.

261
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,180
A dungeon?!

262
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,775
You went all by yourself?!

263
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,808
Unh-unh. I went with him.

264
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:49,483
Huh?

265
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:51,423
K-Kirito?!

266
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,115
Uh, hey, Asuna!

267
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:55,602
Long time, no see!

268
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:57,915
It's been, what, like two days?

269
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,490
Well, this is a surprise!

270
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,500
I didn't know you wanted to check this place out!

271
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:03,993
I wish you would've told me! I could've come with you!

272
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,598
I'm sort of confused. You know each other?

273
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:07,520
Yeah.

274
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,927
Both of us are on the assault team, so...

275
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:15,802
He said he was looking to get a more powerful
sword, so I told him about you and your shop.

276
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:16,650
Oh.

277
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,550
Why is she acting like that?

278
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,344
I swear, if you did anything weird to her...

279
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,917
I-I didn't do anything!

280
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,943
Then why'd you stutter just now, huh?

281
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,146
You know, you could try to show a little more compassion.

282
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,435
I almost got killed!

283
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:30,085
Like that's my fault!

284
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:32,237
Don't I always tell you not to fight solo?!

285
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:33,587
Right.

286
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,623
I get it now.

287
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:40,443
If this guy said anything rude, you'd tell me, right?

288
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:42,883
Liz?

289
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:44,942
Uh...

290
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:48,691
You want to talk about rude, try this!

291
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:51,355
First thing he does when he
comes in is shatter my best sword!

292
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,539
What?! I'm sorry!

293
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,487
Oh, come on. You don't have to apologize for anything!

294
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,491
He might be a little weird, but he's not such a bad guy.

295
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,612
Don't screw this up, Asuna!

296
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:03,604
He's a keeper.

297
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:06,983
But I told you! It's not like that!

298
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:08,165
Liz?

299
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:10,653
Sorry. I have to go pick up some supplies!

300
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:11,807
I'll be right back!

301
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,181
But y-you're gonna leave the store?

302
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:15,770
Hold down the fort for me.

303
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:16,613
Later!

304
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,264
What?! No, wait! Li...

305
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,387
Lisbeth.

306
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,976
I almost got away with it.

307
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:55,270
A couple more minutes, and I would've
gone back to my usual, cheerful self.

308
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:56,446
Liz, I...

309
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,466
How'd you know I was here?

310
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:06,853
I scanned the whole town for you from up there.

311
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,302
Figures you'd do something crazy like that.

312
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,100
Sorry if I worried you.

313
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:19,501
I'm fine now.

314
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,283
Must be all the excitement.

315
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:23,474
I'm not used to having adventures.

316
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,023
Anyway...

317
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:28,083
Oh, just forget everything...

318
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,162
I said.

319
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,672
Okay?

320
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:33,745
Liz, I...

321
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,981
I just wanted to thank you.

322
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,284
See, I...

323
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:39,975
I don't know.

324
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:44,101
I always thought dying was better
than surviving day after day...

325
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,087
Living with the guilt.

326
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:48,707
Kirito.

327
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:54,253
But then we got stuck in that hole, and
I was really happy we were still alive!

328
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:58,507
I realized that even here, our
lives are real and have meaning.

329
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:00,896
Thank you for helping me see that, Liz.

330
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,722
I guess it's what I've been looking for this whole time.

331
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:05,360
Yeah. Me, too.

332
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,152
I know what you mean! I was also
looking for something... something real,

333
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,717
hoping I'd find it.

334
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,728
The warmth of your hand...

335
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:16,189
for me...

336
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:17,905
That was real.

337
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,842
Do me a favor, okay?

338
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:26,621
Tell Asuna what you told me.

339
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:27,838
Liz...

340
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:29,648
I'm fine, really!

341
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,836
The getting-over-it part... that's gonna take a while.

342
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:37,340
Until I do, promise me...

343
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,915
Promise me you'll put an end to this world.

344
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:42,692
Till then...

345
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:45,427
I'll keep doing what I do best.

346
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:48,246
I promise I will.

347
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,390
I swear I'll beat the game.

348
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,820
If you ever need your weapons or
gear repaired, my door is always open.

349
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:58,717
Sure.

350
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,530
Don't forget, now!

351
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,476
You'll always be welcome at my shop.

352
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,087
Next time: "The Sword Dance of Black and White".
