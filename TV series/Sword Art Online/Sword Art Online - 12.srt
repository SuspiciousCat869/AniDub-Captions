1
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,046
There's so...

2
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:16,453
Many of 'em, huh?

3
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:17,643
Yeah, there are.

4
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:20,422
I know, right? It's like this pretty much every day.

5
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:26,989
By the way, is Yui feeling any better? Well, she
got a good night's sleep, so I think she's okay.

6
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:27,256
Mmm.

7
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:28,679
I don't know. You tell me.

8
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,340
Has this ever happened to her before?

9
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,856
We have no idea.

10
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:37,145
You see, we found her on floor
22, wandering in the forest.

11
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:40,619
The poor thing... she's lost her memory.

12
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:41,674
Oh.

13
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:43,955
That's the reason we came here.

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,269
We thought maybe someone in the town
of beginnings might know who she is.

15
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:51,144
You live here.

16
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:52,487
Have you ever seen her before?

17
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,473
Uh...

18
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:55,030
Sorry, I haven't.

19
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:58,406
I mean, there are a lot of kids
in town, but I've never seen her.

20
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:03,776
When the game started, a lot of the
children suffered severe psychological trauma.

21
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:09,345
I couldn't stand by and do nothing, so I moved to
this church and made it a safe place for them to live.

22
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,494
I walked through the town every
day, looking for kids like these,

23
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:17,465
kids who might need my help, but in
all this time, I've never seen her before.

24
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:19,721
Back to square one.

25
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:21,352
Huh?

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,039
Sorry to bother you.

27
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,110
I'm Yulier.

28
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:28,986
And you're with the army, right?

29
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,770
I hope you're not here to start
trouble because of yesterday.

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,639
God, no.

31
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:34,141
In fact, I'm here to thank you.

32
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,072
You did right by putting those men in their place.

33
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:37,812
Huh?

34
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,507
Actually, I came here to ask the two of you for your help.

35
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,292
Seriously?

36
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,255
When the guild was formed, we... well,
actually, it was our leader, thinker.

37
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,798
He never wanted it to turn into the kind
of dictatorial organization it's become.

38
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:31,933
At first, the mission of the
guild was to share information

39
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:35,064
and food equally among as many players as possible.

40
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,464
But then the guild grew too large, didn't it?

41
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:38,293
Right.

42
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:41,724
And after much infighting, one man became very powerful.

43
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,430
His name is Kibaou.

44
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:49,663
Kibaou and his group became stronger and stronger,
monopolizing all the best monster spawn points.

45
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:55,169
They're out of control now, extorting other
players under the pretext of collecting taxes.

46
00:03:55,676 --> 00:04:00,070
It was obvious Kibaou didn't care about clearing
the game, and that made a lot of people mad.

47
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,940
He had to do something to get back in their good graces,

48
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:06,482
so he sent the highest-level
players he had to the front lines.

49
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,141
Corvatz!

50
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:15,301
Kibaou was denounced after spearheading that massacre.

51
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:19,567
That's when we started to seriously
consider kicking him out of the guild for good.

52
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:24,802
And now that he's scared and getting
desperate, he's decided to eliminate thinker.

53
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:30,427
He set a trap and stranded thinker deep inside a dungeon.

54
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,613
Can't he teleport out?

55
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:33,787
Mnh-mnh.

56
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,329
Does he have any weapons?

57
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,554
He didn't take anything with him.

58
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,363
Kibaou told him he wanted to talk, unarmed.

59
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:41,916
Thinker believed him.

60
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:43,626
That was three days ago.

61
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,310
He's been gone that long?

62
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:46,795
Can't he find his way out?

63
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,607
The dungeon is the highest level we've seen so far.

64
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:51,879
He can't get out of there on his own.

65
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,534
As his second-in-command, this is my responsibility.

66
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:59,974
But the problem is, my level
isn't high enough to reach him.

67
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:04,892
And Kibaou is using his influence to
keep the rest of the army from helping me.

68
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,271
When I heard that two of the most powerful
players anyone's seen were in town, I thought,

69
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,742
"this is my chance." I tracked
you down because I need your help.

70
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:19,871
Kirito, Asuna, I beg you for thinker's sake,
please help me rescue him from that dungeon!

71
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:25,256
If you think we can help get thinker
out of there, we'd be glad to help you.

72
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:26,423
However...

73
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,594
Well, the thing is, we'd like to
make sure you're telling the truth.

74
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:33,756
I'm sorry. I know we just met,
and I'm asking a lot from you.

75
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:40,194
But when I think about him trapped alone
in there, I feel like I'm going insane!

76
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:44,998
It's okay, mommy.

77
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:45,386
Uh?

78
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,661
Everything she's been telling you is the truth.

79
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,705
Y-Yui, you mean you can tell?

80
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:52,570
Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:55,598
I don't know how I know she is, but...

82
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:57,012
She is.

83
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,317
If anything, I'd rather trust her and
regret it than not trust her and regret it.

84
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,047
Uh...

85
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:08,815
Let's go.

86
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,216
It'll all work out.

87
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,470
Right?

88
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,294
Whatever you say, Mr. Easygoing.

89
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,474
Okay, we'll help. I just hope
we're strong enough to do it.

90
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:23,803
Thank you so much!

91
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,439
I know what it feels like to want to save someone,

92
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,623
especially someone you care for.

93
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,714
Stay here and wait for us, okay?

94
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,614
No, I'm coming, too!

95
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,610
Oh, come on, Yui. Don't you want to stay here with me?

96
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,518
No!

97
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:37,828
Uh...

98
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,988
Great, now we get to see her rebellious side.

99
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,245
Hey, this is serious.

100
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:45,445
It's too dangerous for you to
come along with us this time.

101
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,900
I'm going, too!

102
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:55,481
I never knew this dungeon was
under the town of beginnings.

103
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:56,544
I know.

104
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,658
There wasn't anything like this during the beta test.

105
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:03,831
I think the dungeon opens up to reveal
more as the floors above are cleared.

106
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,437
I bet Kibaou was planning on
keeping this place all to himself.

107
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,441
Exclusive access to spawns can be profitable.

108
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:14,828
The thing is, the monsters here
are usually around level sixty.

109
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,037
He wouldn't be able to do much hunting.

110
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,477
This is the entrance.

111
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:22,583
Mm.

112
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,577
Huh?

113
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,537
Don't worry... I'm not afraid!

114
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,299
No, it's okay.

115
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,953
Believe it or not, she's a heck
of a lot tougher than she looks.

116
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:31,525
Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,559
She'll make a fine swordswoman someday.

118
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:34,234
Mm-hmm!

119
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,921
We should get going.

120
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,308
Come here, little froggy!

121
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:02,035
I feel like I should apologize.

122
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,457
He's doing all the fighting.

123
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,156
Oh, no.

124
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,198
He's happy out there.

125
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:07,135
Really, he loves getting his battle on.

126
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,887
We're pretty far down. Are we almost there?

127
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:16,414
Thinker hasn't moved from this position for a while now.

128
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:19,120
It could be a safe zone, but I'm not sure.

129
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,729
If we can reach it, maybe we can use a teleport crystal.

130
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:23,467
Whew!

131
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,723
Man, I fought my butt off!

132
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:26,916
I should've helped you.

133
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:27,908
No, not at all.

134
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,053
I had a blast.

135
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,832
Besides, they dropped some items.

136
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:31,507
Really?

137
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:32,793
You get anything good?

138
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,017
Uh-huh.

139
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,776
What... what is that?!

140
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,228
It's scavenged toad meat.

141
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,683
You mean those frogs?!

142
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,805
Hey, the weirder the meat, the better the taste.

143
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,497
Maybe you can cook it up later.

144
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,895
Not on your life!

145
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,834
What the hell?!

146
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,743
Oh, come on, what'd you do that for?!

147
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:52,273
Hmph!

148
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:53,848
Damn it! Okay, fine!

149
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:54,675
Hmm?

150
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,819
What am I gonna do with these?!

151
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:59,298
No! No, no, no, no, no!

152
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:00,324
Asuna!

153
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:01,405
It's good meat!

154
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,452
Get rid of it!

155
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:03,557
But it's delicious!

156
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,076
Ew!

157
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:05,115
You just have to cook it right!

158
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,076
You smiled.

159
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:06,839
Uh?

160
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,590
I've never ever seen you smile before!

161
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:14,907
Uh?

162
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:22,337
Come on, let's go.

163
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,542
Look, it's a safe zone.

164
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:37,784
Huh?

165
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,651
There's a player inside.

166
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,870
It's thinker!

167
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,203
Wait, don't!

168
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:45,205
Huh?

169
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,043
Yulier!

170
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:54,523
Thinker!

171
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,995
Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,566
No, stay away!

173
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,336
The corridor's rigged!

174
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:04,272
Stop! Wait, Yulier!

175
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,169
Come back!

176
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:07,576
Unh!

177
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:19,906
Yulier.

178
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:20,232
Uh?

179
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,959
Take her to the safe zone and wait for us there, okay?

180
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,356
O-Okay.

181
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:26,072
Mommy...

182
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:27,072
Come on.

183
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:51,782
Asuna, use a teleport crystal and
get Yui and the others out of here now.

184
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,351
I can't see its data with my I.D. Skill.

185
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,780
It could be as strong as something from floor 90.

186
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,665
I can buy you time. Just get everyone out of here!

187
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,447
No way am I leaving you here!

188
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:03,343
I'll catch up!

189
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:04,176
Move it!

190
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:07,848
Mommy!

191
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:11,558
Take care of Yui!

192
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,346
Run while you still have a chance!

193
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:14,188
Asuna!

194
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,641
No, we can't leave...

195
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:16,450
hurry!

196
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:16,761
Uh?

197
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:52,640
Kirito!

198
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:53,825
Yui, no!

199
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,676
It's dangerous!

200
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,518
Come back!

201
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,412
What are you doing?! Get away from it!

202
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,633
Yui!

203
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,824
Daddy, mommy, it's okay.

204
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,723
Yui!

205
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,922
An immortal object?!

206
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:35,401
Uh, Yui?

207
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:36,551
Yui...

208
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,446
Daddy, mommy...

209
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,979
Don't worry... I remember everything.

210
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,440
Yui, say something.

211
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,133
You remember who you are?

212
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:53,752
Yes.

213
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,898
Kirito, Asuna.

214
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:05,725
Everything in the world of sword art online
is controlled by a single massive system.

215
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:09,022
The system is called cardinal.

216
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:13,964
It was designed to operate entirely on
its own without any human intervention.

217
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:19,035
Its function is to regulate the balance
of S.A.O. According to its own discretion.

218
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:25,278
From monsters and NPC A.I. to
drop rates for items and money,

219
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:30,292
everything here is controlled by the
processes the cardinal program executes.

220
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,370
That includes the psychological care of the players.

221
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:38,890
Mental health counseling program, prototype one.

222
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,636
Code name... Yui.

223
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:43,113
That is who I am.

224
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,077
You're a program?

225
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:47,657
An A.I.?

226
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:51,503
I was designed to put players at ease with me.

227
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,176
That's why I was given the
ability to emulate complex emotions.

228
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,488
Nothing about me is real,

229
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:00,537
nothing, not even my tears.

230
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:03,414
I'm so sorry, Asuna.

231
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,662
Oh, Yui...

232
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:07,370
Uh?

233
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:12,366
But then what about your amnesia?

234
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,751
Can that even happen to an A.I.?

235
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:19,211
Two years ago, on the day of the official launch

236
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:26,151
and for reasons I never understood, the cardinal program
banned me from interacting with any of the players.

237
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,998
I wasn't allowed to assist them.

238
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:33,183
I couldn't do anything except
continue monitoring their mental states.

239
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:37,759
Their situation, in a word, was horrible.

240
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,547
No, don't!

241
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:49,008
Terror, despair, rage.

242
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,172
People were overcome by negative

243
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:56,121
feelings. Some of them couldn't take it.

244
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:03,978
They went insane. Under normal circumstances, my function
would have been to go to such players immediately.

245
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:07,260
But I wasn't permitted any contact with them.

246
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:12,471
Little by little, errors began piling up inside of me.

247
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,383
And I fell apart.

248
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:22,009
Then one day, I saw two players.

249
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:27,152
Their mental parameters were vastly different
from anything I'd seen among the others.

250
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:29,910
There was joy.

251
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,611
And peace.

252
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,374
And there was something more.

253
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,096
I wandered through the playing field,

254
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:44,681
hoping to get as close to both of
you as I could without being detected.

255
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,844
So that's why you were in the forest.

256
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,788
Yes, that's why.

257
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:54,443
I've wanted to meet the two of you for the longest time.

258
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,455
That's strange, isn't it?

259
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:59,626
It should be impossible for me to think things like that.

260
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm not human. I'm a program, after all.

261
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:05,942
Yui...

262
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,651
Maybe what you're feeling are real human emotions.

263
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,027
I don't know. I'm confused.

264
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,349
Nothing makes sense. I don't know what's happened to me.

265
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:19,884
uh?

266
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,363
You aren't just some program anymore.

267
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:25,039
The system can't control you.

268
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,971
Listen, if you want something,
all you have to do is say it.

269
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:31,656
Go ahead, tell us what you want.

270
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,878
Mm. What I want...

271
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,142
I want...

272
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,751
I want to stay with you forever!

273
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,062
Daddy!

274
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,238
Mommy!

275
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:56,681
You will!

276
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:59,276
We'll be together forever, Yui.

277
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:01,729
Yeah.

278
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:03,913
Remember, you're our child.

279
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,350
It's too late.

280
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:13,876
For what?

281
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:21,885
Look, this is actually a console the G.M.
Can use to gain emergency access to the system.

282
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,970
I used it to delete the monster in the corridor.

283
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:32,270
And now because I disobeyed the cardinal's directive,

284
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:35,392
the system is running a check on my program.

285
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,536
It thinks I'm a foreign object now.

286
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,010
I'll probably be deleted at once.

287
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:41,835
Oh, no!

288
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:44,482
There's got to be a way around it!

289
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:48,511
Daddy, mommy, thank you.

290
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:50,980
This is goodbye.

291
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:57,153
No! I don't want that!

292
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:58,859
Stay with us!

293
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,353
Please stay!

294
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:03,111
We just started living like a real family!

295
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:05,844
Yui, don't go!

296
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:11,604
Whenever the two of you are around,
you have a way of making people smile.

297
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:17,335
From now on and for me, please continue my work.

298
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,049
Keep helping people.

299
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:22,028
Share your happiness with all of them.

300
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,292
I can't! I won't!

301
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:25,945
You have to stay with us!

302
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,232
I can't be happy without you!

303
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,184
Smile, mommy.

304
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:58,584
Uh...

305
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:03,195
Cardinal!

306
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:05,193
No! Kayaba!

307
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:09,826
You're gonna find out things don't
always go the way you want 'em to!

308
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,976
Kirito, what are you...

309
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:18,394
If I'm fast enough, I might be able to
use the G.M.'s account to access the system.

310
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,229
Agh!

311
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:30,669
Kirito!

312
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,805
Are you okay?

313
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,931
What's this?

314
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:43,773
The system was about to reject Yui's admin credentials.

315
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:47,954
The only thing I could do was take her
program and turn it into a game object.

316
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,252
So this is...

317
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:54,072
You're holding Yui's heart.

318
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:06,825
Bye!

319
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:07,412
Bye-bye!

320
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:08,486
Hey, Kirito?

321
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:09,303
Hmm?

322
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,602
If the game does get cleared and this world ends,

323
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,405
what's going to happen to Yui?

324
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:21,673
Don't worry... I fixed it, so her data will
be saved to the local memory on my nervegear.

325
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:26,973
When we get back, re-creating her
the way she was isn't gonna be easy.

326
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:30,666
But if there's a way, we'll find.

327
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:37,374
Okay.

328
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:40,233
As long as we can be a family again.

329
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:44,354
We'll see her when we get back... our first child.

330
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,225
Yeah, we'll see her again.

331
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,704
Hey, Asuna, you okay?

332
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,520
Good luck, mommy.

333
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:38,801
Next time: "Edge of Hell's Abyss".
