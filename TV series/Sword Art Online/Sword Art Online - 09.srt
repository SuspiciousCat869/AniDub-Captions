1
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:05,134
Okay, are you ready?

2
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,160
There's nothing in here.

3
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:20,614
Hey, wait.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,812
I'll be okay.

5
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,282
I'm not going in too far.

6
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:26,803
Besides, we should find out what
kind of boss we're dealing with.

7
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,805
How else we gonna figure out how to beat it?

8
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,544
Yeah, I know. It's just...

9
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,551
That one's gonna be tough to beat.

10
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:41,327
You're right. I saw he only had that one big sword,
and I'm pretty sure it's got special attacks, too.

11
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:46,096
We're gonna have to put tanks in the front
row and keep switching out, just to wear it down.

12
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:49,218
Yeah, and it wouldn't hurt to have about 10 shield users.

13
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,084
Shield users, huh?

14
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:52,729
What? What's wrong?

15
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:53,775
You are.

16
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,708
You're hiding something, aren't you?

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,574
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,329
I just realized something.

19
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:03,811
The biggest advantage of using a
one-handed sword is you can also use a shield.

20
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,783
But you know what? I don't
think I've ever seen you using one.

21
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,769
I don't use a shield because it'll slow down my rapier.

22
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,496
Others don't because they think it looks dumb.

23
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,914
And how come you're not using
the sword you commissioned from Liz?

24
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,361
Very suspicious.

25
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:24,032
Mm-hmm.

26
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:27,892
Hmm.

27
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:30,832
Oh, never mind!

28
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:34,432
It's rude to ask people to justify their skills.

29
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:39,223
Since it's gotten so late, might as well have lunch here.

30
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,294
Really?

31
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,591
D-Did you make it yourself?

32
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:43,424
Yep.

33
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,158
But you better take your gloves off before you eat.

34
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:47,532
Oh. Sure!

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,064
Here you go!

36
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,711
This is good!

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,272
How'd you get it to taste so amazing?

38
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,306
Chalk it up to a whole year of training and study.

39
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:07,659
Aincrad has everything you need.

40
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,771
There's about a hundred different seasonings.

41
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:14,753
I made everything just by calculating all the
parameters used by the flavor-recreation engine.

42
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:18,487
This was made with grogua seed,
shugra leaf, and calim water.

43
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,427
It's mayonnaise.

44
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:25,564
And I made this, using abilba
seed, sag leaves, and ulafish bone.

45
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,153
Whoa!

46
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:30,498
That tastes exactly like...

47
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,166
Soy sauce!

48
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:38,413
You're right. I made the sauce
for the sandwich out of that.

49
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,389
Amazing!

50
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,469
It's perfect!

51
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,170
Have you thought about selling
this, cause you'd make a fortune!

52
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:45,061
You think it's that good?

53
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:46,538
Wait.

54
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:47,746
You can't sell it.

55
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,082
But why not?

56
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,855
Cause there wouldn't be any left for me.

57
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,368
My god. You're so greedy.

58
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:02,332
If you like it that much, I could always make more.

59
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,070
Hey, Kirito!

60
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,603
How you doing, buddy?!

61
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,280
Hey, Klein.

62
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,504
Still alive, huh?

63
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,266
Geez!

64
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,823
You're the same as ever.

65
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,041
Wait. Whoa!

66
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:31,331
You're a solo player. What the
heck are you doing with a... girl?

67
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,275
Um, I could have sworn you guys
met before at one of the boss fights.

68
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,211
I'll introduce you.

69
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,113
This is Klein, of the fuurin kazan guild.

70
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,375
And this is Asuna, of the knights of the blood oath.

71
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,649
Hey. Come on. Say something.

72
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,894
What's wrong? You lagging?

73
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:57,586
Hi! I'm k-Klein. I'm 24 and single and looking for a...

74
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:02,945
boss!

75
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,807
Whoa! Are you really that Asuna!

76
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,923
Don't worry. It's cool.

77
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:19,185
These guys are okay.

78
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:22,125
Yeah, but I don't know about Klein.

79
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:24,552
What the hell?

80
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:26,693
That's payback, you weasel.

81
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,097
Come on, Klein!

82
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,278
What are you doing with a girl, holding out on me?

83
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:36,076
What's the deal, man? Spill it.

84
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,817
Uh, well...

85
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:38,986
Excuse me?

86
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:42,250
Kirito and I are together
because we're sort of in a party.

87
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:43,862
Huh?!

88
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,403
Kirito, you son of a...

89
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:45,810
wait!

90
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,385
It's not what you think!

91
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:50,347
Kirito.

92
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,542
What the hell?

93
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,101
It's an army.

94
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,403
It's the big guild that runs floor one.

95
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,429
What are they doing up here?

96
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,067
They were almost slaughtered on floor 25.

97
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:07,244
Instead of clearing levels, they've
been trying to build up their numbers.

98
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,643
I haven't seen them on the front lines in awhile.

99
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:14,899
At ease!

100
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:23,870
I'm with the aincrad liberation army.

101
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,721
Lieutenant Colonel Corvatz.

102
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,783
I'm Kirito. Solo.

103
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:29,140
Sure you are.

104
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,516
Have you cleared the area up ahead?

105
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:32,404
Yeah.

106
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,369
We also got a map with directions to the boss room.

107
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:37,585
Hmm. Right.

108
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:40,358
Then hand over that map and we'll be on our way.

109
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:43,496
You want us to just give it to you?!

110
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:46,864
Do you even know how much of
a pain in the ass mapping is?!

111
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:51,321
We share our information and resources
with civilian players all the time!

112
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,396
And we don't charge a thing for it.

113
00:07:53,745 --> 00:08:00,283
We maintain order in the chaos of battle so that all
players can leave this world as quickly as possible!

114
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:05,347
Therefore, it's your duty to
cooperate with us, so hand over that map!

115
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,667
Listen, you!

116
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:08,860
You bastard.

117
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:09,397
Easy.

118
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,233
When we got back to town, I was
gonna go public with the map, anyway.

119
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:14,361
It's cool.

120
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:15,530
Oh, now, wait!

121
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,779
Come on, man. You're being way too nice to him.

122
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,665
I don't care about making money off map data.

123
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,718
Hmm. Thanks for cooperating.

124
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:32,508
By the way, if you're planning to
hit the boss, I wouldn't recommend it.

125
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,962
That is mydecision to make.

126
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,031
Hey, I just took a look inside that room, pal.

127
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,628
And you can't beat that boss if your troops are half-dead!

128
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,146
Look at them! They're exhausted!

129
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,182
Nonsense! My men are tougher than that!

130
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,098
They won't quit until I say so!

131
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,021
On your feet! Come on, move!

132
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:01,435
Oh, man.

133
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:03,722
Are those guys gonna be okay?

134
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,877
I'm sure they know what they're doing.

135
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:09,213
They won't rush the boss without
checking it out first, right?

136
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,510
Maybe we shouldkeep an eye on them, anyway.

137
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:20,757
I don't know who's nicer... you or me.

138
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,751
So... anyway... Asuna.

139
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,429
I got a favor to ask.

140
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:37,642
He can be hard to talk to, and
he's a loner and addicted to combat.

141
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,031
But he's a good guy.

142
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:40,705
Take care of him, will you?

143
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:46,801
Okay.

144
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,321
I promise. He's in good hands.

145
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:01,726
That's the last one.

146
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:03,448
Only thing left's the boss's room.

147
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:07,413
Maybe those guys used some kind
of teleportation thingy to go back.

148
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:12,989
Asuna!

149
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:13,687
Mm-hmm.

150
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,021
Hey!

151
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,267
Idiots!

152
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,733
Hey! You guys okay?!

153
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,169
Don't just stand there!

154
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,908
Use your teleport crystals!

155
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,844
We can't!

156
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,038
Th-the crystals aren't working!

157
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:50,210
I've never heard of a trap like
this being in a boss room before.

158
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,860
The aincrad liberation army
doesn't know the word "retreat"!

159
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:59,379
Come on! Keep fighting!

160
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,657
They're insane.

161
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:02,939
Hey, the hell's going on.

162
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,956
They can't use their teleportation crystals.

163
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:09,101
We could distract the boss,
but going in there's too risky.

164
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,096
But isn't there somethingwe can do?

165
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,652
Ready?!

166
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,328
Cha-a-a-a-rge!

167
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:23,687
Don't do it!

168
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:43,750
Hey!

169
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:45,981
Hang on, Corvatz!

170
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,620
I can't believe it.

171
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,521
No.

172
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:15,545
No. I can't...

173
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,418
No...

174
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,159
NO...

175
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:25,588
Asuna!

176
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,751
Oh, what the hell!

177
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,815
Get out!

178
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,676
I got you, buddy.

179
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:57,517
Thanks.

180
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,045
This'll take forever!

181
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,312
Get out of there!

182
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,154
Kirito!

183
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,750
The only way to end this is if I use it!

184
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:31,244
But then...

185
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,458
Damn it, just use it already!

186
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,833
Hey, Klein! Asuna!

187
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,734
Listen, I need 10 seconds! Keep him off me!

188
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,061
Yeah, you got it.

189
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,737
Aah!

190
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,361
Okay, I'm ready!

191
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:16,358
Switch out!

192
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,115
Okay, here goes.

193
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,378
Starburst Stream!

194
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,906
What the hell kind of skill's that?

195
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:57,128
Faster!

196
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:07,896
Got to go faster!

197
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:22,584
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

198
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,553
Is it... Over?

199
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,134
Kirito!

200
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,929
Wake up, Kirito!

201
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:21,552
Oh, man. My head.

202
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,225
That was too close.

203
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,701
How long was I out for?

204
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,377
Just a few seconds.

205
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,560
You reckless... Idiot!

206
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,024
Geez, don't hug me so hard.

207
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,363
I'll lose the last of my HP.

208
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,106
Corvatz and two of his men are
the only ones who didn't make it.

209
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:55,135
We haven't lost a player in a boss fight since floor 67.

210
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:58,258
That wasn't a boss fight, that was suicide.

211
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,879
Corvatz was a damn fool.

212
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:04,415
There's no point to any of this if you die!

213
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:13,265
You're not off the hook, either.
What the hell did you do just now?

214
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,324
I don't think you want to know.

215
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,941
Oh, come on! I've never seen anything like that before!

216
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,310
It's an extra skill I picked up... dual-wielding.

217
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,403
Dude, are there prerequisites?

218
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:31,121
If I knew that, I'd have shared it by now.

219
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:34,346
It's not on the info broker's skill list.

220
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:36,364
Guess it's exclusive to you.

221
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,190
Hey, you got a unique skill.

222
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:40,740
Way to stay on the down-low, Kirito.

223
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,777
How can you keep an awesome
secret like this from your buddies?

224
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:47,725
About six months ago, I was
scrolling through my skill menu.

225
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:50,123
And it was just... There.

226
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:51,521
"Dual-wielding."

227
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:56,050
But if anyone else found out I had a skill like this...

228
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,451
They'd get pissed, cause you had something they didn't.

229
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,922
Some gamers are like that, but not me.

230
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,234
You're right, though. People would
definitely be jealous you had that.

231
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,784
And that.

232
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:13,641
Well, they say your character's built by life's
challenges, so keep soldiering on, young man.

233
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:17,136
Easier said than done.

234
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,263
We're gonna go trigger the warp gate.

235
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:22,156
You coming?

236
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,041
No, I'll catch up with you later.

237
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:26,979
Need to rest for a bit.

238
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,473
I heard that.

239
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:30,063
Have a safe trip back.

240
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:36,094
Oh, and, by the way.

241
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:41,527
You know how you ran in there to
rescue those army guys like you did?

242
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:43,456
Yeah?

243
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:48,590
Well, you know, glad you did.

244
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,736
Anyway. I'll see you.

245
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,595
What's wrong, Asuna?

246
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:03,001
I was so scared.

247
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,927
If you died, I didn't know what I'd do.

248
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:09,105
What are you talking about?

249
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:11,630
Hey, you're the one who jumped in first, remember?

250
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:16,818
I'm taking a leave of absence from the guild.

251
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:17,641
Why?

252
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,368
And do what, sleep in all day?

253
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
Did you forget already?

254
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:23,825
I said I was teaming up with you.

255
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:55,104
Okay.

256
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:11,941
"A blue demon that annihilated a big squad of army guys,

257
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:16,738
and a 50-hit combo from a dual-wielder
who took out the boss by himself."

258
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,521
I can't believe what a big deal
they're making out of this thing.

259
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,519
Yeah, it's blowing up right in my face.

260
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,306
A butt-load of swordsmen and info
brokers showed up at my place this morning.

261
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,794
Now I need a new pad, cause they know where I live.

262
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:34,210
Yeah, well, that's sort of, kind of your own fault.

263
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:38,420
You said it was gonna be our little secret,
but you went and blabbed it to everyone.

264
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,511
What are we gonna do, Kirito?

265
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,975
We've got ourselves a huge problem!

266
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:57,997
Outside of boss fights, I don't
believe we've ever actually met, Kirito.

267
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,278
Well, there was that conference on floor 67.

268
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,077
We talked a little bit there,

269
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:05,982
Commander Heathcliff.

270
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:09,015
Yes, that wasa difficult battle, wasn't it?

271
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,899
We almost lost a few players there, too.

272
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,992
We may be the top guild, but we barely
get by with the amount of troops we have.

273
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:21,194
And now here you are, trying
to poach one of our best players.

274
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:22,921
I don't know what to say.

275
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:28,393
If she's that important, maybe you should
do a better job picking her bodyguard.

276
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,676
You have my sincerest apologies for any
trouble you might have had with Kuradeel.

277
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:38,531
But you must understand that we simply cannot allow
our second-in-command to leave the guild just like that.

278
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:45,211
If you want her, you'll have to use
your dual blades to take her from us.

279
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:49,341
If you can defeat me in combat,
you'll be free to take Asuna with you.

280
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:51,200
On the other hand, if you lose,

281
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:54,522
you will join the knights of the blood oath.

282
00:21:58,675 --> 00:21:59,621
Yeah, okay.

283
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,498
If you want to settle this with swords, that's fine by me.

284
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,714
We'll have ourselves a duel, then.

285
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:39,095
Next time: "Crimson Killing Intent".
