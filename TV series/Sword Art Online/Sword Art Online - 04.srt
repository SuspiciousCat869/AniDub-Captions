1
00:00:00,817 --> 00:00:02,253
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:06,000
Why should wehave to share
these healing crystals with you?

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,811
Your pet lizards hashealing powers, you know.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,529
But you never fight on the front
lines, so who are you to talk?!

5
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:14,310
You don't need to use any crystals!

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,730
Of course I do.

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,535
You're the popular one around here, Silica.

8
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:21,537
I can't expect the boys to help me when I need it.

9
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,388
Oh, come on.

10
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,453
It's not like that.

11
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:25,946
Fine. I don't care.

12
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:27,726
You want my items, take 'em,

13
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,848
but I'm never going to team up with you again.

14
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:33,844
I know there's a ton of other parties out
there who'd love to have me on their side.

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,722
Wait! Don't go! Silica!

16
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,559
I'm out of healing crystals!

17
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:54,355
Pina!

18
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,484
Pina! Pina!

19
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:58,533
Pina.

20
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:01,480
Pina.

21
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,947
Pina.

22
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,219
Pina.

23
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:08,410
Pina.

24
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:09,545
Pina!

25
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:42,749
Pina.

26
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,904
Don't leave me all alone here.

27
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:49,464
Pina!

28
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:54,558
What's that feather?

29
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,206
It's Pina, my best... friend.

30
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,693
You're one of those beast tamers, aren't you?

31
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:05,703
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:09,104
If I got here sooner, I could have saved your friend.

33
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,900
No. It's all my fault.

34
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,092
I was stupid to think I could
make it through the forest on my own.

35
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,454
Thank you for saving me.

36
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,138
You did what you could.

37
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,392
That feather...

38
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,523
Check and see if it has an item name attached to it.

39
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:26,571
Huh?

40
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:35,502
Hey, don't cry.

41
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:37,679
That mean's Pina's heart's still here.

42
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,228
There's a chance you can revive.

43
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,080
No way. Really?

44
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:42,755
Mm-hmm.

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,997
On the south side of floor 47,

46
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,961
there's a field dungeon called the hill of memories.

47
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:52,567
I heard somewhere that the flower
growing at the top can revive familiars.

48
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:57,552
Floor 47, huh?

49
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,450
I'd offer to go get it for you.

50
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,484
All you'd have to do is pay for the trip.

51
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:06,749
The thing is, the flower won't bloom
unless the familiar's master's there.

52
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,711
Thank you so much for telling me about it.

53
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,635
If I work hard to raise my level, then someday I could...

54
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,304
Sure, but the time limit's three days to revive it.

55
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:17,769
No way.

56
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,637
It's all my fault.

57
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,282
I'm so sorry, Pina.

58
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:25,076
It's okay.

59
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,571
You have three days.

60
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:29,845
Take this equipment.

61
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,145
It should boost you 5 or 6 levels, and if I
tag along, I'm sure everything will work out.

62
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,316
But... why would you do all this for me?

63
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,958
I'll tell you, but only if you promise not to laugh, okay?

64
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:48,951
I promise I won't.

65
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:52,535
All right.

66
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,165
It's because you look like my little sister.

67
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:04,571
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:10,412
Um... i know this isn't enough col to pay you back, but...

69
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,349
no, it's cool.

70
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,741
Besides, it works with why I'm here.

71
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,440
We'll be helping each other out.

72
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,396
Huh? Okay, then.

73
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:18,516
My name's Silica.

74
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,837
My name's Kirito.

75
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,511
I guess we'll be working together for a little while.

76
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,029
Hey, look! It's Silica!

77
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:32,538
Huh?

78
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,975
It took you a long time to get back.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,066
We were getting worried.

80
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:36,717
Um...

81
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,331
You want to team up with us?

82
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,269
We'll take you wherever you want to go!

83
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:43,010
That's really nice of you to offer, but...

84
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:48,555
Well, I've sort of already agreed
to be in a party with him, so...

85
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,838
'Kay, later. Bye.

86
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,969
I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.

87
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:01,132
Didn't know you had fans. You must be popular.

88
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,498
No.

89
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:07,240
They don't take me seriously.
They want me to be their mascot.

90
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,635
Maybe they're right.

91
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:15,273
They call me dragon tamer, and
I guess... it went to my head.

92
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:16,892
Don't worry about it.

93
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:17,426
Huh?

94
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,653
We'll make it in time, promise.

95
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:23,932
Okay!

96
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,887
Do you live around here, Kirito?

97
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,518
I'm on floor 50.

98
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:32,632
It's kind of far, so I was
thinking of getting a room tonight.

99
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,670
If you stay, I'll take you out for some cheesecake!

100
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:36,987
It's really good here!

101
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,950
Well, if it isn't Silica.

102
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:43,383
Wow, you made it out of the forest alive.

103
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,863
Good for you, girl.

104
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:46,649
Something wrong?

105
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,363
Oh, no. Nothing.

106
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:49,270
Hang on.

107
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,209
What happened to your little friend the lizard?

108
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:53,203
Did it run away?

109
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:54,934
Pina died saving me.

110
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,699
But... I'm gonna get Pina back!

111
00:07:57,953 --> 00:07:58,889
Really?

112
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:02,156
I guess you'll be heading for the hill of memories, then.

113
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,217
I wonder if you'll be able to clear it at your level.

114
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,732
Of course she will.

115
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,720
It's not that difficult a level.

116
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:13,414
Oh, god, this girl's seduced anotherplayer.

117
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,521
No, it's not difficult, but you don't look thatstrong.

118
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:17,681
Come on.

119
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:24,078
Why does she have to be so mean?

120
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,498
Well... Is sword art online your first mmo?

121
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,710
Uh-huh.

122
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,453
A lot of people's personalities
change when they play games online,

123
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,053
and some actually like playing the game as the bad guy.

124
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,951
You see how our cursors are green?

125
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:44,543
Well, if you commit a crime against another
player, your cursor's gonna turn orange.

126
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:49,780
Then they become what's called a red
player... the worst, also known as player-killers.

127
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,226
They're all about murder.

128
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,680
They kill other players?!

129
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:57,671
In a normal game, they role-play as the
bad guy, have some laughs, and it's cool.

130
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,115
But... sword art online isn't normal.

131
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:05,818
It's definitely not a game.

132
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:08,306
Kirito?

133
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:11,619
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,529
Well, I think you're good, so...

135
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,759
I mean, you saved me, after all.

136
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,004
Looks like youcheered meup instead.

137
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,221
Thank you, Silica.

138
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,401
Aaah!

139
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,942
Wow, where the heck is our cheesecake already?!

140
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,126
Excuse me!

141
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:35,003
Our dessert hasn't shown up yet!

142
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,592
I wonder if he'd laugh if I told
him I wanted to talk some more.

143
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:47,443
Silica?

144
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,588
You still awake?

145
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:50,526
Kirito?!

146
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:55,348
I forgot to tell you some stuff about
floor 47, but it can wait till tomorrow.

147
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:56,397
No, now's fine!

148
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,686
Actually, I was just thinking I should ask you about...

149
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,254
that was so close!

150
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:09,504
Uh, what's up? Something wrong?

151
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,363
No! Nothing!

152
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,676
What's that thing do, Kirito?

153
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,504
It's a mirage sphere.

154
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:25,984
It's pretty.

155
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:31,091
This is the town area of floor
47, and that's the hill of memories.

156
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,467
I was thinking if we take this route, we can...

157
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:34,086
hmm?

158
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:35,606
What's wro...

159
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:35,963
shh!

160
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,566
Who's there?!

161
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,873
Um... who was it?

162
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:43,403
An eavesdropper.

163
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:44,788
But they can't.

164
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,529
I mean, you can't hear through
a door unless you knock first.

165
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,483
But if your listening skill is high enough, you can.

166
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:51,899
It takes practice.

167
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:53,418
Not thatmany players have it.

168
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:55,507
Why would they want to listen to us?

169
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,861
Wow!

170
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,059
This place is like a dream!

171
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:10,994
I know.

172
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,359
The whole floor is covered in flowers.

173
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,591
That's why they call it the flower garden.

174
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:26,904
Couples!

175
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,947
Silica?

176
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:34,936
What?! Nothing!

177
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:36,509
Sorry to keep you waiting!

178
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,264
What's wrong?

179
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:39,170
Oh, nothing! Nothing at all!

180
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,219
Come on.

181
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,562
Okay.

182
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:47,647
What's that for?

183
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:51,699
If anything bad happens while we're in
here, I'm gonna tell you to warp out, okay?

184
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,583
When I do, use this crystal.

185
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:55,283
You can jump to any town with.

186
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:56,283
But...

187
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:57,617
No "buts." Use it.

188
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,409
I understand.

189
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,450
Let's get going.

190
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,590
If we take this path, it'll lead
us right to the hill of memories.

191
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:18,413
Um, Kirito?

192
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:27,731
Aaaaah!

193
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,685
Calm down!

194
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,367
That thing's not thatstrong!

195
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,586
Help, Kirito! Save me!

196
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:33,142
But don't look!

197
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:34,618
Save me, but don't look!

198
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:35,456
That'll be...

199
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:36,676
Difficult.

200
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:41,307
Darn you! Put me down! Now!

201
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:57,128
You see anything?

202
00:12:58,263 --> 00:12:59,216
Not really.

203
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:06,049
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but what's your sister like?

204
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:07,574
Why do you want to know?

205
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,404
Well, you said I look like her.

206
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:14,264
I know it's not polite to ask about your real life, but...

207
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:15,813
What's she like?

208
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,007
I call her my little sister, but she's really my cousin.

209
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:21,190
Huh?

210
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:26,222
We were raised like brother and sister
since we were babies, so I doubt she even knows.

211
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:30,415
But I know, and I guess that's the reason I avoided her.

212
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,224
Our grandfather's really strict.

213
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:37,307
When I was 8, he made us take
classes at the local kendo dojo,

214
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:40,023
but after a couple years, I stopped going.

215
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,502
Grandpa beat the hell out of me for that.

216
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,060
That's awful.

217
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:45,418
Anyway...

218
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,137
Then my sister stood up for me and told him to stop.

219
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:50,662
She said she'd train hard for both of us.

220
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,020
And she did. She trained hard.

221
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,712
She even made it to the nationals.

222
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,634
She did? How awesome!

223
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:58,651
Yeah.

224
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:01,075
I've always felt guilty for putting her through that.

225
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:05,747
I wouldn't doubt it if she hates god knows
she could have been doing something else.

226
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,639
Maybe that's why I wanted to help you.

227
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,214
In a weird way, it makes me feel like I'm paying her back.

228
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:13,977
There it is.

229
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,452
If you don't mind me saying,

230
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:17,585
you're wrong.

231
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,341
I don't think she hates you at all.

232
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,709
She wouldn't work that hard
for you if she didn't like you,

233
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:23,700
promise!

234
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,610
And I bet she even loves kendo!

235
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,700
There you go again, making mefeel better.

236
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:31,886
Maybe you're right.

237
00:14:32,593 --> 00:14:33,841
Man, I hope so.

238
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,361
Okay, then!

239
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,259
I'm gonna do mybest, too!

240
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,191
Aaaah!

241
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,955
Kirito!

242
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,202
Is that reviving flower around here?

243
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,543
Yeah. Over there.

244
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,387
Go ahead. Pick it up.

245
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,205
You sure it'll bring Pina back to life?

246
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:39,181
Uh-huh.

247
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:40,842
I'm so glad.

248
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,821
There's a bunch of strong monsters lurking around here.

249
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:45,768
Let's revive it when we get back to town.

250
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,104
I'm sure Pina would want it that way.

251
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:49,604
Okay!

252
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,535
Is something wrong?

253
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,165
Whoever's hiding out there, come out... now!

254
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:05,845
Rosalia?

255
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:11,509
If you saw through my hiding skill so easy,
your detection skill must be really high, swordsman.

256
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,050
Ooh!

257
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,355
It looks like you were successful
getting your hands on the pneuma flower!

258
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,279
Congratulations.

259
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,403
Now, hand it over before you get hurt.

260
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,184
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,947
No one's handing anything over, Rosalia...

262
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:30,490
Not to you or the orange guild,
or should I say titan's hand.

263
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,982
You're their leader, right?

264
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:33,650
Nice.

265
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:35,676
But Rosalia's cursor is green.

266
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,137
It's an easy trick.

267
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:43,534
The green members find their victims, then they
lure them straight to the orange players for the ambush.

268
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:47,275
That was one of your pals last night eavesdropping on us,

269
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,031
wasn't it?

270
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:52,156
Then the reason you were in that
party with me and the others was to...

271
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,323
How perceptive.

272
00:16:54,507 --> 00:16:58,955
I was observing their strength and
watching them earn all that beautiful money.

273
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:05,265
You were who I was excited about, and
I was so sad when you left the party,

274
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,036
but then you told me you were getting a rare item.

275
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:12,144
What I want to know is if you knew
about us, why did you bring her here?

276
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,679
Are you dumb, or does she have
you wrapped around her finger?

277
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:17,300
Nope.

278
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:18,842
You're wrong both times.

279
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:22,134
See, I've been looking all over for you, Rosalia.

280
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,350
What areyou talking about?

281
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:25,891
Remember 10 days ago?

282
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,236
You attacked a guild called the silver flags?

283
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,943
The leader survived, four didn't.

284
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,620
Oh, the losers with no money.

285
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:38,530
Their leader went back and forth from the
warp point to the front lines, morning till night,

286
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:43,011
and with tears in his eyes, he begged
everyone he met to avenge his dead friends.

287
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,158
But he didn't want you killed.

288
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:47,962
No, he wanted you to go to prison.

289
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:51,179
Do you have any idea how he felt?

290
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,919
Can't say I do.

291
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,376
Only idiots take this seriously.

292
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,368
So what if we kill someone here?

293
00:17:57,646 --> 00:18:00,307
There's no proof dying here means you're dead I.R.L.

294
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,192
Anyway, it's time you started worrying about yourselves.

295
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,904
Kirito, there's too many of them.

296
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,142
We should get out of here.

297
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,556
No, it's okay.

298
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,301
You'll be safe if you stay here.

299
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,298
Keep the crystal handy till I say so.

300
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:24,244
Okay, but...

301
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:26,812
Kirito!

302
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:28,494
Kirito?!

303
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,459
Dressed in black, one-handed, no shield.

304
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:33,707
Holy crap!

305
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,344
It's the black swordsman!

306
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:37,762
Rosalia, that guy...

307
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,221
He's the beater who plays solo on the front lines!

308
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,661
He's with the assault team!

309
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:43,146
No way! He is?!

310
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:46,807
Why would someone from the assault
team be all the way down here?

311
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,445
Go on! Take him out!

312
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,331
And take everything he owns!

313
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:51,456
Die!

314
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,554
I've got to save him.

315
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,617
He won't last!

316
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:08,805
What's going on?

317
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,762
What the hell, you idiots?

318
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,452
Kill him already!

319
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,934
400 in 10 seconds, give or take...

320
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:27,098
That's about the total damage
the seven of you can inflict on me.

321
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,631
I'm level 78.

322
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:32,650
I got 14,500 h.P.

323
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:37,711
My battle-healing skill auto-regenerates
600 points every 10 seconds.

324
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:41,381
We could stand here all day,
and you wouldn't get anywhere.

325
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,226
That's not possible!

326
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:44,305
Want to bet?

327
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,134
If your numbers are high enough, you're invincible.

328
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,882
Mmos that use leveling systems are unfair that way.

329
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:57,293
My client spent his entire fortune on this
warp crystal, and he'll get his money's worth.

330
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:00,026
It's been set to the coordinates of the prison.

331
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,253
And I'm sending all of you bastards there!

332
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,336
Well, I'm green, and if you hurt me, you'll go orange...

333
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,940
I'm a solo player, got it?

334
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:19,681
I don't care if I have to play
as orange for a couple of days.

335
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,993
I'm really sorry, Silica.

336
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,061
This whole time, I was using you as bait to catch 'em.

337
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:34,351
I thought you'd be scared if
I told you the truth about me.

338
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,676
I could never be scared of
you 'cause you're a good person.

339
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:45,403
Um... do you really have to go?

340
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:46,480
Yeah.

341
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:49,438
I've been away from the front lines for five days.

342
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:50,908
I need to get back.

343
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,620
I... I think it's cool you're with the assault team!

344
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:58,638
I could try for 100 years and never make it.

345
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,351
Um... I...

346
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,512
You know, levels are just numbers.

347
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:09,174
And a person's strength in this world is just an illusion.

348
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,892
Sure, it's cool and all, but there
are more important things than that.

349
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,679
We should meet up in the real world.

350
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:20,486
That would be cool 'cause I like having you as a friend.

351
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,904
Okay. We will. I promise!

352
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:28,612
Well, ready to revive Pina?

353
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:29,629
Yeah!

354
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:47,991
Pina, when you get back, I'll have
lots of stuff to tell you about...

355
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:52,917
About the amazing adventure I had...

356
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:03,783
... and about this one day when I
got to have my very own big brother.

357
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,880
Next time: "Murder in the Safe Zone".
