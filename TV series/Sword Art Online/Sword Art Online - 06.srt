1
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:10,605
Yoruko!

2
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,252
Keep an eye on him!

3
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:26,320
No! Wait!

4
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:37,545
Damn!

5
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:44,665
Where the hell does he think he's going?!

6
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,650
You idiot!

7
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,904
What's your problem?

8
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:36,800
Uh...

9
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,638
Well, what happened?

10
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,054
I lost him.

11
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,777
He teleported off somewhere.

12
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:49,064
The system's supposed to protect players inside the inns.

13
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:52,012
I thought, if anywhere, she'd be safe in here.

14
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,173
Damn it!

15
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,631
That robe was Griselda's.

16
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,371
That was Griselda's ghost!

17
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:04,715
She's come back to get revenge on us!

18
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:09,823
Think about it... only a ghost
can PK someone in a safe zone.

19
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,716
That wasn't a ghost.

20
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,076
Someone's using the system to kill.

21
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:20,365
That's the only way these murders
could have happened in a safe zone.

22
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:21,858
I know it!

23
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,447
I don't know what to think.

24
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,156
Was that black-robed figure Griselda's ghost?

25
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:37,137
After seeing two people die mysteriously,
I'm starting to think it's possible.

26
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:38,131
No.

27
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,450
That definitely wasn't a ghost.

28
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:41,110
Hmm.

29
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:45,384
I'd bet my life on why would a
ghost need a teleport crystal?

30
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,354
Teleport crystal.

31
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:48,420
What is it?

32
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:52,051
Nah. It's nothing.

33
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:54,672
Hmm.

34
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:02,494
Here.

35
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:02,851
Oh.

36
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,398
What? Is that for me?

37
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,379
Well, what do you think I'm doing... showing it off?

38
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,127
Are you gonna take it, or what?

39
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,741
Uh, okay. Thanks.

40
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:12,508
Thank you.

41
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,364
Better eat it fast before it disappears.

42
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,700
Its durability is almost down to zero.

43
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,622
Oh, uh, right.

44
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:27,223
It's delicious.

45
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,950
When in the heck you find time to pick this up?

46
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:36,899
I had a feeling we wouldn't have time for
lunch today, so this morning, I packed one for us.

47
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,232
Hurry up and eat it, okay?

48
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:43,541
Got to hand it to you... for a second-in-command
of the knights of the blood oath, you rock.

49
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,220
Where'd you buy these, anyway?

50
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,261
I didn't.

51
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,435
Huh?

52
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,240
I made it.

53
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,084
Yes, I can cook. So what?

54
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,957
Oh.

55
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:55,896
Wow.

56
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,042
I-I don't even know what to say.

57
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:01,965
I mean, if you're looking for a second
career, you'd make a killing selling these.

58
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:10,827
Should have been eating instead of talking.

59
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:16,982
Are you crying?

60
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:17,585
Shh!

61
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,157
Mm.

62
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,928
No way!

63
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,264
That's right!

64
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:23,431
That's it!

65
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,125
What's it?

66
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,778
What did you just figure out?

67
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:27,873
I...

68
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:31,655
No, wait... Wenever saw a thing.

69
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,968
We just thought we did, but we were seeing something else.

70
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:35,437
Huh?

71
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:37,168
I was right.

72
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,648
The game doesn'tallow killing inside a safe zone.

73
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:43,062
There is no weapon or system exploit!

74
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:48,719
Griselda.

75
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,383
The only way I can be saved now is if you forgive me.

76
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:59,207
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Please forgive me, Griselda!

77
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,666
I swear I never thought this was going to happen!

78
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,040
You have to believe me!

79
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:09,324
Oh, really?

80
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,581
Oh, really?

81
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:15,656
Oh, really?

82
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,941
What did you do to me?

83
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,674
Tell me, Schmidt.

84
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,929
Tell me what you did.

85
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,334
Tell me now.

86
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,211
Okay! Okay!

87
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:47,341
The day we voted to sell the ring,

88
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:51,908
I-I-I looked at my belt pouch, and there
was a crystal and a note with instructions.

89
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,404
Who were they from?

90
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,844
Who gave you them?

91
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:00,801
Grimlock?

92
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,018
You're dead, too?

93
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,120
Tell me.

94
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,349
I want to know who gave you those instructions.

95
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:09,420
I don't know!

96
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,722
I swear I don't know!

97
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:14,341
The note said for me to bind
the crystal to Griselda's room

98
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:17,468
at the inn she was staying at
so whoever it was could get in.

99
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,775
Then I had to put the crystal
in the guild's shared storage.

100
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:22,100
Then what?

101
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,594
That's all I did! I swear!

102
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:26,987
I didn't want her to die.

103
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,616
I didn't want to be part of that!

104
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,942
Please, believe me!

105
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:40,873
We recorded everything you said, Schmidt.

106
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,476
Wait. They're alive?!

107
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,589
Yep, they're alive...

108
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,202
Both Kains and Yoruko.

109
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,727
B-But...

110
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:04,669
Inside safe zones, a player's HP doesn't deplete
on its own, but the durability of an object does...

111
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,942
Just like that sandwich you gave me.

112
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,365
What?

113
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,945
That day, the spear was sticking out of kain's armor.

114
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,132
It wasn't draining his HP though.

115
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:17,008
It was draining the durability of his armor.

116
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:20,496
But then h-his body didn't disintegrate. It was...

117
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,116
Yep, just his armor... nothing else.

118
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:27,512
And at the precise second when his
armor's durability expired... poof...

119
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,578
Kains used a crystal to teleport out of his armor.

120
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:35,649
Sure, it looks a lot like what
happens when a player dies in the game...

121
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,704
Only he didn't die.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,572
T-Then what happened to Yoruko?

123
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:44,392
I bet the dagger was rigged to her back the whole time.

124
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,315
She had it all planned out.

125
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,698
But we would have seen.

126
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,247
Only if she turned around, though.

127
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,585
Remember, she never turned her back to us, not even once.

128
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,637
She kept an eye on her equipment's
durability level while she was talking.

129
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:04,363
When it got down to zero, all she had to do was act like
she was hit by a dagger thrown from outside the window.

130
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,892
Who was the person in the black robe you chased?

131
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,228
It wasn't Grimlock. I'm pretty sure of that.

132
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:14,137
But Kains... he and Yoruko were in it together.

133
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,878
They figured out how they could use
this method to fake their own deaths.

134
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:22,091
Getting people to think they were murdered
in a safe zone was a calculated twist.

135
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:26,714
Everything they did was designed to draw
out the person behind Griselda's murder

136
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,349
and expose him.

137
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:33,587
The only way to find out for sure was by faking
their deaths and creating an illusionary avenger.

138
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:37,638
And Schmidt was the person they had
pegged for it, probably since the beginning.

139
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:39,047
Hey.

140
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:42,039
You still have Yoruko on your friend list, don't you?

141
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:42,428
Oh.

142
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,601
Right now she's in the field on floor 19.

143
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:52,265
It looks like she's on a small hill just outside of town.

144
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,289
I see.

145
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:54,140
Mm.

146
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:55,695
That's it then.

147
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,746
I guess they can handle it from here.

148
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:00,179
I mean, our job's pretty much done now.

149
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,338
Wouldn't you say?

150
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:02,990
Mm-hmm.

151
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:10,728
You were... Recording?

152
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:17,420
So... that's how it is, huh?

153
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,407
You cared about what happened to Griselda after all.

154
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,044
Of course we did.

155
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:24,609
But you didn't betray her because you hated her, did you?

156
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:25,585
N-No!

157
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,474
I didn't hate her, honest.

158
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:31,435
I mean, sure, I feel guilty
getting money from my part of it,

159
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:35,358
but the rare weapon I bought helped me
get into the holy dragon alliance, so...

160
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:46,853
Paralysis?

161
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:52,050
One down!

162
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:56,802
No... way!

163
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:05,144
That's a hell of a catch... a big
shot from the holy dragon alliance.

164
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:14,886
The laughing coffin... the murder guild.

165
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:21,771
All right.

166
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:24,204
What game should we play with these three?

167
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,059
Oh, I know! I know!

168
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:29,870
Let's play the one where they have to
kill each other... last one standing wins!

169
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:33,826
I know it's your favorite, but last time
we did that, you killed the winner anyway.

170
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:34,963
Oh, come on!

171
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,284
You spoiled it! It's no fun
if they know they're gonna die!

172
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,312
All right.

173
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,961
Let's get this show on the road.

174
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:57,382
Huh?!

175
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,942
Damn.

176
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,662
Looks like I made it just in time.

177
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,921
So, now what?

178
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,785
I got 30 players from the assault team coming.

179
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,888
You guys want to stay and fight them?

180
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:44,354
Come on.

181
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,352
Nice to see you alive again...

182
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,548
Yoruko.

183
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:07,609
You won't believe me, but after it was
over, I was going to tell you the truth.

184
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:10,795
I am sorry we had to trick you to help us out.

185
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:11,380
Hmm.

186
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:12,638
Kirito.

187
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:12,892
Mm.

188
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,228
Thank you for saving me, but... how did you figure it out?

189
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,716
How did you know those three would attack us here?

190
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:21,615
I didn't figure anything out.

191
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,464
I was acting on a hunch is all.

192
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:27,408
Hey, Yoruko, Kains, level with me...

193
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,911
You guys asked Grimlock to make
the spear and the knife, didn't you?

194
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:35,803
We did, but he was against our plan from the beginning.

195
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:39,672
All he wanted was to let Griselda rest in peace.

196
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:44,336
He did forge the weapons for us, but only
after we got down on our knees and begged him.

197
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:48,157
Sorry, but he had a different
reason for not liking your plan.

198
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:49,953
Griselda had nothing to do with it.

199
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:55,148
He was worried faking PKs in a safe
zone was gonna draw a lot of attention.

200
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,907
He didn't want to take the risk of
someone snooping around for answers.

201
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,498
We figured the whole thing out about half an hour ago.

202
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:09,323
We ended up playing right into Yoruko's hands, didn't we?

203
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,460
You know what?

204
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:11,706
I don't really mind.

205
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,002
Yeah, me neither.

206
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:15,285
Hey.

207
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:15,800
Mm.

208
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:21,885
If you were in their guild and a super-rare
item like that dropped, what would you have done?

209
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:23,767
Oh, I don't know.

210
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,097
I play solo. Part of why I do is
so I can avoid situations like that.

211
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:30,758
In my guild, the one who got the kill gets it.

212
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:31,322
Oh.

213
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,199
Those are the rules we have to play by.

214
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:39,330
You know how in SAO if a player gets a drop,
no one knows unless that person reports it?

215
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:43,693
Our way, no one can hoard stuff, because
we worked out who gets what ahead of time.

216
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:49,270
Also, the rules my guild play by gives the
concept of marriage in this world real meeting.

217
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:53,807
Think about it... if you marry,
you have to share your item storage.

218
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:59,598
If you're single, you can hide whatever you want, but,
you know, when you're married, you can't hide it anymore.

219
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,049
I think sharing storage with the person
you're married to is wonderfully pragmatic.

220
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:08,400
At the same time, I think it's also very romantic.

221
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:11,738
Hey.

222
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:12,732
Yeah? What?

223
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:17,356
So, uh, how many times you been married, anyway?

224
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:21,369
Wait! I didn't mean it!

225
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:22,513
That didn't come out right!

226
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:25,360
You were talking about how
it's romantic and plastic and...

227
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,177
I did not say that, you ass!

228
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:27,685
Aah!

229
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:30,682
What I said is, "it's romantic and pragmatic."

230
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,129
For your information, the word
"pragmatic" means "practical"!

231
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:34,914
My god!

232
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:38,197
You think marriage in SAO is... Practical?

233
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,070
Of course.

234
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:42,764
If you're married, everything's out in
the open, you know, 'cause of common storage.

235
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,139
What?

236
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,740
That's it... common storage.

237
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:50,886
Okay, say your spouse dies...

238
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,633
What happens to the items?

239
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,255
Huh?

240
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:55,643
Item storage is shared, right?

241
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:59,504
So when one person dies, what happens to their stuff?

242
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,658
If you're talking about Griselda and Grimlock...

243
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:03,434
Hmm.

244
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,250
If one of them died...

245
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:08,077
Everything would go to the surviving spouse, right?

246
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:13,076
And if everything goes to the spouse,
then the ring in Griselda's storage...

247
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:16,268
Should be sitting in Grimlock's storage, notthe killer's.

248
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,088
It's been sitting there this whole time.

249
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,774
It was never stolen in the first place.

250
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,648
No, it wasstolen.

251
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:24,522
It doesn't matter it's still there.

252
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:28,415
Grimlock was basically stealing it
the minute he put his plan into action.

253
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:34,516
It was Grimlock?

254
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,440
Then those were his instructions.

255
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,744
Then he killed Griselda, too!

256
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,898
No, I doubt he was the one who actually killed her.

257
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,592
Although, I'm pretty sure he went and
found himself a red player to do it for him.

258
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:50,015
My god!

259
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:55,920
But then if he really did have her killed, why
would he go to all that trouble just to help us out?!

260
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:59,923
You explained your plan to him in detail, didn't you?

261
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:06,369
Your plan was the perfect chance for him to bury
the ring incident and any witnesses, once and for all.

262
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:12,026
All he'd have to do is sit back and wait
for you, Schmidt, and Kains to get together.

263
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,067
You'd be sitting ducks.

264
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:17,436
That's it. That's why.

265
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,208
They knew we'd be here because he hired them.

266
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:21,550
Yeah.

267
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:25,706
My guess is it was probably the
same bunch he hired to kill Griselda.

268
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,162
Oh, my god.

269
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:31,702
Found him.

270
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,588
If you want to know more, you can ask the man yourself.

271
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,495
Hello.

272
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,768
Long time, no see, comrades.

273
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,929
I can't believe it.

274
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:52,672
Did you... did you really plan this?

275
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,874
How could you, Grimlock?!

276
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:56,859
Answer me!

277
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:58,546
Why did you kill Griselda?!

278
00:17:58,616 --> 00:17:59,609
Was it the money?!

279
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:02,801
Was the money so important to you
that you'd kill your own wife for it?!

280
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:03,636
Hmm.

281
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,059
Money?

282
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:08,314
Did you say money?

283
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,592
It wasn't for the money.

284
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,070
I had to.

285
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:20,558
No matter what, I had to kill her
while we were stuck in this world.

286
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,585
I had to kill her while she was still my wife...

287
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:27,709
And because she was also my wife in the real world.

288
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:34,756
In a way, she was the perfect wife,
ideal... so pretty, so submissive.

289
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:38,164
The whole time we were together,
we never had a single fight.

290
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:44,122
But when we were trapped in
here... in this world... she changed.

291
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,312
In here, I was the one who was afraid,
terrified of playing this death game.

292
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:56,549
But she looked so much happier here, more
alive than she ever did in the real world.

293
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:01,530
There was nothing I could do about it... she changed.

294
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,389
The yuuko I loved was gone.

295
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,012
Gone!

296
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,716
But then I realized I didn't
haveto live with the way she was.

297
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,566
Murder is part of this game!

298
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:16,888
If I couldn't have the yuuko I loved back, I'd
settle for the memory of her, and who could blame me?!

299
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:19,605
That'swhy did it?

300
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:21,744
That'sthe reason you killed your wife?

301
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,245
It's reason enough.

302
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,319
And, someday, you'll understand, too.

303
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,206
Once you've found love, believe
me, you'll do anything to keep it.

304
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:31,951
Mm.

305
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,709
You're wrong, Grimlock.

306
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,679
You've got it all wrong.

307
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,928
You didn't love Griselda.

308
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:40,524
That's not what you felt.

309
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,988
You stopped loving her when
you became selfish and possessive!

310
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:52,459
Uh...

311
00:19:56,626 --> 00:20:01,618
Kirito, we appreciate your help, but I
think this is our problem to deal with now.

312
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:02,570
Okay.

313
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,692
Hey.

314
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:22,532
Hmm.

315
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,872
Say it was you and you married someone and later on,

316
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,232
you found out she had a side to her you didn't know about.

317
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:32,081
How would you feel?

318
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,435
I guess that I was lucky?

319
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:36,856
Mm.

320
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:43,586
Uh, because, I mean, if you marry someone, that means
you already like whatever you know about them, doesn't it?

321
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:47,895
And if you discovered something you didn't know
about them before and fell in love with that, too, then.

322
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,659
Uh, that would be awesome?

323
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,687
Right. Good answer.

324
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,006
Anyway, I'm hungry after all this.

325
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,468
I didn't really get to finish my dinner.

326
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,805
Oh. Yeah, you didn't.

327
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:02,203
We should get back to work tomorrow.

328
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,475
We've been off the front lines for two days.

329
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,166
Yeah.

330
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:08,544
I was hoping to have this floor
totally cleared by the end of this week.

331
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:11,856
Now what?

332
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:13,850
Mm?

333
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,942
Hey, Kirito, do you want to "friend" me?

334
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:51,064
It's kind of silly not to.

335
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:52,494
It's convenient.

336
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,810
We arein the same assault team, after all.

337
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:56,935
But I'm a solo player.

338
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:59,835
Hey, I didn't say you had to form a party with me.

339
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,963
You should try to make some friends while you're here.

340
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,182
Yeah, I don't know. It's not that I don't want...

341
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:04,741
Hey!

342
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:07,471
Think about it while we eat... no pressure.

343
00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:10,068
Come on. Let's go back and find a good restaurant.

344
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:11,776
Uh... okay.

345
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,873
Next time: "The Temperature of the Heart".
