1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,753
I understand the situation.

2
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:07,809
Now I just have explain it to the rest of the guild.

3
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:11,440
Also, we'd like a temporary
leave of absence from the guild.

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,646
Really?

5
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:13,845
Why?

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,191
We have concerns with the current state
of the guild, and we need time to think.

7
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:18,953
Hmm.

8
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:20,580
Very well.

9
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:23,352
Although...

10
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,120
I'm positive you won't stay
away from the battlefield for long.

11
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:28,715
Uh...

12
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:42,786
Wow, this view's amazing!

13
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:51,270
It ispretty awesome, but don't fall off the balcony.

14
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:52,700
That would really suck.

15
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,636
We bought the best house.

16
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,455
Andnow we're totally broke.

17
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:06,864
It's worth it, though, 'cause we can live in peace here.

18
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,163
Uh...

19
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:12,481
Kirito?

20
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,069
What's wrong?

21
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:15,571
Well...

22
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:18,185
I was thinking...

23
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:21,363
Does our relationship only exist in this world?

24
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,206
I can't believe you'd say that.

25
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:23,761
Uh...

26
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:26,186
I don't give a damn if this is a virtual world.

27
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,378
My feelings for you are real.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,326
Huh?

29
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:35,142
If I learned anything in the last two years, it's this

30
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,113
to keep doing the best we can till the very end.

31
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:42,776
And if we make it back to the real world,
I promise I'm going to find you again,

32
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:46,453
no matter what, and fall in love with you again.

33
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:38,313
Usually, he's brash and impulsive.

34
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,767
But he can be so naive, too,

35
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:42,872
almost like a little kid.

36
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:48,170
Oh, my god, is he younger than me?!

37
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:54,972
Kirito...

38
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,891
I love you.

39
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:01,616
Let's stay together forever.

40
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:05,411
Huh?

41
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,369
Unh!

42
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:14,261
Good morning, Kirito.

43
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:14,928
Mm.

44
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,160
Morning.

45
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,876
D-Did you...

46
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:19,344
Hear what I said?

47
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:21,347
No, I didn't hear a thing.

48
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:22,666
What'd you say?

49
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,701
Nothing! Not a thing!

50
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:27,490
Anyway, you want to go have some fun today?

51
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,206
Yeah, you know...

52
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,488
Didn't we have fun yesterday and

53
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:35,465
the day before, too?

54
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,624
So you're saying you don'twant to go have fun today.

55
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:43,925
Uh...

56
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,804
Wait, I know a place we can go.

57
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:49,741
Come on!

58
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:56,999
Where are we going?

59
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:59,977
You're just gonna have to wait
till we get there to find out.

60
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:02,104
Hmm.

61
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,902
Hey, carry me on your shoulders.

62
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,761
Uh, seriously?

63
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:10,829
Oh, please! It's no fun seeing the
world from the same height all the time.

64
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:14,174
Besides, with your strength
parameter, you won't break a sweat.

65
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:15,596
Yeah, I mean...

66
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,287
I guess, but...

67
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:22,096
... aren't you a little old for that, though?

68
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,908
It doesn't matter how old I am.

69
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:27,029
Come on, it's not like anyone's gonna see us.

70
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:28,372
Okay.

71
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:29,269
Get on.

72
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:33,060
Uh...

73
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,442
I-If you turn around, I'm gonna slap you.

74
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,803
Are you gonna hop on already, or what?

75
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,927
Giddyup!

76
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:46,272
Whoa!

77
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,700
This is so cool! You can already see the lake from here!

78
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,434
No, youcan see the lake. I...

79
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,232
Okay, if you want, you can ride on my shoulders later.

80
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,251
Let's get a move on, horsey.

81
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,078
We're heading north-northeast!

82
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:05,189
Okay.

83
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,786
It almost flew up my nose!

84
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,638
We got people staring at us now.

85
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,134
Our own audience.

86
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,543
Go on.

87
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,347
Wave back, or he'll think you're rude.

88
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:34,617
Nope, not gonna happen.

89
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,875
Do you want me to get off you now?

90
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:38,612
Mnh-mnh.

91
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,592
You're fine right where you are.

92
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:41,529
Whoa!

93
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:42,854
Aah!

94
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,518
I heard this weird rumor in the village yesterday

95
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:57,683
about how if you go deep enough
into the forest, you'll see...

96
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:58,603
Them.

97
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,384
Huh? See who?

98
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,545
Ghosts.

99
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,350
Y-Y-You mean, like,

100
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,223
those in-game, astral-type monsters, right?

101
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:08,691
No, not those.

102
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,349
Realghosts.

103
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:15,603
They say the tortured souls of the monsters hunted here

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,656
come back to wander the forest at night.

105
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,837
We're almost there.

106
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,155
The place the rumor mentions?

107
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:34,126
About a week ago, a carpenter hiked into
the forest to get some wood for a project.

108
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:38,489
He stayed so long that before he knew it, it was night.

109
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:43,572
As he walked along, he caught a glimpse
of something white standing by a tree.

110
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,296
Aah!

111
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:54,949
Was it a monster or something else?

112
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:59,018
The white figure slowly walked toward some trees, and...

113
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,137
Hey, look!

114
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:01,733
Uh, huh?

115
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:05,076
Aah!

116
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,991
I want to get down! I want to get down!

117
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:08,039
Uh?

118
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:09,630
What's wrong with you?

119
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:20,126
It's... it's over there!

120
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:21,795
What are you talking about?

121
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,064
Uh, you got to be kidding!

122
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:42,292
Hold on.

123
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:44,715
That's not a ghost!

124
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:47,185
Oh, wait, K-Kirito!

125
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,283
Oh, geez!

126
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:57,585
It's another player!

127
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:58,895
Yeah...

128
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:01,271
But there's something really strange about her.

129
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,797
What do you mean?

130
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,498
She doesn't have a cursor.

131
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:09,987
Maybe it's some kind of bug.

132
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:11,941
Yeah, maybe it is.

133
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:16,081
What's a little girl like this doing playing s.A.O.?

134
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:18,099
Uh...

135
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:21,499
I guess we'll find out when she wakes up.

136
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,550
But we can't just leave her out here till she does.

137
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,282
Let's take her home with us.

138
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,102
Yeah, okay.

139
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:36,268
Well, one thing's for sure.

140
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:38,342
She's not an NPC.

141
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,030
We didn't have any trouble moving her here.

142
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:43,085
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:44,626
She can't be that.

144
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,026
If she were, she would've given off a
warning when you picked her up, like other NPCs.

145
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:53,006
You're right, and she's
definitely not a quest giver either.

146
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:57,189
Our quest log would've been updated
as soon as we interacted with her.

147
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:03,965
She has to be a player. She'd probably been
out there for a while, wandering around, lost.

148
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,959
That's the most likely scenario.

149
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,971
Yeah, but what was she doing out there?

150
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,143
Your guess is as good as mine, but she has
to have a parent or guardian out there, right?

151
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:15,795
Mm-hmm.

152
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,044
She had to have logged in with someone from her family.

153
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,959
I just hope they're safe.

154
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,074
Hey, do you think she'll wake up?

155
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:26,632
Yeah.

156
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:31,757
If her body hasn't disappeared, that means signals
are still being transmitted to and from her nervegear.

157
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,482
She's in some kind of sleep mode.

158
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,047
I'm sure she'll wake up soon.

159
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,429
And the sooner, the better.

160
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,464
Yeah.

161
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,180
Hey, Kirito?

162
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,515
I wonder, did she log into S.A.O.
By herself or with her family?

163
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:17,556
Or has she been alone here all this time?

164
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,027
Sleep well.

165
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,504
Please hurry and wake up tomorrow.

166
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:40,375
Uh...

167
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:42,535
Huh?

168
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,716
K-Kirito, wake up!

169
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,292
Good morning.

170
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:52,453
Something wrong?

171
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,249
Hurry! Get over here!

172
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:54,829
Huh?

173
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,650
You woke up!

174
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:01,207
Thank goodness!

175
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,177
Do you remember what happened to you?

176
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:05,680
Mm...

177
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:07,881
Mnh-mnh.

178
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:09,604
Okay.

179
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:11,886
How about your name?

180
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:14,046
My...

181
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,406
My name is...

182
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,693
I think my name is...

183
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:19,949
I think...

184
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,562
Yu-i.

185
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:23,689
Yui.

186
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:25,796
That's it... Yui.

187
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:28,028
That's a cute name.

188
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,473
Nice to meet you.

189
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,898
My name's Asuna.

190
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,066
And this is Kirito.

191
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,377
A-una?

192
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,974
Ki-to?

193
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,428
Try to remember.

194
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,837
What were you doing in the forest?

195
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:44,587
And do you know where your mom and dad are now?

196
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:46,166
Um...

197
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,544
I-I don't know.

198
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,524
I-I can't remember anything.

199
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:54,589
Oh, no.

200
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,840
Well, you're awake.

201
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:02,581
Can I call you "Yui"?

202
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:03,994
Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,089
Okay.

204
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,086
Then I want you to call me "Kirito."

205
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,730
Can you say "Kirito"?

206
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,256
Ki-to.

207
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:12,567
It's Kirito.

208
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,140
Kirito.

209
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:14,918
Mm.

210
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,430
Kito.

211
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,767
That's okay. Maybe it's a little hard.

212
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,651
How about you call me whatever's easier for you.

213
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:24,955
Mm.

214
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:28,519
Daddy.

215
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:29,926
M-Me?

216
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,271
Auna is...

217
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:34,732
Mommy.

218
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:38,276
Mm...

219
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:42,550
Okay.

220
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,759
I'm mommy. That works.

221
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,007
Mommy!

222
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,658
Mommy! Daddy!

223
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,189
You must be hungry!

224
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,476
How about breakfast?

225
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:54,270
Okay!

226
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:57,758
Hmm?

227
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,548
Here you go, Yui.

228
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:02,740
This one's yours.

229
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:11,519
Oh, I don't know, Yui.

230
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:13,043
This one's super spicy.

231
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:14,227
Oh.

232
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,216
I want the same one that daddy has.

233
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:19,676
Okay.

234
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,005
If you think you're ready for it, I won't stop you.

235
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:24,079
You only live once, right?

236
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,502
Uh...

237
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:28,108
Ahh...

238
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:37,714
Mmm.

239
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:40,216
I like it.

240
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,567
Wow, you've got an iron stomach.

241
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:45,946
We can do a full course of
extra-spicy food tonight if you want.

242
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:46,913
Mm-hmm.

243
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,171
Okay, let's not get carried away.

244
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,038
I'm not cooking anything nuclear.

245
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:52,468
You heard the lady.

246
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:53,794
You heard the lady?

247
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:05,769
So...

248
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,261
What do you think?

249
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:09,121
I don't know.

250
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:10,788
She's a blank slate...

251
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,209
no memories.

252
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:13,655
It's really weird.

253
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,166
Yeah, I know.

254
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,952
It's like she's a baby again.

255
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,253
I just...

256
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:19,390
I don't...

257
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,038
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,484
I don't know what to do.

259
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:26,788
I get it.

260
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,116
You want to take care of her...

261
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:31,605
At least until she gets her memory back.

262
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,176
Uh, yeah, but...

263
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,011
But it's a catch-22.

264
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,546
We have to get back and clear the game.

265
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,708
Otherwise, it'll take that much
longer for Yui to be free of it.

266
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:41,827
I know.

267
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,649
For now, we'll do

268
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:45,998
what we can.

269
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:51,140
Judging by the gear she's got in her
storage, she hasn't been out in the field much.

270
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,008
We'll check the town of beginnings.

271
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,740
Maybe there, we can find out if she's got family.

272
00:15:58,136 --> 00:15:58,811
Okay.

273
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:02,055
Look, I don't want to say goodbye to her either.

274
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,262
Huh?

275
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,648
You really don't?

276
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:06,760
I don't know what it is.

277
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,206
I mean, we just met her and all.

278
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,745
But having her here, it's made

279
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,847
our little cabin feel like a real home.

280
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,498
Don't you think so?

281
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,412
Mm-hmm.

282
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:20,122
This doesn't mean we'll never see her again.

283
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:25,851
But look, if she's got a family out there,
they're probably worried about her right now.

284
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:27,676
Okay.

285
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,616
When she wakes up, we'll go to the town of beginnings.

286
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,112
That place is army territory.

287
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,998
It might be a good idea if we go in
fully equipped, ready for anything.

288
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:39,413
Yeah, we better be careful.

289
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,161
Mommy...

290
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,908
Daddy...

291
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,238
It's been forever since I've been back here.

292
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:53,699
Me too.

293
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,135
What do you think?

294
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,550
Huh?

295
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,918
Do any of these buildings look familiar?

296
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,593
Uh...

297
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:08,983
I don't know.

298
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:13,161
Don't get down about the town of
beginnings is a really big place.

299
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:14,658
So, how about it?

300
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,461
Should we start at the central market?

301
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:19,655
Hey, Kirito?

302
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:20,695
Yeah?

303
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:24,701
Do you know how many players
are here right now in the town?

304
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:26,035
Hmm.

305
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,290
Good question.

306
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:31,373
Last I checked, there were 6,000
players still alive in S.A.O.,

307
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:36,054
and about 30% of those people, including
the army, live in the town of beginnings,

308
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,718
so maybe a little less than 2,000?

309
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:41,448
Then doesn't it seem a little dead around here?

310
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,727
You're right.

311
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,516
Leave those children alone!

312
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,160
Look, it's that daycare bitch!

313
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,672
We've been waiting for you!

314
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:52,323
Uh...

315
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,737
Leave them alone, and let them go!

316
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:59,061
You make it sound like we're
doing something illegal, baby cakes.

317
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:03,151
We're just teaching 'em how things work
around here, making sure they pay their way.

318
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:06,012
It's all part of the army's job, ma'am.

319
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:07,467
That's right.

320
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:09,951
Everyone's got to pay taxes around here.

321
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:15,745
Gin, kain, Mina, are you okay?!

322
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:20,581
Help me, Sasha, please!

323
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,811
Save us!

324
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:24,817
They just want your money, so
give it to them, and it'll be okay!

325
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,189
We tried, teach, but they said it's not good enough!

326
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,493
You know, you deadbeats owe us
a hell of a lot in back taxes.

327
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,409
You need to drop all the equipment you got right there,

328
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:37,141
including your armor.

329
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,843
Come on, honey, don't be shy.

330
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:42,506
No way!

331
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,276
Let me through or else!

332
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,990
Stand aside!

333
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:47,195
Huh?

334
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:53,787
Huh?!

335
00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:56,733
You guys are gonna be okay now.

336
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,130
Pick up your stuff.

337
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,733
Uh, okay.

338
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:02,094
What the...

339
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:05,121
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, who the hell are you?!

340
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,427
This is army business, so get the hell out of our way!

341
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:09,462
Hold on.

342
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:09,716
Huh?

343
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,113
I got this.

344
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:13,868
I guess you're all new in town, yeah?

345
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,770
'Cause we're with the liberation
army, and you do not mess with us!

346
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:23,736
Kirito, take care of Yui.

347
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,915
Uh-huh.

348
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:33,359
What?

349
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,457
Agh!

350
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:37,378
Unh!

351
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:42,447
Ohh!

352
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:49,853
Oh, don't worry...

353
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,188
it's a safe zone.

354
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,960
Your HP won't deplete, no matter what I do.

355
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,727
There's just a feeling of getting knocked off your feet.

356
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:02,312
Even so, a fight with me is still
gonna scare the hell out of you.

357
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,703
No! No, don't!

358
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:05,822
Agh!

359
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:06,719
Unh!

360
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:11,157
Don't just stand there, you assholes!

361
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,200
Do something!

362
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:37,722
Uh...

363
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,476
Awesome!

364
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:41,924
That was so awesome!

365
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,307
Oh, I've never seen anything like that before!

366
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,231
Yeah, you were so cool!

367
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:47,048
Yeah, thanks!

368
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:48,599
Thank you for helping us out!

369
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:49,757
Please, please?!

370
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,311
You see that?

371
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,374
You're mom's crazy-strong, isn't she?

372
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:57,616
Huh?

373
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,549
Their hearts...

374
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,164
Everyone's hearts are...

375
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:07,661
Yui?

376
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,651
Uh, what's wrong, Yui?!

377
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:10,454
Huh?

378
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,065
Yui, what's the matter?

379
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,933
Their hearts...

380
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:13,711
Yui!

381
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,946
Yui, did you remember something?

382
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:18,526
I...

383
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:20,314
I-I...

384
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,881
I was never here...

385
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,772
In this place.

386
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:26,948
I was always alone...

387
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,789
In the dark!

388
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,149
No, Yui!

389
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,217
Mommy, I am scared!

390
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:48,582
Mommy!

391
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,154
My god...

392
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:51,626
Mommy!

393
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:52,969
Yui...

394
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,374
What was that?

395
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,563
Next time: "Yui's Heart".
