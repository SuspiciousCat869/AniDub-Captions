1
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,583
Here we are,
Madam Koganei.

2
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
Please,
have a seat.

3
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,125
This diamond just
arrived from South Africa--

4
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,083
you're the first
to see it.

5
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,291
My...

6
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,916
Go ahead.
Pick it up.

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,166
A full ten carats
with stunning clarity--

8
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,833
almost completely
flawless...

9
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,583
a true marvel.

10
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,250
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

11
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,875
I immediately
thought of you.

12
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,375
It is brilliant...

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Any questions?

14
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,583
No...
I'll take it.

15
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,833
Wonderful! Would you like
to discuss a setting?

16
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,083
Madam...! My god,
what are you doing?

17
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,541
"Whore of Diamonds" Who knew
you could be so clumsy...?

18
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,250
You let my daughter be abducted
right in front of your eyes?

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,541
My sincerest apologies...

20
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,666
I have no one to blame
for this but myself.

21
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,708
If you could be the one
to punish me, Miss Tennozu,

22
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,583
I would be most grateful.

23
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,875
That's your plan?

24
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,291
Gambling I won't have the heart
to shoot my plaything?

25
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,250
You'll bring Kagura
back home safely, won't you,

26
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,041
before this
gets out of hand?

27
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,833
And you'll make
sure the man dies?

28
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes ma'am...

29
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,458
You may tend
to your legs

30
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,500
but not until you've
gone between mine.

31
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,041
Dinner is served.

32
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,708
Just don't burn yourself...

33
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,333
S'not much, but they were fresh
out of the twelve-course meals.

34
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,916
It was either
this or cold cuts.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,291
Thought this
would keep you warm.

36
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,333
Thank you, Saiga,
smells good!

37
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,166
Let me guess.

38
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,291
I should've gone
with the cold cuts?

39
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,375
No, not at all...!
They're perfect!

40
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,666
I'm just surprised--

41
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,666
I've never had instant
noodles before!

42
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,083
Hang on a sec--

43
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,458
you're a teenager and you've
never had a cup of ramen?

44
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,875
Well no--

45
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,750
but I have always
wanted to try it!

46
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,083
O-kay...

47
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,708
Yeah, hello.

48
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,416
Saiga! Oh, thank god!
Are you okay?

49
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,291
Yes, Bob, I'm fine.

50
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,416
Well our building's
become a hornet's nest,

51
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,000
and they're
all looking for you!

52
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,416
Listen, I don't know what
kind of trouble you're in,

53
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,958
but my sister runs
a little club in Kitasenju--

54
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,208
the Show Pub.

55
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,208
She said you could hide
there for a while--

56
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,791
no problem!

57
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,083
Thanks.

58
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,291
The party crowd
is just heading home now--

59
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,541
it's going
to be bumper-to-bumper

60
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,041
going this direction...

61
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,583
This is bad.

62
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,083
Hey what the hell man?

63
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,666
Move your fucking truck!

64
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,458
What'd you say...? Huh?

65
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,291
Man, not her.

66
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,958
You're lucky
I'm on the clock.

67
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,791
These guys
are unbelievable--

68
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,000
they've roadblocked
the whole street

69
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,416
so they can search
every damn car for you...

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,541
We'll just have
to kill some time

71
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,375
until the morning
rush hour starts,

72
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,125
and then pray we can slip
by with the commuters

73
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,208
in the subway system.

74
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,291
Okay...
But if we walk...

75
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,625
Oh right,
you need shoes...

76
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,166
And a different wardrobe
wouldn't hurt either.

77
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,083
This outfit
is embarrassing.

78
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,916
Relax-- it's to help you
blend in with the crowd.

79
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,291
Wait...
Come this way.

80
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,458
Good. I don't
think they saw us.

81
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,458
Looks safe enough.

82
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,833
Here.

83
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,458
Oh...
Thank you.

84
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,000
What...?
Uh... Um... Saiga!

85
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,416
Never taken a
train either, huh?

86
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,666
There's so many people.

87
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,041
Hang in there-- most
of 'em will get off soon.

88
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,666
So why were you
laughing back there?

89
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,250
I don't know...

90
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,666
'Cause the man in front of us
was tickling me with his hand.

91
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,041
Damnit...!
That was a pervert!

92
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,875
Speak up next time!

93
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,666
Hello...?

94
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,500
Madam Koganei,
you home?

95
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,041
Can't believe she
doesn't have a phone...

96
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,875
What the--?

97
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,333
Hey... Everything here
is tagged for auction...

98
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,041
Wonder what that's all about.

99
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,125
We were sent to find
Madam Koganei--

100
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,875
the rest is
not our business.

101
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,583
Ah, don't
be such a prude.

102
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,458
Now that's how you
shit with class.

103
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,583
I thought Madam
Koganei had kids?

104
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,166
Hell if I know.

105
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,500
Sorry to keep you
gentlemen waiting.

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,708
Oh, hope we didn't
scare you, madam-

107
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,625
Mister Suitengu
wants your help.

108
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,416
Well... We should
get going, then.

109
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,791
Can't blame her
for being tired...

110
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:46,125
Look at me, on the run with an
abused, sheltered teenage girl.

111
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,333
What the hell
am I thinking?

112
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,208
This stop,
Kitasenju Station.

113
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,916
This is the end of the line.

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,250
Please exit the train.

115
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,916
This place is weird--
it's so dirty.

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,791
Stop looking 'round
like a tourist, will ya?

117
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh... Sorry.

118
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,583
This is it.

119
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,458
Not there either, huh...?

120
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes yes, I understand--
I'll call you back shortly.

121
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,416
We've secured all the main
roads and station terminals

122
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,375
that lead outside
of the city...

123
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,875
but we still
haven't caught them...

124
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,750
Means they're either still
hiding somewhere close...

125
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,750
or they...

126
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,875
Excuse me, sir?

127
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm trying to get to Ameyoko--
could you point me there?

128
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh yeah you
mean the market?

129
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,458
Just keep going a few blocks
down until you-- what?

130
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,375
Hey, what
are you doing?

131
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,000
Ah, god!
God, let go of me!...

132
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,125
Yes, that's it...
You have Kagura's scent.

133
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,666
Where were you when you
put your hands on her?

134
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,291
A pretty girl--about 15--
with long brown hair.

135
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,250
On the subway!
The Hibiya Line!

136
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,416
The subway? Damn it!

137
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,333
Now I'll have to search
that entire track!

138
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,875
How come
no one's here?

139
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,416
It's a late-night
type of club--

140
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,708
the employees
are probably asleep.

141
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,791
Anyways... I'm hoping we
can lay low here, for a while.

142
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,916
You think Mister Suitengu
will stop looking

143
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,166
if he doesn't
find me soon?

144
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,541
I highly doubt it.

145
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,708
Yeah... me too.

146
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,083
Listen, while we're
on that topic...

147
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,083
I know this isn't easy...

148
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,750
But for our sake...
Our safety...

149
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,625
Anything you can remember
about what happened to you,

150
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,541
in those underground
rituals--

151
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,833
I need to know.

152
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,458
Okay...

153
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,083
I'm sorry...
I just... I...

154
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,708
Hey... It's all right...
Just forget it...

155
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,625
We can worry about
all that later, okay?

156
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,250
Hey, you like Karaoke,
don't you...? Sing something.

157
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,791
We could both
use a diversion.

158
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,750
What's Karaoke?

159
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,083
It's like singing your
favorite song in the shower...

160
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,791
No pressure to be good,
and you can pick what you want.

161
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,833
Oh...

162
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,375
I like hymns...

163
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,041
Like they sing at church.

164
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,875
Church hymns ...?

165
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,500
Yeah, it's been a while.

166
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,875
Well, hello.

167
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,333
You must be the "special
customers" Bob phoned me about.

168
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,208
Yeah, so that makes you,
um, Bob's "sister"?

169
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,500
What?

170
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,041
One hell of a lay...

171
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,125
Stop the car.

172
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,833
Is something wrong,
Madam...?

173
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,375
You're not feeling
car-sick, are you?

174
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,541
Just put your
foot on the brake.

175
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,125
Can I... help you?

176
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,666
What an exquisite
diamond you have.

177
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,041
Come, let me look at it--
one girl to another.

178
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,291
Okay...

179
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,291
It's lovely...

180
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,583
Hey...! What are you
doing you freak??

181
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,041
What the--?!

182
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:36,166
Let's go...

183
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,000
Only a cheap diamond
made to look expensive.

184
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,250
Damn it lady,
that's fucked up!

185
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,291
Stop the car...!
Stop it! Now!

186
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,791
What do you think?

187
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,125
I don't know-- sure as hell
can't let her do that again.

188
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,500
I need more...

189
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,041
You cocksuckers,
I need more diamonds!

190
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,291
No funny stuff!

191
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,291
Just dump the
rocks in the bag!

192
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,125
Take what you want--
just don't hurt us!

193
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,041
An old-fashioned stick up--
I'm getting nostalgic.

194
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,125
Yeah, the first job I ever took
was a jewelry store heist...

195
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,208
Gave my mom
a necklace.

196
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,833
She was so proud.

197
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,333
Sure...

198
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,166
The madam kind of
reminds me of my mom,

199
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,833
y'know, when she
was younger.

200
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,791
Mmm, delicious.

201
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,541
Yes, there's no mistake...

202
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,666
This is where
Miss Kagura got off.

203
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,125
Oh, come on, sugar,
you can be honest--

204
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,958
we're all friends here.

205
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,916
What's the story between you
and that hot hunk o' beef?

206
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,250
What do you mean?

207
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,291
Is he your sugar daddy?

208
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,625
My what?

209
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,208
Don't be stupid...
You know that can't be it...

210
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,000
Ooh...! He's your
teacher right?

211
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,875
And you've fallen
hopelessly in love...

212
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,583
The forbidden passion between
a teacher and his pupil...!

213
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,458
You're eloping, aren't you?

214
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,750
No, no, it's nothing
romantic like that...

215
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,791
They're a daughter and
step-father, that's my bet.

216
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,708
Boo-- scary!

217
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,791
Yeah, enough with
the childhood memories!

218
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,041
No, it's nothing
like that-- really.

219
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,208
But you did run
away with him right?

220
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,583
Yes.

221
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,625
Then you're free now,
that's all that matters!

222
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,791
I am?

223
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,291
Well aren't you?
You tell me.

224
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,541
I'm not sure yet,
actually...

225
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,208
What about all of you--
are you free?

226
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,791
Well there's no way
that I am...!

227
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,750
Not with the old balls-and-chain
still stuck to me!

228
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,375
Well then hurry up
and get rid of it!

229
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,875
Why do you think
I'm working so hard?

230
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,500
Maybe if you didn't work hard,
you'd get better tips.

231
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,458
Sorry about their
crudeness Kagura...

232
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,083
They couldn't be clean if
they were raised in a bath.

233
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,166
Oh no... I really
don't mind at all--

234
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,166
everyone seems to have
so much fun here.

235
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,416
Oooh...! This girl is so
adorable I can't stand it!

236
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,958
I want to make her
my little sister!

237
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,250
Hands off, Yashiro!

238
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,416
The big sister title
belongs to me!

239
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,541
Don't you mean
big brother?

240
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,000
Speak for yourself.

241
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,250
Can it...! You haven't even
asked what she thinks...!

242
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,708
You're probably scaring
the poor girl silly!

243
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,750
No, I think it's great--
I don't have any real siblings.

244
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
Good... Then in
that case, it's decided!

245
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,458
From this day forward, you can
be a little sister to all of us!

246
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,958
Yay!

247
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,208
All right, Kagura!

248
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,958
Welcome to the family!
Wonderful!

249
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,375
Yoo-hoo "Simon"...

250
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,791
Where's that whiskey
and water...?

251
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,500
Chop, chop! Our customers
need their drinks!

252
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,125
Yeah, yeah...
I'm coming.

253
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,625
I guess no one hides
for free.

254
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,541
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Show Pub David!

255
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,833
And now,
it's Sexy Showtime!

256
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,250
So...! Let's
get kinky, girls!

257
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,458
Take it off!

258
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,041
I'm not gonna
regret this!

259
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,958
Oh yeah!

260
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,541
I must've lost my mind.

261
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,333
I was expecting you
over an hour ago.

262
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,458
We had to take
a little detour.

263
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,333
Madam... The night finds
you more radiant than ever.

264
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,333
Thank you!

265
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,458
Are you happy...?

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,791
That's a worthy frame.

267
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,958
Oh, just take her
picture already...

268
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,750
After all...
She is quite lovely.

269
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,750
What a stupid irony.

270
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,250
Finally find a subject,
and I can't take the shot.

271
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
You sure that cute little
heiress is hanging around

272
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,791
in a dump like this?

273
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,583
Yes... There's no doubt.

274
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,916
Yeah! Bravo! Encore!

275
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,083
Now, for our finale...

276
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,250
Young Kagura
will sing for us!

277
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,333
What?

278
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,125
Yeah! Alright!

279
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,458
Let's go...! We can't
keep your audience waiting!

280
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,416
Wait, I--

281
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,708
She's here.

282
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,625
Don't be shy, sweetie--
go for broke!

283
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,750
We'll be right behind
you the whole time!

284
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay.

285
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,625
Hurry up and sing!

286
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,583
Yeah, we'll cheer no
matter how bad you are!

287
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,583
Show us what you got!

288
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:30,291
♪ Amazing grace,

289
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:36,083

00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:47,000

295

296
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,250
Beautifully sung Goddess--
you gave me chills...

297
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,291
You've had
your adventure...

298
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,500
Now it's time
to come home.

299
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,416
Oh, yeah!
Take it off, honey!

300
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:36,458
There's a carnivore in the
room with skin like diamonds.

301
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,291
Cold, hard,
and impossible to bruise.

302
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,750
In this city, greed
can take you like madness,

303
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,875
until all you want
to do is feed.

304
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,833
But you can't weigh
love by the carat.
