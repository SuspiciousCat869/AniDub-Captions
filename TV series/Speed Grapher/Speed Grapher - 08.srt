1
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,875
There, you see it?

2
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,750
A dark spot on her brain.

3
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,625
Odds are that's a tumor.

4
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,833
There's nothing we can do...

5
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,041
I'll be blunt, Saiga--

6
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,708
she probably has
six months, at best.

7
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,833
This isn't fair.

8
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,750
How can a girl so full of life
only have six months to live?

9
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,125
Are you ready to begin...
Mister Suitengu?

10
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,958
Go ahead.

11
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,583
Did it... work?

12
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,416
Your cell activity level is
definitely being affected...

13
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,125
it's back all the way
up to ninety-eight percent

14
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,583
at the points
of attachment.

15
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,625
I won't fail...
I swear it...

16
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,416
Mister Suitengu.

17
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,333
Thank you for making the
trip all the way out here.

18
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,583
Hmm... My,
are you all right?

19
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,333
You're looking awfully pale--
even more so than usual.

20
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,916
Have you made
any progress?

21
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,791
Oh yes, about that...

22
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,875
The sample-- it wasn't...

23
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,750
Well there simply wasn't
enough of it to cultivate...

24
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,875
Our only hope is
to collect another sample

25
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,666
from young Kagura.

26
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,833
Up until now, we've been able to
artificially regulate her body,

27
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,125
and suppress the
onset of menstruation.

28
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,958
However,
for obvious reasons,

29
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,875
we can't administer
the dosage anymore.

30
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,708
And without it...

31
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,291
Her cycle
could start at any time,

32
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,291
sending her hormonal
balance into turmoil--

33
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
Yes I'm quite aware...

34
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,041
that's why I'm going to retrieve
her before that happens.

35
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,291
But for now...

36
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,375
do the best you can
with what you have.

37
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,041
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,083
Kagura...

39
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,833
I got the dentist with me...

40
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,333
so where's the girl now?

41
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,875
She just returned
to the house.

42
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,333
Let's do it.

43
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,875
Not yet... We wait for the
reinforcements to arrive.

44
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,708
It's been
a while hasn't it...

45
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,250
Doctor Mizonokuchi?

46
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,375
You're in a tight
spot this time...

47
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,083
Though I never thought the
Goddess would be kidnapped--

48
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,500
I can hardly blame him.

49
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,250
I warn you...
he has quite a power...

50
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,416
Shoots more than
pictures, I know...

51
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,250
I was in attendance on
the night he was so blessed.

52
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,083
Then when everything
is in place...

53
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,875
you'll go in and
extract the problem?

54
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,208
I take it you've agreed...

55
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,583
to the terms of
my compensation?

56
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,833
We have... Once she's
back in our hands,

57
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,916
we'll deliver Kagura
to your chair each month

58
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,833
for a routine cleaning.

59
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,083
Wonderful.

60
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,875
Sad, isn't it?

61
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,750
How poor souls
who've not received

62
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,375
the Goddess' blessing...

63
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,875
must resort to such
rudimentary tools to perform ?

64
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,541
Yeah,

65
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,166
so Doc, what's that you been
messin' around with back there?

66
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,416
This...? It is my
greatest treasure.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,875
But, what the hell is it?

68
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,833
It was...
three years ago...

69
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,875
That's when the Goddess
first graced my chair

70
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,500
with her presence...

71
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,916
In all my years
of practicing dentistry,

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,958
I had never laid eyes on
a more beautiful set of teeth.

73
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,250
Until I peered between
her gaping lips...

74
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,166
One minor imperfection: The
Goddess' jaw was too small...

75
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,166
causing some overcrowding...

76
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,791
one of her rear molars had to
be removed to make more room.

77
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,208
Only I couldn't bring myself
to just pull it like a weed...

78
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,458
Bit by bit...
I polished away at it.

79
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,291
Why would you go to
all that extra trouble?

80
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,833
Can't you imagine
the Goddess writhing around,

81
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,166
helpless in your grasp?

82
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,458
It was a private pleasure...

83
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,666
reserved just for me...

84
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,458
A honeymoon of sorts, between
the Goddess and myself.

85
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,958
Alas...

86
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,541
as all pleasures must, it
reached its inevitable climax.

87
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,958
That's what this is...

88
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,750
My crown jewel,
if you will.

89
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,833
Pretty windy here.

90
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,208
We're right on the beach...

91
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,041
The wind blows down from
the mountain and out to sea.

92
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,333
I have a friend who works

93
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,750
in the university's
genetics research lab.

94
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,125
I'll have him look
at the blood samples

95
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,000
I collected
from you and the girl...

96
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,791
He owes me a decent favor...

97
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,416
And it's among
the top-rated facilities

98
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
of its kind
in the country.

99
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,208
Thank you Doc...
for... everything

100
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,416
I'm sorry. She didn't
even ask permission.

101
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,541
Nevermind that...

102
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,791
My wife was the only
one who played...

103
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,125
I'm glad someone's
getting some use from it.

104
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,416
I'm at a loss...

105
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,666
I don't know how you
managed to cope with this.

106
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,041
Everyone dies in the end.

107
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,875
You think
I don't know that...?

108
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,083
Living beings turned lifeless
with the snap of a shutter...

109
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,000
Seen it over and over
again during the wars.

110
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,375
But... to watch death
approaching slowly--

111
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,875
unable to stop it...

112
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,750
Should I tell her the truth?

113
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,416
For what purpose...?

114
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,291
The girl's too young
to come to terms with it...

115
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,833
She wouldn't know
where to start.

116
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
The best thing you
can do for her...

117
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,958
is make the most of
her remaining time.

118
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,166
Its memories, Saiga...

119
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,291
That's what makes it bearable
for those who live on.

120
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,166
Let's go...!

121
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,208
And make certain
Kagura is unharmed!

122
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,583
She knows her way
around the ivories.

123
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,041
Yeah.

124
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,083
Is something wrong?

125
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,541
You smell that...?
Something's burning.

126
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,583
A fire?

127
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,166
But Saiga...

128
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,750
Saiga...
what's going on?

129
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,458
Get down now!

130
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,333
Saiga...

131
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,208
Why'd a war just start in
the middle of my place?

132
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,833
Sorry 'bout this Doc...

133
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,708
those are the guys
who've been chasing us.

134
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,333
I should've asked before...

135
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,291
What kinda trouble
you in, exactly??

136
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,166
Mr. Saiga!

137
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,125
Are you still
in one piece?

138
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,458
Yes.

139
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,166
This way!

140
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,833
We should be able to avoid
most of the smoke down here--

141
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,500
for a while at least.

142
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,541
All right Doc...

143
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,041
I need you to take
care of her...

144
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,666
Go on.

145
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,791
You're unarmed and outmanned--
What're you gonna do?

146
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,333
Don't worry about me--
I got it under control.

147
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,333
Saiga!

148
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,166
No! Wait!

149
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,458
All this damn smoke...

150
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,833
My camera can't lock focus
on a solid object--

151
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,541
it keeps targeting the haze.

152
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,750
Gotta be careful...

153
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,291
or else I'll blow my
freaking face off.

154
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,541
Mr. Saiga...

155
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,916
What's the call...?

156
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,750
We just swoop in all
at once and surround 'em?

157
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,750
Not yet... First the
Dentist goes in alone.

158
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,083
Let's see how that goes.

159
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,625
Guess they know better than to
come any closer than this...

160
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,750
So now what?

161
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,875
You're mine.

162
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,833
What?

163
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,416
Without a camera,

164
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,750
your Euphoric power isn't
of much use to you, now is it?

165
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,791
You've made some powerful
people very angry.

166
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,958
So they called on me
to remove the decay!

167
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:17,458
I'm going to drill
through your entire body.

168
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,541
Without a camera
I am powerless.

169
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,416
Unfortunately for you,
I always pack a spare.

170
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,583
Your resistance
is admirable, yet...

171
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,500
ultimately futile...

172
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,041
In this smoke, your power is
as useless as a wisdom tooth...

173
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,708
Can't you see
when you've lost?

174
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,208
I can't see much now,

175
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,291
but I think that's
all about to change.

176
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,666
We're right on the beach...

177
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,416
The wind blows down from
the mountain and out to sea.

178
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,708
Now I see you.

179
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,208
Smile, asshole!

180
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,125
How dare you--

181
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,666
What the hell is that thing
and why's it in my house?

182
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,416
Stay back, Doc!

183
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,791
You're just like
the rest of 'em...

184
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,041
Not right in the head.

185
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,916
Wanna tell me what's
going on here, Saiga...?

186
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,458
Who was that monster...?

187
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,583
And how'd you do that
with your camera?

188
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,166
I'll explain
it all later.

189
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,291
But right now...

190
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,416
I need a really
fuckin' bright light.

191
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,791
I got a portable backup
generator in the basement...

192
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,500
If it's still in one piece
it could juice a floodlight.

193
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,291
Even if my plan works out...

194
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,125
there's a chance your
place might be destroyed.

195
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,916
It's a little late
for a warning.

196
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,125
Doc... take her and wait
for me in the car, all right?

197
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,875
I'll be there in a sec.

198
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,541
We attack on my command!

199
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,291
And don't even think of
coming back without Kagura!

200
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,583
Yes, sir!
What the fuck?!

201
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,125
Get down!

202
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,666
What was that?

203
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,291
It's him.

204
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,583
Damn it... the
bastard's still alive?

205
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,833
Take it that means the
Dentist has been retired.

206
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,291
Sorry guys...

207
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,958
But I don't think you
need to be following me.

208
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,166
Help me.

209
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,208
I'm gonna...
kill that jerk off.

210
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,208
We fucked up royally...

211
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,458
For all we know
she could be--

212
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,791
Don't worry...
Kagura's still alive.

213
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,666
Yes I'll be needing you to get
me another car immediately.

214
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Preferably one that can't be
blown up by a fucking camera!

215
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,708
I'm sorry, man...

216
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,000
What a way
to repay you, huh?

217
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm really sorry,
too, Doctor.

218
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,291
Hang in there Saiga...

219
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll take a look at your
wounds in just a second.

220
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,708
No need for that...

221
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,250
These wounds'll heal
themselves soon enough.

222
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,083
Are you nuts...?
You've been critically injured!

223
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,958
Yeah yeah I know what it
sounds like but I'm serious...

224
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,583
Give it a few minutes
and you'll see.

225
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,083
Between that hideous freak
and your exploding camera...

226
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,833
I'm not sure how much faith
I put in my eyes these days.

227
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,416
Yeah, me neither.

228
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,916
I don't want to believe...
any of this is real.

229
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,000
Far outside of Tokyo, away
from the tar of corruption

230
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,625
that lines every
city-dweller's lungs...

231
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,875
A hidden railway offers
the hope of a way out.

232
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,958
But hope is like
the sun in winter.

233
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,000
It never stays for long.
