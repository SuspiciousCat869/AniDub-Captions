1
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, good God!

2
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,958
What the fuck
is goin' on?!

3
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,416
Suitengu!

4
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,333
Suitengu?

5
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,583
He's wasting his time...

6
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,583
and ammo, this whole
building is bulletproof.

7
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,291
The bird is down.

8
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,333
I repeat,
the bird is down.

9
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,625
Hold off on
the police...

10
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,708
Let us clean up
here first.

11
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,958
How the hell is that son
of a bitch still alive?!

12
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,083
It appears as though
you're all there.

13
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,458
Suitengu!

14
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,250
Deputy...
Defense Minister...

15
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,708
and all you other
Cabinet members...

16
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,208
I do hope you're
enjoying the show.

17
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,125
Damn you...!

18
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,916
Don't you realize
what you're doing here...?

19
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,291
This is an act
of treason!

20
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,250
Don't worry yourself
over my fate.

21
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,666
Just enjoy to the fullest your
final moments at the Club.

22
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,250
Final moments?

23
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,166
What the hell
does that mean?

24
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,833
Suitengu...!
Answer me!

25
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,333
No good!
The door's locked!

26
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,958
And with that the Club is
completely locked down.

27
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,666
This blows.

28
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,166
Can't believe the son of
a bitch is really gone.

29
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,833
Yes...

30
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,625
But sir...
What's this for?

31
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,125
This is your
last assignment--

32
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,875
The time has come
for me to let you go.

33
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,833
There are those
in the government

34
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,083
who intend
to eliminate me...

35
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,625
From this point on, the fight
is between them and me alone.

36
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,958
I can't ask you
to join me.

37
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,666
There will soon be
nowhere in this country...

38
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,416
or in the world
for that matter,

39
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,708
where I will belong.

40
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,083
Only Kagura and I
shall remain here,

41
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,416
to face our fates.

42
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,208
You've all worked hard for me
and've been incredibly loyal...

43
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,791
You have my
sincerest gratitude.

44
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,291
Well boys,
this is where I get off...

45
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,875
Though it has
been quite a ride.

46
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,833
I'm staying put.

47
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,208
You can take my
share if you want.

48
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,833
You fuckin' serious?

49
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,541
Tsujido...
You stick around here,

50
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,666
and they'll fuckin'
slaughter your ass!

51
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,958
What can I say, ever since we
met, I've admired his scent...

52
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,500
And regardless, I've been
living on borrowed time

53
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,958
since that day.

54
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,083
You know, fuck it...
Take mine, too.

55
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,166
Makabe?!

56
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,708
Long time ago I promised
myself I wouldn't go out

57
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,083
'til I was on top...

58
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,208
And somehow, I doubt I'm
ever gonna get any higher

59
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,458
than where I'm at now.

60
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,958
Ah come on...! So this is how
you assholes honor Suitengu?

61
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,541
By ignoring his
last fuckin' wishes?

62
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,250
He told us
to run, right?

63
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,291
Ain't it up to the
three of us to live?

64
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,083
So we can go and tell the world
all the great shit he done?

65
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,583
Niihari...

66
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,916
I think that's a task
you were born to perform.

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,541
We'll meet again,
if the fates allow.

68
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,750
Cocksuckers...

69
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,875
Try not to
get dead.

70
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,541
Let's go, Makabe...

71
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,916
This time we save him.

72
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,166
Kagura...!

73
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,041
Kagura!

74
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,541
Kagura!

75
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,208
Away from the door!

76
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,041
Doc,
is that you?

77
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,625
Saiga...! Thank God,
you're still alive.

78
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,416
Kagura...!
Where is she...?

79
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,750
Isn't she with you?!

80
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,041
They took her somewhere...

81
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,291
So tell me... where
the hell are we, anyway?

82
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,916
The Prime
Minister's mansion.

83
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
The what?

84
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,208
Stop it!

85
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,166
You have no reason to be
afraid in here, Goddess.

86
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,500
This office is
completely secure...

87
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,458
My men will
take care of...

88
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,250
that horrible Suitengu.

89
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,875
As long as I'm here
with you, my child...

90
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,000
you've nothing to fear,
I won't let anyone hurt you.

91
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,791
Now... why don't we
make our way to the Club

92
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,666
so we can continue
our meal in peace...?

93
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,000
I've asked them to prepare
all the finest delicacies.

94
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,250
But first, just
one more lovely taste

95
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,166
of your delicious
fingers, hmm?

96
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,833
No...!
Stay away from me!

97
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,083
Kagura!

98
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,708
Saiga!

99
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,583
Ah yes,
I recognize you...

100
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,291
You're that photographer...

101
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,125
You called me "a boring subject"
if I recall correctly.

102
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,833
Wow, you remember me,
I'm all tingly inside.

103
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,250
I've heard about
your unique talent...

104
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,500
But do you honestly dare snap
that shutter of yours at me...

105
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,500
the esteemed Prime
Minister of Japan?

106
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,958
Now then....

107
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,416
How shall I prepare you,
my little appetizer?

108
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,875
Suitengu!

109
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,333
Why isn't anyone who's
supposed to be dead dead?!

110
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,125
So Suitengu...

111
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,000
You responsible for that
pile of bodies out there...?

112
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,916
Just how many lives
are you gonna take?

113
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,875
All the people I've killed
in this country were guilty...

114
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,750
Guilty of being blinded
by their unending avarice.

115
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,708
The only innocent
blood on my hands...

116
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,791
is from a distant
battlefield long ago.

117
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,375
In that previous
existence...

118
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,833
I ended
countless lives...

119
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,083
Innocent, harmless,
unselfish...

120
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,500
People who had never
done any wrong by me...

121
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,125
Just so I could cling
to my own miserable life.

122
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,708
Just so I could
survive... Kamiya...

123
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,958
and claim
my vengeance on you.

124
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,166
Vengeance, what are
you talking about?

125
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,333
Do you not recognize...
this visage...?

126
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,458
Fifteen years ago when you
were Secretary of Finance...

127
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,375
you sold me abroad--

128
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,708
Have you forgotten
Takeshi Ueno?

129
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,208
Ueno...?

130
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,750
My God, you're that young
whelp from all those years ago?

131
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,791
Good morning,
young man.

132
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,666
And to you as well,
young lady.

133
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,916
What a shame!

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,458
Truly an unfortunate
turn of events.

135
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,541
Who are you?

136
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,125
I don't know
if you're aware,

137
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,166
but your father was
in quite a bit of debt.

138
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,375
He was?

139
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,791
Oh, yes. And rather
late on his payments.

140
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,666
So, you lived
to tell...

141
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,250
In a manner of speaking--

142
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,833
I was mortally wounded
during battle...

143
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,208
But, Kagura...

144
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,708
thanks to the research
performed by your father...

145
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,916
I was reborn...

146
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,416
Your true father was
Doctor Kazuki Odawara,

147
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,583
a brilliant scientist...

148
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,125
Some twenty years ago...

149
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,541
he was enlisted by the
Japanese government...

150
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,500
which had been
invited by an ally...

151
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,041
To participate
in a joint project

152
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:20,291
developing biological weapons
for use in polar warfare.

153
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,166
Biological weapons...

154
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,750
But then...

155
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,041
an international treaty banned
all research of that nature...

156
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,666
Fearing reprisals, the nations
involved sought to destroy

157
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,750
all evidence of the project.

158
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,166
But Odawara's research
was secretly passed on

159
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,916
in two people.

160
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,125
One of them was me,
the carrier...

161
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,541
The other was you,
Kagura...

162
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,958
There is a substance coursing
through your bodily fluids

163
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,458
that has the power to
activate the viral syndrome,

164
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,000
and create Euphorics.

165
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,916
I spread the virus
as I saw fit,

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,375
and then used your
talents at my club

167
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,375
to ascend the ranks of
power in this country.

168
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,291
All for this day.

169
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,875
Too bad then, that as of
today you're through...

170
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,083
The Club is set
to become state-run...

171
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,708
and the Tennozu Group
will be sold to foreigners...

172
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,833
The Cabinet already
made it so...

173
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,625
And our will is the
will of the people.

174
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,416
Don't you just
love democracy?

175
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,708
And this is the true face of our
country's Prime Minister...

176
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,833
How appropriate.

177
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,458
W-- Wait...
Suitengu...!

178
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,541
Your sister, I know
where your little sister is ...

179
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,958
If you kill me now...

180
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,833
there's no way
you'll ever find her!

181
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,833
Yui is still alive?

182
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,666
That's right...
And I know where...!

183
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,333
I'm the only one
who still knows!

184
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,750
A nice attempt...

185
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,375
But my sister has been
with me for some time now.

186
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,041
Get out of the way!

187
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,041
Move it!

188
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,791
Clear the street!

189
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,583
Ano kamu?

190
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,083
(shouts in Tagalog)

191
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,041
Paki ibigay
ang pera sa akin.

192
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,500
Give me...
money...

193
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,375
Okane...
kudasai...

194
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,166
Money... money...
money...

195
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,583
Give me money--
cash only.

196
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,500
Yui...

197
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,791
Are those your
sister's remains...?

198
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,583
Gimme, Suitengu, gimme!

199
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,041
Let me be the one to devour it--
I want her inside me!

200
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,291
Yui... now you and
I will be together...

201
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,958
until I can join you.

202
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,583
Tell you what,
Suitengu...

203
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,625
we got off on the
wrong foot, okay...?

204
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,666
How 'bout I put the Club
back in your hands...?

205
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,916
Or I know!

206
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,791
How would you like a
cushy Cabinet post?

207
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,416
Name it,
it's yours!

208
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,708
I think not.

209
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,916
No wait...!
Let's talk!

210
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,291
Kagura...
Come with me.

211
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,750
Fuck!

212
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,166
Saiga!

213
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,166
Please, Suitengu,
leave him alone!

214
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,625
Kagura...
if you do as I say,

215
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,500
I will spare
this man's life.

216
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,208
Ah, c'mon... what use do
you have for Kagura now,

217
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,458
why not just let
the poor girl go?

218
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,666
She and I are needed
to end this tragedy...

219
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,666
But after that we
have no place...

220
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,833
We're cursed aberrations,

221
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,416
living plagues upon
the earth...

222
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,583
Had I died on
that battlefield...

223
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,666
and had you
not been born...

224
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,333
countless deaths would
have been prevented.

225
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,041
If I had
never been born?

226
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,291
That's right.

227
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,166
You should never have
been allowed to exist.

228
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,791
Kagura...! Don't listen
to a goddamn word he says!

229
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,041
Oh, god!

230
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,125
Suitengu... Promise me
you'll let him live.

231
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,000
Kagura!

232
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,500
Let's go...
Right now.

233
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,916
Thank you, Saiga...

234
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,875
Don't forget me.

235
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,125
Kagura...

236
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,291
Kagura!

237
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The cruel morning dawns,
the end looming on the horizon,

238
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,833
ready to rise like
a waiting sun.

239
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:42,083
What happens to a nation
when its leaders are gone?

240
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,875
Someone always steps
in to fill the void.
