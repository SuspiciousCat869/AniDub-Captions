1
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,708
That kind of power...

2
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,583
I can't believe you
could get it from her.

3
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,291
You planning to take her
back home anytime soon?

4
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,250
No, that's the last
thing she needs...

5
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,208
Pretty abusive
environment there.

6
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,708
In my view...

7
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,083
The best thing I can do
for that girl and myself...

8
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,708
is keep looking...

9
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,083
find out what's going on
with our bodies,

10
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,500
and bet back
to normal again.

11
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,708
You know, Saiga...

12
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,958
I can take care of
that part for you.

13
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,250
The finding out anyway.

14
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,625
I took the liberty of sending
your blood to the university lab

15
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,208
I was telling you about
where I used to do research...

16
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,125
When it comes to DNA
they're the best,

17
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,166
and if they can't
figure it out no one can...

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,833
Listen...

19
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,666
It's just a theory, but I'm
thinking the tumor in her brain

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,250
may be less a symptom of her
curse than the cause of it.

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,791
Thanks, Doc...

22
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,666
but I've already endangered
you way too much as it is.

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,000
Shut the hell up--

24
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,166
being around you two
has been a real blessing ...

25
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,875
I haven't felt this
young in years.

26
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,000
All I'm in danger of
is being happy again.

27
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,000
Call me in a week...

28
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,708
I should have results then.

29
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,333
Okay.

30
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,958
Uh, Captain?

31
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,750
Sorry, but why am I here?

32
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,708
'Cause I called
for you, rookie.

33
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,291
Yes but... why...

34
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,041
did you call for me, ?

35
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,333
'Cause this is
your office now,

36
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,083
and I thought the least
you could do is show up.

37
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,375
What?! My office...? I work the
crime lab-- remember?

38
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,666
As you can see,

39
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,958
all of my men are playing
hooky in the hospital.

40
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,166
So I asked the brass
for reinforcements.

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,416
You're them.

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,625
No...! That's crazy--

43
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,166
I can't work out
in the field...!

44
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,875
I mean, outside of training I've
never even handled a pistol!

45
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,875
Funny...

46
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,875
Figured a guy like you's
got all kinds of practice

47
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,666
holding his own pistol.

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,041
Okay, fine...!
Tell you the truth

49
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,583
I've always dreamed
of making detective one day...

50
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,791
Just wait'll the boys
in ballistics hear!!

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,416
Jesus, try not to crap
yourself with excitement...

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't have time
for dry-cleaning.

53
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,958
So... what are we
workin' on now, Captain?

54
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,416
One hell of a puzzle.

55
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,750
A pile of politicians
and celebs turn up dead

56
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,833
all across town...

57
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,625
A massive fire...

58
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,958
And the sudden disappearance
of Tatsumi Saiga.

59
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,000
Wait, Mr. Saiga disappeared?

60
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,833
While he was sniffing around a
certain top-secret social club.

61
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,291
So what's the connection?

62
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,958
All that shit just
happened to go down

63
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,000
on one fuckin' night...?!

64
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,333
Doesn't that seem odd to you?

65
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,791
Every one of these jerks
dies of unrelated causes

66
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,708
in unrelated locations??

67
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,875
Bullshit!

68
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,791
This isn't
some coincidence...

69
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,041
They were all part of the
same incident, same place.

70
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,666
Someplace where famous people
get to hobnob with each other...

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,708
I see...! It's that club
you were talkin' about...!

72
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,500
And Mister Saiga saw something
there he wasn't supposed to!

73
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,166
That'd certainly connect all
these "unrelated" cases...

74
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,125
But we don't have
any hard evidence...

75
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,833
Guess we'll have
to go make some.

76
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm here to see
number eleven.

77
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,041
Hello beautiful,
welcome to the stir...

78
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,333
How about you
crawl on in here

79
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,166
and we make this visit
a conjugal one?

80
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,541
Some other time...

81
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,166
Right now I'm
busting you out.

82
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,416
Uh, Captain, I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,375
Where are you
taking me hot stuff...?

84
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,416
District attorney...?
Grisly crime scene?

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,041
Mister Suitengu's office.

86
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,125
You can't do that!

87
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,416
I'm serious...!

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,458
You have no idea
what he'll do to me...

89
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,083
Yeah but what kind
of guest would I be

90
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,791
if I showed up
empty-handed?

91
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,416
That hurts...!
Let go of me!

92
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,333
Let them through.

93
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,666
Afternoon...

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,958
Got a few cases I'm workin'
on, and-- funny story...

95
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,291
they all led me to you.

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,458
I had a feeling that
eventually a police presence

97
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,541
would turn up around here.

98
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,583
Should I take that as a
confession the secret club's

99
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,500
behind all the stiffs
I keep finding?

100
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,416
If it's secret
how would I know?

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,208
Spare me your
bullshit asshole...!

102
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,666
I know you've been
hunting down Tatsumi Saiga...

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,208
And now you're gonna tell
me where the fuck he is...

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,291
Of course I'm willing to
give you something in return.

105
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,875
This is the
wannabe crime lord

106
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,750
who tried moving
in on your turf...

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,000
You'd prob'ly like to
take care of him on your own.

108
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,791
I can arrange that.

109
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,041
You crazy bitch!
Somebody should lock you up!

110
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,916
Interesting.

111
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,791
I'm sure your photographer
friend would be disappointed

112
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,208
that you think so very
little of him, Detective.

113
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,250
Because "very little"

114
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,666
is about all this
two-bit hustler is worth.

115
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,375
Seems you don't know Mr. aiga
as well as the rumors claim.

116
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,166
Oh that's perfect...
What the fuck?!

117
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,541
Now even you're tellin'
me I don't know the guy...

118
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,541
If you need dating advice,
we can do it another time...

119
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,375
We're done here.

120
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,458
God damn it, you stupid
jackass son of a bitch!

121
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,250
'Course a miserable piece
of trash like you

122
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,791
isn't worth the grease
in Saiga's hair!

123
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,583
Captain, get a
hold of yourself!

124
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,166
Back off!

125
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,041
There's not a soul
in this world

126
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,916
who cares for that
bastard more than me...!

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,458
Saiga is the air I breathe!

128
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,333
He's my life!

129
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,333
Jesus Christ, I don't
even know this Saiga guy!

130
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,250
How's your headache
doin' now...? Feel okay?

131
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,083
Much better.

132
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,916
What's wrong?

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,250
It's nothing...

134
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,583
My eyes are gettin'
a little tired, that's all.

135
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,000
Hey listen...

136
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,458
There some place in particular
you're itchin' to go?

137
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
We gotta keep movin'
for a week,

138
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,291
so we might as well
move to somewhere.

139
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,041
Must be plenty of places
you've always wanted to see.

140
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,833
Now that you mention it...

141
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,875
There is... one place.

142
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,541
Who the's girl?

143
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,041
My mother when she
was a young woman.

144
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,791
And the guy?

145
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,916
I don't know...

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,750
That's what I
hope to find out.

147
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a nice picture...

148
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,750
Who gave it to you?

149
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,791
It was sent to me out of the
blue about four years ago...

150
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,666
I've tried to ask my
mother about it, but...

151
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,000
whenever I bring up the
past, she gets angry...

152
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,541
So I just had to wait.

153
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,916
Bessho Onsen Spa...

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,791
That's in Nagano.

155
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,250
From what I know of it,
the life of Shinsen Tennozu

156
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,791
has always been
shrouded in mystery...

157
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,666
She came out of nowhere to take
the modeling world by storm.

158
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,166
Her distinct look caused
an uproar, but then,

159
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,500
as suddenly as she'd
emerged, she was gone...

160
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:50,208
leaving the runway to become the
mistress of Yuichiro Ashikaga,

161
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,458
a giant in
financial circles...

162
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,833
Upon his death...

163
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,250
the grieving widow
restructured the Ashikaga group

164
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,625
under the Tennozu name,
and thus her dynasty was born.

165
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,166
Could this child's disease
have been passed down

166
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,041
from her mother?

167
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,791
Something stinks...

168
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,958
No that's not
what I meant kid.

169
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,833
Yeah but I do
smell kinda bad...

170
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,833
I've been in the same
clothes for days.

171
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,416
Guess we're both
a little ripe...

172
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,583
How about
we make a detour?

173
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,916
Awesome...! I've always dreamed
of coming to a place like this!

174
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,666
Go ahead-- you can have
whatever you want.

175
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,250
Thanks!

176
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,125
But you have to help me pick,
'cause you have the good eye.

177
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,625
You're a photographer,
after all!

178
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,208
Yeah... the fashion
thing's not really my scene--

179
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,416
uh!

180
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,375
Look, it's
just like yours!

181
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,875
Well, I'm taken care of--
now we get to shop for you!

182
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,166
That's okay...

183
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,833
Come on don't be shy...

184
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,958
You look great!!

185
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,333
You sure...? Don't
think it's really me...

186
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,666
What is it?

187
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,583
You have a call coming
in from the mansion...

188
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,958
Madam Gotokuji is not having
one of her better days.

189
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,000
Patch her through.

190
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,708
Shinsen...!

191
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,875
Shinsen! I need to see
the doctor-- you have to help--

192
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,583
I just know something dreadful
is going to happen to me!!

193
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,625
Shinsen...!
Shinsen...!

194
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,958
Shinsen,
where are you?!

195
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,833
Whatever is the matter...
President?

196
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,208
I'm not speaking to you--
bring me Shinsen!!

197
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,083
Come now-- don't you
recognize me...?

198
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,958
I'm here.
I am Shinsen.

199
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,250
You're lying...!

200
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,875
Bring the real Shinsen
to me you beast!

201
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,416
Lies...!
It's all lies!

202
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,000
I assure you, I am Shinsen.

203
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,458
Assure all you want, but you
are not the Shinsen I know...

204
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,458
Take a look... Now this--
this is Shinsen.

205
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,958
What an ugly child.

206
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,500
Oh no... Can't you see
this girl is a rare gem...?

207
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,750
Polish up her rough edges

208
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,833
and she's sure to become
an unrivaled beauty...

209
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,333
I have an uncanny eye
for this sort of thing.

210
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,000
But Madame President...

211
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:13,583
that child has already
blossomed into a butterfly.

212
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,791
Shinsen...?!

213
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,791
Shinsen,
is that really you ?!

214
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,791
Look at these wrinkles...

215
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,833
We must hurry and get you
to the doctor at once!

216
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,625
You know, that doctor with
the blemish on his left hand...

217
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,458
I think you fancy
him, don't you?

218
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,666
I did...

219
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,333
But that was another
lifetime ago.

220
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,083
Ah yes... It's
coming back to me now...

221
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,125
The woman pictured is
Shinsen Tennozu, right??

222
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,916
So you remember her
coming out here?

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,083
Most definitely...

224
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,375
How could I forget...?

225
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,458
Quite a bit
happened that trip...

226
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,958
Now then... you
must be her daughter.

227
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,208
Yes.

228
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,875
Any clue who that guy
standing next to her

229
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,625
in the picture might've
been, ma'am...?

230
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh... forgive me...
I'm her uncle...

231
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,666
I'm a big-time lawyer
back in Tokyo, um...

232
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,250
These rags are just my
traveling clothes...

233
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,291
I'm here to clear up a
question of succession.

234
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,041
Oh... is that so?

235
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes, so any information
you may have...

236
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,000
Please, even if you're
uncomfortable discussing it...

237
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,791
if it has anything to do
with where I came from...

238
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,500
Bear in mind...

239
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,500
all of this occurred about
fifteen years ago now...

240
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,125
Miss Tennozu
often came to our spa,

241
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,541
with this gentleman
at her side.

242
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,125
Was he her boyfriend?

243
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,041
Well, I don't like to pry,

244
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,833
but it certainly
appeared that way.

245
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,291
And then...?

246
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,666
From what I could
gather at the time,

247
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,208
they had arranged
to meet here that week...

248
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,041
but he didn't make it...

249
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,625
Miss Tennozu waited
around for a few days,

250
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,000
but eventually, she returned
to Tokyo, all alone.

251
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,083
He stood her up...?
My poor mother.

252
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,416
So this mystery guy--
He never showed?

253
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,250
Actually... he did
arrive at our door...

254
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,416
Tragically just hours
after Miss Tennozu left.

255
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,333
When he discovered
she'd already gone,

256
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,375
he seemed so...
devastated.

257
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,541
He left that
photograph behind,

258
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,083
the one my father mailed
to you four years ago...

259
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,333
But I don't know why he didn't
mail this at the same time--

260
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,083
the man wanted Shinsen's
child to have it, too.

261
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,833
Do you know...
where that man is now?

262
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,916
I'm afraid I do.

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,291
A few days later,

264
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,791
his body was found
at the bottom of a ravine...

265
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,666
The police neglected to do
a thorough investigation,

266
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,958
simply writing it off
as the accidental death

267
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,833
of an unidentified man.

268
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,291
My father and I decided

269
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,041
it was best not
to notify Miss Tennozu...

270
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,791
We'd read in the paper
about her marriage

271
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,333
to that wealthy businessman

272
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,750
shortly after her
return to Tokyo...

273
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,458
What good could have
come from telling her?

274
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:59,083
You still have the guest
register from back then?

275
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,625
Ah yes...
here he is.

276
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,333
Kazuki Odawara.

277
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:09,083
Jeez, Saiga...! I'm not your
goddamned errand boy...!

278
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,166
Where are you, anyway?

279
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,916
You get the info
I asked for, or not?

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,416
Yeah, I got it...

281
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,416
Bacterial Research
Lab One Fifty-Two.

282
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,250
An old Army installation
for experimenting

283
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,041
with biological warfare.

284
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,541
But it's been shut
down for 15 years.

285
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,583
As for that Odawara
you asked about,

286
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,583
he was a licensed physician up
until fifteen years ago.

287
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,041
His specialty was
genetic cures.

288
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,833
Bacterial research and
genetic cures-- some combo...

289
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,375
What about this modeling
agency Shinsen was with?

290
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,166
Gotokuji Promotions...?

291
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,041
The president vanished
fifteen years ago

292
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,500
and the company
went under...

293
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,750
That's funny.

294
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,291
All this crap happened
fifteen years ago...!

295
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,208
Hey, this wouldn't
have anything to do

296
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,458
with that club you were
lookin' into, would it...?

297
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,750
Saiga, you there--?

298
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,416
One of them exited
the car at this spot...

299
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,166
and headed
for the station.

300
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,916
The doctor.

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,208
And then... Saiga and the
Goddess went this way.

302
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,708
You sure
about that boss?

303
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,083
Every passing day Miss Kagura's
scent grows more pungent...

304
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,583
It's obviously been several days
since the Goddess's last bath.

305
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,375
This feels great...

306
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,708
It's like
I've been reborn.

307
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,250
Yeah...

308
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,833
You know, I read
in a book one time...

309
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,375
When large birds
like that mate,

310
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,083
they choose
one partner for life.

311
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,333
It's a nice thought, isn't
it...? Seems pure, somehow...

312
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,583
The way
nature intended.

313
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,375
That song...

314
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,333
I picked it up from
a guy, long time ago.

315
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,666
I think I remember...

316
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,291
hearing that
somewhere before.

317
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,666
They've left Izu
and are headed west.

318
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,625
West huh...?

319
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,416
Interesting...
The man's no fool.

320
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,375
It appears he's
taking her to Nagano.

321
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,458
Nagano?

322
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,333
We've wasted too
much time on this...

323
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,125
I'm ready to see
results...

324
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,958
I think I'll go
out there myself.

325
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,791
In your condition...?

326
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,291
What do you think
you can accomplish?

327
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,000
My injuries aren't
so severe...

328
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:51,000
I need to see this through,
Miss Tennozu, as a man...

329
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,833
But true to my word...

330
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,916
once everything has been settled
and the club has reopened,

331
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,750
my body will be happily at
your disposal once again...

332
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,125
Just so we're clear, you're
going to bring Kagura home

333
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,833
and remain my
personal plaything?

334
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,541
Of course.

335
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,000
So be it...

336
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,083
But before you
go chasing her...

337
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,291
I'd like some reassurances
that I'm the one

338
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,500
you'd rather get
your hands on.

339
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,375
How does your left hand
always please me so?

340
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,625
I swear, I'm tellin'
ya the truth...!

341
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,250
This sparkly, naked
broad comes in,

342
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,541
slicing everything she
can reach into pieces...!

343
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,291
And then this bartender
with the camera

344
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,041
and this really cute girl
who was up on stage singin'

345
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,333
some church song...

346
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,666
They ran off together
hand in hand.

347
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,041
You sure that's what you
saw you pathetic lush?!

348
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,458
Yeah... That bitch was
some kinda monster...

349
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,125
She broke my last bottle.

350
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,041
Damn you, Saiga...

351
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,291
Running around
with some girl...

352
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,958
Looks delicious!

353
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,041
Not too shabby is it...?

354
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,541
To good health...

355
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,833
Cheers!

356
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,000
You know...

357
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,333
I'm really glad I got
to talk to that lady

358
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,791
and hear about my
mother's past...

359
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,666
To think there was a time
when she loved someone enough

360
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,250
to consider
eloping with him.

361
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,416
You see... I've always been told
I was conceived for money,

362
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,208
a pact my mother made
to get her fortune...

363
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,416
I knew she never
loved my father...

364
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,666
There wasn't much
to love about him.

365
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,750
I thought that was why my
mom always looked at me

366
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,125
with so much hatred
in her eyes...

367
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,916
But don't you think
I look an awful lot

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,791
like that man
in the picture?

369
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,083
I hope so.

370
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,291
I want to be the daughter

371
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,000
that she had with the
man she once loved.

372
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,083
I like the sound of that.

373
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,541
I think you're right, kid...

374
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,333
Your mother still thinks
about that man a lot.

375
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,125
Each year, her child grew
to look more and more

376
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,666
like the lover who
deserted her...

377
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,125
And she couldn't
deal with that.

378
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,583
'Kay, so... How much you
suckers wanna bet...

379
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,291
that lucky bastard's bangin'
divine pussy right now?

380
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,791
Shows how much you know...

381
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,583
That's never going
to happen with them.

382
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,958
Why not?

383
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,666
Quite simply, a Euphoric needs
something very different

384
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,291
to get off.

385
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,333
If only I could...

386
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,291
Temptation lurks
around every corner.

387
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,083
The desire to do that
which we know is wrong.

388
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,583
Sometimes the fruit
of vice can be tempting,

389
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,333
but the cost -
innocence - too high.

390
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,291
Large sums of money
and giant wings unfurl.
