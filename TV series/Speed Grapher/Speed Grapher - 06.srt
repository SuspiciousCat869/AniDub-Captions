1
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,041
All right, baby!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

2
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,000
Take it off!

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,916
She's so beautiful...

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,750
You didn't tell me
you had friends like her.

5
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,541
Hey, over here, doll!

6
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,333
First drink's on me!

7
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,208
Shit!

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,166
Is this...
part of the show?

9
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,541
Step off my runway,
you bitch!

10
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,666
You dress up nice,
but your jaw line's a giveaway--

11
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,333
should I slim
it down for you?

12
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,208
Now...
Let's go, Goddess.

13
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,041
Smile.

14
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,875
Make sure you
catch my good side.

15
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,666
Go to hell.

16
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,958
What was that?

17
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,833
Some kind of explosive...

18
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,166
It didn't focus...

19
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
What a pity..

20
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:17,958
Simon! You filthy whore...!
Get out of here!

21
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,833
You're gonna have to pay
for all these damages!

22
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,333
You won't get off just 'cause
you're a freak! Ta!ke that

23
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,125
Damn you! I've got somethin'
else you can suck on!

24
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,166
Saiga!

25
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,416
Go, Simon! We'll keep her
in here as long as we can.

26
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,583
But she'll hurt you.

27
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,625
Leave it to us--
you're our sister now.

28
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,250
Get out of here.

29
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,416
And find your happiness.

30
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,458
But--

31
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,666
No time to argue
about it now, honey.

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,166
Thanks.

33
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,666
There they are!

34
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,041
You can't interfere with
their dreams, you cocks!

35
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,125
You'll have to go
through us first!

36
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,875
Your funeral!!

37
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,166
Either shut your trap
or leave in a zippered bag.!

38
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,791
This is a private
establishment!

39
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,375
You won't get
away with this--

40
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,166
Permission to
carve the faces off

41
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,083
these ugly
vaudevillians, sir?

42
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,208
We don't have time
for a clean up crew...

43
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,541
Forget them--
go after the girl.

44
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,666
You're a freak show.

45
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,041
Find a mirror.

46
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,041
David!

47
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,041
Are you okay?

48
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,833
Come on out, Kagura,
we know you're in here.

49
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,375
I'd better be paid
extra for this.

50
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,750
Ah, hell.

51
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,333
We got a problem here...

52
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,416
This stupid dive shares its
crapper with the club next door.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,125
All right, patrons,
time to hustle-hustle...!

54
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,125
Don't forget
our specials tonight!

55
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,791
500-yen longnecks,
800-yen sake--

56
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,958
warm or cold!

57
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,916
Saiga, what is this place?

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,208
The edge of Hell.
Just close your eyes.

59
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,875
Oh, sorry.

60
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,833
Damn!

61
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,416
Hey! It's them! Come on!

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,666
Let's go! Don't lose 'em!

63
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,208
It's over, camera man!

64
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,541
No use running!

65
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,666
Ah, shit.

66
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,250
We're gonna
cut your throat!

67
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,708
Saiga...
How are you doing that?

68
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,791
I'll tell you just as soon
as I find out... Come on.

69
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,000
This what you wanted?

70
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,875
Thank you.

71
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,666
Hey, man,
nice bike.

72
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,458
Hey!

73
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,833
Wait a minute, what do
you think you're doing?

74
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,833
Sorry, need to borrow it--
though I'm not sure

75
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,833
I'll be able to bring it
back in one piece.

76
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,666
Wait, damn it! Thief!!

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,708
There they go...

78
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,625
Bring the cars
around, now.

79
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,875
Hold on tight.

80
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,333
Okay.

81
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,916
Madam.

82
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,333
Hit Kagura
and we're all dead.

83
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,083
Jesus, I know that!

84
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,625
No you idiot...! Shoot
the cars around them...!

85
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,416
Block the road ahead
so they can't get away--

86
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
we need her alive!

87
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,291
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,208
What the
fuck're you doing?

89
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,166
Just shut up
and drive!

90
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,375
Kagura has used
her talents on you...

91
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,750
She has awoken
your potential,

92
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,083
and turned your deepest
desire into reality.

93
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,208
Yes, like you,
I've had the pleasure

94
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,250
of the Goddess' blessing.

95
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,291
That gun of yours--
let me see it.

96
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,958
You heard me--
I said give me your gun!

97
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,291
Yes, madam.

98
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,083
Thank you.

99
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,250
You just took out
two of our guys!

100
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,708
Keep driving...!

101
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,666
We'll just have to go
after the Goddess alone now...

102
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,375
Or do you object?

103
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,625
Damn it...! What is
Madam Koganei up to now??

104
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,958
Not sure,
just follow them!

105
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,041
Hey. I'm gonna
need you to hold

106
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,708
onto the throttle
for a minute.

107
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,666
What?

108
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,583
Hey...
You okay?

109
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,333
Ah, the beauty
of diamonds...

110
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,250
The hardest substance
in the natural world.

111
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,750
You're of no use to me...

112
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,166
Let me put you out
of your misery.

113
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,833
No!

114
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,291
I'll go back with you!

115
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,291
Whatever you want!

116
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,166
Please,
I'm begging you!

117
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,208
Just don't hurt
Mr. aiga anymore!

118
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,083
No. That's
not the deal...

119
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,833
I... I promised ...

120
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,750
I'd make you free.

121
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,041
But Saiga... you...

122
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,250
Stop! Just
take me and go!

123
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,791
You're gonna kill him!

124
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,333
Relax. Euphorics
don't die so easily.

125
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,500
Hey...
You guys need help?

126
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,458
What are you?

127
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,750
An... Alien!

128
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,041
My, young man.

129
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,333
Is that any way to
speak to a lady?

130
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,958
Now, what do you say
you give us a lift?

131
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,125
Saiga...

132
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,875
I'm sure the
upstanding gentlemen

133
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,208
who hired me will take
good care of him.

134
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,750
No...

135
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,916
If we lose Kagura because
of that damn woman,

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,166
she's really gonna pay.

137
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,208
Look, isn't that
the car she was in?

138
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,916
And the bike, too.

139
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,333
They're gone!

140
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,666
Wake up, pinprick...! What's
the story-- where'd they go??

141
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,291
Hands up.

142
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,666
This camera may not work
on "Diamond Lil",

143
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,875
but it sure as hell
can do a number on you.

144
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,875
What happened to Kagura?

145
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,625
Your hired gun has her.

146
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,666
What?

147
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,041
That shifty whore...

148
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,750
Where did she take her?

149
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,750
We're in the dark
here, same as you.

150
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,208
Answer it.

151
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,541
Yes...?

152
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,625
Madam??

153
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,833
What are you trying
to pull here...?

154
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
This was not in the plan!

155
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,250
I've decided the plan
needed adjustment.

156
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,666
Merely erasing my debts is
not sufficient recompense.

157
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,083
I want diamonds.
Crates of them.

158
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,666
Surely an additional
five billion ...

159
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,125
or let's say...

160
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,458
ten billion yen is a fair
price for her safe return.

161
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,750
You do understand what sort
of waters you're stirring,

162
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,333
Madam Koganei?

163
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,708
Yes, I heard you.

164
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,208
As you wish...

165
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,958
Damn it, she won't
back off her demands--

166
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,375
she's betraying the club.

167
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,458
You're lying to me.

168
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,000
Believe what you want.

169
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,958
But it won't change a thing.

170
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,625
And what about Kagura?

171
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,416
We'll make the exchange
at the madam's house.

172
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,166
Oh? And where's that?

173
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,833
Kaoru Koganei.

174
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,583
She's an entry
in my car's GPS.

175
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,875
Rat bastard!

176
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
Sure that's wise?

177
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,583
Letting him go like that??

178
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,041
We've paired a Euphoric
against a Euphoric...

179
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,875
Both are powerful, and
both are the enemy now...

180
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,541
Whoever dies, it'll
make our work easier.

181
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,125
You know, that woman's reminding
me of my mother more and more.

182
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,208
She walked out
on me, too.

183
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,125
My apologies, Mister Suitengu,
but my options are limited.

184
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,375
Matters have
gotten out of hand.

185
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,500
Say no more.

186
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,291
I've fallen a bit
out of shape lately--

187
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,291
I could use the exercise.

188
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,166
Feigning injury
has grown tiresome, anyway.

189
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,166
Just...
Hang in there...

190
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,208
Sorry, we're
closed for the day.

191
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,500
Hey, Pops, I need you to put
something together for me.

192
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,916
Oh, Saiga,
you look like hell.

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,708
Yeah, thanks.
You too...

194
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,583
Ya got any grub
'round here...?

195
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,583
I had to give
blood today.

196
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,333
You poor thing,
you really must move on.

197
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,791
Those henchmen from
the Club have no doubt

198
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,791
taken care
of him by now.

199
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,708
You're wrong...

200
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,375
Saiga survived,
I'm sure of it...

201
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,000
He did.

202
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,916
What a pathetically
naïve girl you are...

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,625
Is that what gives you
your power, Goddess--

204
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,625
living in a
fairy-tale world?

205
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,000
It isn't make-believe!

206
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,125
Saiga is alive, and he's
gonna come rescue me!

207
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,958
Everything's going
to be all right...

208
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,541
Men exist to make
women sparkle--

209
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,500
that is their purpose...

210
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,916
They're meant to give
up their lives for us--

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,041
it's how they
show their love.

212
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,125
That isn't true!

213
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,833
It's time you understood...

214
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,208
A woman's worth is judged by how
much a man will spend on her...

215
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,041
And you are a highly
valued girl...

216
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,958
Just as I was.

217
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,916
My husband knew the rules...

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,708
He showed his devotion
by giving me diamonds...

219
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,166
Then this mansion,
and finally, his life.

220
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,166
He was an accomplished artist,
and a tortured soul...

221
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,583
He sold everything
he created,

222
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,541
to pay for the diamonds
that would make me smile...

223
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,791
And when he still didn't feel
that was enough for me,

224
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,833
he took out an insurance
policy and hanged himself.

225
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,375
So, I really don't
have a choice.

226
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:59,125
It's my duty to hunger
for these jewels.

227
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,500
As a woman, it's the only
dignified way to respond...

228
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,166
I must consume and consume,

229
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,250
until my body is a shining
tribute to his love.

230
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:28,583
I think you should
feel really awful.

231
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,333
Your husband may have thought
he was dying for love...

232
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,500
But wasn't it your own greed
that made him do it...?

233
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,291
Obviously he was willing
to do anything for your sake...

234
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,625
Why didn't you tell him

235
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,708
that diamonds weren't
as important as he was...?

236
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,416
Why didn't he realize you
can't buy somebody's heart?

237
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,791
For a child so young,

238
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,333
you certainly act like
you have all the answers...

239
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,833
It's easy for you
to say money doesn't matter--

240
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,250
you've had the world
at your fingertips

241
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,708
since you could crawl.

242
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,625
It's true,
my mother is powerful,

243
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,791
and I've been privileged
my entire life...

244
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,333
But that's how
I know I'm right,

245
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,750
'cause I've had all those things
and I'm still not happy...!

246
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,041
There has to be something more
valuable in this life than money

247
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,291
or big mansions
or stupid stones!

248
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,291
There isn't.

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,583
You can talk all you want
of your high ideals...

250
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,375
But the truth is diamonds
have never betrayed me.

251
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,666
And as a matter
of fact, Goddess...

252
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,208
You're the one who revealed
that to me, remember?

253
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,416
That forbidden essence...

254
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,083
Which courses
through your body...

255
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,208
Then to us from your lips.

256
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,666
No...!

257
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,916
Saiga, please!

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,625
Save me...

259
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,666
You don't belong to that
photographer anymore, my jewel..

260
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,666
You belong to me.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,958
What a pathetic tactic...

262
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,875
Who's there?

263
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,041
I knew it!

264
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,666
Well well...
You did survive...

265
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,458
So persistent...

266
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,833
But what's your plan
of action, photographer?

267
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,166
I have my claws
at the Goddess' throat.

268
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,416
And she breaks
much easier than I.

269
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,416
That's true enough...

270
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,916
But she's your meal ticket...

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
to your favorite feast,

272
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,916
worthless with a hole
in her neck...

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,875
You won't risk
hurting her now.

274
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,000
So here's my best offer...

275
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,208
Set her free,
and in exchange

276
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,500
I'll let you sell me
to them instead.

277
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,333
Saiga, no!

278
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,375
That's a ridiculous offer...

279
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,833
I could fetch more
with a glass marble

280
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,333
than I could with you.

281
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,791
You honestly thought
that would work?

282
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,250
I pity you...

283
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,125
Love can make us
all so foolish--

284
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,875
he must really
like you a lot.

285
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,708
Drop the camera and move forward
slowly, or I will hurt her..

286
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,458
He's defenseless now.

287
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,166
Don't do this...

288
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,791
Kagura, run!

289
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,833
Damn you!!

290
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,291
How dare you...?!

291
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,083
What is this shit...?

292
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,000
Focus points.

293
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,958
She's broken...

294
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,750
You sure you're okay?

295
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm fine.

296
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,875
Then let's be happy
with that.

297
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,083
I need more diamonds...

298
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,666
I'm sorry about my mistake--

299
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,166
please-- I'll do anything
you want for them!

300
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,333
Madam Koganei...

301
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,166
You played a risky hand,
but now it's time to collect.

302
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,166
No!!

303
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,541
Ah, I got her!

304
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,625
No.

305
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,958
I told you I'd
take care of it.

306
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,708
Madam...

307
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,166
Please help me...
I'll repay you!

308
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,083
You know a clouded
diamond has no value.

309
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,000
Gather the pieces,
and sell them off.

310
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,458
We have to profit
from her somehow...

311
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,291
What's wrong?

312
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,291
It's me...

313
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,041
I'm the reason
you got like this.

314
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,125
You, and that woman, and
the man in the rubber suit.

315
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,291
I made it happen
somehow, didn't I?

316
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,708
I feel guilty, but
that's not all.

317
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,250
I'm so afraid
of myself...

318
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,166
I don't understand
what I am...

319
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,416
What exactly are we,

320
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,791
and what will be the fate
of the girl in the center peg?

321
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,291
It's in those
moments of quiet

322
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,625
that the question
becomes a scream.

323
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,625
But there's little time
for theories,

324
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,416
with more than one doctor
in line for a full exam.
