1
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,416
That same nightmare again...

2
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,666
Eight-thirty five?

3
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,291
But I set the alarm
before I went to sleep.

4
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,250
Why on earth are you
still in bed, Kagura?

5
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
Did you oversleep again?

6
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,541
Sorry, Mother...

7
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,166
Good morning.

8
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,500
You had better get a move on,
or you'll be late for school...

9
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,958
And I'm sorry...
but you missed breakfast.

10
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,166
Yes, ma'am.

11
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,708
Where did it go?

12
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,208
What's the matter now?

13
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,708
My school uniform,
it's missing...

14
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,208
I know I hung it
here last night.

15
00:02:56,291 --> 00:03:00,000
Well clearly you didn't.
Maybe it was just a dream.

16
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,833
How'd it get there?

17
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,500
Hurry, Kagura. You don't
have time to dawdle.

18
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,208
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,541
Look at you,
running in the house...

20
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,208
What has happened
to your manners?

21
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,750
Young lady, you really should
develop better work habits,

22
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,666
like preparing for the day
before you go to bed at night.

23
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,958
Yes ma'am.

24
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,166
Have a good day.

25
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,958
Our sunshine emerges.
The day can begin.

26
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,166
Oh, good morning.

27
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,708
Good morning...
Is everything all right?

28
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,458
You look a little
under the weather.

29
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,166
Oh, she's perfectly
fine, Suitengu...

30
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,208
Silly girl just overslept
and missed breakfast.

31
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,666
You know how she
loves her sleep.

32
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,000
Good morning, Miss Tennozu,
good to see you...

33
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm sorry to hear
that, Kagura.

34
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,583
You should wake up earlier--
growing girls need to eat.

35
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,458
Pardon me, Kagura...
I've packed your lunch.

36
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,583
There's no need...

37
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,208
I've already prepared
a special lunch

38
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,708
for my daughter
on my own...

39
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,500
Here.

40
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,583
Thank you.

41
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,541
A loving mother's
home cooked meal.

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,666
Can't get any better
than that, can you?

43
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Good morning, Kagura.

44
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,833
Good morning.

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Ushigome...

46
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,958
Ma'am?

47
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,208
Why don't you take this
other lunch for yourself?

48
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,333
Grateful
as always, ma'am.

49
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,250
Kagura seems to be
trimming down a bit.

50
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,000
You think?
It's hard to believe.

51
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,083
She eats like a pig
whenever she gets the chance.

52
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,875
I think she's
a beautiful girl.

53
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,708
Takes after her mother.

54
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,916
She's disgusting,
is what she is.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,125
Shiny hair,
perfect skin.

56
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,000
And not even the
hint of a wrinkle...

57
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,583
It's like watching the canvas
of some master painter,

58
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,125
becoming more
beautiful every day.

59
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,250
It's enough to make
a mother sick...

60
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,625
I feel like she's gaining
what I'm losing, Suitengu...

61
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,958
Like she's a parasite,
absorbing my very essence.

62
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,708
That's simply untrue.

63
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,291
She's an unripe grape,
and you, a full-bodied wine.

64
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,750
You've always been
good at compliments.

65
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:44,083
What can I say, Miss Tennozu?
You're the woman of my dreams.

66
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:51,166
I do love to hear those
words fall from your mouth.

67
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,875
Yet you still insist we have
to wait to share our passion

68
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,583
with the world?

69
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,791
I'm beginning to think
you have other reasons.

70
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,416
Maybe you love
Kagura, instead?

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,875
Don't be silly.

72
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,958
It's not like I have
a Lolita complex.

73
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,833
I'm committed to upholding
my responsibility:

74
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,041
Taking care of all your...
smoke and mirrors...

75
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,625
And a relationship with you
would put me in the spotlight...

76
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,750
My dirty dealings could tarnish
the Tennozu Group's name.

77
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,458
We'll just have to wait until
your dream is realized, my love,

78
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,208
and Japan belongs to you.

79
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,250
While you're here,
Suitengu...

80
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,250
I understand the chief
cabinet secretary

81
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,833
is enjoying
your club very much.

82
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,250
An important gathering place
for important people...

83
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,458
Whatever you're doing...
you'd better keep it up.

84
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,750
Until next time,
Miss Tennozu.

85
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,375
Good morning,
Miss Tennozu.

86
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,125
Good morning,
Miss Tennozu.

87
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,833
Good morning,
Miss Tennozu.

88
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,375
Good morning,
Madam President.

89
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,875
So I've heard.

90
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,458
The Governor of Tokyo has been
waiting to speak with you.

91
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,666
Begging for campaign
money, no doubt.

92
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey, Kagura...

93
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,875
You're always eating
lunch by yourself--

94
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,666
Why don't you
join us for once?

95
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,958
Yeah right... I, for one,
would be interested to see

96
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,583
what kind of food the heir
to the Tennozu Group brings.

97
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,833
Stop it...

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,375
You see!

99
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,875
Yeah, I knew there was
something freakish about her!

100
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,583
No wait...
I can explain...

101
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,125
I-- Kagura?
Are you okay?

102
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,583
Are you feeling
any better, Kagura?

103
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,750
Miss Wakaba...

104
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,833
It's all right.
You don't have to get up.

105
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,208
You... have a mild
case of anemia.

106
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,125
Have you been
eating enough?

107
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,250
I'm your teacher,
I care about you--

108
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,625
I need you
to be honest.

109
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,208
The other girls say you
bring an empty lunch box

110
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,208
to school every day.

111
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,083
I... I'm on a diet,
that's all.

112
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,916
I know
that's not true.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,583
You're not the type
who would starve yourself,

114
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,875
even if there are
problems at home...

115
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,166
Now I want you
to eat this, okay?

116
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,208
Yes-- yes ma'am...
Thank you, Miss Wakaba...

117
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,875
Oh you poor thing...
I should've known...

118
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,666
Your stomach's
gotten so weak.

119
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,458
Maybe I shouldn't be asking,
Kagura, but I need to know...

120
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,791
Is your mother abusing you?
Is she not letting you eat?

121
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,083
I suspected as much...

122
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
That settles it,
I'll speak with her today...!

123
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,708
I don't care
how rich she is

124
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,166
or how important her business
dealings are to this city.

125
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,583
She has a
responsibility to you.

126
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,333
She's a horrible mother
for treating her own daughter

127
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,000
in this way.

128
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,541
And now, an update
on the murder

129
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,166
of former Health
Minister Nakano...

130
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,916
We're running out
of space here.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,291
Yeah, business
must be booming.

132
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,291
We'll need
another warehouse.

133
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,458
What the hell?

134
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,416
Lucky for you there's
still two-thirds intact...

135
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,416
If a single bill goes missing,
Suitengu will know.

136
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,333
You can guess
what happens then.

137
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,333
I'm sorry sir...
We'll kill every rat we see.

138
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,541
My philosophy exactly...

139
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,500
Oh, and there'll be one
more delivery today.

140
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,375
Shit!
I'm still short!

141
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,541
Gotta be some change
in here somewhere...

142
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,750
God damn... it...!
C'mon...!

143
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,333
Hey, Dad...

144
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,791
I need a soccer ball!
Buy me one!

145
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,208
Shut up...!

146
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,125
Can't you see I'm busy?!
Now get out!

147
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,541
Well give me some
money and I will!

148
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,166
Come on, everyone
else has one!

149
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,625
Your allowance--
Give it back!

150
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,500
I'll pay you
double next week!

151
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,666
Yeah right, I already
spent it, okay...!

152
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,875
Ah, this is why mom left,

153
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,500
'cause you're such
a freaking cheap-skate!

154
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,208
I don't have time
for this shit! Get out!

155
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,666
Come on, there's
gotta be something...

156
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,083
Gotcha!

157
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,125
Yes...
Payment in full...

158
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,875
We've counted
several times.

159
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,291
Mister Otsuka...

160
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,958
Your requital is three hundred
million, nothing less.

161
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,708
I'm telling you,
it's a mistake!

162
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,583
There must be something
wrong with the machine!

163
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,666
I counted--
I know I had it all!

164
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,458
Don't give us excuses...

165
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,208
There are no discounts
for membership fees--

166
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,458
you pay us in full!

167
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,250
If you cannot present
the full amount in cash

168
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,125
by this date and hour, you will
surrender all of your assets

169
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,916
to the Tennozu Group,
without exception.

170
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,458
That was our agreement,
Mister Otsuka,

171
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,125
which includes the proceeds
on your life insurance policy.

172
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,833
But I did have
enough, I swear!

173
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,250
C'mon. Let's go.

174
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,416
No...! Please,
just count it again!

175
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,833
Don't be a sore loser,
Mister Otsuka.

176
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,750
You had a hell
of a good time, pal.

177
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,250
No reason
to regret it now.

178
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,916
Don't worry about
changing your will.

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,291
We'll take care
of everything.

180
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,083
Wait, damn it!
Please!

181
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,666
This is a mistake!
Look, count it!

182
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,583
Count it! Just count it
one more time!

183
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,375
You bastards!
I swear!

184
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,875
I had enough!
I swear!

185
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,583
You were living
beyond your means,

186
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,333
trying to sit
at the big kids' table.

187
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,875
You've got no one
to blame but yourself.

188
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,291
No! Don't kill me,
please, I have a son!

189
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,291
Quit strugglin'.

190
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,333
Just think
of something pretty.

191
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,291
Hey kid...

192
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,083
A word of advice...

193
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,375
In this country, lives can be
bought and sold on a whim...

194
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,500
Should you deem it
necessary to take my life,

195
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,500
I suggest you make a lot of
money and come buy it from me.

196
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,916
I just got off the phone
with your mother, Kagura...

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,333
She's agreed to speak with me,
so I'll head over there now

198
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,708
and smooth things out
before you get home.

199
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,791
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,541
I'll demand
an explanation,

201
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,041
and let her know you
can't be treated like this.

202
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,833
Things are going to change
for you, I promise.

203
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,250
Excuse me?

204
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,666
I hate to ask,

205
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,916
but could I possibly borrow
some money from you?

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,750
Borrow some money, ma'am?

207
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,291
Yes sir... I'd like to buy
something to eat somewhere.

208
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,375
Sorry, no can do,
little lady.

209
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,208
I'm neither allowed to stop this
car nor to give you any money...

210
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,791
Your mother was quite specific
with her instructions.

211
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,166
Hello, I'm home.

212
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,791
Someone's
in my bedroom...

213
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,583
Miss... Wakaba?

214
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,416
Kagura...

215
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,208
I'm glad
we had this talk.

216
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,791
As promised,
you may leave here

217
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,083
with all the money
you can carry...

218
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,166
But your
clothes stay here.

219
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,166
Miss Wakaba, why?

220
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,833
Kagura, please,
pick that up for me.

221
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,083
Hurry, damn it!

222
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:47,125
Looks like
a busy afternoon.

223
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,791
I was tutoring her teacher...
A simple study in economics.

224
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,500
When you're at the top
everything has a price tag.

225
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,958
A valuable lesson.

226
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,583
Speaking of lessons, Kagura,

227
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,416
it's time for your
piano practice.

228
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I've come to take you
to your instructor's house.

229
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,958
Suitengu...

230
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,833
How is the little
girl in that photograph

231
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,833
able to smile like that?

232
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,125
Who knows... I don't often
ponder the well being

233
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,750
of third world
inhabitants.

234
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,708
Maybe she found
some bread.

235
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,375
She's poor, but in a way,
at least she's free.

236
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,416
Freedom,?

237
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,416
I never pegged you
as a romantic, Kagura...

238
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,208
But unfortunately, people must
pay for their freedom here,

239
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,833
and it usually comes rented
on a short-term lease...

240
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,958
With mortgages, taxes,
the cost of living,

241
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,666
the poor are never free.

242
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,750
They suffer with meager scraps
of money their whole lives,

243
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,125
miserable prisoners of a society
built to massage the rich.

244
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
That's what this
country is about.

245
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,708
If that's true, then
I want to escape!

246
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,625
To somewhere far away!

247
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,541
I'm scared
I'm losing my mind...!

248
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
I have these
terrible nightmares,

249
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,833
almost every night!

250
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,625
I'm so afraid!

251
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,750
They're only dreams, your mind's
way of confronting a world

252
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,583
that can be a truly
frightening place...

253
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,375
That's why you're being
given the finest academic

254
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,958
and cultural educations--
to rise above it--

255
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,583
to reach your potential and
succeed your mother one day.

256
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,708
Concentrate!

257
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,041
I'm sorry, sir...
It's just... that smell...

258
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,291
It's starting
to get to me.

259
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,375
Try it-- try it all again,
from the beginning.

260
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,250
Yes, sir.

261
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,083
I can't go on.

262
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,583
When I see those
hands of hers

263
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,083
I lose my patience!

264
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,458
How can I work like this?

265
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,708
I need new hands-- fresh,
beautiful, graceful hands!

266
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,083
You see?

267
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,125
My sweet Angel's arms
are already decaying!

268
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,958
Ugh. He could at least
try to preserve her.

269
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,416
Please forgive me,
Angel! Forgive me!

270
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,958
Don't worry, Maestro,
the Club is gathering tonight.

271
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,166
I assure you, you'll
have your new arms.

272
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,208
You mean it--
a new pair??

273
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,458
Yes...

274
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,000
We're holding a Divine
Ritual for the VIPs,

275
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,166
a few casualties are
always part of the bill.

276
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:07,250
Kagura... It's time for the
world to see the real you.

277
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,791
Who... am I...?

278
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,000
What... am I?

279
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,375
Kill!
Kill! Kill!

280
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,458
Kill! Kill!
Kill!

281
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,000
Can you help me...?

282
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,875
Take me away from
this terrible place...!

283
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,083
Please...!

284
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,416
What are you waiting for?

285
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,833
Take him away from the
Goddess, immediately!

286
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,166
Kagura, what
have you done...?

287
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,333
This vermin can't possibly
carry the Euphoria Factor.

288
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,416
Death to the intruder,
at once!

289
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,750
Without warning, I was
snatched from my hollow void ,

290
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,291
by a girl who gave me
power beyond imagination.

291
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:40,750
Now my bizarre fascination, once
hidden deep within my psyche,

292
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,041
is staring me straight
in the face.
