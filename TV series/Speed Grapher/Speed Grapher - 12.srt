1
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,666
My God. Hasn't she
gotten the hint yet?

2
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,166
Who is she?

3
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,708
Nobody. She came begging
for her debut one time,

4
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,250
so I had some
fun with her.

5
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,500
Let me guess-- you said you'd
put her on one of your shows

6
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,583
if she played
her cards right.

7
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,291
That girl would
believe anything.

8
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,000
But trust me,
she'll never be a star.

9
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,875
What? 'Cause she doesn't
have the right equipment

10
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,500
for your casting couch?

11
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,000
You're both fools.

12
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,583
That girl's a
diamond in the rough.

13
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,250
She just needs a
little polishing.

14
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,708
Tell me...

15
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,875
Are you the sort of person
willing to sell her soul

16
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,666
for a dream?

17
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,291
Her bone structure is
completely flawless...

18
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,125
It's a shame how
cruel nature can be--

19
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,291
All that's holding her back
are a few recessive genes.

20
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,500
Ask anyone in my field,

21
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,375
they'll tell you
my techniques are crazy.

22
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,250
But if you trust me,
we can help each other--

23
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,666
I'll work
my magic on you.

24
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,000
Twenty years,
can you believe it?

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,916
That's how long it's been
since I first met you...

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,916
If you hadn't come out in the
snow that day to see me...

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,541
I never would've
accomplished any of this.

28
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,541
You've been so much
more of a mother to me

29
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,291
than the woman
who bore me ever was.

30
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,083
The moment I laid
eyes on that girl,

31
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,875
I knew her potential...

32
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,750
I could see everything
she was capable of...

33
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,041
That if she could find the
resolve, she'd shoot to the top.

34
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,708
She could have
done so much.

35
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,083
That child did go
to the top.

36
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,250
Where do you think
we are now?

37
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,916
But that child,
she betrayed me!

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,166
After I gave her more
than a mother ever would!

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,000
What do you mean
Shinsen's gone?

40
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,666
She isn't at home, either.

41
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,625
We've also tried her favorite
shops, and restaurants...

42
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,625
We only took our eyes
off her for a minute!

43
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,416
This was the last day
we had for shooting...!

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,458
How the hell do you plan
to deal with this??

45
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,541
She's my responsibility
I'll bring her back...

46
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,416
Search every nook and
cranny-- understood??

47
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,458
Damn you girl...

48
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,583
You probably ran away to
be with that man again...

49
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,000
President...

50
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,416
How could she?

51
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,833
How could she betray
me after everything?

52
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,750
Look what she did!

53
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,541
President...
That day I lost it all...

54
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,625
Everything that was precious
to me was plucked away...

55
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,500
And I knew I would
never get it back...

56
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,625
Even if I got all
the way up here...

57
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,166
So I tell myself that was
the curse that went along

58
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,333
with the Doctor's magic.

59
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,375
Um...

60
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,750
Will you please take me outside
so I can get some air...?

61
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,000
I feel so claustrophobic
in here...

62
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:15,458
I can't tell if it's
day or night anymore..

63
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,583
If--

64
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,666
if you want to touch me,
I won't complain.

65
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,875
Okay that's enough,
I don't want to get caught...

66
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,791
What are you doing?

67
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,625
Hey... That's real
dangerous--just put it down...

68
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,791
Come any closer and
I'll kill myself, I swear!

69
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,625
Okay please, don't do it...

70
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,791
You're too important--

71
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,041
They'd kill me if
anything happened to you!

72
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,166
All right... Then you're
gonna have to do what I say.

73
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,875
What the hell is
that fool doing?

74
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,666
Darling...
May I interrupt?

75
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,291
Hello ma'am,
my name is Ichinohashi,

76
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,833
with the Family Registration
System at City Hall...

77
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,666
I've come with your
marriage application form.

78
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,291
As you can see,
we work around the clock...

79
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,000
I've waited so
long for this...

80
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,625
I can't find the words.

81
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,791
Mister Suitengu...

82
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm very sorry
to interrupt...

83
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,750
But I think you
should hear this...

84
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,291
Forgive me.
The world calls.

85
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,208
I have no doubt she'll
try to come here first...

86
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,708
Establish a perimeter
with your men...

87
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,750
Do not let Shinsen see her.

88
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,208
This is how you welcome
guests into your home?

89
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,708
A bit unorthodox, Captain.

90
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,500
I had a feeling they'd
send somebody here..

91
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,166
Don't be too flattered.

92
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,583
Your boyfriend's the one
I'm really here to see.

93
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,083
Then you'll leave
disappointed.

94
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,333
'Cause where he is,
you'll never find him...

95
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,375
Now we're gonna
go to headquarters,

96
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,041
where you can tell me all about
your little midnight mission...

97
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,125
Get on your feet,
nice and slow.

98
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,833
It's warm in here...

99
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,916
You Have any objections
if I lose my coat?

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,708
It'll be just one less layer
for the bullet to go through

101
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,041
if you try anything dumb.

102
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,208
Now turn around, and put
your hands on the wall.

103
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,666
What the fuck?

104
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,666
We took it very personally when
you damaged our skin, Captain.

105
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:18,541
I'm so looking forward to
our next encounter, Captain!

106
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,541
Damn...
I'm losing my mind.

107
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,625
By the way, what happened
to our usual host?

108
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,458
The smell of wild animals
makes him a little nuts...

109
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,208
'Sides he's a busy man...

110
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,125
There's a lot
going on tonight.

111
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,791
Careful with this
stuff, gentlemen..

112
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,083
One shot can take
down an elephant.

113
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,083
An elephant, eh...? Sounds
like one hell of an night--

114
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,041
I'd like to try one
of those next time.

115
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,625
I'll pass it on.

116
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,375
Our young man is
putting on quite a show...

117
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,708
That took some real balls
getting rid of Taizo Senri

118
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,791
in this climate...

119
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,708
Is he seriously
trying to take hold

120
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,541
of the Tennozu Group's
reins so early?

121
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,833
I'll sure watch him try.

122
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,833
Don't you think it's a little
dangerous trying to tame him?

123
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,291
I doubt he'll strike against us,
and it's well worth the risk.

124
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,916
He's promised us
a ridiculous portion

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,458
of the Tennozu Group's stock.

126
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,625
He's ambitious,

127
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
but in business
he's still an amateur,

128
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,208
and we can take
advantage of that.

129
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,250
Sure, our party can
profit off him now,

130
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,041
but what about the future?

131
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,666
I'll take the first shot.

132
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,250
Damn. That recoil is a lot
fiercer than I expected.

133
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,833
As far as our
boy's concerned,

134
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,583
we've elected to turn a
blind eye for the time being.

135
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,083
And does the Prime Minister
know about this choice?

136
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,625
Actually, that one was
a Cabinet decision...

137
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,958
But if he turns on us, we'll
take care of him swiftly.

138
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,208
And that decree?

139
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,250
A Cabinet decision as well.

140
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,875
Exquisitely handled...

141
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,125
We've just got to try
the elephant next time.

142
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,416
Couldn't agree
with you more.

143
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,458
Don't stop,
just keep going.

144
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,708
Miss Kagura is
on the premises.

145
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,250
Yeah, I'm on it.

146
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,708
Where the hell
is she, maggot?

147
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,000
She got out before
I reached the lift--

148
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,583
she said to keep going!

149
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,708
Damn. She must've
taken the elevator.

150
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,958
Mother!

151
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,250
Mother,
where are you??

152
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,750
Let's move! She's gotta be
in the mansion already!

153
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,791
A hidden doorway?
What is this?

154
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,833
Shinsen... Shinsen,
is that you?

155
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,916
Don't we
need witnesses?

156
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,125
I can certainly be one of
them madam-- that is my job.

157
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,958
And the second witness
we can simply make up--

158
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,208
I doubt the
city will care.

159
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:05,000
That's not very
romantic, now is it?

160
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,500
Suitengu, darling...

161
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,666
Before I sign this,
I have a confession--

162
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,916
there's someone
I've kept secret from you.

163
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,416
I'd like her to
be our witness.

164
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,291
Don't worry,
I'll be right back.

165
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,250
Hello?

166
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,125
Shinsen!

167
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,750
Oh Shinsen...!
It is you!

168
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,458
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

169
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,875
A secret passage...

170
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,166
We're finding
all sorts of things

171
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,000
that shouldn't be
here tonight.

172
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,416
Fucking pest...
You gotta stop running.

173
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,625
You're making us
work way too hard--

174
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,708
So tell me my bride to be--
who am I going to meet?

175
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,041
I'm ah, sorry, boss.

176
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,333
I heard about your plans
to marry my mother...

177
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,125
I came here to stop you.

178
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,541
You poor girl, your
nightmares have returned...

179
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,083
You're supposed to be
undergoing treatment for that.

180
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,458
Mother please,
listen to me,

181
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,583
I've seen this man
do terrible things!

182
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,083
He hurts people, and he's
just using you I know it!

183
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,791
Please believe me--
don't marry him!

184
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,291
I'd like you to take a test
to help warm my cold feet.

185
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,166
My beautiful lady
you offend me--

186
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,750
please don't tell me you
believe your daughter's lies--

187
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,083
you know how
unbalanced she's been.

188
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,333
The cylinder
of this revolver

189
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,666
has been loaded
with four bullets.

190
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,708
Suitengu...

191
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,583
Kagura...

192
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,916
I'd like you to settle
this dispute yourselves.

193
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,083
Wha-- with a gun??

194
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,958
I've had a feeling
that you and Suitengu

195
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,833
were plotting something
behind my back...

196
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,250
And now, your mere presence
here today confirms it.

197
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,250
That isn't true!

198
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,291
Shut your mouth!

199
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,833
You ungrateful,
thieving succubus...!

200
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,041
Deceiving him with your
perky little breasts

201
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,750
and your perfect skin!

202
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,166
So you're only giving us a
one-in-three chance of survival

203
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,208
with every pull
of the trigger...

204
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,625
Not the most generous
of odds, my love.

205
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,541
I feel it's more than a fair
price for my forgiveness.

206
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,708
My dear Miss Tennozu...

207
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,583
I'd rather not kill you
if I can at all avoid it.

208
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,250
It would make my plans
so needlessly complex.

209
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,666
Won't you just
follow the script?

210
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,083
After all
your flowery words,

211
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,291
you finally show
your true colors...

212
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,541
Go ahead and shoot
if you can manage it.

213
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,750
You leave me
little choice.

214
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,625
You poor blind fool.

215
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,875
This test was my
final act of charity--

216
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,625
and you've failed.

217
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,250
I suppose I should
have known better than

218
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,708
to ever trust
anyone again...

219
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,708
Ever since that night...

220
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,625
The night
he didn't show up.

221
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,083
You Kagura...

222
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,916
You're no more than cruel
proof of the bastard's betrayal!

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,958
Mother, please...

224
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,416
And you,
Mister Suitengu...

225
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,250
A pale imitation--
a surrogate for my love.

226
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,791
No I assure you, Madam.

227
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm an original.

228
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,708
Please believe me...!

229
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,916
I never betrayed you Mother,
I came here to warn you!

230
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,625
That's enough!

231
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,416
I've said my piece.

232
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,583
Go ahead ladies,
fill them full of holes.

233
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,250
Mother, please!

234
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,500
You should
close your eyes.

235
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,458
Please, I'm just
a city clerk...

236
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,000
President...

237
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,625
Let's go away somewhere,
and lead quiet, peaceful lives.

238
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,458
Shinsen...

239
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,250
Oh god...
President!

240
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,708
Suitengu?

241
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,458
You should be dead...
not her...

242
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,791
Mother, run!

243
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,291
He's one of them--
he's a monster!

244
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,041
What an interesting
surprise ...

245
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,875
I had no idea
she was still alive.

246
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
So you know
my big secret...

247
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,375
You've known
it all along...

248
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,666
Of course.

249
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
You're the work of
Ms. Gotokuji and the doctor

250
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,041
who fathered your child.

251
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,416
Your body
is a fabrication.

252
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,916
Or no... "Reconstruction"
would be a better word.

253
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,583
Who are you-- really?

254
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,000
I am just a vessel.

255
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,333
Flesh that inherited
the powers of God

256
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,250
from the man
you loved most.

257
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,708
That birthmark...

258
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,500
You should have
been happy with me.

259
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,125
In all the time
we shared,

260
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,208
you were always in the left
arm of the man you loved.

261
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,583
Let her go!

262
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,916
Mother, no!

263
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,166
Listen to me...
You were wrong...

264
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,833
That night fifteen years ago,
my father did come for you,

265
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,916
he was just late!

266
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,083
He got there right
after you left!

267
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,791
The owners told me!

268
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,500
Father never deserted you!
He loved you!

269
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,458
Mother no--
you can't leave me now--

270
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,833
if you go away
I'll be all alone!

271
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,708
Fuck...

272
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,958
Well I take it this
means the wedding's off.

273
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,375
No... Just a
small change in cast.

274
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,875
With Shinsen gone, all
the Tennozu Group's assets

275
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,416
go to her daughter...

276
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,541
There will be a
marriage tonight...

277
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,375
And Kagura
will be my bride.

278
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,291
In Tokyo there's no shortage
of men willing to kill

279
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,708
for the yen.

280
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,500
And far too many know the
power of the Goddess' kiss.

281
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,875
As a woman with a gold
gun readies for battle,

282
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,791
an orphaned girl looks for
hope where there's none.
