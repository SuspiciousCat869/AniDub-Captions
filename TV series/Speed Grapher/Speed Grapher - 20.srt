1
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,583
Kagura...
You asshole...

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,000
What've you done
with Kagura?

3
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,333
What good will it do you
to know that, Mister Saiga?

4
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,166
You'll never see
the Goddess's smile again.

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,291
You're just like the rest of
Suitengu's little lap dogs...

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,125
I'll fuckin'
kill you, too.

7
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,541
Vulgar Suitengu.

8
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,916
He was the conductor's baton
that started the march.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,250
But we have our
own momentum now.

10
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,000
Matters have evolved far
beyond crude solo acts.

11
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,833
What the hell
does that mean?

12
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,666
Nothing a trivial man like you
should concern himself with.

13
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,791
Joe...

14
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,833
And now the music
I promised.

15
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,791
The song of parting.

16
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,583
Think of the Goddess...

17
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,041
and die!

18
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,583
This is it!
The perfect feeling!

19
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,375
The heightened senses!
The vibration!

20
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,166
Damn...

21
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,708
I can feel it!

22
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,791
Your soul
is vibrating too!

23
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,333
Don't leave yet,
there's still more!

24
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,125
That was
just the overture.

25
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,208
Now comes
the good part!

26
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,083
Vibrations, huh?

27
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,083
That's what
emotions are.

28
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,708
Tangible pulsing,
shaking your bones!

29
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,291
Fear! Fury!

30
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,291
Sorrow! Joy!

31
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,041
And by creating vibrations,
humans can express themselves!

32
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,458
So let's have it!
You and I!

33
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,958
A session of souls!

34
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,958
You can't
run from me.

35
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,583
There's still more!

36
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,833
This is it,
Saiga!

37
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,958
Do you feel
it pulsing?

38
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,000
The ultimate sensation
of sight and sound!

39
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,458
Damn it.
My eyes!

40
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,125
Saiga is in there,
isn't he?

41
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,791
Hey, wait!
Come back!

42
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,916
Ah, fuck.

43
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,958
They can't be...!

44
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:47,958
Toda!

45
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,958
Sakuragi!

46
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,000
Oizumi!

47
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,250
Come on... Joe!

48
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,916
Hang in there, kid...!
You can't be dead...!

49
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,375
You're just
a damn kid...!

50
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,166
Joe! Joe!!

51
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,875
Saiga...!

52
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,958
He's gone.

53
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,000
What the fuck
happened here?

54
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,208
This city is falling apart and
you cops haven't done shit...!

55
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,500
So we took matters
into our own hands...!

56
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,083
They were respectable men and
women, pillars of the community,

57
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,500
sacrificing to fight
the vultures

58
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,958
who are preying
on this country!

59
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,958
And this
is the result?

60
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,166
This is some
sort of list.

61
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,875
The Prime Minister's
name is on it,

62
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,083
along with most
of his cabinet members.

63
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,958
It's probably the
club membership list

64
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,541
that Joe had been
talking about.

65
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,166
Club? You mean the one
Suitengu's been running?

66
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,708
That's right...

67
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,541
We were gonna present it at
the next legislative assembly

68
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,208
and cause a shitstorm
that not even

69
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,583
the ball-less mass media
could dance around...

70
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,083
But now...

71
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,250
Hell, I can't believe
they're all dead!

72
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,791
Oh, god!

73
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,458
They were
Japan's last hope...

74
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,708
That fucker!

75
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,250
Hey, wait!

76
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,458
Come on.
Don't quit on me yet.

77
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,250
Good morning,
citizens!

78
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,583
This is your incumbent
representative to Parliament,

79
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,458
Seiji Ochiai!

80
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,375
I want to thank you all for your
years of enthusiastic support!

81
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,625
You know election
day is approaching,

82
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,750
so I've come out
to make a final bid

83
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,041
for your endorsement
at the polls...

84
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:43,041
If re-elected, I promise to see
the pseudo-intellectuals,

85
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,083
pseudo-journalists,
pseudo-feminists,

86
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,125
and all other
public enemies,

87
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,541
purged from our
beautiful streets!

88
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,541
I will work to build a new,
stronger nation,

89
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,375
dedicated to those
upstanding citizens

90
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,958
who are true hedonists.

91
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,541
Thank you,
thank you all very much!

92
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,125
Your stirring
cheers of support

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,791
will help build
the Japan of tomorrow!

94
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,708
I wish my opponent,

95
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,708
candidate Saiga,
the best of luck.

96
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,291
What's the
meaning of this?

97
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,458
Why are you treating me
like I'm one of them?

98
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,250
I demand to see
Ochiai immediately!

99
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,708
He said if I did my part,
I could have Kagura for my work!

100
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,541
Where the hell have
you taken us, anyway?

101
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,083
Professor Nishiya!

102
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,208
What kind of game
have you been playing...?

103
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,500
Were you lying to us...?
From the start?

104
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,125
Oh no...
That means Saiga...

105
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,750
Where are you
people taking us?

106
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,250
How could they
do this to me?

107
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,458
I was promised that I would have
both of them for my research!

108
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,416
He can't get
away with this...

109
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,125
I won't let him!

110
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,750
Hey!

111
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,333
Professor!

112
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,000
Stay where you are...
All of you!

113
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,666
This is
sulfuric acid...

114
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,666
If I spill this, it'll eat
the flesh right off her bones!

115
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,500
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

116
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,000
I won't be delayed
any longer!

117
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,833
I have to move forward
with my research!

118
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,750
None of you understand the
importance of this discovery!

119
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,958
I'm warning you!

120
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,458
Don't come
any closer!

121
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,708
Please! Stop!

122
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,250
You're better
than this, Nishiya!

123
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,458
Use your head!

124
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,833
There's no one
left to interfere.

125
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,166
Sulfuric acid was
a good bluff, wasn't it?

126
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,833
Want to know what
was really in there?

127
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,000
A culture of the virus
I extracted from Saiga.

128
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,750
I've just turned
myself into a carrier.

129
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,541
All I need now is to be
exposed to your bodily fluids.

130
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,000
Stop it...!
Just stay away from me!

131
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,166
I need to discover
for myself...

132
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,958
I know the virus changes
the body by reconfiguring DNA,

133
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,208
templating to
subconscious desires.

134
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,083
But what's the connection
between the virus

135
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,041
and the subconcious?

136
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,041
What?

137
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,041
No!

138
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,375
Just cooperate.

139
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,166
It's in the name
of science!

140
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,625
Get offa' me...!

141
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,458
No! Stop!

142
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,000
I have to see it work,
for the sake of my research!

143
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,458
We don't have
any choice...!

144
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,333
I need your catalyst to
activate the virus in me!

145
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,041
No!

146
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,250
I'm sacrificing too,
experimenting on myself...!

147
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,416
Now just give me powers
like you gave Saiga!

148
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
They'll probably manage
to break the door down soon,

149
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,708
but don't worry:

150
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,750
This should
only take a minute.

151
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,416
You might
even enjoy it!

152
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,666
No!!!

153
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,791
It's okay now, Kagura.
I've got you.

154
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,750
Don't touch me!
Get away!

155
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,833
Calm down, Kagura,
it's me.

156
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,125
Dr. yogoku...

157
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,750
You're okay now.

158
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,416
If you're smart you won't
give us any more trouble.

159
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,875
We'll be good.

160
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,416
Saiga...

161
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,625
Candidate Saiga
did his best,

162
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,791
but lost the election
in a landslide.

163
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,416
But don't be discouraged,
photographer.

164
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,916
You still have your
meaningless journalism career

165
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,250
to fall back on.

166
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,041
Pretty bold for a man who
got his start in the papers.

167
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,208
Ridiculous!
I'm Representative Ochiai!

168
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,958
Member of Parliament!
A man of import!

169
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,458
I'm no scum-sucking
media lapdog!

170
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,041
Journalists and
activists are useless.

171
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,166
What does a camera take?
Pictures, not action!

172
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,666
What did the White
Eagles accomplish?

173
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,708
Talk, not change!

174
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,333
They coulda done a lot
if you hadn't betrayed them.

175
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,875
I didn't betray.

176
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,333
I only led them
to their natural end.

177
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,791
See, when I joined Parliament,
I realized a vital truth.

178
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,583
Authority belongs to those
of us with the power

179
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,083
to shape history.

180
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,375
Those who oppose us are destined
to be crushed in our wake.

181
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,250
Journalists are
merely spectators,

182
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,541
describing the world
we create.

183
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,541
Sounds like fascist nonsense...
That's crap!

184
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,041
Oh, I assure you,
it is mankind's only truth...

185
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,375
The strong seize power and
earn the right to rule ...

186
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,750
While the weak simply
moan and take pictures.

187
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,416
Did your photographs
ever change the world?

188
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,250
Did they lessen the number
of struggles, and wars?

189
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,791
Through your lens,
you saw the world's pain.

190
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,583
Why didn't
you save them?

191
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,250
Lift a weapon, instead
of pressing the shutter?

192
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,958
I know why. You wanted to
capture that decisive moment!

193
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,000
You craved the fame--
the glory...!

194
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,291
And you called it
"journalism," "justice."

195
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,250
But in reality,
it was just a delusion.

196
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,666
No. You don't know
shit...! I...

197
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,750
That's not--

198
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
That's not who I am!

199
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,958
It's okay,
Mister Saiga...

200
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Take your petty,
self-serving pictures,

201
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,708
and claim it's
for a greater good.

202
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,083
The powerful...

203
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,875
The authority
of the nation

204
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,750
will protect your
freedom of the press.

205
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,333
We will preserve you
and your hypocrisy,

206
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:55,125
because freedom cannot
exist without authority.

207
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,833
Do you truly believe freedom
and civil rights exist

208
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,708
independent
of authority?

209
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,625
Look at the Goddess,
freedom incarnate.

210
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,958
Right now, the Prime Minister,
symbol of authority,

211
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,583
is keeping her safe.

212
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,416
Kagura...

213
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,916
Son of a bitch.

214
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,291
Now, now, photographer,
you mustn't run.

215
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,000
This is one of those epic
moments you love to exploit.

216
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,208
A train full
of commuters.

217
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,833
I wonder how many will
die because of you?

218
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,125
Oh no, you've
dropped your camera.

219
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,666
But that's the most
important part, isn't it?

220
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,958
Go on, pick it up,
take your pictures!

221
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,416
See what difference
they make!

222
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,250
You are going to die.

223
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,958
Amid the glory,
the praise... the hypocrisy.

224
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,333
I've taken pictures
of what I wanted...

225
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,000
Glory and praise had
nothing to do with it!

226
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,458
Nor did it matter that
your subjects were dying.

227
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,125
Or that
you're dying now!

228
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,708
Now you
listen to me!

229
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,541
Here's somethin' any good
war photographer knows...

230
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,208
"If your pictures
aren't good enough...

231
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,125
you're not
close enough."

232
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,083
Yes, Saiga,
I feel it!

233
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,500
Good vibrations!

234
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,625
Licadonia?

235
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,333
They'd been given asylum
in the Licadonian Embassy.

236
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,416
Unfortunately, it seems they've
since been moved elsewhere.

237
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,750
Ochiai's work.

238
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,958
I believe so.

239
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,291
I've tried
contacting him,

240
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,791
but his people say
he can't be reached.

241
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,833
So the old maverick has
finally made his move.

242
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,958
And the man gripping
his reigns...

243
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,625
Kamiya himself.

244
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
The Prime Minister, sir?

245
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,041
How goes
our other project?

246
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,208
Rather well, sir.

247
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,000
We've nearly
completed liquidation

248
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,625
of all Tennozu
Group assets.

249
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,000
This evening will mark
the Club's grand reopening...

250
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,208
Be sure to notify
all of our members.

251
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,416
Sir.

252
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,250
The Last Supper
can finally begin.

253
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,875
My God, it's
what I thought.

254
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,000
Saiga...

255
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,458
Mannequin legs?

256
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,708
Fuck!
Not nice, Captain.

257
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,625
I really don't like
uninvited guests.

258
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,500
Damn you!

259
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,958
You're the
fucking chief...

260
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,041
How could you--

261
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,041
That was unlawful entry...

262
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,000
Self defense,
to use your phrase.

263
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,041
You may have noticed,
I'm not the tallest man.

264
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,000
And while I can't
say it's been easy,

265
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,000
it's always given me
the perfect view.

266
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,666
Your legs, Captain.

267
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,708
You have the most
fantastic pair.

268
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,625
Powerful, and long.

269
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,291
Just between us, I've wanted
to add them to my collection

270
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,333
for a long time, ever
since you joined the force!

271
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,208
But to think you'd
bring them to me.

272
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,958
Just walk them right in...
It's a dream come true.

273
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,125
Ka... Kagura...

274
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,958
Wounded hearts that
call out to each other--

275
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,833
even from afar...

276
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,791
As the deadline
approaches,

277
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,500
an insatiable hunger
is revealed...

278
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,291
And an explosion lights the
fires of the final contest.
