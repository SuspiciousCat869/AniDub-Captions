1
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,083
I have to have this.

2
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,791
Ooh,
this shade is hot.

3
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,208
I like this one better.

4
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,625
Seriously, I hear this stuff
makes you super skinny!

5
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,416
Like Michiko?
She's a total twig!

6
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,458
Now you can look...
just as good as you sound.

7
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,916
Isn't that that
Tennozu heiress chick?

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,916
I saw the whole
thing on tv...

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,875
Like that nutso
wedding she had...?

10
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,250
I totally freaked
when that church blew up.

11
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,166
Did they ever figure out
if it was a terrorist thing?

12
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,958
I thought I heard somewhere
that it was a jealous

13
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,916
ex-boyfriend who came
to whisk her away.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No way--
that's so hot!

15
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,166
Dig in ladies!

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,916
That don't get you wet,
I don't know what will!

17
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,625
Check this out!

18
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,541
President, Chairman,
Director, C.E.O., Advisor...

19
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,791
Take your pick!

20
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,291
Who wants
to be my girl?

21
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,416
Aw, fuck it! I got enough
of this to go around--

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,041
I'm gonna take
all of you...!

23
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,708
Oh, it's
good to be me!

24
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,416
Bam... Bam...
Bam... Bam.

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:34,708
Ah...! Ah...!
Ah...! Ah...!

26
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,750
What's this "ah" shit?

27
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,375
You say,
"Lucky me."

28
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,208
"Lucky me?"

29
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,291
We're nearing
the end.

30
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,708
What do you smell?

31
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,750
Blood, sweat
and tears.

32
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,125
The unmistakable
stench of money...

33
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,750
The putrid stink of people
trading their souls

34
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,791
for scraps of paper...

35
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,125
Soon this tower will
serve as a grave marker

36
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,916
to those consumers
and their greed.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,833
So the Drop
of the Goddess...

38
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,208
is driving them
insane as planned?

39
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,791
That... and Mister
Saiga's photograph

40
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,375
has multiplied
the effect...

41
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,291
It's his masterpiece.

42
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,166
Speaking of whom, our man
inside the police called...

43
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,916
A couple, matching Kagura
and Saiga's descriptions,

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,875
has been spotted
in Hokkaido.

45
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,500
Wow you caught a lot!

46
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,958
Yeah.

47
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:22,958
Still seasick?

48
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,875
Nah not anymore kid...

49
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,875
Must be getting
my "sea legs."

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,625
We ship out
tonight after dark.

51
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,000
Go pack your bags.

52
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,541
You sure...?

53
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,875
But I haven't put in as many
hours as you and I agreed on.

54
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,583
Consider the rest a loan.

55
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,666
You can pay me back
once you get settled...

56
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,500
Just don't send me
none of them rubles.

57
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,041
Hidaka, I don't...

58
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,291
Hey, maybe
somebody there

59
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,291
will buy your brother
and sister story.

60
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,875
You knew?

61
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,500
I ain't blind...

62
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,708
You sure about this?

63
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,791
As long as
I'm with you I am.

64
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,625
Yeah, used to poach
out here all the time,

65
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,125
'til 'bout
ten years ago.

66
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,583
You guys got nothin'
to worry about.

67
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,000
Coast Guard maybe...?

68
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,500
No way, that ain't
one of their boats!

69
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,125
Damn it!

70
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,958
Saiga!

71
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,166
Well, you assholes
obviously aren't Japanese...

72
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,083
So where the hell
are you takin' us ?

73
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,750
Saiga!

74
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,375
Doc!
What're you...?

75
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,375
Glad you made it
here safely, Saiga...

76
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,333
Kagura.

77
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,666
Doctor!

78
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,208
You been feeling all right?

79
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,125
Yes.

80
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,375
Well that's good news.

81
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,833
Don't get me wrong, Doc,
it's good to see you,

82
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,666
but what the fuck?

83
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,000
There'll be time to explain
everything in the car...

84
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,333
We have an
appointment...

85
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,000
In Tokyo.

86
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,875
In Tokyo?

87
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,083
After your little
"incident" at the church,

88
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,000
Professor Nishiya came
to me with an offer...

89
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,083
He arranged
a meeting for us

90
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,041
with a friend
of his in Parliament;

91
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,083
to see about helping you
two out with your situation.

92
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,000
A Parliament member?

93
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
Seiji Ochiai,
one of the good guys--

94
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,041
a maverick of sorts,

95
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,041
goin' after corruption
in his own party.

96
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,583
Makes sense, used to be
a hell of a journalist...

97
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,500
Read all of his stuff when I was
comin' up, back in the day...

98
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,875
Might even call him one
of my early influences.

99
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,000
I told him everything...
He promised...

100
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,083
he'd protect you both
as best he could.

101
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,000
Problem is, Suitengu's
got the Justice Ministry

102
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,375
and the police
under his thumb.

103
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,416
So Ochiai got some foreign
embassy involved, clever...

104
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,958
Means we got immunity
inside this car...

105
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,791
Japanese cops
can't touch us...

106
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,500
Outta curiosity, what country
did he get all buddy-buddy with?

107
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,208
Licadonia...

108
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,791
They declared their independence
about ten years ago.

109
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,625
That little scrap o' land?

110
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,125
Find a little oil and they
wanna play with the big boys.

111
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,791
Guess the only size
that matters is your GDP.

112
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,750
Sorry about how we had
to grab you back there,

113
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,666
but there
was no other way.

114
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,291
You'll be safe once we
get you behind the walls

115
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,375
of the Licadonian Embassy...

116
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,375
But we've got a quick
stop to make first.

117
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,583
Mr. Ochiai insisted
on meeting you.

118
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,541
We've been
expecting you...

119
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,625
Right this way please...

120
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,458
Let's go.

121
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,625
Go on in...

122
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,375
Wrap it up!

123
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,083
Mister Saiga...
glad you could make it.

124
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,708
And you must be the
lovely young Kagura.

125
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,125
Thank you
both for coming.

126
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,416
Yeah well...

127
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,583
we didn't really
that have much choice

128
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,625
in the matter now did we,
Representative?

129
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,958
Not that we're
not grateful.

130
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,875
So what do you
say Saiga...?

131
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,500
Go a round
with an old pug?

132
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,000
Come now, surely you've
been in a ring before?

133
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,875
Be an honor to trade
jabs with the man

134
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,041
who took "Taking
a Break from War."...

135
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,375
I still say the
Pulitzers robbed you.

136
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,291
You've done you're research,
sir, I'm impressed.

137
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,333
More than that.

138
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,541
I've been an admirer
for some time.

139
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,375
You do great work.

140
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,666
I'm providing sanctuary
to you and the young lady...

141
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,541
Least you can do
is sock a diehard fan

142
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,000
in the face
a few times.

143
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,166
C'mon...

144
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,000
So you can move.

145
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,958
I must confess,

146
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,458
when Professor Nishiya
came to me for assistance,

147
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,791
it wasn't the first I'd
heard of this secret club...

148
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,375
I did a little
digging of my own.

149
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,500
Old reporter habits,
you know?

150
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,375
Even with the Tennozu
Group's money,

151
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,000
a man like Choji Suitengu
could only get so far...

152
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,000
He's got someone
high up backing him...

153
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,958
A silent partner...

154
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,916
And...

155
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,916
In terms of
political power...

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,791
He's as high
as it gets...

157
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,041
Suitengu's got
Prime Minister Kamiya!

158
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,708
Oh, come on!

159
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,666
The Prime Minister?

160
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,916
It's true.

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,125
And if we allow him
to remain Prime Minister

162
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,375
it's only a matter of time
before Japan is ruined...

163
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,333
Now I have a plan in place
to remove him from office...

164
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,291
But in order for it to work
I've got to go public

165
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,250
with his ties
to Suitengu.

166
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,583
Oh... you're
just using us...

167
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,083
You're only helping...

168
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,125
To get what you want!

169
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,083
You want to call me
Machiavellian or pragmatic?

170
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,291
Maybe I am, but in all your
sanctimony don't ignore the fact

171
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,875
that toppling Kamiya will bring
Suitengu's club down with him.

172
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,625
What do you say?

173
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,083
Can you work...
with me?

174
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,708
Let's... clean up
this country...

175
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,000
Put those bloodsuckers
down once and for all!

176
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,000
Saiga...

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,083
We'll continue this
discussion later.

178
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,375
Saiga...?
What now?

179
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,250
It's been a long day,
you must be beat.

180
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,000
Take it easy
for a while...

181
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,791
These folks will show
you to your rooms.

182
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,916
If you need anything,
they're here to help.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,541
I don't know
what to say...

184
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,416
Oh, stop it!

185
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,708
You'll embarrass
us both...!

186
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,250
I'm pretty tired myself.
See you in the morning.

187
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
Oh, Saiga...

188
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,208
Ochiai told you, right?

189
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,291
So, uh...
Good night.

190
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,791
Good night.

191
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
Just a sec.

192
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,250
What's wrong?

193
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,750
I can't sleep.

194
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,625
Is it okay if I come
sleep in your room??

195
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,875
Uh, I don't know if...

196
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,416
Hey!

197
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,958
You can't stay here.

198
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,083
Okay... Then I'll go
and sleep in your room.

199
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,375
Then I'm back
where I started.

200
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,083
I'll have trouble
getting to sleep again.

201
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,000
I guess you'll be up
all night then...

202
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,750
I'm off to bed.

203
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,250
It was better before...

204
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,375
Back when we were on the run
we were always together,

205
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,208
just the two of us...

206
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,041
Sometimes I wish you and
I had never stopped running.

207
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,750
Augusto Toscana...

208
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,750
Easily my favorite
conductor.

209
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,916
He remains utterly faithful to
every note of the composition...

210
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,708
As if he was
fated to do so...

211
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,458
You realize our opponents
have the upper hand here...

212
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,958
The legislature,
the judiciary...

213
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,208
all moving to the rhythm
of Suitengu's baton...

214
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,333
Everything is proceeding
note-for-note

215
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,291
as he has
orchestrated...

216
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,416
But I see a different
fate knocking at his door.

217
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,250
I'm going to bring his rotten
little club and all its members

218
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,916
to light during the next
legislative session.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,791
For what purpose?

220
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,458
To gain
public attention--

221
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,000
and more importantly, to gain
the attention of the media.

222
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,500
There'll be outrage!

223
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,625
Yeah, that's a
great plan and all...

224
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,958
But isn't the media already
in Suitengu's pocket?

225
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,500
Don't forget
I was part of the media,

226
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,208
I know how
the game works...

227
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,416
The front page
follows the money...

228
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,875
But this time...
things will be different...

229
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,541
They will
have to act!

230
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm not alone
in my mission--

231
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,833
I belong to
an organization...

232
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,791
We're known
as the White Eagles...

233
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,166
Journalists,
critics,

234
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,250
party members,
average citizens...

235
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,000
all unified to bring
Kamiya to justice...

236
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,833
make him pay...

237
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,500
Together we have the power
to ensure the media

238
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:08,583
pays attention and opens
the public's eyes.

239
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,375
However, for
that to happen...

240
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,291
We'll need you and the girl
to testify to Parliament,

241
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,583
and you to display
your "abilities.

242
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,333
"Huh--?
Hold on!

243
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,208
I'm all for exposin' Suitengu
and his bastard cronies,

244
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,333
but puttin' the kid on display
like a fuckin' sideshow freak...

245
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,875
She's only fifteen
for chrissake!

246
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,875
I can't force you
to do anything...

247
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,000
If you feel that's the
choice you have to make,

248
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,791
I'll personally
arrange to send

249
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,041
both of you somewhere
safe overseas...

250
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,375
But know this
could be our best

251
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,791
and last chance
to expose them...

252
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,500
And...
Forgive me for saying,

253
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,125
but if you are still
a journalist,

254
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,208
shouldn't that
be your priority?

255
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,041
Give me some time to
think about it okay?

256
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,041
Looks like a simple
case of exhaustion.

257
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,041
As long as her headaches
aren't getting any worse,

258
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,333
I'd say it's
nothing serious.

259
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,083
That may be, Doctor, but
it doesn't change the fact

260
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,250
that we must examine Kagura
as soon as possible.

261
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,333
Saiga...!

262
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,000
Accept Ochiai's
proposal...

263
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,000
I beg you.

264
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,375
Professor...

265
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,833
I don't understand why he's
so reticent to testify!

266
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,708
It's a complicated
decision for him.

267
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,500
He wants to do what's
best for the girl.

268
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,875
But unless
we can get Kagura

269
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,208
moved to the proper
facilities...

270
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,166
she'll die and then
it will be too late.

271
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,000
If we don't get a
living tissue sample...

272
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,333
Nishiya!

273
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,375
While I appreciate your
help getting us in touch

274
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,083
with Representative Ochiai...

275
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,208
I won't allow you to turn
this into a publicity stunt!

276
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,666
Miss Kagura...

277
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,625
I have something very
important to tell you,

278
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,208
about your health...

279
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,250
Your friends have
been keeping secrets.

280
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,416
You have to appear
before the legislature.

281
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,750
If we delay a full examination
of you for much longer,

282
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,000
Your condition
will kill you.

283
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,000
And your friend,
Mister Saiga...

284
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,666
will be left
permanently blind.

285
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:36,500
In this city, insanity
runs silent but deep.

286
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,958
Is a lie still a lie if it's
for your own good?

287
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,958
Will the man
be a friend?

288
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,791
Or will
he cut and run?
