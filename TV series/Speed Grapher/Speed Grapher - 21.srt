1
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,708
I can't... I can't
see anything...

2
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,208
My eyes...

3
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,000
Is this it?

4
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,000
I've got to...

5
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,083
I've got
to shoot her.

6
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,916
Please help me!
Is anyone out there?!

7
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,833
Anyone...?!
Let me out of here...!

8
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,750
Somebody! Please!

9
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,583
(Oh please some)body get
me out of this place!

10
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,625
Kagura!

11
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,625
Kagura, can you
hear me? Kagura!

12
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,625
Doctor, is that you...?!
Doctor Ryogoku?!

13
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,666
Not so loud.

14
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,458
I don't know
what's going on here,

15
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,083
but it's probably best
not to draw attention.

16
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,708
But Doctor...

17
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,708
I've been thumbing through
Professor Nishiya's journal.

18
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,208
There are notes
in here...

19
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,250
Detailed notes
regarding the research

20
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,291
he did on you
and your condition.

21
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,125
About me?

22
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,208
Yes. And it's confirmed
a lot of my theories.

23
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,625
I was hoping I might find
some way to save you.

24
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,791
But there's something
I still can't seem to grasp.

25
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,083
That...
journal...

26
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,041
That journal is me,
isn't it...?

27
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,541
All the secrets...

28
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,958
My whole life I've been
wondering who I really am...

29
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,750
But now I... I'm really
going to die, aren't I?

30
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,708
For so long...
that's what I wanted.

31
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,708
But now that I'm
actually facing death

32
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,458
I want nothing more
than to survive...

33
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,041
With Saiga...

34
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,833
he helped me see that
I could live and be free.

35
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,750
I want to live...

36
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,708
I wanna live
to see Saiga again.

37
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,708
Oh good, I'm so glad
you're up, Captain.

38
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,125
Chief...?!

39
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,958
What the fuck
is going on?!

40
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,500
Shouldn't I be asking you
what you're doing here...?

41
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,250
Of course, who am I to question
the sublime hand of fate

42
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,333
that brought you and your
"knockout pair" into my home

43
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,750
to join my
private collection?

44
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,375
Collection...?

45
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,500
You mean...

46
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,666
This fucked up
shit is your doing?

47
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,416
Whatcha think...?
Beautiful aren't they...?

48
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,708
Don't worry, I saved
a nice bit of real estate

49
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,500
for your stems,
Captain...

50
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,500
The perfect place, right between
my wife's and daughter's!

51
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,250
Goddamn...! You mutilated
your own wife and kid?!

52
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,333
You sick fuck!

53
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,375
You make it sound
like a bad thing,

54
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,500
when I did it
purely out of love.

55
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,708
This way I stay close to them
for as long as I live,

56
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,083
and they always
stay beautiful...

57
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,833
Well at least their
legs stay beautiful!

58
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,750
What does an elite club
like Suitengu's even want

59
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,583
with a lowly
nothing like you?

60
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,958
Ah, so that's
what brought you here...?

61
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,666
They welcome all public
officials with open arms.

62
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,250
Course, the
Superintendent-General

63
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,291
of Metro Police
is my uncle...

64
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,250
But that's enough
gossiping...

65
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,375
Those legs aren't going
to saw off themselves.

66
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,166
Stay away!

67
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,125
Please don't struggle my sweet!
They all struggle...

68
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,791
But it'd be
a real travesty

69
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,916
if I were to damage
those perfect legs.

70
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,083
How could I forget
the most important part?

71
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,541
Lotion!
Lotion!

72
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,375
Play it smart,
Chief...

73
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,375
if you kill me, you're
gonna find yourself smack

74
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,958
in the middle of a
massive shit storm!

75
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,625
How's that?

76
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,375
Before I came here I got hold
of the Club's membership list.

77
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,291
And guess whose name
was printed right there

78
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,416
in black and white...

79
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,125
If I don't get back soon...

80
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,041
I've arranged for that list to
go to the brass and the media.

81
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,083
Oh is that all, you really
had me worried for a second...

82
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,333
Did you even bother to look
at some of the other names,

83
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,666
Captain...?

84
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,041
The head of the
National Police

85
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,541
and my dear uncle, the
Superintendent- General...?

86
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,125
As for the media,

87
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,958
our members own
every major newspaper

88
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,208
and broadcast
outlet in Japan.

89
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,791
Hell, even the Prime
Minister's a member!

90
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,333
In fact, the Club's
reopening tonight!

91
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,166
I couldn't be
more excited!

92
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,833
And... Kamiya's got
a big announcement

93
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,666
to make at the ceremony.

94
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,958
Of course you'll be
dead by then

95
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,250
so what the fuck
do you care?

96
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,500
Now the lotion...
it works wonders...

97
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,875
It'll make your skin as
smooth as silk stockings.

98
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,833
Plus it helps you relax,
and the aroma's intoxicating.

99
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,000
But best of all, it contains
Drop of the Goddess!

100
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,875
Drop of what...?
What the hell is that?

101
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,333
The special ingredient

102
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,541
added to every one of the
Tennozu Group's new products.

103
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,875
The "magic potion" that's
been liberating everyone

104
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,166
of their inhibitions
as of late...

105
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,833
Oh sure some people
have gone a bit crazy...

106
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,375
but that's a small price to pay
for unleashing our desires...

107
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,833
No...!
Get off me!

108
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,500
Get off...!
Get off now!

109
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,000
Why my dear,
sweet Captain.

110
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,625
That is entirely
the point.

111
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,875
Get off!

112
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,041
Damn it...
Damn it...

113
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,500
Goddamn it...

114
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,125
What was that?

115
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,833
Is somebody out there?

116
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,208
I've got a gun...

117
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,083
Saiga?!
Sweet baby Jesus!

118
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,250
Guess the Chief wasn't
dickin' around, was he?

119
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,458
They're all here...

120
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,375
Directors, Deputy Chiefs,
Security Police...

121
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,458
What the fuck's wrong
with this country?

122
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,333
Welcome to the grand
reopening of our Club...

123
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,333
This is truly a
special evening!

124
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,750
Please partake
of our fine elixirs

125
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,291
and feast upon the sumptuous
dishes prepared by our chefs.

126
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,000
That's it...!
Kagura I found it!

127
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,208
I found a way to
save your life!

128
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,541
Kagura!
Kagura!

129
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,541
Pardon me, sir.

130
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,208
Welcome Goddess.
Please, come in.

131
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,083
I trust that you
slept well last night?

132
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,083
Aren't you ...

133
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,791
Kamiya, yes...

134
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,666
You seem surprised
to see me...

135
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,416
Since yesterday you've been
a guest in my residence.

136
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,833
Mr. Prime Minister...
why have you--?

137
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,708
Please, won't you
have a seat...?

138
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,625
I apologize for the manner
in which you were brought here.

139
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,291
However, it was of the utmost
importance that I see you;

140
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,041
to apprise you of your
current situation.

141
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,916
What is this...?
What am I here for?!

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,041
With all you've been through
you must be famished...

143
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,125
I'll explain everything
to you as we enjoy

144
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,791
a hearty breakfast,
Goddess.

145
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,291
Now come,
have a seat.

146
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, everything looks
delicious, doesn't it?

147
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,625
The dishes on the table are
like power in this country...

148
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,041
Spread out before me,
and all within my reach.

149
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,791
I'm not ashamed to say
I derive boundless pleasure

150
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,291
from each little bite.

151
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,916
And as the man at the head
of this nation's table,

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,083
I intend to
devour it all.

153
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,416
I'm sorry, sir, but
I don't feel like eating...

154
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,000
Now please tell me
what you want from me.

155
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,333
Why have you brought--

156
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,250
You mustn't let this
banquet go to waste!

157
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,916
You have lost entirely too much
weight while on the run, dear...

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,583
You have to eat something
to get your energy up.

159
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,583
Go on...

160
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,166
Food is more than
mere sustenance.

161
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,833
It is culture-
it is art...!

162
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,291
And only the chosen few
are given the chance

163
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,083
to appreciate and indulge
in such epicurean delights...

164
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,291
And no one is more
deserving than you, Goddess.

165
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,333
What's the matter,
dear Goddess...?

166
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,458
That soup is full
of collagen...

167
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,333
It's good
for your complexion.

168
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,208
Let me out
of here now!

169
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,541
Patience my
beautiful child...

170
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,875
As soon as you finish
eating this fine breakfast

171
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:51,791
we shall leave...

172
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,916
And head to the Club.

173
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,208
Why would you--...?

174
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,250
I'm never going back
to that place, never!

175
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,666
I'm afraid you have no
say in the matter...

176
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,833
Recently the Tennozu Group
has been brought

177
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,791
under federal control...

178
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,166
Meaning that the Club
is hereby a public entity.

179
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,666
In which case,
I suppose one could say you

180
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,208
are now a servant
of the people...

181
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,166
Just like yours truly!

182
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,333
You won't get
away with this!

183
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,166
Oh I'll eliminate anyone
who gets in my way...

184
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,750
I've dispatched an elite
squad to do just that.

185
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,750
Relax. There's no love lost
between you and Suitengu?

186
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,416
So... let's enjoy
the rest of our meal

187
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,000
while we wait
for the good news.

188
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,875
All right boys, we're storming
the Tennozu Building.

189
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,583
Suitengu's gotta be
holed up in there.

190
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,541
Fuck me!

191
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,375
How much ya think's
in this shit hole?

192
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,583
Sit... We're not
finished eating yet!

193
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,625
I can't eat this...!
And I don't care what you say...

194
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,625
I won't ... I won't
go back to that Club...!

195
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,416
The only place I'm going
is wherever Saiga is.

196
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,041
That pest?
He's dead.

197
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,125
Forget him...
Now hurry up and eat...

198
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,041
you naughty girl, you!

199
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,875
You're lying, he can't
be dead...! He can't...

200
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,916
Hurry up and eat,
Goddess,

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,291
the time
for feasting is now!

202
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,625
Bravo, gentlemen.

203
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,916
I'm flattered I warrant

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,666
such a distinguished
welcoming committee...

205
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,166
Prime Minister Kamiya can
be a bold man at times....

206
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,000
A crack squadron,
to be sure...

207
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,791
It's too bad none of you have
any actual combat experience...

208
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,666
I just wish you could've
been in that jungle--

209
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,291
seen what I saw...

210
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,166
Fire!

211
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh, Saiga...!

212
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,416
Thank God you're awake...!

213
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,208
C- can you even
tell who I am?

214
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,833
Yeah, Bob...
I can see...

215
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,958
But you kept saying
"I can't see-- I can't see...

216
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,125
" Somethin' wrong with
those gorgeous eyes?

217
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,625
Guess you can call
that one more I owe ya.

218
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,708
Oh pish posh--
don't be silly...

219
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,250
Makes me feel good
takin' care of you.

220
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,625
'At's sweet, but...

221
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,125
No moving!

222
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,208
I gotta go.

223
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,166
Kagura's in trouble--
'cause of me.

224
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,166
Don't be ridiculous...!

225
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,000
You're staying right
here with me...

226
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,083
Doctor Bob's
orders, honey!

227
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,416
Bob, I...

228
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
When's it stop?

229
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,458
How much suffering'll
be enough for you two?

230
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,875
Just look at you...!

231
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,833
I wanted you both
to have a fairytale ending,

232
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,333
and that's the truth...

233
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,666
Why do you think,
against my better judgment,

234
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,250
I did everything
I could to help?

235
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,916
But what good did it do?

236
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,541
For you...?
For that girl?

237
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,041
No, you're wrong...
about us...

238
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,625
Wake up...!
Will you...?

239
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,500
It's all over!

240
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,500
Back there...
I had a dream.

241
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,416
I dreamt I took Kagura's
picture and killed her...

242
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,958
It was so goddamned
real it was scary...

243
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,166
And then I
realized that,

244
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,708
when I'm with her...
all I feel is fear!

245
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,125
Saiga, you--

246
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,833
This isn't
about love, Bob...

247
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,666
It's something more...

248
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,875
If I can't find a way to save
her, I can't go on living!

249
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,875
And it goes a lot deeper
than just me and her now...

250
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,583
Too many people
have died...

251
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,125
This whole country's
been sold to the wolves!

252
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,041
Just promise me one
fuckin' thing...

253
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,958
That you'll come
back to me alive.

254
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,166
Thanks for
everything, Bob.

255
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,625
Shouldn't Kamiya
be here?

256
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,958
Don't worry, he'll be arriving
with the Goddess soon.

257
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,625
And the Ambassadors, too...

258
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,458
If we can seduce
foreign diplomats now,

259
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,958
it'll be easier asking
for favors down the road.

260
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,250
Professor...
Nishiya...

261
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,958
Uh, sir...

262
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,500
What do you want?
Is it time already?

263
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,041
What? No, sir...
It's just...

264
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,041
there's a bit
of a problem.

265
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,000
The squad infiltrated
the Tennozu Building,

266
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,000
but we seem to have lost
contact with them.

267
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,166
What the hell?!

268
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,208
That's gotta be...

269
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,875
Keep the change!

270
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,500
I'm coming for you...

271
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,083
Kagura.

272
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,375
The time has come for
you to remember the beginning

273
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,458
of our sordid story...
Prime Minister.

274
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,041
Time to go.

275
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,750
That shocking day that
lies hidden in your heart.

276
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,500
The dark memory that haunts
the deepest recesses

277
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,708
of your mind...

278
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:43,041
Sooner or later,
it all boils to the surface.

279
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,833
And all you can do,
is let it come.
