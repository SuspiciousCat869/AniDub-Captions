1
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,416
Defense Minister Fukushima,
Finance Minister Yumoto.

2
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,541
Thank you so much for coming
to our little factory

3
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,500
on the sea this evening.

4
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,375
We've arranged
a first-rate tour.

5
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,125
Right this way,
gentlemen.

6
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,750
It's a damn
fine factory.

7
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,958
All this, hidden
inside a tanker.

8
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,416
Ingenious.

9
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,875
Yes... So it that
our magic elixir?

10
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,625
I've been thinking of calling
it "Drop of the Goddess."

11
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,666
Got a nice ring to it.

12
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,250
The formula has already
been added to all

13
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,208
of the Tennozu
Group's products.

14
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,083
It's not quite up to par with
the girl's Euphoria stimulant...

15
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,708
But it is highly addictive...

16
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,833
even a small dose reduces
serotonin in the brain.

17
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,333
Serotonin?

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,583
That's a hormone,
isn't it?

19
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,416
It's a neurotransmitter
that regulates

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,750
the amount of dopamine and
norepinephrine in the brain--

21
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,541
the chemicals
responsible for desire.

22
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,541
When serotonin
levels are low,

23
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,958
people become unable to control
the most basic animal cravings.

24
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,708
Put simply, it will return
people to their primitive roots,

25
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,125
making them
ideal consumers...

26
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,166
and creating great
fortune for us all.

27
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,958
Thanks to your changes to the
Pharmaceutical Affairs Law,

28
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,416
the Tennozu Group's drug
companies now own the market,

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
and these products will
reach every shelf...

30
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,416
while your recent corporate
deregulations have allowed to us

31
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,541
to expand our financial empire
in ways few dreamed possible.

32
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,500
From the Prime Minister
down the chain,

33
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,125
all of you
loyal Club members --

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,125
as well as your
family businesses--

35
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,541
will become
top shareholders

36
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,458
in each of the
Tennozu Group's firms.

37
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,041
Healthy dividends await,
you can be sure.

38
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,500
We'll take care of raising
funds for the next phase...

39
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,041
In terms of investments

40
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,666
it's far beyond the Bank
of Japan's normal limits...

41
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,416
But I've already
cleared it personally

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,208
with the bank's governor.

43
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,541
This has been a risky
maneuver for all of us...

44
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,916
These legislative
changes have stirred up

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,750
a firestorm in the media--
especially the drug law--

46
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,750
and we expect big returns.

47
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,666
You know, gentlemen,
we could always spin off

48
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,791
part of the Tennozu Group
into a public corporation...

49
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,583
And thus transfer most of
the early financial burden

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,916
to the national debt.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,916
Don't get ahead of
yourself, Suitengu.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,375
Just do your job, and leave
the politics to the politicians.

53
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,458
Please sirs,
pardon my insolence.

54
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,791
This was a damned bold step
on your part, you know,

55
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,500
offering us such a sizeable cut
of the Tennozu Group's profits

56
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,500
in order to make this
plan of yours happen.

57
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,791
"Bold?" No, I'm simply
looking to the future...

58
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,833
My dreams go far
beyond riches.

59
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,250
You don't say...

60
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,875
Gentlemen-- to the development
of our great country.

61
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,333
And prosperity
for all of us.

62
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,208
I gathered
all I could!

63
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,458
I pulled strings,
groveled on my knees!

64
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,666
I maxed out every possible
line of credit, I swear!

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,791
Yet you're still short
twenty million yen.

66
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,250
That's money you
spent at the Club.

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,083
But I've given you
everything!

68
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,791
The stock in my company,
the deed to this house!

69
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,541
Mister Suitengu, please!
Twenty million yen!

70
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,416
That's pocket change
for someone like you!

71
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,791
The state of my
financial affairs

72
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,916
should be the least
of your concerns...

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,083
At this point,
I'm certain you know the rules

74
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,375
of doing
business with me.

75
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,375
There's a reason life
insurance policies

76
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,541
are a membership
requirement.

77
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,166
I'm begging you...!
Please reconsider!

78
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,041
I have a family--
children!

79
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,041
Mai, don't come in here--
go back to your room!

80
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll give you...
this...

81
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,291
That's nice,
sweetheart...

82
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,041
But it's play money--
we can't take that.

83
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,291
How old are you?

84
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,000
Your daughter just
bought your life.

85
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,125
Let him go.

86
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,375
How's it coming?

87
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,083
Man, this is a bitch...

88
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,208
Do we honestly gotta get
every single boxload counted

89
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,583
by the end of the day?

90
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,250
It's the semiannual audit--
you know how it works...

91
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,250
How's Sasazuka?

92
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,041
Every time he crunches
numbers he gets that grin--

93
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,000
If I didn't know better I'd
think he was jerking off.

94
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,791
He knows numbers
like I know smells.

95
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,250
If I get a whiff of
someone's urine,

96
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,000
I can tell where they've been,
what they were eating--

97
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,916
even how they felt
while they pissed...

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,583
Smell has its own language--

99
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,083
it excites me in a way
nothing else can.

100
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,666
Were I to venture a guess,
I'd imagine crunching numbers

101
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,416
gets him off in
the same fashion.

102
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,166
It's been
a hell of a term

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,666
compared to the
normal receipts.....

104
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,125
And I know who we
have to thank...

105
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,958
So this is it.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,458
What is this?

107
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,333
Who would have thought...

108
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,583
In a madhouse
like this...

109
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
I'd finally find
my subject.

110
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,083
What are you waiting for?

111
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,125
Take him away from the
Goddess, immediately!

112
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,375
He stole my ritual...

113
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,333
I've come for you.

114
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,333
Who are you?

115
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,666
Take a guess.

116
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,333
Tatsumi Saiga...
Photographer...

117
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,916
Someone who knows freedom.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,666
You've done homework.

119
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,333
So what are you going to
teach me today Mister Saiga?

120
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,916
How to be free
of course... You coming?

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,333
Yes!

122
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,958
Keep your eyes closed
and hold on tight.

123
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,791
Um, yeah.

124
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,666
You wouldn't have the power
if you didn't want it.

125
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,250
Your desire is to steal
life with your lens...

126
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,833
Even a Euphoric will perish
if his head is taken off...

127
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:50,083
So I shall twist off
yours like I did the rest.

128
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,458
Thanks for the tip.

129
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,291
What do you know?

130
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,458
My desire was fulfilled.

131
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,333
Smile.

132
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,916
Make sure you
catch my good side.

133
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,041
Go to hell.
It didn't focus...

134
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,083
What a pity.

135
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,916
Simon...!
You filthy whore...!

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,166
Get out of here!

137
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,583
You won't get off just
'cause you're a freak!

138
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,416
Madam Koganei...

139
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,625
You played a risky hand,
but now it's time to collect.

140
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,958
Please help me...
I'll repay you!

141
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,416
You know a clouded
diamond has no value.

142
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,291
Gather the pieces,
and sell them off.

143
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,083
We have to profit
from her somehow...

144
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,166
What the hell is that thing
and why is it in my house?

145
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,333
Stay back, Doc!

146
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,833
You're just like
the rest of 'em...

147
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,125
Not right in the head.

148
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,708
'Kay, so...

149
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,291
How much you
suckers wanna bet...

150
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,958
that lucky bastard's bangin'
divine pussy right now?

151
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,541
Shows how much you know...

152
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,208
That's never going
to happen with them.

153
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,625
Why not?

154
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,458
Quite simply, a Euphoric
needs something very different

155
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,416
to get off.

156
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,333
I believe that's more
than fair compensation...

157
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,166
for the photograph you
took of Miss Kagura.

158
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,416
Photograph?

159
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,041
What are you
talking about?

160
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,250
See for yourself...

161
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,250
It turned out
quite nicely.

162
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,291
Can't say I care
much for the rest.

163
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,833
Okay that's enough;
I don't want to get caught...

164
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,833
What are you doing?

165
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,958
Come any closer and
I'll kill myself, I swear!

166
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,875
Okay please, don't do it...

167
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,041
You're too important--

168
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,041
They'd kill me if
anything happened to you!

169
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,500
All right... Then you're gonna
have to do what I say.

170
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,875
Mother, run!
He's one of them--

171
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,791
he's a monster!

172
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,833
You should have been
happy with me.

173
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,958
In all the time we shared,
you were always

174
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,208
in the left arm
of the man you loved.

175
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,416
Let her go!

176
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,500
Mother, no!
Don't leave me!

177
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,916
Listen to me...
You were wrong...

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,791
That night fifteen years ago
my father did come for you,

179
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,000
he was just late- -he got
there right after you left!

180
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,541
The owners told me!

181
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,958
Father never
deserted you!

182
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,500
He loved you!

183
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,333
Mother no--
you can't leave me now--

184
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,958
if you go away
I'll be all alone!

185
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,166
Well I take it this
means the wedding's off.

186
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,333
No. Just a small
change in cast.

187
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,666
With Shinsen gone, all the
Tennozu Group's assets

188
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,458
go to her daughter...

189
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,416
There will be
a marriage tonight,

190
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,666
and Kagura
will be my bride.

191
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,041
It's got me...

192
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,708
Saiga...!
Use your camera!

193
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,041
It's the only way-- you
have to take us both out!

194
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,083
Ginza!

195
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,000
Just...
do it...

196
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,416
I can't.

197
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,208
And Kagura Tennozu...

198
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,750
Do you take this man to be your
husband, for better or worse,..

199
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,250
Yurigaoka? Yeah he's
here I saw him come in...

200
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,375
You have to say "I do"...
My darling...

201
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,541
She doesn't have
to do shit!

202
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,375
Now you get to watch
me leave with the girl.

203
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,833
Mister Saiga!

204
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,291
It's good
to have you back.

205
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,541
Where are we?

206
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,583
The church.
Outside.

207
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,875
That's right...!

208
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,625
They tried to force me
to marry Mr. Suitengu...!

209
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,583
But I knew it! I knew
you'd come save me!

210
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,708
Then let's go.

211
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,708
Okay!

212
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,333
I will not allow it!

213
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,208
The wrath of God shall
sear your mortal flesh.

214
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,666
Now, it is time
to confess your sins.

215
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,958
With you for a subject it
seems a bit redundant

216
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,916
to use a flash...

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Almost!

218
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,625
Kagura? Ready?

219
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,166
Uh-huh!

220
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,916
I have a marriage license that
needs to be filed right away.

221
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,208
Gladly.

222
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,583
Oh, it's...

223
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,958
Still unclear
at this time...

224
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,375
exactly what happened
inside that church today...

225
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,916
I don't have all day.

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,083
Oh. Consider it done.

227
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,041
Then it's official.

228
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,666
Kagura is
a married woman.

229
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,458
Well done.
Thank you, sir.

230
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,250
One more thing.

231
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,208
Add this
to the balance.

232
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't do that...

233
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,750
It's not real money.

234
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,250
Of course sir,
please excuse me...

235
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,125
I'll add it
in immediately.

236
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,958
Repaired,
as you asked.

237
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,375
I've been meaning
to ask you, Saiga.

238
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,583
That song you're
always whistling...

239
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,500
What's the name of it?

240
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,333
Don't know...

241
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,791
It's just something
I picked up...

242
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,000
Out on the battlefield,
when I was a war photographer.

243
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,541
I heard it eight years ago.

244
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,208
I'd been sent to this
island to cover a raid

245
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,875
by a special forces unit.

246
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,291
There were rumors of secret
experiments going on there,

247
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,291
some weapon that had been
forbidden by an arms treaty.

248
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,000
I thought it'd
be my big scoop.

249
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,750
I guess I was wrong.

250
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,000
There was a explosion,
the whole unit was wiped out.

251
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,500
I got hit, bad.

252
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,708
When I woke up,
I was buried alive.

253
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,458
I scraped for hours,
trying to get to the top.

254
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,750
But it was no use.

255
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,625
I had given up.

256
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,291
I was just about
ready to die....

257
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,458
that's when I heard
that song,

258
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,666
coming from someone
trapped nearby.

259
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,208
We were both too badly
injured to say anything,

260
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,083
but he kept playing
his music box...

261
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,208
Over,
and over again.

262
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,583
I don't know if he was trying
to give me stength to hold on...

263
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,375
Or if he was just trying
to keep his own sanity.

264
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,250
Maybe it was both.

265
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,583
Do you know what
happened to him?

266
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,791
I did some checking later,
but whatever happened

267
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,583
on that island was classified
top secret by the military.

268
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,250
I couldn't find out his name,
what he looked like,

269
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,333
or even if he
was still alive.

270
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,750
But one thing
I know for sure.

271
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:41,291
He and that song
saved my life.

272
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,750
It's a nice thought...

273
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,500
That he's out there and
you might find him someday.

274
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,750
I guess.

275
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,791
Could that be it...?

276
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,083
Could that be when
I became a carrier?

277
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,750
All that's left
are tears of blood,

278
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,416
called forth by the winds
of nostalgia...

279
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,333
He can hear the music
box playing that same,

280
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,541
haunting song...

281
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,208
Until an explosion
rips through the air,

282
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,166
and all the
music is gone.
