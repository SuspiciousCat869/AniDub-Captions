1
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,458
Launching missiles into Tokyo
without any provocation...

2
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,750
Do they think Japan'll
just take this lying down?

3
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,583
But the truth is,
we can't respond.

4
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,291
Suitengu killed
the Prime Minister,

5
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,583
and all our top
officials are missing...

6
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,750
What the hell's going to
happen to this country now?

7
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,458
Suitengu...!
Open this gate!

8
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,541
You think you can get
away with this, you fuck?!

9
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,208
Our top story: the recently
evacuated Minato Ward

10
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,541
has come under
missile attack.

11
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,083
We have still not received
any official statement

12
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,541
from the
administration.

13
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,791
But in light of the assault

14
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,458
on the Prime Minister's
home this morning...

15
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,458
Many speculate this operation
is a counterattack...

16
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,166
against some unidentified
terrorist force.

17
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,291
Panic has set in on the
streets of the capital,

18
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,291
with citizens demanding answers
from their government.

19
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,833
Oh, shit!
I can't believe it!

20
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,750
You piece of shit...!
What did you do with her?!

21
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,166
Kagura has chosen
to accept her fate,

22
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,625
and that's all
you need to know.

23
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,458
You see, I was never a
believer in destiny before...

24
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,416
Before Yui died
in my arms...

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,791
But then I met Kagura
for the first time...

26
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,416
I learned she possessed within
her the same power as I...

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,375
And my views changed.

28
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,583
It was too perfect
for coincidence.

29
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,500
I was being led
to my true end.

30
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,333
Kagura and I were fated

31
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,083
to drown this lost
nation in Euphoria.

32
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,375
Get over yourself.

33
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,041
You used Kagura for your
own personal vendetta!

34
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,375
True, my blood
debts were paid.

35
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,291
But what did I
do to get there?

36
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,250
I merely nudged
the backs of those

37
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,166
already headed
toward self- destruction.

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,208
Because destruction
is the only end

39
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,875
for those twisted
by desire and greed.

40
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,833
Be it a nation, or lost
individuals like you and me.

41
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,333
So, what? You're
saying all that's left

42
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,250
for us is
to curl up and die?

43
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,125
Exactly...
Once the plan is done,

44
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,916
I'll die with the rest.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,333
You're wrong...

46
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,458
I know the real reason
you're eager to die...

47
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,416
Because you feel guilty
for killing your sister

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,083
when you couldn't handle
what she'd become.

49
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,500
You looked at Kagura,

50
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,041
and all you could
see was Yui...

51
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,333
Cause it made you
feel better thinking

52
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,291
you were working
with her to get revenge.

53
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,791
But it's not her.

54
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,166
Kagura is not your sister!

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,833
Give her the freedom
she deserves.

56
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,625
You'll have
to take her from me...

57
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,500
By force!

58
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,166
This whole place
is comin' apart...!

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,208
Why're you boys all
suicidal for that prick?!

60
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,833
His afterimage.

61
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,000
Every person emits light,

62
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,541
and some burn
brighter than others.

63
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,500
When you've been standing
next to someone like him,

64
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,375
he burns into your retina,

65
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,500
so even when he's gone,
he's all you see.

66
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,041
This is the fate of people
who stare into the sun,

67
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,708
like Makabe and me...

68
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,291
On the day we first
met Suitengu...

69
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,291
We got burned.

70
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,291
Fighting for a man
you love...

71
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,291
Yeah, I can relate.

72
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,750
Behold your demise.

73
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,041
Damn...

74
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,875
Caught me off
guard... You okay?

75
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,791
Thanks to you.

76
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,958
Makabe!

77
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,541
We had a helluva
run, Tsujido...

78
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,916
Take care of the rest...

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,750
Makabe!

80
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,291
Makabe...

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,208
Let's do this
the easy way.

82
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,583
I really don't wanna
hafta kill you...

83
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,791
Leave now, nice n' quiet,
and I won't follow.

84
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,083
Fuckin' hell,
you're one of them, too?!

85
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,333
Damn it...

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,375
Damn fool...
Had your chance...

87
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,916
Kagura...

88
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,125
Elevator still works.

89
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,416
Least somethin's
goin' right.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,625
Ginza...!

91
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,625
Saiga! Glad to see
you're not dead!

92
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,750
Yeah, you too...
Y'seen Kagura?

93
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,416
Nothin' yet, just
got here myself.

94
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,916
Not yet...
I'm not finished.

95
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,750
Kagura!

96
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,458
Kagura!

97
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,375
Can you hear me?
Say something!

98
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,916
Oh God, no...!

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Kagura...!
Talk to me!

100
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,708
Open your eyes.
Please!

101
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,041
S--Saiga ...

102
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,791
Kagura... I thought
you were dead...

103
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,916
Now come on...
Let's go...

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,916
Can you stand...?

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,833
I've got some good news...

106
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,041
Doc found the answer,
he knows how to save you now.

107
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,208
I don't wanna be
saved, Saiga...

108
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,583
Forget me.

109
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,583
How could you--?

110
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,750
This whole thing
was my fault...

111
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,166
I created all of those
horrible monsters...

112
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,083
But if I had
never been born...

113
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,125
a lot of people
would still be alive.

114
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,250
Don't talk like
that, Kagura...

115
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,625
None of that was your
fault, you hear me...?!

116
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,791
From now on, all you have
to do is live your own life!

117
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,583
I've made up my mind...

118
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,250
What Suitengu said
about me was right,

119
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,916
it's my destiny to die
in this building with him...

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,291
Don't worry about me...

121
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,166
It's more important
that you live.

122
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,208
That's insane...!

123
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,291
You haven't lived half
as long as me...!

124
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,000
Forget about destiny...

125
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,666
Grow, see the world...!

126
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,541
Then you can act like you
know what's best for you!

127
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,291
I wanna thank you, Saiga...

128
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,833
I'm so glad I got
to meet you...

129
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,958
It may not have
been very long...

130
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,875
But I'd never felt
happiness like that before.

131
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,750
You think dying will
solve everything...?

132
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,625
Well, what about
my feelings...?

133
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,375
The feelings
I have for you?

134
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,041
I told you I'd make
you free, Kagura...

135
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,583
How will I keep
my promise?

136
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,083
But Saiga...

137
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,458
I love you.
Don't you know that?

138
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,500
Please go
on living.

139
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,291
For me.

140
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,166
Saiga!

141
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,916
Ginza... Take Kagura
and get outta here.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,750
Make sure she's safe...

143
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,291
Let Doc help her,
then leave Japan...

144
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,291
Go somewhere no
one'll ever find her.

145
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,916
It's time for me
to end things with him.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,875
Saiga...

147
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,041
I know I've got no right
to ask you to do this ...

148
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:43,041
But you're the only one
I have left I can turn to.

149
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,791
You are such
a fucking loser.

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,791
I won't let
her be rescued.

151
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,833
Then we got a little
problem to work out...

152
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,750
here and now.

153
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,208
Let's go, kid!

154
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,458
No, I won't leave him
again...! I'm staying!

155
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,458
If I can't be with him
I don't wanna live at all!

156
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,250
You have no idea how much
I'd enjoy helping you

157
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,416
with that deathwish,
little girl...

158
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,166
All of that shit Saiga
said to you just now...

159
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,000
You think it was
easy for me to hear

160
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,083
that when he should have
said it to me instead...?!

161
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,750
I wanna kill you...!

162
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,916
I wanna paint that wall
with your god damn brains!

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,000
But'cha know...?

165
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,500
I still have some pride,

166
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,791
and I'm trying to turn
things around here.

167
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,208
Saiga asked me to
take care of you...

168
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,958
If I let you die, I really
will be a lost fucking cause!

169
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,500
I won't let you die.
I won't.

170
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,500
I've got too much
self respect for that.

171
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,083
Is this it?

172
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,000
My limit?

173
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,583
This next shot
could be my last.

174
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
Shit!

175
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,666
That you,
Suitengu...?

176
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,333
Just like the
beginning, huh...?

177
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,375
You're even playing
the same old song.

178
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,666
Figures we'd have
such an ironic end.

179
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,541
Full circle,
and all that crap.

180
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,333
Now go on,
kill me.

181
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,833
I can't see anymore.

182
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
Why did I leave him?

183
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,291
I'm such a
fuckin' idiot.

184
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,041
Saiga!!

185
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,583
Suitengu's blown
himself up, Mr. President.

186
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,875
You can stop
the operation.

187
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,416
So it's done...

188
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,166
Now we'll have our
businesses buy out

189
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,208
all the Tennozu Group companies
and then call it a day.

190
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,458
Yes, sir. We've already made all
the necessary arrangements.

191
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,083
Sir, wait a minute!

192
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,500
We've got a problem.

193
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,291
According to the reports
I've just received,

194
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,500
approximately
eight trillion dollars

195
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,541
invested by the Tennozu
Group has gone missing!

196
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,708
Missing?!

197
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,583
There's more-- apparently
the Bank of Japan

198
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,125
has another ten trillion

199
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,083
invested in the Tennozu Group
that was converted to cash!

200
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,250
Oh, God-- you're not saying
Suitengu would've blown up

201
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,583
all that money, are you?!

202
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,625
If he has done that...
Japan will go bankrupt!

203
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,791
But sir, Japan is already
over twenty trillion dollars

204
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,375
in the red!

205
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,083
Holy hell... If Japan
does go belly up...

206
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,125
Forty trillion dollars'll
just disappear

207
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,791
in the international
markets!

208
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,333
We gotta do something 'fore
all them markets open today...!

209
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,041
Or else there is gonna
be a financial panic!

210
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,375
Too late, Mr. President,

211
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,791
the New York Exchange
is opening right now!

212
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,291
Oh, my dear God!

213
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,291
Saiga...

214
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:47,958
What...?

215
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,666
That's all money...

216
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,583
Hello...?
This is Bob speaking...

217
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,291
Saiga, honey...!
Is that actually you...?!

218
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,583
Sweet Jesus we thought
you were dead--

219
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,708
Hey, Saiga,
it's Doc here...

220
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,041
Where are you?

221
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,875
Don't know.

222
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,041
My eyes gave out on me.

223
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,083
Seem to be on a
rooftop somewhere.

224
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,458
There's a fire.
Hot as hell.

225
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,833
Just sit tight...
I'm not sure how yet...

226
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,416
But we're coming
to find you.

227
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
C'mon...! I can get
a police helicopter for us!

228
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,291
Out of the way!
Rescuers coming through!

229
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
I've gone over it
in my head a thousand times,

230
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,291
and I have no idea
why Suitengu saved my life.

231
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,375
But he got his revenge.

232
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,333
This country was
plunged into bankruptcy --

233
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,041
the collapse heard
'round the world.

234
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,541
They called it
the Roppongi Crisis,

235
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,375
and it turned
everything upside down.

236
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,291
What do you mean
this is all you got,

237
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,875
you limp-dicked
son-of-a-bitch?!

238
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,541
You're trying to make a
fool of me on my own turf?

239
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,333
I don't care
how much they're worth,

240
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,500
I only take repayment
in gold Euros!

241
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,291
I wouldn't wipe
my ass with those!

242
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,166
You got one week...
Don't disappoint me.

243
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,208
I won't sir...

244
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,458
Well when
it comes to money,

245
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,208
you're still as ruthless
as ever, Mr. President.

246
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,208
What can I say, I'm
a man with a dream...

247
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,041
I'm gonna need me
a crapload o' cash,

248
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,083
so's I can build three
towers downtown

249
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,625
so damn tall,
they block out the sun...

250
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,250
The tallest one,
smack in the middle,

251
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,208
I'll name the
Suitengu Building...

252
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,000
And then, the ones
on either side,

253
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,625
I'm gonna call the Tsujido
Tower and Makabe Plaza.

254
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,208
Now that's a dream that's
fuckin' worth somethin'.

255
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,458
What's wrong?

256
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,416
Nothin'...
Must be seeing things...

257
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,708
Hey, let's boogie.

258
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,750
What the frig is this?
It's out of focus!

259
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,541
Saiga could take
better pictures--

260
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,208
even in the shape
he's in now!

261
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,708
Don't you think you're
exaggerating just a bit, sir?

262
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,583
Hell no...! You give him
the lighting conditions

263
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,416
and the distance to the subject,
he'll take far better pictures

264
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,875
than every miserable
halfwit on my payroll...!

265
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,291
A real professional can feel
the shot in his bones...!

266
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,416
Christ, what're you, new...?
How long has it been

267
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,458
since you started working
for me anyway, kid?...

268
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,500
Um... About five years
I guess...

269
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,208
So...! I gotta lead
to check...! See ya!

270
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,166
Hey...! I'm not
done yellin' atcha!

271
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,375
Next stop,
Shiina station.

272
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,750
Thanks.

273
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,583
Tell Saiga I'm finally
gonna be starting up my bar

274
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,625
again at night,

275
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,875
and I'm saving
a seat for him.

276
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,291
Yeah, you got it.

277
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,625
I'm sure he'll be
glad to hear it.

278
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,375
Take it easy.

279
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,791
Shiina,
now departing!

280
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,541
And... One, two...

281
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,666
One, two...

282
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,250
Come on, ladies,
it's opening night!

283
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,125
Let's get those
legs up in the air!

284
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,291
Um...
excuse me...

285
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,750
I've been looking for Saiga,
you know where he is?

286
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,833
You mean Simon?

287
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,500
Have you tried
Bob's Parlor?

288
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,291
Yeah, it was the
first place I checked,

289
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,875
but nobody's answering.

290
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,333
Huh... Well isn't
that bizarre...

291
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,083
Oh, you know, they're
probably up on the roof!

292
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,333
Up on the roof?

293
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,083
There you are...

294
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,833
What on earth are you guys
doing all the way up here?

295
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,416
Hey there, rookie.

296
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,833
Dude, you can't call
me rookie anymore...

297
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,000
I've been at this
for five years...

298
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,875
Is Saiga taking pictures?

299
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,500
Comes up here every day...

300
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,291
And each time he takes exactly
one photograph of the city.

301
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,708
It's a crazy little irony,
don't you think...?

302
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,333
The man had to go
completely blind

303
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,166
before he finally
realized a way

304
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,375
to take pictures
that make him happy.

305
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,416
So is there a reason
for your visit?

306
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,166
Oh... Yeah Ginza
sent me a postcard

307
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,541
and I thought
I'd share...

308
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,541
She says she and the
Doc are in Africa now.

309
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,166
Still havin' trouble
with that one.

310
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,083
I mean, Ginza hooking
up with Dr. Ryogoku?!

311
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,375
How do you see
that coming?

312
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,625
Can it, loverboy!

313
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,458
Or I'll find a
place to stick this.

314
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,291
Oy, that woman's a
handful and a half.

315
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,791
But she doesn't mention
anything about Kagura here.

316
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,458
No, but as far as I know,
she's still with them...

317
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,333
And last I heard, they were
actually getting along.
