1
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,541
Saiga...

2
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,625
Kagura, dear.

3
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,708
I'm the woodsman,
not the wolf.

4
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,916
I'm sorry,
I can't let anybody in!

5
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,791
I know you've been
through a lot...

6
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,250
That's why I'm here,
to protect--

7
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,333
No...!

8
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,291
You have a gun.
I saw it.

9
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,833
It's 'cause
I'm a cop, Kagura.

10
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,750
I don't believe you!

11
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,000
Listen, Saiga's
a friend of mine.

12
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,250
He told me you'd
be waiting here.

13
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,208
We've taken him into
protective custody.

14
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,166
No one else is
gonna touch him.

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,708
Captain Hibari Ginza.

16
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,958
New Metropolitan Police.

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,833
Now you're gonna be a
good girl and go home ...

18
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,958
Aren't you?

19
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,666
But your mother
needs you, hon...

20
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,791
Haven't you heard what
happened while you been gone?

21
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,291
What?

22
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,541
I'm Police Chief Ekoda...

23
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,750
I have a statement regarding
Shinsen Tennozu's condition...

24
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,208
As you know,

25
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,000
Ms. Tennozu collapsed
outside her home this morning.

26
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,333
Paramedics responded swiftly,

27
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,666
but Ms. Tennozu has yet
to regain consciousness

28
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,708
and remains in
critical condition.

29
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,416
Oh my God,
Mother--!

30
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,208
Word around town is

31
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,708
it was friction
between you and your mom

32
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,708
that made you run
away from home...

33
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,375
But the fact is, she's the
only the real family you've got.

34
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,458
You're her blood--

35
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,875
she bore you,
and that matters--

36
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't care how much
you hate her right now...

37
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,333
You can tell me it's
none of my business...

38
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,666
But if she dies and
you're not there...

39
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,416
you'll regret it for
the rest of your life.

40
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Besides, going home now
may be your only chance

41
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,875
to save Saiga
from kidnapping charges.

42
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,500
Somehow I don't think
prison's his style.

43
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,750
So tell me...

44
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,458
What was going on with you
and Saiga through all this--

45
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,041
what kind of relationship
did you two have?

46
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,583
Relationship?

47
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,041
Look, I'm a cop and you're
a minor, I have to ask.

48
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,666
We got laws against
certain things, ya know.

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,083
Laws?
Against what?

50
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,708
Stuff you learn
in health class--

51
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,791
birds, bees, bad places--

52
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,958
come on, you
know what I mean.

53
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,750
It's not like that...

54
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,875
He never touched me.

55
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,291
It's better than that.

56
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,041
What I share with
him is in the heart.

57
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,166
Do you know my
mother's condition?

58
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,250
She's here, ma'am.

59
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,833
Mother--

60
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,166
Well...

61
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,375
What's going on...?

62
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,916
That news story
said you were sick...

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,833
Sorry to worry you, dear...

64
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,333
But I'm certain I'll live
much longer than you.

65
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,791
Welcome home,
Kagura...

66
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,083
We're so relieved...

67
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,625
You were gone
such a long time.

68
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,500
It's perfectly normal
for a child your age

69
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,583
to want to expand
her horizons...

70
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,666
But do you really think it was
fair to worry your mother so?

71
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,583
Mother...
Don't trust him...

72
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,041
You don't understand...

73
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,375
He--

74
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,875
You disgraceful whore...

75
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,041
Manipulating that damned
fool into kidnapping you...

76
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,166
with your
young little cunt!

77
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,375
We have to remember,
Miss Tennozu...

78
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,541
Your daughter is
not well now...

79
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,333
It's her condition that
makes her so irrational...

80
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,166
She needs treatment
at a proper facilty,

81
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,416
to make sure
she won't stray again.

82
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,083
Ah, hell.

83
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,916
Ginza, wait!

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,208
Please! It was a trick!

85
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,791
Don't look at me
to save you...

86
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,666
You thieving little cat!

87
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,416
You said you'd...
protect me...

88
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,791
No, let go!
Get off of me!

89
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,208
Thank you, Captain.

90
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,666
You do good work.

91
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,166
Ginza, why?

92
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,583
I held up my
end of the bargain,

93
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,791
so I'll be taking
my bounty, as agreed.

94
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,458
No! Saiga, wake up!

95
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,791
You know it was a
real bitch piecing

96
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,458
that fake news
report together...

97
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,125
I hope you don't plan
to go back on your word.

98
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,375
I admire a brave woman...
You won't be followed.

99
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,708
'Preciate it.

100
00:07:55,791 --> 00:08:00,000
How could you do this--
you said you came to help!

101
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,375
Little word
of advice, kid,

102
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,875
next time someone
shows up at your door--

103
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,666
the wolf always lies.

104
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,958
You can't take him
from me, please!

105
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,166
Is that supposed
to be funny...?

106
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,833
You listen to me...
Saiga is all mine...

107
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,125
And nobody steals from
me and gets away with it!

108
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,041
No...!
You don't understand!

109
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,375
Please!
Don't leave me here!

110
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,541
I won't survive
without him!

111
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,125
Saiga! Get your
hands off me!

112
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,916
I can't go to back
to this!! I can't! Stop!

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,458
I leave the rest to you.

114
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,875
No! What are you
doing to me?

115
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,166
Please, let me go!

116
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,416
Calm down little one,
we're here to help you...

117
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,375
You're sick, and it's
affecting your thoughts.

118
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,625
We're going to make
everything better.

119
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,916
No, get away!

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,375
Just relax.

121
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,666
Nice, deep breaths...

122
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,666
It'll be okay...

123
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,416
Trust us, you'll see...

124
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,250
Thank god. She hasn't
begun menstruating yet.

125
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,750
Inject her with the
hormone inhibitor!

126
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,666
Hurry!

127
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,500
Oh yes...

128
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,250
Do you know how long
we've waited for this day?

129
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,875
Come on,
come on! Faster!

130
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,875
I'm gonna win, you filthy
little whore, let's go!

131
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,208
That's right, baby,
keep it trucking...

132
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:42,916
One dirty little hoof at a time!

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,916
Go!

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,666
You're falling behind!

135
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,833
Come on!

136
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,500
Giddyup, bitch, giddyup!

137
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,291
You like getting
spanked, don't you?

138
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,250
That's what a
slut like you needs!

139
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,541
Move!

140
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,750
Yeah, keep it movin'!

141
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,125
Almost there!

142
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,125
Don't give up now,
you naughty little cooze!

143
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,250
Very close race,
gentlemen.

144
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,583
Clearly,
I won that one.

145
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,291
Like hell...!
I won!

146
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,666
Miserable whore!

147
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,791
You know what happens
to losing horses?

148
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,666
Number one by a nose.

149
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,041
No...
It's a tie.

150
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,833
Yeah!

151
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,250
Dinner's on me
tonight, bitches!

152
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,125
Here ya go sluts!

153
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,416
Enough for everyone!

154
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,375
It appears you've
won big tonight.

155
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,541
It's just a way
to pass the time...

156
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,166
However...

157
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,958
These activities alone are
hardly enough to satisfy.

158
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,833
I understand...

159
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,625
And I realize I've kept you
gentlemen waiting far too long,

160
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,833
but the Club is
scheduled to reopen soon.

161
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,833
That is good news...

162
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,625
But it's clear the Club is
just a part of your strategy.

163
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,375
All of these "gifts"
you shower us with

164
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,750
are obviously a lead-
in to something bigger.

165
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,666
Am I so transparent?

166
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,500
Let's cut to the chase,
Suitengu...

167
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
Ponies are fun, but
Miss Tennozu is the horse

168
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,166
we want to ride...

169
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,125
It's time to grab
hold of her reins.

170
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,166
-- The problem's Taizo Senri--

171
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,625
He clings to her
like the heir apparent

172
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,708
and she won't make any financial
move without his consent.

173
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,875
We can't reach him--

174
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,208
he has no interest
in wine or women--

175
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,208
just his god-
damned pond.

176
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,583
How does a wet blanket like
him become such a hero

177
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,166
in financial circles...?

178
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,083
If you ask me it's a sign of the
economy's impending collapse.

179
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,166
Measures have
already been taken.

180
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,083
You and your esteemed
colleagues rule the political,

181
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,041
industrial and
financial worlds...

182
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,875
With your help
the Tennozu Group

183
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,708
will become
Triple-Crown champion,

184
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,333
bringing riches to us all...

185
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,083
Let me thank you now,
in Shinsen Tennozu's name.

186
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,333
You know it's a real pity
we couldn't deal with her

187
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,708
in person tonight...

188
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,708
I always have
enjoyed her ass.

189
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,208
Pretend these
girls are her...

190
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,416
I'm sure she'll
like the gesture.

191
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,416
Oh...?
Is that right...?

192
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,125
Well, Shinsen...
Are you having fun now?

193
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,166
Now I got the worst
sense of smell around ...

194
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,083
But I could still
smell that...

195
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,750
So with your nose it
must've been killing you.

196
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,166
The smell of decay...

197
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,333
Old sweat
and stale cigars...

198
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,750
I can withstand
any stench

199
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,875
as long as it
benefits our business.

200
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,791
You're a model employee.

201
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,333
I don't know what Suitengu is up
to but it seems kind of risky...

202
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,916
Should he really be trusting
those wrinkle-dicks?

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
His nose is
even more sensitive

204
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,416
to the smell
of money than mine...

205
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,541
All we have to do
is believe in him,

206
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,083
and go where he leads us.

207
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,750
You've certainly gone too
far this time, haven't you?

208
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
What does that mean?

209
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,708
The Tennozu Group
is past its growth phase--

210
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,125
I thought you understood.

211
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,833
Any further expansion
at this stage

212
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,458
will only lead
to destruction,

213
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,166
like the great
empires of the past

214
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,750
that over-extended
their borders,

215
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,583
leaving themselves so
vulnerable they collapsed.

216
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,958
You've talked in the past
of me ruling Japan...

217
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,625
Maybe you should
explain your strategy,

218
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,416
because you clearly see
something I don't.

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,458
Forgive my ignorance.

220
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,208
Are you mad at me now?

221
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,958
Furious, at myself.

222
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,458
Because I no longer know
what you think of me.

223
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,583
What are you
talking about?

224
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,375
All of this...

225
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,500
Everything I've done,
I've done to make you happy

226
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,166
so one day you'd take me
as your husband......

227
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,500
But I'm too much of a fool
to even get that right.

228
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,416
Suitengu, ...

229
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,041
I feel I'm a captive
of my own decorum.

230
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,625
Like I need to do something rash
to show you how I truly feel.

231
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,625
Suitengu,
what are you doing?

232
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,666
We're together--
nothing else matters!

233
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,541
Please...
be my wife.

234
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,416
Suitengu,
you do go overboard.

235
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,083
But I can't say
I don't enjoy it.

236
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,250
It is nice
to feel again...

237
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,291
Good day,
Madam President.

238
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,625
We received a call
from Taizo Senri's home

239
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,541
while you were gone.

240
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,166
Senri's home?

241
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,583
Yes ma'am... I'm sorry
to tell you this...

242
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,666
But they said there's been an
accident at his lake house...

243
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,708
He's passed away.

244
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,250
Senri, Chairman
of the Federation

245
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,750
of Economic
Organizations, has died...

246
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,500
sending shockwaves through
the Japanese economy.

247
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,208
Hey I knew him...

248
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,333
He was one of Miss
Tennozu's advisors.

249
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,583
Uh-huh. And Yuichiro
Ashikaga's friend--

250
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,208
he's the one who brought the
original investors together.

251
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,833
So now that he's dead...

252
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,791
The Tennozu Group could lose
most of its financial backers...

253
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,583
So... That's what
Suitengu's after.

254
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,791
He's planning
to challenge them all.

255
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,125
Let's go.

256
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,458
Where?

257
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,791
To meet the next V.I.P...
Then go after Saiga.

258
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,708
What, again?

259
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,875
Forget about earlier--

260
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,583
Suitengu hasn't cancelled
his orders yet...

261
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,583
Wait!

262
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,875
Hey...

263
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,250
Yurigaoka!
Over here!

264
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,625
Why...? Why am I not
good enough for you?

265
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,291
She's just a kid...

266
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,291
And I'm not
losing you to her...

267
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,958
Hell...

268
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,833
I'm your girl.

269
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,125
Don't you know that?

270
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,958
Having fun?

271
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,666
Director...!
I'm sorry...

272
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,250
Well...

273
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,083
Can't blame you...
I come here myself.

274
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,666
Did you hear about
Mister Suitengu?

275
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,333
Apparently he and Miss Tennozu
are going to be married.

276
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,666
No... Mother and that
horrible Mr. Suitengu??

277
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,250
How can she?

278
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,166
Doesn't she know
what he is?

279
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,625
With the world
on her shoulders,

280
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,375
a girl runs in despair.

281
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,416
And where she ends up
will forever change

282
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
the face of Tokyo.

283
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,041
They say life
moves in circles.

284
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,208
And with the doomsday god
about to rear its head,

285
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,375
it's good to know
where you've been.
