1
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,708
Your sister's one hell of
guy, Bob. I owe you both.

2
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,875
Forget it...
You're family now too.

3
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,875
Oh, I brought
what you asked for.

4
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,208
Those bastard goons turned
your apartment upside down,

5
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,208
but most of your camera
stuff was still there.

6
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,791
Killers tend not to have
much use for camera gear.

7
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,666
So that's the girl?
Heir to the Tennozu Group?

8
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,666
That's her. Saiga,
I'm worried for you...

9
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,333
Those guys have their
hands in everything--

10
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,583
politics, the police,
organized crime...

11
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,083
Why don't you
just send her away

12
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,875
and go back to taking
pictures, like you used to?

13
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,666
It's too late for that.

14
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,666
I'm in too deep.

15
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,791
Such beautiful teeth...

16
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,041
Like rows of pearls, nestled
in a warm and fertile oyster.

17
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,833
All they need is some tender
love, and a healthy polish.

18
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,500
Oh yes,
that's better...

19
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,041
Okay, Doc.

20
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,333
Fun's over...

21
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,208
It's time we discuss
how you'll pay us back--

22
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,041
for her and the rest.

23
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,291
See you next time.

24
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,250
What the fuck
was that, Chief?!

25
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,083
Why the fuck'd they
all get released?

26
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,666
We had them by
the balls you idiot...!

27
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,583
Illegal Possession of
Firearms-- and they walk??

28
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,875
They didn't walk they were
just processed quickly...!

29
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,791
The judge paroled them
with suspended sentences,

30
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,583
since it was their first
offense, so we had no choice!

31
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,000
You're telling
me they were tried

32
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,875
and sentenced
in three days??

33
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,333
Well, yes! I know it's
unusual, but it happened!

34
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,916
And I was ordered not to
get involved in the case!

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,791
And you just swallowed the
command with a big happy gulp...

36
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,916
Do you have any desire to
protect this city at all?

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,916
I have a mortgage--
that's what I have!

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,041
car payments, my daughter's
tuition, just leave me alone!

39
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:52,791
You're really making this a
lot harder than it has to be.

40
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,125
Now either you
spill your guts,

41
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,000
or I start spilling
them for you.

42
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,541
My guys ain't exactly
the top of the food chain--

43
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,250
they just told us to bring the
photographer, Saiga, to 'em...

44
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,291
I don't know nuthin'
else, damn it-- I swear!

45
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,833
What about Saiga--
where is he now?

46
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,041
I don't know-- last I heard
he ain't been caught.

47
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,291
You just qualified
for self-defense.

48
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,791
What in the world
is going on?

49
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,958
His apartment
getting ransacked.

50
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,125
The underground fire.

51
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,833
And the midnight
shooting in Odaiba.

52
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,250
Someone powerful
has stepped in,

53
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,666
and made it seem
like none of it happened.

54
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,541
But Saiga knew...

55
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,083
And now he's been
erased, too...

56
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,666
No matter who I ask,
or where I look,

57
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,541
I can't find him.

58
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,958
What the hell
is going on??

59
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,416
Saiga...
Where have you gone??

60
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,875
Have at it...

61
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,958
Detective,
what are you doing?

62
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,916
I've got some film
I need developed, pronto.

63
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,333
That's gotta be
a thousand rolls!

64
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,208
Yeah, and?

65
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,541
Wow! It's so
beautiful...!

66
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,625
Where are we?

67
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,250
We're outside
of Shimoda...

68
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,583
You've learned
about that, right...?

69
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,625
Japan's first port open
to ships from the West.

70
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,416
Really...? You seem to know
about everything, Mr. Saiga.

71
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,041
I bet you've been
all over the world?

72
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,291
Yeah.

73
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,875
I never have.

74
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,291
In fact, I've never been
outside of Tokyo until now.

75
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,458
I used to dream about
places like this, though.

76
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,291
Never left Tokyo?

77
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,416
My god. Don't schools take
kids on field-trips anymore?

78
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,416
Yes. But I've never
been allowed to go.

79
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,958
And my family never went
on any trips, either.

80
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,208
You see, my family's
kind of strange.

81
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:03,166
My mother hates me,
and I don't know why.

82
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,250
Hey... You remember
that first night

83
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,291
when we were floating
on that buoy...?

84
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,916
As far as I know,
that's the first time

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,541
I'd ever left
Japan's shores.

86
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,166
What's wrong?

87
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,750
Sorry, it's just...
It's just a headache.

88
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,250
You gonna be all right?

89
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,875
Yeah, I should be.

90
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,708
I think I just need to lie back
like this for a little while.

91
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,625
I see. Well
I'm glad you told me now.

92
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,666
As it so happens, the guy we're
on our way to see is a doctor...

93
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,833
I was planning to have him
check us both out anyway--

94
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,375
we can just add
that to the list.

95
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,708
This is my fault...
I'm so sorry.

96
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,708
Drop the bag of
guilt, Kagura...

97
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,625
It's not yours to carry.

98
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,666
Yeah.

99
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,583
Tsujido.

100
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,500
It's that big shot from
the Traffic Department.

101
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,208
They're headed south on
the Tomei Expressway.

102
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,500
Our cameras caught them as
they took the Gotemba Center

103
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,791
exit onto Route 246.

104
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,041
By the way, any news
on the club reopening?

105
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,625
It won't be long...

106
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,833
And you have my word,
the moment it does open,

107
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,583
you'll get free admission...

108
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,875
In gratitude for your help.

109
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,916
They're on the Izu Peninsula.

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,250
We'll rendezvous there.

111
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,125
Roger that.

112
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,541
Good news, Doc. You're
about to get a new patient.

113
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,250
You got a good nose, sir.

114
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,250
But it's still no match
for their high-tech toys.

115
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,208
If I could smell
every fetid thing

116
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,333
that was happening
in this city,

117
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,958
I would have lost
my mind a long time ago.

118
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,166
Hello?

119
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,500
Hey Doc, you in here?
Guess not...

120
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,625
Yeah, go ahead and sign
in... I'll be right up.

121
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,041
Hope you're cheap.

122
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,625
War photographers don't
make dick these days...

123
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,291
War photog--?
Well I'll be damned.

124
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,458
So you're closing down
the ol' clinic, huh?

125
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,583
That's correct,
I've decided to re-enlist

126
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,125
with one of the
medical N.P.O.s.

127
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,458
You dragging
your wife along?

128
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,750
She passed on ...
'bout three months ago.

129
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,791
It was cancer
that took her,

130
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,958
it must have been eating
her away for months--

131
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,208
by the time I got back
to Japan it was too late...

132
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,958
And you know through
the entire ordeal...

133
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,000
she never once laid
the obvious blame.

134
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,958
What a god-damned
pitiful story.

135
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,333
I'm an M.D., and I didn't
even know she was sick.

136
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,208
So sorry to hear that, Doc.

137
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,750
I hate telling people--

138
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,291
feels like I could choke on
all the undeserved sympathy...

139
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,666
But anyhow... What brings
you to my clinic? --

140
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,833
Don't tell me you just came to
show off your young girlfriend.

141
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,625
I can't give you
details, honestly...

142
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,041
But I was hoping you could
run a few tests on us both...

143
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,875
Blood work...
CAT-Scans...

144
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,416
Even DNA, if possible.

145
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,666
DNA...? X-Rays are about
all I can do out here...

146
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,291
You'd have to go into
one of the major hospitals

147
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,041
if you want
testing like that.

148
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,916
I was hoping you could use
some of your connections for me.

149
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,125
Okay.

150
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,625
How could I say
no to you, Saiga?

151
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,708
I've done work with a
hospital not far from here.

152
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,958
I'll give 'em a call.

153
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,083
You're the best
there is, Doc.

154
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,333
Done yet?

155
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:38,041
I've worked all day, and
I've hardly made a dent.

156
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,083
These photographs...

157
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,708
They're Tatsumi Saiga's,
aren't they?

158
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,750
He was at your
last crime scene.

159
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,500
What? You know of him?

160
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,833
Of course. Anyone does,
who's serious about photography.

161
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,666
His images are so potent.

162
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,208
Like he fits the whole history
of the world in every frame.

163
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,208
It's a world
I can hardly imagine,

164
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,958
but he stares
it in the face.

165
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,166
Doctor?

166
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,416
Since you're his friend...

167
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,708
Would you mind telling
me more about him?

168
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,083
Saiga?

169
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,916
Yes, anything you
know would be helpful.

170
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,708
I want to learn where he
came from... Who he is.

171
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,041
Truth is, for as long
as I've known him...

172
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:22,166
I don't know
much about him.

173
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,041
Honestly, I can
only remember one time

174
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,000
when he talked about himself,
and his past...

175
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,375
It was over ten years ago,
on a chaotic newsroom floor...

176
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,291
A young man came in to see me
with a cut-and-dry offer--

177
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,458
he'd pay his own way
to the frontlines,

178
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,083
as long as we paid
him market price

179
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,000
for the photos
he sent back.

180
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,500
That's how I met Saiga.

181
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,583
At the time I was
fighting with the public,

182
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,750
protesting the war in one
of the more radical weeklies...

183
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,458
I suppose that's how
the kid found out about me.

184
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,041
So what's your answer?

185
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,958
You gonna take my deal...?
Or aren't you?

186
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,125
You get that in by tonight's
deadline, damn it...!

187
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,416
No bull!!

188
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,083
Why on earth you wanna
go to a place like that?

189
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,083
I'm a photographer......
It's my life...

190
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,750
And I want to give
my life to its pursuit,

191
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,833
the way Capa,
and Sawada did.

192
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,291
I was dumbstruck.

193
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,291
Here was a young man
not only willing,

194
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,791
but wanting to risk
his life for a cause.

195
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,291
In this shit-hole world

196
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,541
where the only values
come on price tags,

197
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,416
he was a breed
I thought was extinct.

198
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,041
And then, less than
two weeks later...

199
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,958
We got his first rolls
from the battlefield,

200
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,000
and again I was
knocked off my feet.

201
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,833
He was literally risking
everything out there...

202
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,666
Wandering the frontlines
day after day

203
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,291
for a snapshot of truth.

204
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,666
He was unbelievably
reckless, sure...

205
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,083
But his pictures struck
a chord with the public...

206
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,666
He was a household name.

207
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,250
Pleased to meet
you, Mr. Saiga...

208
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,791
I heard you're going on a
search-and-destroy mission...

209
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,250
Oh, yeah...
I'm Sid...

210
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,500
With the U.S. News Service.

211
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,291
Hello, Sid...
Pleasure's mine...

212
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,166
Though I guess
I can't get my scoop...

213
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,583
Now that you're here.

214
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,208
I'm going to take advantage
of your good fortune...

215
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,916
People talk
about your unit...

216
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,541
Say it always
comes back alive.

217
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,583
Everybody at base camp is just
superstitious, that's all...

218
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,625
Trust me, nothing is
certain in this place.

219
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,708
I just don't get it...

220
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,083
It's one thing to go to war with
a gun and join in the fight...

221
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,166
But charging into battle
armed with a camera--

222
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,291
what the hell's
the point of that?

223
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,208
Maybe this doesn't make sense,
from a cop's perspective.

224
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,291
But a war photographer
is looking for something

225
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,250
more abstract than the win/loss
columns on a general's desk.

226
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,375
It's not about their
lives, or glory.

227
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,333
It's about the work
they leave behind.

228
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,083
Putting a face
on the war...

229
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,625
Is their presence going to
change the battle's outcome?

230
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,041
Not a chance in hell.

231
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,750
Shit...

232
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,625
Showtime!

233
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,083
They save no lives,
and take no lives--

234
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,375
endangering no one else
but themselves.

235
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,916
Through showers of bullets,
exploding grenades,

236
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,916
even fields littered with
mines, they charge ahead.

237
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,458
You ain't getting
there before me.

238
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,166
Hey!

239
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,000
And they drop
like flies.

240
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,333
War photography's an
investment of sorts--

241
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,583
in the immediate sense the
work doesn't matter at all...

242
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,833
But later on, when it reaches
the public back home

243
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
through the newspapers...

244
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,291
Or years afterward, when
people's memories begin to fade,

245
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,458
that's when the
pictures really shine...

246
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,375
They become windows
to that moment in history.

247
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,416
People like us can stand
with the photographer

248
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,875
on that battlefield,

249
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,375
and try to make sense of the
mess we got ourselves in--

250
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,708
or in the very least,
acknowledge the horror of it.

251
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,791
All done.

252
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,458
Okay.

253
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,375
Such an overwhelming
life story...

254
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,125
I can't imagine what
it's been like for him.

255
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,041
No. I doubt anyone
who hasn't been there,

256
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,833
in the heat of battle,
really can...

257
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,500
It changes a person.

258
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,291
You become
accustomed to it.

259
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,541
To seeing the dead.

260
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,541
Your body and soul wear down
from the endless trauma,

261
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,291
until something inside
you just shuts off.

262
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,875
Eventually his luck ran out.

263
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,583
He suffered critical injuries,

264
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,250
and was barely saved by
an NPO Doctor named Ryogoku

265
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,750
who found Saiga wasting away
in a crude foreign hospital...

266
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,750
After that I pulled some
strings and forced him

267
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,333
to come back to Japan.

268
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,333
See... I thought it was
in his best interest,

269
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,333
but it's a decision
I've come to regret.

270
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,875
Regret?

271
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,166
Ever since he got off that
plane, his eyes have been dead.

272
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,583
The battlefield was the
one place he was alive.

273
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,916
Looks like the power
depends on the lens,

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,166
and its focal distance...

275
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,041
She has awoken
your potential,

276
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,541
and turned your deepest
desire into reality.

277
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,041
So, what kind of
investigation is this?

278
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,500
The none-of-your-business kind.

279
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,708
I should tell you...

280
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,291
He was looking into
a certain... secret club.

281
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,291
Secret club, eh?

282
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,125
Damn you, Saiga.

283
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,041
Are your eyes dead
to me now, too?

284
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,166
Stop.

285
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,375
Hello, Miss Kagura.
I've found you.

286
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,708
Let's talk in here.

287
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,791
He's such a good boy...

288
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,500
Does she have any family?

289
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,791
Not really...
They're... estranged...

290
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,375
Why, is there something
wrong with her?

291
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,541
Well...

292
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,666
Then I guess you're
the one I need to tell.

293
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,000
There, you see it?

294
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,708
A dark spot on her brain.

295
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,333
Odds are that's a tumor.

296
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,083
And it's a large one, too...

297
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,625
It looks to be pressing
against her parietal lobe...

298
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,208
The location makes
removal impossible.

299
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,625
Meaning...?

300
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,125
There's nothing we can do...

301
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,291
I'll be blunt, Saiga--

302
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,333
she probably has
six months, at best.

303
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,583
How do you live by the
ticking of a clock?

304
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,500
Do you count
each pendulum swing,

305
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,958
or try to pretend
you hear nothing at all?

306
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,791
There's a doctor in the dark,
anxious for a second opinion.

307
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,750
And when the sounds
of the piano die,

308
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,125
the mountain
will begin to slide.
