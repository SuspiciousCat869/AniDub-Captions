1
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,166
There was a man on that
barstool last night

2
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,291
smoking like a freight
train-- who was he?

3
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,750
Look around...
It's a bar...

4
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,916
There were a lot
of men smoking...

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,625
most of 'em like it
was goin' out of style.

6
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,083
I told you I don't
know who he is...

7
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,458
What're ya doin'...?

8
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,875
That's some perfectly
good whiskey!

9
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,041
Fuck! Fuck!
Okay!

10
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,000
The guy you're lookin' for's
a photographer, named Saiga!

11
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,750
Now grab that extinguisher
and put me the fuck out!

12
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,125
"Tatsumi Saiga... renowned
freelance photographer.

13
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,208
He made his name documenting
the wars of Africa, Asia

14
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,791
and the Middle East.

15
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,583
His images are at once
vibrant and haunting,

16
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,666
stirring the souls of all those
who lay eyes upon them...

17
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,125
And this humble reporter

18
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,541
surely cannot be the only
one left wondering...

19
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,958
how the Pulitzer could have
eluded him for so long."

20
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,875
Tatsumi...
Saiga.

21
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
A war photographer eh?

22
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,541
Yes... He's in Tokyo now
toiling away in obscurity.

23
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,708
Surely he couldn't have
been on that battlefield...

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,708
I'm having his place
watched around the clock,

25
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,875
but he's yet to return.

26
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,666
Should we attempt to lure
Mister Saiga back home?

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,250
There'd be no point...

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,166
A man like him can't
be seduced with money.

29
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,083
The roll of film
he left behind...

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,083
Have it developed.

31
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,583
I want to see his work.

32
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,291
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,250
They really called
the police? That's bad!

34
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,708
Why? I didn't get
the ticket...

35
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,375
Creepy!
Total hentai.

36
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,750
I'll bet he's going up
there to buy some panties.

37
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,375
Yeah the ones
you just sold!

38
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,666
Manager, you got
any fresh ones?

39
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,375
Maybe something
in a blonde...

40
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,375
What the hell...?

41
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,708
So we meet again...

42
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,541
Interesting hobby
you got here...

43
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,833
Senator.

44
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,708
You -
you're that--

45
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,375
Where... am I?

46
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,125
Awake at last.

47
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,541
The tawdry fetish
of a Senator...

48
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,041
A trashy enough shot'll
cover my rent for a year...

49
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,125
Soon they'll all
know your secret.

50
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,625
You bastard-- what is
the meaning of this??

51
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,083
Voters'll kick your
ass outta the House...

52
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,916
and then your wife
will do the same.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,458
No...! What do you
want from me?!

54
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,250
Saw you leaving the
hotel that night--

55
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,541
were you there
when your colleague

56
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,333
in the Health Ministry
was decapitated?

57
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,000
Did you pop his head off?

58
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,875
Of course not...! I only went
to Nakano's room because...

59
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,791
Mister Suitengu told--

60
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,250
"Mister Suitengu"?

61
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,208
Why don'tcha tell me all
about your secret boss...

62
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,875
and that underground club
of his you belong to.

63
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,291
No...
I can't.

64
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,333
Wha-- What... the hell
kinda camera is that?!

65
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,875
You tell me--

66
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,375
ever since I dropped in
on your twisted club...

67
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,000
it's had a lot more flash...

68
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,666
So how 'bout you
start talking?

69
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,166
If I talk...

70
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,208
I'm a dead man,
soon as I leave!

71
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,833
If you don't, you're
a dead man now.

72
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,583
Hold on-- I'll talk I'll talk
just put that damn camera down!

73
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,333
One night, at an otherwise
unmemorable cocktail party,

74
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,500
a stranger approached
me out of the blue.

75
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,666
This man, Suitengu, knew
all about my "proclivities."

76
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,083
He told me there was a club
that catered to people like me.

77
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,958
The first few visits
would be gratis

78
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,541
and if I liked
what I saw,

79
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,583
I could pay annual
membership dues...

80
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,208
and receive services well
worth the exorbitant fee.

81
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,750
Frankly I was shocked...

82
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,375
These were people not even
I could brush shoulders

83
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,166
with in the outside world.

84
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,375
All the highest
of the high were there--

85
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,791
the nation's movers
and shakers.

86
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,291
And this club was the one place
they could gather together,

87
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,583
in tacit agreement
of secrecy,

88
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,875
while forging a
network of power.

89
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,458
That's when I realized--

90
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,625
those who weren't in this club
could never climb to the top.

91
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,125
It was just another
wrung on the ladder.

92
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,958
And it served a purpose.

93
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,750
The heavier the
responsibility,

94
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,875
the heavier the stress...

95
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,250
Every man has latent hungers
that yearn to be fed...

96
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,333
This club is a necessary evil.

97
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,083
Those in power need somewhere to
release those urges most of all!

98
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,750
So you're telling me orgies
are what keep the wheels

99
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,250
of this country turning...?

100
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,291
Do you even hear the shit
that's coming out of your mouth?

101
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,958
Now, tell me
about the ritual.

102
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,166
Does it have anything
to do with me

103
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,125
turning into whatever
it is I've become?

104
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,041
I don't... I don't know,
I'm not a VIP...

105
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,083
They're the only club members
allowed to attend the rituals.

106
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,291
But I've heard...

107
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,041
when the Goddess
bestows her blessing

108
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,041
you experience supreme bliss...

109
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,583
and your deepest
desire is fulfilled.

110
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,208
Blessing of the Goddess ...

111
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,208
I swear, that's all I
know about the ritual...!

112
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,625
But take my advice...

113
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,833
If you value your life
even the slightest bit

114
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,125
don't get involved
with that club!

115
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,125
The place is flooding!

116
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,916
Please, you gotta take
these cuffs off me!

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,125
Hurry!

118
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,541
Oh, thank God!
Ah, it slipped!

119
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,375
Hey, where you going?
You can't just...

120
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,791
Don't get involved, huh...?

121
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,291
A little late for that.

122
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,583
She has awoken
your potential,

123
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,791
and turned your deepest
desire into reality.

124
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,125
I'll die if I have to stay!

125
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,791
It's back--
I wanna take photos...

126
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,041
Shot after shot
after shot...!

127
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,000
I may be on a
treacherous path,

128
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,750
but I will follow
it to the end!

129
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,875
Hey, excuse me, girls.
Can I take your picture?

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,916
Oh, please...
Forgive me...

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,750
I haven't even
introduced myself yet-

132
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,083
I'm a photographer...
For Tokyo Girl magazine.

133
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,541
Have you seen it?

134
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,708
Only like every month!

135
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,416
Yeah, I got a subscription.

136
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,166
We're looking for models
for next month's issue

137
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
and I think you've
got the look. Interested?

138
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,416
Hell yeah, we are!

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,833
Sorry girls, your dreams
of fame'll have to wait.

140
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,166
I know better than to
carry a loaded camera.

141
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,916
All right, give it to me.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,416
Yeah, play with your hair.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,916
Yeah, just like that.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,666
Okay, now you: smile!

145
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,791
Gorgeous...

146
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,666
Man you two are pros!

147
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,458
You go to St. Ignatius
right...?

148
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,041
You wouldn't happen
to know a girl there

149
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,791
by the name of
Kagura Tennozu?

150
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,041
Well yeah, of course.

151
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,666
She's a celebutante.

152
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah I shot her
the other day...

153
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,375
I need to get some
retakes on her.

154
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,916
Good luck finding
her at school.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,541
She hasn't been
around in days.

156
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,583
Huh... You know why?

157
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,083
No, not really...

158
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,541
I heard her mom's paying our
teacher for private lessons.

159
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,000
Seriously?

160
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,416
Private tutoring
at home, huh?

161
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Good afternoon...

162
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

163
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,958
Beg your pardon... but
where is Miss Wakaba?

164
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,500
Well regrettably...

165
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,958
Miss Wakaba got a little tied
up in the classroom so...

166
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,250
I'll be filling in
as substitute today.

167
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,791
No bugs in here.

168
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,166
Excuse me...

169
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,875
I'd like to make a personal
call if you please.

170
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,958
Uhhh... I've brewed some
fresh tea for you.

171
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,875
Door's open.

172
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,541
So, Chief, any word on that
underground fire in Roppongi?

173
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,875
Well...

174
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,583
the boys over in arson say
it could be weeks-months

175
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,500
even-before repairs
are finished down there.

176
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,791
When's this go public?

177
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,583
There's a press conference
tomorrow afternoon.

178
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,666
Means there's still
a few hours

179
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,541
to sell my East
Kanto Internet stock

180
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,666
and buy up shares
of Tojo Electric.

181
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,000
They're gonna be up to their
asses in no-bid contracts soon

182
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,875
as this gets out.

183
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,375
Just a memo to myself...

184
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,666
So... whadda ya want
from me Chief?

185
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,208
Uh... Would staying...

186
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,791
behind your desk be
too much to ask of you?

187
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,250
I see...

188
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,625
You don't want me on the
streets-- is that how it is?

189
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,833
No, no...
It's just that...

190
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,791
when you leave the
office--people...

191
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,500
they tend to get hurt...

192
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,208
And when people get hurt
they tend to get lawyers.

193
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,291
So, you didn't
lose my number...

194
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,500
You must really
want something bad.

195
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,958
Actually, I just want
to return a favor...

196
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,833
That double homicide,
the Roppongi fire,

197
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,041
the shooting in Odaiba...

198
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,583
If you listen to me...

199
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,083
You should be able to round up
all the suspects at once,

200
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,500
and get all
the credit for it.

201
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,791
Well... When you put it like
that, I can't afford not to.

202
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,125
Does this mean
you're going out?!

203
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,083
Hey sugar...
wanna have some fun?

204
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,333
Shit.

205
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,125
You must be lookin' for a man,

206
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,958
'cause you ain't gonna find
a better woman than me!

207
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,458
See anything yet?

208
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,250
Nada...

209
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,583
You think this guy's dense
enough to come back home?

210
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,125
That's not your concern...

211
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,083
Just keep watching--
is that clear?

212
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,083
Crystal.

213
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,125
Oh, yeah...

214
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,750
Right there...
Yeah that's it...

215
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,416
Mister Slotnik
you naughty boy,

216
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,125
you've been overworking
your pelvic muscles!

217
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,583
Come one, come all.
Door's open!

218
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,000
Jesus Christ...
All right, all right.

219
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,500
You know how to open
a door don't you?

220
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,750
Just put your hand on
the knob and twist...

221
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,750
It's just like...

222
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,041
You... you that crazy bitch
who's stalking Saiga.

223
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,750
You can go yank
yourself Yankee...

224
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,000
and while you're at it...

225
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,791
you can give us...
your apartment.

226
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,750
Why me?

227
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,750
Is it him?

228
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,166
Can't see-- damn
blinds are in the way.

229
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,541
Gather up the men.

230
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,333
Odd. I haven't
picked up his scent.

231
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,250
Miss Kagura... it's time
for your tutoring session.

232
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,125
I think I've seen
enough of Miss Wakaba.

233
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,500
Actually Miss Wakaba
isn't here today...

234
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,916
but a Mister Saiga
has come in her place.

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,250
Mister Saiga?

236
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,250
Hi Kagura... Are you ready
for your lesson?

237
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,833
This way.

238
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,583
I've come for you.

239
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,666
Who are you?

240
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,083
Take a guess.

241
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,041
Tatsumi Saiga...
Photographer...

242
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,125
Someone who knows freedom.

243
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,416
You've done your homework.

244
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,416
So what are you going to
teach me today Mister Saiga?

245
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,416
How to be free of course...
You coming?

246
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
Yes!

247
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,375
Close your eyes for me.

248
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,583
I take it you guys
are the perps...

249
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,333
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

250
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,833
For the record that
was self-defense.

251
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,208
Freeze!

252
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,333
Self-defense!
Self-defense!

253
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,750
Sounds like a war
zone up there!

254
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,708
Pigs must'a ambushed 'em!

255
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,166
Damn it, he set us up!

256
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,291
Mister Saiga... how do we
get out of here?

257
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,416
You just leave that to me.

258
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,791
I will need to borrow this.

259
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,041
Good wind.

260
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,166
Keep your eyes closed
and hold on tight.

261
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,083
Um, yeah.

262
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,083
Son of a bitch...

263
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,958
How dare you keep
humiliating me?

264
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,250
I see... Perfect.

265
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,875
Tonight... You two shall have
an exclusive audience...

266
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,250
you shall see my true dance!

267
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,916
You all right?

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,916
Heck, yeah!

269
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,250
Divine Goddess... it's not
like you to shy away.

270
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,958
Who are you-- I've never
seen you before in my life.

271
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,333
You're one of them.

272
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,833
Yes, like you,
I've had the pleasure

273
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,250
of the Goddess' blessing.

274
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,791
Mister Saiga...
what was that?

275
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,291
I'll explain later...

276
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,041
Right now I'm gonna
distract him...

277
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,625
That's when you
make a break for it.

278
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,833
But then what?

279
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,125
Under that billboard?

280
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,791
Yeah, wait for me
under the billboard

281
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,458
we saw from the buoy...

282
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,708
I'll come for you.

283
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,291
I promise. Now go!

284
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,041
Okay.

285
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,208
What?!

286
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,083
Your aim's a little
off, cameraman.

287
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,166
It was you...! You're the
one who killed Nakano!

288
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,041
You're familiar
with my work?

289
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,291
Oh, now that didn't work!

290
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:24,416
What kinda...
twisted freak are you?

291
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,166
One who has
transcended humanity.

292
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,875
I grasped at the light that
shines within her heart,

293
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,000
and plucked true bliss.

294
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,958
A man with pleasure
does not mind his chains.

295
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,125
His desires fulfilled,
he walks gladly through hell.

296
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,208
Am I so different from you?

297
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,625
You are...

298
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,208
'Cause I...

299
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,833
I never wanted
this power!

300
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,416
You wouldn't have the power
if you didn't want it.

301
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,333
Your desire is to steal
life with your lens.

302
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,000
It's just too bad you'll
die before capturing me,

303
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,625
the ultimate subject.

304
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,291
See, while I've enjoyed
our pas de deux,

305
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,666
it's come time
for the coda.

306
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,041
Even a Euphoric will perish
if his head is taken off...

307
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,291
So I shall twist off yours
like I did the rest.

308
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,083
Thanks for the tip.

309
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,125
What do you know...?
My desire was fulfilled.

310
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,708
How does this nobody keep
slipping through our fingers?

311
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,166
I've got our best men setting
a trap for him as we speak.

312
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,500
Here...
The photographs he took.

313
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,958
He has quite an eye.

314
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,541
Saiga!

315
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,666
Sorry to...
keep you waiting.

316
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,125
Saiga...!

317
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,375
I'm all right kid...
Forget about it.

318
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,708
When the sun goes down,
the city becomes a playground

319
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,875
where assassins roam.

320
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,250
And with the snap
of their fingers,

321
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,833
their darkest desires
