1
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,750
Officer!
Mind tellin' me

2
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,166
why the hell you're all
just standin' around?

3
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,708
Technically that's
federal land,

4
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,750
we haven't gotten
clearance to step in yet.

5
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,583
What are you
talkin' about?

6
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,291
Our superiors haven't
given us any orders at all.

7
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,875
The Prime Minister's house
has been attacked...!

8
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,083
Where's the SDF?

9
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,333
They shoulda been
called in by now!

10
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,583
We've tried them, but they
don't have orders, either.

11
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,541
Across the board, none of
the higher-ups can be found.

12
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,958
What, did they fall into
a fuckin' black hole...?

13
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,583
There's gotta be somebody,
uh, the D-Defense Minister!

14
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,333
Or the Deputy
Prime Minister!

15
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,916
If they're important
enough to give orders,

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,458
you're not gonna find 'em.

17
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,125
Captain Ginza!

18
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,958
How the hell do ya
know that...?

19
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,708
Hey!

20
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,125
Saiga!

21
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,666
You two!
Hands up!

22
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,541
Not so fast.

23
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,916
Captain Ginza,
New Metro P.D...

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,333
These guys aren't suspects,
they're with me...

25
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,625
You go on inside
and look for survivors.

26
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,791
Weren't you listening?

27
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,000
We don't have
authorization for that.

28
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,125
Forget your goddamn
authorization...

29
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,000
The whole place
is a blood bath...

30
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,666
Now do the job you're paid for
and try to save some lives!

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,500
If you got a badge,
come with us!

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,500
Yes, sir!

33
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,916
Jesus, what
happened in there?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,583
Kamiya's dead.
Suitengu killed him.

35
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,041
What?

36
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,208
Tell me you at least
got some pictures.

37
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,833
Sorry,
no such luck.

38
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,416
That isn't like you.

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,583
Give him a break, old man, don't
you know what his camera doe--

40
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,916
Drop it.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,625
You! Get your gear.
We're goin' in.

42
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,041
Tell me you're gonna
get a scoop out of this.

43
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:41,125
You're damn straight, a full
exposé on how the mighty fall.

44
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,458
Gotta avenge Joe's
death somehow.

45
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,166
Come on. Let's get
you outta here.

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,541
What is this?
Who the hell is this guy?

47
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,625
Choji Suitengu, CEO
of the Tennozu Group.

48
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,791
I see. The manager of
the secret club in question?

49
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,333
That's not all.
He seems to be the beast

50
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,916
that wiped out our Special
Forces eight years ago,

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,083
when they were
secretly deployed

52
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,333
to neutralize
a bio-weapons lab,

53
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,500
after our treaties
made it too risky.

54
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,083
Uh-huh... So he's a,
he's a leftover

55
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,000
from the living
weapons project

56
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,166
we funded in
collaboration with Japan.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,791
I was briefed on
it this morning.

58
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,708
He's managed to stay under
our radar all this time.

59
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,041
Mr. President, we must
eliminate him. Right now.

60
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,416
I agree in principle, sir.

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,708
But we've lost contact with
the Japanese government.

62
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,833
Our hands are tied.

63
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,625
We don't need the Japanese
government's approval...

64
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,333
Let our diplomats deal
with the clean up.

65
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,541
However... The United
Nations Resolution--

66
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,125
This situation calls for
immediate action...

67
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,791
We're not dealing
with a human...

68
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,625
We'll make up
reasons later.

69
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,083
Say there was a bio-terror
threat in the heart of Tokyo

70
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,958
and we saved the day...

71
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,291
You've seen the video.

72
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,166
Deploy soldiers, and
they'll just become

73
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,625
more sacrificial lambs.

74
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,958
We're not going to use troops
to exterminate this monster.

75
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,958
Right now he's holed up
in a skyscraper,

76
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,416
and our ships already
have the coordinates.

77
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
If we act now,
we can kill him quickly

78
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,416
and minimize casualties.

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,833
At the same time,
we can show the world

80
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,958
our military dominance.

81
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,583
And think about it.

82
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,791
It's the perfect opportunity
to sell our new arms to Japan.

83
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,291
Well hell.
I'm on board.

84
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,458
So, it's decided then?

85
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,625
"Moral America
Rescues Corrupt Japan,"

86
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,208
that's one heck
of a spin job,

87
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,750
considering
what we're about to do.

88
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,625
I don't know how you
stayed on your feet

89
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,375
with those wounds, pal...

90
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,958
But with the way
your body heals,

91
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,333
you should be up and
runnin' before too long.

92
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,291
Don't even try it.

93
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,000
Why don't you tie
him to the bed?

94
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,750
I can lend you my cuffs,
but bandages oughtta work.

95
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,708
Ginza... I appreciate
you being here,

96
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,958
but don't you have
bigger fish to fry?

97
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,041
Speaking of... Where have you
been all this time, Captain...?

98
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,250
I've been trying to--...

99
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,416
Last night the Chief's
house burned down...

100
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,875
They-- they found
his body inside.

101
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,583
Yeah. Tough break.

102
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,916
Wait.
You already knew?

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,666
Of course.
I killed him.

104
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,000
What?!

105
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,083
I saw the manifest
for that secret club,

106
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,083
and the prick's
name was on it...

107
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,375
I went to grill
him about it,

108
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,416
and he had a whole
fucking room full of legs

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,583
from women
he'd butchered.

110
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,166
He killed his wife and
kid and he almost got me.

111
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,125
Every politician and offical
who's worth a shit

112
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,916
went to that
Club last night.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,958
The doors are sealed, so they're
prob'ly still stuck inside.

114
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,958
But that means Japan's without a
working government right now...

115
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,666
And the attack on the
Prime Minister's house--

116
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,875
my god, is this what
Suitengu had planned?

117
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,041
You think Suitengu's done
all this to stage a coup?

118
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,166
Hello, Bob's Massage
Parlor, this is Bob...

119
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,125
Who did you say?
Saiga's boss?...

120
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,375
Huh?
Turn on what news?

121
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,458
--interrupt today's
regular programming

122
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,041
to bring you
a special news report...

123
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,500
Yotsuya, are you there?

124
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes I am, Trisha, with
a serious development.

125
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,500
We've received
a press release

126
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,416
from the Emergency Crisis
Management Committee.

127
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,666
They've ordered a full,

128
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,333
mandatory evacuation
of Tokyo's Minato Ward,

129
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,666
effective immediately.
I repeat...

130
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,541
It's a full, mandatory
evacuation of the Minato Ward...

131
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,083
All residents and anyone
currently within the area

132
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,041
are required to vacate
without delay...

133
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,875
Evacuees should
leave quickly but calmly,

134
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,291
take only
what they can carry,

135
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,875
and follow all directions
given by the SDF.

136
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,250
Okay, I'm watching...

137
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,166
So what the hell
does this mean?

138
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,958
The Japanese government couldn't
have ordered this evacuation...

139
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,000
Everyone with that
authority's gone.

140
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,375
Someone's pulling
the strings...

141
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,625
But...
Who could--?

142
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,583
The Americans, god damn it,
I'd bet my career on it.

143
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,166
They've taken
advantage of the chaos,

144
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,583
and infiltrated
Emergency Management.

145
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,583
There's only one reason
they'd order an evac.

146
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,083
And that's a
military assault.

147
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,250
This country's knee
deep in it now, Saiga.

148
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,541
You guys'd better get your
asses outta here, quick.

149
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,083
The Self-Defense force
and the police

150
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,208
will be directing traffic
along all major exit routes.

151
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,625
Evacuees should cooperate
with the officials,

152
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,000
and help those in the area
with limited mobility...

153
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,583
Once again, all residents
must vacate immediately,

154
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,708
Saiga!

155
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,125
You'll get yourself
killed...! Saiga!

156
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,416
Whoo!

157
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,708
Yeah!

158
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
Anarchy...

159
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,958
Thought
I'd seen it all...

160
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,791
Attention,
all citizens.

161
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,083
This is the
Self-Defense force.

162
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,208
This area
must be vacated.

163
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,916
Evacuation centers
have been readied

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,416
for you outside
the Minato Ward.

165
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,875
You will be safe there.

166
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,833
Please proceed
calmly, but quickly,

167
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,208
in a courteous
and orderly fashion.

168
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,083
Evacuation
is not a choice.

169
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,916
You must leave now.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,583
Back to you, Yotsuya.

171
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,000
Can you tell us anything about
the cause for this evacuation?

172
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,916
The administration
has still not released

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
any official statement...

174
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,041
But our sources tell us
that the explosions

175
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,416
at the Prime Minister's
home this morning

176
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,791
were caused by
military-grade weapons...

177
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,791
It is widely speculated this
evacuation has something to do

178
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,375
with that incident.

179
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,958
Am I to understand this is
possibly an act of terrorism?

180
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,250
Hey, let's go!

181
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,666
Saiga, wait!

182
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,458
So what I hoped
for wasn't true.

183
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,625
I wasn't a child born
out of love, after all.

184
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,875
You and I are human, my dear,
but not completely...

185
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,583
We are guinea pigs, ushered
along by the whims of fate...

186
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,541
And no matter how hard we
push against its current,

187
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,041
we cannot escape
our destiny...

188
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,750
Even if we did keep scraping
along and find a way to survive,

189
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,666
it would only be a life
of misery and pain...

190
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,125
Like Yui had.

191
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,875
She was only five
when it happened...

192
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,083
When we were hauled away.

193
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,833
At least I had Saiga to show
me the kind of freedom you

194
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,208
and your sister
never had.

195
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,291
Despite all the unsavory
things I've done,

196
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,500
whenever I looked at you,
Yui was there...

197
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,250
Deep, beneath it all.

198
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,625
Saiga... What the hell
are you doing?

199
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,541
Suitengu's planning
to die tonight

200
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,500
and he's gonna
take Kagura with him.

201
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,083
You won't stop him...

202
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,166
You'll just lose what
sight you have left.

203
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,625
You're prob'ly
right, Doc,

204
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,916
but I'll be damned if that's
gonna stop me from trying.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,875
This-- everything
I've done--

206
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,791
it's been my choice.

207
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,583
Ever since that
first snap of the shutter

208
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,958
after my powers
were awoken,

209
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,875
I could feel I was on a
road that would end me...

210
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,375
If I truly hated it,
I would've stopped...

211
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,958
But for as long
as I can remember

212
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,375
photography's been like
breathing to me...

213
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,250
Without it I'll suffocate
in all this filth.

214
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,583
If my eyes are really
gonna quit on me,

215
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,208
I wanna be on the front
lines when it happens...

216
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,416
I want the last thing
I see to be through a lens.

217
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,541
When you do get
Kagura back,

218
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,208
bring her
straight to me.

219
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,708
I found the answer in
Nishiya's journal...

220
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,541
They've kept her from
having her first period

221
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,833
because the hormone
change in her body

222
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,708
could reverse the
syndrome's effects--

223
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,041
that's how
it was designed.

224
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,833
You mean, you could
save her life?

225
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,625
I'm holding you
to that, Doc...

226
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,916
I promise I'll
get her out alive.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,708
Get yourself
out alive, too.

228
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,958
Where are you
slinking off to, Tiger...?

229
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,333
Blind as you are...

230
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Wanna take a guess?

231
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,250
I'm not stupid enough to think
I can talk you out of it...

232
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,833
So I guess I'll suck it
up and take you there.

233
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,166
Ginza, you--...

234
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,250
I went to that club
last night...

235
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,416
And it hit me...

236
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,250
This country's elite
only care about excess.

237
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,041
They're fucked
beyond belief. But...

238
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,625
I'm the same...
Just on a smaller scale...

239
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,208
Playing the system
to grab whatever I can,

240
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,333
doing it all for the money
or a good piece of ass...

241
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,875
Tell you the truth
I'm sick of myself...

242
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,125
Disgusted by the
things I've done...

243
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,375
And I'm tired of
livin' on empty...

244
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,416
I wanna do something
that means a shit.

245
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,000
Too easy.

246
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,250
I told you he'd come.

247
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,375
Let's do this.

248
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,291
Hold up. I got a handle
on these fuckers. You go up.

249
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,125
Ginza...

250
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,125
Now which one of you
wants some self-defense?

251
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,708
Now it gets good.

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,250
Those trigger-happy idiots...

253
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,250
They have no clue what they're
getting themselves into.

254
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,250
That music.

255
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,500
Son of a bitch.

256
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,958
So it was you...

257
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,708
With the music box on
that island years ago.

258
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,750
And that's where you contracted
the carrier virus as well.

259
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,083
Tatsumi Saiga,
I knew you'd come...

260
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,333
Your destiny and
mine are intertwined.

261
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,625
Mystery solved.

262
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,166
I finally see what
you've been up to.

263
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,750
With the power you had,

264
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,958
you could have easily killed
Shinsen and Kamiya long ago,

265
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,291
and had your revenge.

266
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,208
But you waited,
biding your time.

267
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,583
And this is why.

268
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,958
I have six hundred trillion
yen in cash here...

269
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,208
Including stocks and bonds,
it's triple that amount.

270
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,958
Tonight it will
all turn to ash,

271
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,291
and the Tennozu
Group will crumble...

272
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,833
The Bank of Japan and every
major company in the nation

273
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,250
have invested far more than
is legal in the Tennozu Group,

274
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,750
and far more than they
can afford to lose.

275
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,208
When this money disappears,

276
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,000
the entire country
will go bankrupt.

277
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,750
That's your true revenge...?
A total financial collapse?

278
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,416
If I had merely killed
Shinsen and Kamiya

279
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,625
what difference
would that have made...?

280
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,458
No one would have
missed them...

281
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,791
They would have only been
replaced by new heads,

282
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,000
while the Hydra
continued to thrive.

283
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,291
You see, Saiga, on the
battlefield I realized

284
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,500
the true object
of my vengeance --

285
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,458
the one that orphaned
me and my sister.

286
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:48,125
It was society itself--
a culture of greed...

287
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,458
Built from the
souls of mankind.

288
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,166
You're talking about
fighting a system, an idea...

289
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,791
But it's people-- human beings
you're making pay the price!

290
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,291
I should've died
on that battlefield,

291
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,500
with the rest of my squad.

292
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,416
Then I wouldn't've had to
experience any of the suffering

293
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,916
that greeted me
when I returned to Japan.

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,750
But now this life...

295
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,958
The life my sister
willed me to lead,

296
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,791
can finally reach its end.

297
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,958
If you believe that,

298
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,250
what the hell was
my purpose for surviving?

299
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,958
When I was trapped
in that rubble...

300
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,666
Hearing that music was
the reason I held on.

301
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,916
If you think you were kept
alive for your sister's revenge,

302
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,083
then in a way
she saved me, too.

303
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,750
So why?

304
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,625
Maybe I'm here to keep you and
Kagura from being destroyed

305
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,958
by all this shit.

306
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,666
If you're here for Kagura,
you've come too late.

307
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,208
There was a billboard
on the waterfront

308
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,791
with a simple question.

309
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,541
One I'm still not
sure how to answer.

310
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,958
Every story needs a
final page, and trust me,

311
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,625
this one comes with a bang.
