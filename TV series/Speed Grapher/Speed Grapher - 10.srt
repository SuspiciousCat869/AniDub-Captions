1
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,250
Ah, they ain't in there.

2
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,958
From the smell of it
we just missed them.

3
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,000
But all's not lost--

4
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,875
Mister Suitengu says
he's got an idea

5
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,125
where they might be headed.

6
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,333
The hell's that
s'posed to mean?

7
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,666
Who can say?

8
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,750
You know the boss--
he's just full of mysteries.

9
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,958
Hey, lady!
You can't be here!

10
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,666
This is
a restricted area!

11
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
Yeah...
so rent-a-cop...

12
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,875
this is a real badge,
and that was self-defense.

13
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,083
Excuse me, Ms. Tennozu
is an extremely busy woman

14
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,291
and no one is permitted to see
her without an appointment,

15
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,750
not even the police.

16
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,625
Do you even have a
warrant to be here?

17
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,916
Hold onto
these for me...

18
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,875
This is a matter
between ladies--

19
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,958
doubt I'll need 'em.

20
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,625
Yes? Can I help you
with something?

21
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,875
Morning, ma'am.

22
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,416
Captain Hibari Ginza,
New Metropolitan Police.

23
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,291
You do understand that by
barging in here, uninvited,

24
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,750
you've greatly reduced my
willingness to cooperate.

25
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,375
What I understand...

26
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,875
is that your daughter hasn't
been seen at school in days.

27
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh, that's her!
That's the girl!

28
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:45,000
I recognize her--
she's practically famous.

29
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,958
So...
where's the girl?

30
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,541
Not that
it's your business,

31
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,666
but Kagura's simply
away on vacation.

32
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,458
Is that a fact?

33
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,000
The virginal daughter
of the Tennozu dynasty,

34
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,000
gallivanting around
with an older man...

35
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,666
A bit risque,
don'tcha think...?

36
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,666
Even by today's standards...

37
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,250
Just so we're clear-- are
you trying to blackmail me?

38
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,375
Oh no, this is
purely negotiation.

39
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,791
I'm offering to bring
your daughter back to you,

40
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,333
unharmed...

41
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,625
In exchange I want her traveling
companion returned to me,

42
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,041
with all his parts
still danglin'

43
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,458
where they're supposed to.

44
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,041
So that's what
this is about.

45
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,833
Here it is, just
beyond these gates...

46
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,500
The research lab mentioned
in that notebook.

47
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,125
Sure they went
this way boss?

48
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,500
Yes...

49
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,541
We're approaching
something up ahead...

50
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,083
It stinks to high hell.

51
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,750
Saiga...
Check this out.

52
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,708
I can't believe how
far underground it goes.

53
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,208
It's a fail-safe to
protect against biohazards.

54
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,041
Biohazards?

55
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,458
Yeah, like dangerous
bacteria or germs.

56
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,833
In the event of an accident,
having the labs underground

57
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,166
makes it easier to
contain any contamination.

58
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,416
Is that chlorine I smell...?

59
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
It kinda reminds me
of my mother's pool.

60
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,916
Must've disinfected the place
before shutting it down...

61
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,666
We're better off
splitting up...

62
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,208
You take the ground floor

63
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,166
on the off chance somebody
left some records lying around.

64
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,416
Yes.

65
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,875
And I'll take a
look downstairs.

66
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,875
Okay... we'll meet back
here in an hour.

67
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,416
Got it.

68
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,625
Little jumpy
there, Saiga?

69
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,041
Somebody must've had a good
reason to weld that door shut...

70
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,416
This won't be the brightest
thing I've ever done

71
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
but I'll be damned if
I'm gonna turn back now.

72
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,500
This is...

73
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,916
What kinda fucked
up shit is this?

74
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,083
Looks like they torched
all their lab animals ...

75
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,375
But these bones...

76
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,291
They're from no animal
I've ever seen.

77
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,500
Nobody in the car.
Guess they went in.

78
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,875
Then we go in too.

79
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,750
That's him!

80
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,375
Shall I, uh...?

81
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,666
No, hold up..

82
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,583
Mister Suitengu is here..

83
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,250
The big man himself?

84
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,958
No doubt.

85
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,041
This sucks, we gotta get in
there and whack photo boy

86
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,041
before it's too late.

87
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,958
It is too late.

88
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,041
It's been
nice knowing ya.

89
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,750
It appears the
fugitives are inside.

90
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,541
You've had a rough time.

91
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,125
I am terribly sorry, sir.

92
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,083
But uh, we got it
under control now--

93
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,416
there's really no need for you
to get your hands dirty.

94
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,583
I've come to finish
this once and for all.

95
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,916
Don't worry sir...

96
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,625
We got your back in there--
you can count on us..

97
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,416
No, I will face this
parasite one on one.

98
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,666
How strong is Mister
Suitengu anyway?

99
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,625
Honestly... I have no idea.

100
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,625
No one does.

101
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,041
Anyone who's ever seen him
in action... is dead.

102
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,041
These guys sure have a way of
sniffing us out don't they?

103
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,791
Mr. Saiga, let's just
get out of here--

104
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,583
I found this
list of names.

105
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,791
Okay, take the stairs
at the end of this hall

106
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,458
down to the lowest level...
There's an old sewer line...

107
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,041
It's bound to open up to the
outside world eventually.

108
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,041
What about you?
You can't stay here!

109
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,833
Sorry kid... but I got a couple
things I need to ask him about.

110
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,875
Saiga. Please,
I'm begging you.

111
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,500
Don't take on Suitengu.

112
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,208
You don't know what
that man's capable of.

113
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,833
He'll kill you!

114
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,833
Don't you worry
about me, okay...?

115
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm just going to talk
to him, that's all.

116
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,791
I'll meet you over there.

117
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,000
But... if I don't show
I want you to look

118
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,250
for Doctor Ryogoku
at this address.

119
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,666
Come on you know
I won't die

120
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,250
until I've taken
your picture, right?

121
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,291
Now go.

122
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,541
I said go!

123
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,958
Show yourself, rat.

124
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,166
You've had your fun, but I'll
be needing my property back now.

125
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,041
Yeah and I'll be needing a
shitload of answers from you...

126
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,208
Just what the fuck
did you do to my body ...?

127
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,125
And what the fuck
did you do to her body?

128
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,458
Nothing.

129
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,500
Don't lie to me!

130
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,708
You see, young Kagura
was born that way...

131
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,625
With a genetic mutation.

132
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,583
Genetic mutation?

133
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,166
Your condition is the result
of a latent virus

134
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,541
activated by a catalyst
present in the girl's saliva.

135
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,666
Latent virus...?
What do you mean?

136
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,958
In order for the Euphoria
Factor to be triggered,

137
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,208
you must've already
been a carrier...

138
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,833
I don't know how
you came by it,

139
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,333
but the virus was there in your
cells the night you were kissed.

140
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,125
I believe that's more
than fair compensation...

141
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,166
for the photograph you
took of Miss Kagura.

142
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,958
Photograph? What are
you talking about?

143
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,708
See for yourself...
It turned out quite nicely.

144
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,875
Can't say I care
much for the rest.

145
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,458
But I thought you'd like them
for your personal collection.

146
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,958
How could this--

147
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,833
You really must learn
to embrace your gift...

148
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,833
Especially when it fills you
with such ecstasy, Mister Saiga.

149
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,000
Fuck you!!

150
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,750
What a sad little man...

151
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,958
Why do you
deny yourself

152
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,041
the source of your
greatest pleasure?

153
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,625
I want my body back
the way it was!

154
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,583
I'm sorry I can't do that...

155
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,708
Once a gene has been
mutated, it is done,

156
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,041
and it cannot be undone..

157
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,500
Then what about
the girl, huh...?

158
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,083
Son of a--...

159
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,041
You already know about that
tumor growing in her brain?!

160
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,833
You know she's dying,

161
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,958
and yet you've
done nothing!

162
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,000
Bacterial Research Lab
One Fifty-Two,

163
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,916
an old Army installation
for experimenting

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,083
with biological warfare...

165
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,125
And as for that Doctor
Odawara you asked about--

166
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,208
his specialty was
in genetic cures.

167
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,666
Oh my God, Kagura couldn't
have been one of his...

168
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,250
If you've come this far,

169
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,333
surely you must have
gotten the idea by now.

170
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,916
This is not the sort of thing
that any one person's heroics

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,958
can put an end to.

172
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,791
My only goal in all of this
is to harness that technology

173
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,208
for the good of the world.

174
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,333
Quit jerking me off...!

175
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,375
How's creating a monster like me
make the world any better? !

176
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,541
A monster you say...?

177
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,375
Well, no wonder you've taken
so poorly to this change--

178
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,125
you view it
as a disfigurement.

179
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,375
An oddly common albeit
backwards misconception.

180
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,083
Can't you simply accept it as
your innate talents

181
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,083
becoming more outwardly
pronounced?

182
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,958
Aren't you looking for somewhere
you can truly test your power,

183
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,083
and embrace your desire?

184
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,875
That's precisely
what our club is for.

185
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,500
Return the Goddess to me.

186
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,625
I'll guarantee your life,

187
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,500
and install you
as a permanent member.

188
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,250
That's not my call-- she's
running of her own free will...

189
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,500
so unfortunately, I'm in
no position to bargain

190
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,458
for her freedom.

191
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:50,125
My people tell me you were once
a wartime photojournalist...

192
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,958
So you should know
better than anyone--

193
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,333
you've seen
with your own lens

194
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,833
what's at the root
of all world conflict...

195
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,375
Is it ideology...?

196
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,125
Religion...? No...

197
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,041
It's the gap between the
rich and the destitute...

198
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,583
It's money...
The constant flow of money.

199
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,000
Money is the lifeblood that
flows the world over,

200
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,875
crossing all borders.

201
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,750
But if the circulation is
poor-- if the flow clots,

202
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,458
the other arteries
wither and die...

203
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,833
The only heroes in this life are
the ones that keep it flowing.

204
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,916
There's more to life
than money, asshole!

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,208
Is there...?

206
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,125
Tell that to the men
you saw shed their blood

207
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,041
on the frontlines.

208
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,708
Behind every
justification for war,

209
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,041
you'll find an interested
party who stands to profit...

210
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,083
In the end, what did those
soldiers give their lives

211
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,666
for but the almighty yen...?

212
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,041
And what about you...?

213
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,875
I suppose you put
your life on the line

214
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,916
in pursuit of honor
and altruism?

215
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
You don't know shit!

216
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,208
For the last time...

217
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,041
give back what
you took from me.

218
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,625
And for the last time,
she's not mine to give!

219
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,666
Truth be told...

220
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,916
I've always hated
people like you...

221
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,583
People who don't
respect money.

222
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,708
Don't yearn for it.

223
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,458
People who naively prattle

224
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,958
on about the value
of love and freedom.

225
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,791
And now you will
die as you lived...

226
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,416
Clever, cameraman but I'll
not be so easily defeated.

227
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,291
Where'd he go?

228
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,291
What a waste...

229
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,416
You should be dead...

230
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,416
I was, once upon a time...

231
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,375
This temple of flesh and blood
is the final resting place

232
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,000
for the souls
of all my comrades

233
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,708
who died in battle
without retribution.

234
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,833
Thought you were just
full of yourself!

235
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,666
When will
I be rid of you...

236
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,833
ghosts of
my horrible past.

237
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,291
Well, well.

238
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,000
Ginza?

239
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,916
Look who's come falling
back to me at last--

240
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,041
and you've never looked
more fuckable...

241
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,083
Where'd you stash
the Tennozu girl?

242
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,708
If we don't get a move on,
those thugs'll beat us to her.

243
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,750
A... cabin-- that hill
across the way...

244
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,750
Yeah?

245
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,583
My dear Saiga...

246
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,083
So you've finally
come back to me...

247
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,916
And I'll never
let you go again.

248
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,625
The bond between
mother and daughter

249
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,875
can never be
completely broken.

250
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,416
No amount of torture or
abuse can keep the daughter

251
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,666
from desiring her
mother's love.

252
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,291
Or from seeking it out,

253
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,083
even when the mother's heart
is made of stone.
