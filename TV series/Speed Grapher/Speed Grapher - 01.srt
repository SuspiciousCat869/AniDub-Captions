1
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,750
Kamu pemerintah?

2
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,875
(Satema) kamu!

3
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:06,916
(Satema) kamu!

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,916
(Demura)!

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,375
(Satema) kamu!

6
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,708
You almost took a bullet.

7
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,500
You alright?

8
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,291
Guess so...

9
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:32,041
Goddamn pervert...
You got a freaking hard-on.

10
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,916
That was the moment
I first woke up.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,291
When I caught every man's
destiny on a strip of celluloid,

12
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,666
thirty five millimeters wide.

13
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,125
So how the hell
did I wind up here?

14
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,625
There's serious opposition
in your own party

15
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,416
about this revised
Pharmaceutical Affairs Law!

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,541
Will you comment
on your announcement

17
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,583
at the cabinet meeting?

18
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,708
How many arms did
you have to twist?

19
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,958
All right...

20
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,666
Clear a path-- the Prime
Minister's a busy man.

21
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,625
Please Mr. Prime Minister,
give us a headline!

22
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,083
Why are you pushing
this through so quickly?

23
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,625
What are you--...?
Get that camera out of here!

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,166
What a boring subject...

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,500
But it pays my bills.

26
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,250
It's been over a decade
since the Bubble War,

27
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,916
when the global
economy burst,

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,916
and the insiders who held
the needle pulled out early,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,333
then swooped in like
vultures to eat the remains

30
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,000
at a fraction
of the cost.

31
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,625
You know the drill.

32
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,208
The rich got richer, and
the poor were out of luck.

33
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,416
Welcome to Tokyo, the city
where all the winners

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,416
came to jerk
each other off.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,250
If you've got money,
you can buy anything

36
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,125
your sick mind
can dream up.

37
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,083
If you don't, you just
try not to get crushed

38
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,708
beneath the wheels.

39
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,125
In a city like this,

40
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,333
there's not a single thing
worth the cost of my film.

41
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,708
Damn it...!
That performance was abysmal!

42
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,125
It wasn't me at all!

43
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,958
No, the real dance...

44
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,291
The real me is ...!

45
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,583
Who are you?

46
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,083
I met with you
earlier this week --

47
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,833
I'm Miss Kokubunji ...

48
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,833
If you recall,
you promised you'd see

49
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,000
my daughter dance today.

50
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,583
She's very talented--

51
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,208
we're hoping you'll
take her under your wing.

52
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,375
Very well,
let's see her dance.

53
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,791
Go on, Kozue.

54
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,166
Ye-Yes ma'am.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,333
No, no,
that's all wrong...!

56
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,291
Look how stiff
your arms are!

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,208
Stretch your body!
Be like rubber!

58
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,208
Stop!

59
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,833
More! You're
not even trying!

60
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,916
You're hurting me!

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,583
Mr. Shirogane!
Let go of her, please!

62
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,458
Somebody! Somebody
call an ambulance!

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,833
Hardly worth my time.

64
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,416
Yes?

65
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,208
Well, hello...

66
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,500
What can I do
for you Mr. Suitengu?

67
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,250
Sounds lovely...

68
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,958
I haven't danced
enough tonight.

69
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,125
Saiga-babe, you're
getting expensive.

70
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,875
The public safety authorities
don't come cheap.

71
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,750
I didn't ask you
to bail me out, Ginza.

72
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,875
I never do.

73
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,541
You're impossible.

74
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,000
By the way, you familiar
with a politican named Nakano?

75
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,833
Sure, he's that Health
and Welfare Minister

76
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,125
who's raising Cain over this
Pharmaceutical Reform Bill.

77
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,416
That's right, tiger.

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,750
And apparently he
doesn't feel too safe.

79
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,291
He just asked for a big
bump in police security.

80
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,750
Startin' to think
the guy's in trouble...

81
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,958
Son of a--...

82
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,041
A "thank you"
would've been nice.

83
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041
Now then,
where were we?

84
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,500
Ah yes,
the money...

85
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,041
See I'm running
a little short this month,

86
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,375
cost of living and all.

87
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,375
So why don't you open
your wallet a bit wider,

88
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,708
and I'll forget
I saw these.

89
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,833
Deal?

90
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,458
Shit...

91
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,875
Just 'cause you got a badge
don't mean you can extort me!

92
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,375
Damn you!

93
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,833
For the record, boys,
that was self-defense.

94
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,375
Bitch ass--!

95
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,500
Don't make me
self-defense you, too.

96
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,875
This feel I've longed
for... This aroma...

97
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,250
This flexibility...!

98
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,500
Finally!.
I can be the real me!

99
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,916
What the--?

100
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,458
Take him down!

101
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,791
What?

102
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,375
Please, spare me!

103
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,791
Let's make a deal...!

104
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,250
I swear, we'll give
you anything you want!

105
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,583
Councillor Okubo...
Strange...

106
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,166
Hell of a way to go.

107
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,583
Looks like their heads were
twisted around in a vice.

108
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,500
Always the first on the scene.
I don't know how you do it.

109
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,250
Now get out before
I arrest you.

110
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,958
Right on the mark
this time, wasn't I...?

111
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,083
You get so excited

112
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,166
when you're looking
through that lens.

113
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,291
You're such a pervert.

114
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,125
Stop it...
We're working.

115
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,208
I told you, baby doll, you don't
have to worry about that...

116
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,083
I'm pulling down
enough for us both--

117
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,666
I'll take care of you.

118
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,833
Tempting, Ginza.
But no thanks.

119
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,916
Hey!

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,958
Well in that case
I'll need collateral...

121
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,458
You can have your little toy
back when you come to my place.

122
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,750
Come on, Ginza.
Stop joking around.

123
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,958
Who's joking...? I've got
serious needs, Saiga...

124
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,625
And since you've been
stripped of your passport,

125
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,916
you've got a
short list of options.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,166
Can't leave the country,
can't leave me.

127
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,375
Try it,
and I'll kill you.

128
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,750
Hey, Saiga.

129
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,500
Saiga!

130
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,625
Wait!

131
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,791
Saiga!

132
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,458
Let me guess, Bob. Your
boyfriend dumped you again??

133
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,875
No! I dumped him...!
Fucking bastard...

134
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,291
he was messing around
with another guy!

135
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,875
Oh, no.
Not Jimmy.

136
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,125
No! Charlie...!

137
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,333
Oh please, won't you
take me in and comfort me?!

138
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,458
Sorry, Bob...

139
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,875
Same-sex marriage
isn't legal in Japan.

140
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,416
Saiga!

141
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,500
Nice try, Ginza.

142
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,375
Nakano and Kawaguchi.

143
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,666
Former Health, Labor
and Welfare Minister

144
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,875
and Director of the
Drug Administration,

145
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,416
massacred while in private talks
in a heavily guarded hotel.

146
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
That makes five, now.

147
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,208
They all opposed
the Drug Reform Bill,

148
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,041
and they've
all turned up dead.

149
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,458
That's right...
Heavy stuff...

150
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,541
Obviously someone
big's pulling the strings.

151
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,708
No doubt...

152
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,875
So what do you say
we find the puppeteer?

153
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,000
Ever heard anything
about the Roppongi Club?

154
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,041
Only rumors. Some kind
of secret society--

155
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,041
Open solely
to the ultra-rich,

156
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,250
and offering the
kind of debauchery

157
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,375
that would
make Nero proud.

158
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,833
That's the one...

159
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,625
As long as its members
shell out the cash,

160
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,000
the club claims it can satisfy
any desire imaginable...

161
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,625
legal or otherwise.

162
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,708
And you think these
pleasure-brokers are connected

163
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,375
to the murders, somehow?

164
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,083
That's what we're
going to find out.

165
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,541
Last week's hit was
the Vice-Minister of HLW...

166
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,250
My guys have been
investigating a car

167
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,375
that was inadvertently
photographed near the scene.

168
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,250
Turns out, the car belongs
to Roppongi Development,

169
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,500
a subsidiary
of the Tennozu Group.

170
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,250
The Tennozu Group...?
You mean the ones

171
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,125
who built that
big-ass skyscraper

172
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,583
in the Roppongi district?

173
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,708
That's right...
Real Estate...

174
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,291
Construction...
Information...

175
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,583
The Tennozu Group
does it all...

176
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,625
They've been buying up every
piece of the market they can,

177
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,125
and it's made 'em one
hell of a profit machine.

178
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:07,333
Some say as Tennozu goes,
so goes the Japanese economy.

179
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,833
At the top of it all
is Lady Shinsen Tennozu,

180
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,333
who runs the conglomerate
like its unchallenged queen.

181
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,541
This is her number two,
her right hand man...

182
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,208
Director of Roppongi
Development, Choji Suitengu.

183
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,083
And rumor has it
he's the man in control

184
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,625
of the Roppongi Club,
as well.

185
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,083
This photo's crap.

186
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
I don't know
about that...

187
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,333
Mr. Suitengu's
a private man--

188
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,583
never shows his
face in public...

189
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,583
That's the only pic
we've ever gotten of him--

190
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,541
Tabloids'd
pay a fortune...

191
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,625
But you see
the challenge here.

192
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,333
This club's like an urban
legend around Tokyo.

193
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,666
No hard facts,
no real clues...

194
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,916
That photo's the closest
thing I have to a lead.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,375
Nonsense. You got
all the clues you need.

196
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,750
Next stop, Saiga...
Saiga Station...

197
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,666
All aboard!

198
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,916
Awfully light drink
for you, Saiga.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,125
Don't tell me you're
going to meetings, now.

200
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Don't piss yourself.
I'm still on the clock.

201
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:24,333
Just dumb luck this
seat has a perfect view.

202
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,375
Photographing a high official
in his private office.

203
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,958
You're asking for it.

204
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,125
I'm just watching.
Think that matters to them?

205
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,083
By the way, what's
with the poster?

206
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,208
I'm seeing it everywhere.

207
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,083
And I hear you
took the picture.

208
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,208
I don't do ads,
you know that.

209
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,541
It's a picture
I shot way back.

210
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,083
Someone wanted to use it,
and I was hard on cash.

211
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,583
Aren't we all...

212
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,583
Well, this is my stop.

213
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,708
See you 'round..

214
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,666
Just watch your
step on the way out.

215
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,666
The other day I was cleaning
that storage compartment,

216
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,208
and the floor gave out.

217
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,916
A hole big enough
to climb through...

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,333
We got holes all over
this district now,

219
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,833
thanks to that damn
"Geo Front" program.

220
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,125
You should move down there.
Make it a subway bar.

221
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,166
Ah hell...

222
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,625
Asshole...

223
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,791
Here goes nothing...

224
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,583
I love it when I'm right...

225
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,291
Damn it.

226
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,250
Now what...?

227
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,666
Wait a minute.
If my bearings are right...

228
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,416
Nex--

229
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,375
Back already... What's up,
you forget something?

230
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,750
Just transferring
to the subway line...

231
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,916
Oh, hey... Can you move my
car if you see any cops?

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,791
Thanks.

233
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,375
An air duct...

234
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,416
Deep enough...

235
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,083
All Luxury cars...

236
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,083
Must be the place.

237
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,708
Should be a
memorable night.

238
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,375
Yes. I heard there's going
to be a divine ritual.

239
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,208
Hey... Long time no see.

240
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,458
How'd you get here??

241
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,500
Sleep tight.

242
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,291
Son of a bitch.
An actual subway.

243
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,041
An entire underground system
built solely for them,

244
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,500
so not even the members
know where they end up.

245
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,416
Quite a production...

246
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,125
Must be one
hell of a club.

247
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,291
To the winner
the spoils, right?

248
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,166
Unbelievable...

249
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,625
How could they
build something

250
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,458
like this right under
the streets of Tokyo?

251
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,875
So this is it.

252
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,958
And Ginza
calls me perverse.

253
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,000
I recognize them all,
too, even with the masks.

254
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,250
Politicians,
celebrities, CEOs...

255
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,375
Suitengu...

256
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,250
Damn it. Which way?

257
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,375
Lost him.
This place is a maze.

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,083
What is this?

259
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,750
Ladies and gentlemen, valuable
patrons of the Roppongi Club...

260
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,125
Welcome to a night of
decadence and desire.

261
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,041
There you are...

262
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,500
Tonight we have a man who seeks
the blessings of the Goddess,

263
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,333
and fulfillment
of his deepest want.

264
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,000
And like all who climb
the steps of her altar,

265
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,000
he is willing to put
his life on the line...

266
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,916
Will his anointment
bring ultimate pleasure,

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,291
or a pitiful death...?

268
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,291
Initiant,
are you prepared?

269
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,541
Pleasure is
the only truth...

270
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,625
The driving force from
which all life derives...

271
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,875
Without it we have no purpose,
and can only wait for death.

272
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,166
Goddess on high...!

273
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,083
Please give this
brave man your blessing!

274
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,208
Who would have thought...

275
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,291
In a madhouse
like this...

276
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,375
I'd finally
find my subject.

277
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,375
Grab him!

278
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,875
Taking a picture
inside these walls

279
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,000
is an unforgivable taboo...
Any true member knows that.

280
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,791
And what do we do with
intruders, patrons?

281
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,166
Kill! Kill! Kill!

282
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,708
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

283
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,916
Kill! Kill! Kill!

284
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,958
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

285
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,333
No...! No!

286
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,500
What are you
waiting for?

287
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,583
Take him away from
the Goddess, immediately!

288
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,708
He stole it...!

289
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,500
That was supposed
to be mine!

290
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,916
Kagura...
what have you done?

291
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,708
The Syndrome wasted
on a low-life like him...

292
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,958
Death to the intruder!
At once!

293
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,250
Only one thing's for sure.

294
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,208
The world doesn't
run on love or mercy.

295
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,375
It runs on greed.
And everyone has their price.

296
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,083
It's a place where not even
an innocent child

297
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,041
is safe from being turned
into a money machine.
