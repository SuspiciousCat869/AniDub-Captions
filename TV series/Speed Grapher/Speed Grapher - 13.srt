1
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,291
Who knew it would
come to this...

2
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,416
You are devastated
by her passing...

3
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,041
And so am I.

4
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,000
Come, dear...

5
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,875
Our fractured souls will
find strength in each other.

6
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,541
No!!!

7
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,041
Yes...

8
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,791
Saiga will...

9
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,500
Your photographer
will soon be dead,--

10
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,333
no one can
save you now.

11
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,708
The only one reflected
in your eyes...

12
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,083
will be me...

13
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,083
The man who will
be your husband.

14
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,416
Hey boss, I'm not trying
to be a wet blanket...

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,083
But ain't marrying girls
her age against the law--

16
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,333
I mean when you
file the application

17
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,833
they'll probably
try to arrest you.

18
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,208
Then we'll just change
her birth certificate.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,666
Oh, hey Captain...

20
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,875
Word of advice Tiger:
forget that Club exists.

21
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,833
It's none of your
business, Ginza.

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,250
So what...?

23
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,208
You gonna kill yourself over
that little girl...?

24
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,458
Huh?

25
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,416
A man your age with
a girl like her...

26
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,708
There's a word
for that...

27
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,958
Sick.

28
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,833
If I'm such a damn deviant,
leave me alone--

29
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,125
forget about me.

30
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,791
Fat chance...

31
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,333
I'll keep you locked in a cell
forever if it keeps you alive...

32
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,791
and safe from
that monster...

33
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,791
I know all about it.

34
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,458
What is it you
think you know?

35
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,416
I know some kinda monster
covered in tattoos

36
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,958
came to my place
last night...

37
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,750
He was lookin'
for you.

38
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,041
Tattoos, huh?

39
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,125
They want you dead...!
Stay away from that Club!

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,083
And that fucking child!

41
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,791
Hey... You fixed
your camera...

42
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,416
Nice work.

43
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,625
You might wanna
stand back.

44
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,708
What?

45
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,083
Stand back!

46
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,208
Holy shit...

47
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,875
Careful Ginza,
monsters are everywhere.

48
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,750
Hold it.

49
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,416
What was that?

50
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,875
What happened to you?

51
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,458
Been wondering
that myself...

52
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,583
That's where
I'm heading now--

53
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,375
test results
should be in..

54
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,958
Results from what?

55
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,583
Bum a smoke?

56
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,333
Sure, if you
like menthol.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,416
So that was real?

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,916
And here I was thinkin'
comic books were fiction...

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,625
Silly me.

60
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,375
Suicide?

61
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,666
Yes.

62
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,416
Mister Suitengu...
Correct me if I'm mistaken,

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,166
but I believe the plan was
for you to marry Shinsen

64
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,000
so you could take charge
of Tennozu's assets yourself.

65
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,125
Yes, enlighten me...
How do you intend

66
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,958
to share the profits
you guaranteed us

67
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,500
if they're not
in your control?

68
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,666
Rest assured...

69
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,166
The heart of my plan
has not changed ...

70
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,416
I will
soon be married,

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,041
with full control
of the Tennozu Group,

72
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,083
and all promises
will be kept.

73
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,833
You plan
to marry a corpse?

74
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,750
Allow me to
introduce to you...

75
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,208
My new fiancée.

76
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,833
The Goddess??

77
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,791
This is Kagura Tennozu.

78
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,833
Is this some kind
of a joke, Suitengu?

79
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,166
You just want to keep
the Goddess as your own.

80
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,750
That's bullshit!
I won't allow it!

81
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,000
Shinsen has willed
everything to her...

82
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,125
It was done to prevent me
taking control of the Group

83
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,583
if she died.

84
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,708
This marriage will
solve that problem.

85
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,333
But I assure you it is
merely a business formality.

86
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,666
Kagura will remain
your Goddess...

87
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,250
In every way.

88
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,333
Miss...? Are you
having car trouble?

89
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,250
Let's just say
I played a bluffing game

90
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,833
with my fuel
gauge and lost.

91
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,791
I'd be happy to run you
to the nearest gas station,

92
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,583
if you like.

93
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,541
It's you...
I knew it...

94
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,083
You're Ran Yurigaoka,
the aesthetician.

95
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,250
Why yes...
In the flesh.

96
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,083
Care for a free
evaluation?...

97
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,083
Wonderful...

98
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,458
Now lean your seat back
and try to relax for me.

99
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,041
Oh... Okay...

100
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,833
Your skin is lovely...

101
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,875
But with my therapeutic touch
I can make it even better...

102
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,250
Free its potential...

103
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,291
Just close your eyes,
and let go.

104
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,583
Oh my god...
That feels incredible...

105
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,875
Describe it for me.

106
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,291
I don't know...
It feels...

107
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,083
like my skin is melting...

108
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh... How are
you doing that?

109
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,833
It feels like needles...

110
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,583
Give in to the pleasure...

111
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,750
Let the stimulation improve
the flow of blood to your skin.

112
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,791
Oh yes you're right...
I feel it...

113
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,000
It's like I read--

114
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,083
you're so gentle my
whole body's tingling...

115
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,500
Can I open
my eyes now?

116
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,125
By all means.

117
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,166
I was mistaken...

118
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,750
Doesn't match
your skin at all.

119
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,250
An amusing detour...

120
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,250
Hey, Saiga.

121
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,708
And who's this?

122
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,916
Captain Hibari Ginza...

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,875
New Metropolitan
Police...

124
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,583
I'm Saiga's
girlfriend.

125
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,041
Girlfriend?

126
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,125
You got your hands
full, don'tcha?

127
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,416
So what's
the news, Doc?

128
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,875
You got something for me?

129
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,083
Sure do...

130
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,875
Come on, the
Professor's waiting.

131
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,916
Here we are...

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,875
Come in.

133
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,666
Doctor Nishiya...

134
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,666
I brought the guy whose
cells you've been testing.

135
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,166
It's a real pleasure!

136
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,958
I've been waiting
all day for this...

137
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,916
The hell's
wrong with you?!

138
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,291
Okay...
Self-defense time.

139
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,333
I'm so sorry,
I just wanted to test him,

140
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,666
I swear!

141
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,916
Test?

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,833
Please, just let
me examine the wound...

143
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,291
Forgive me...

144
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,041
I just had
to see for myself.

145
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,708
Astonishing!

146
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,541
What in the hell?

147
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,375
The rapid regeneration of
cells in the damaged area,

148
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,083
It's like nothing
I've ever seen...

149
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,375
It's like...
A vampire...

150
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,666
And you know what
a vampire is.

151
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,791
A vampire?

152
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,125
Yes.

153
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,708
A vampire bite dramaticly
alters human physiology,

154
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,916
granting new strengths
and weaknesses.

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
You're saying I'm gonna
start growing fangs now?

156
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,708
God, no... Vampires
are things of fantasy...

157
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,250
Still...

158
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,916
It's a helpful frame of
reference when trying to explain

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,916
what's happened to you,
because if you think of it

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that way it isn't
too hard to grasp...

161
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,708
Please,
come take a look...

162
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,583
Modern Vampire Fiction has
become quite sophisticated.

163
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,333
Some authors have even
begun linking vampirism

164
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,250
to being infected
with a retovirus.

165
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,458
Quite true
in your case.

166
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,166
This is a map of
your DNA, Mister Saiga.

167
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,000
Mostly ordinary..

168
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,750
But take a look at this.
It's a virus.

169
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,000
A virus attacking
at the DNA level?

170
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,333
It's not unheard of.

171
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,083
There are a number
of natural viruses

172
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,833
that can latch
onto DNA...

173
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,250
But this virus...

174
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,166
It rewrites
the base sequence --

175
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,791
making fundamental
genetic changes.

176
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,291
And it is fast.

177
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,875
That's hard to believe.

178
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,333
You've seen it work...

179
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,833
My theory is when I cut his
hand the virus changed

180
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,708
the surrounding cells into
TS cells, then multiplied them,

181
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,958
repairing the damage--

182
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,458
all in response to a
subconscious impulse.

183
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,791
Like symbiosis...

184
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,291
but the virus actually
responds to his brain ...

185
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,791
and then makes changes
to the DNA sequence...

186
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,208
Imagine the implications

187
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,416
The Carrier would only have
to imagine what he wants,

188
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,416
and his whole genetic
code could be rewritten.

189
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,750
Anything's possible...

190
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,125
He could want
to become a fish

191
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,041
and the virus
might make it happen...

192
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,958
Of course it's all
theory at this point...

193
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,250
If I were to try and
present these findings now,

194
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,750
I'd be the laughing stock
of the scientific community.

195
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,416
You're tellin' me everything
I take a picture of explodes

196
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,375
because my subconscious told
the virus it's what I want?

197
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,708
I know it sounds strange...

198
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,833
But yes, that's
most likely it.--

199
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,625
Of course I won't know for
sure until I've had more time

200
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,166
to study it.

201
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,041
So he contracted
this virus from Kagura--

202
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,333
is that what you're saying?

203
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,541
Well... Actually,
I ran her blood sample,

204
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,333
but her DNA doesn't contain
any sign of the virus.

205
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,750
Her sample was a
diffrent mystery.

206
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,375
It contained a strange
substance I couldn't identify.

207
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,791
And here's the kicker.

208
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,458
When I introduced Mister
Saiga's virus

209
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,958
into another subjects's DNA,
nothing happened.

210
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,166
But when I introduced
the substance from Kagura,

211
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,333
the virus sprang to life,
reproducing like crazy.

212
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,833
I ran some tests on
this mystery catalyst.

213
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,041
I found it significantly lowers
serotonin levels in the brain.

214
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,833
Seratonin
suppresses dopamine,

215
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,833
inhibiting desire.

216
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,083
So without it--

217
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,250
Skip to the end,
Professor...

218
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,666
What's the cure...?
For me and the girl?

219
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,458
There's just no way of
knowing at this point...

220
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,083
But there's
still hope--

221
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,416
I need to
keep studying you,

222
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,208
to get to the core
of what this virus is

223
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,541
and how we can use it...

224
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,833
it's the discovery
of the century!

225
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,541
Sorry, pal, but I don't
have time to play lab rat...

226
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,458
But thanks for the chat..

227
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,041
Mister Saiga, have you
noticed anything wrong?

228
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,750
With your eye,
perhaps?

229
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,208
I told you...

230
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,083
Like a vampire, these changes
give you weaknesses, too.

231
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,166
The mutated cells
degenerate over time.

232
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,583
The more you
use the abilities,

233
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,541
the more quickly
the cells will die.

234
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,708
If you don't let me help
you, you will go blind...

235
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,416
You may even die.

236
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,125
Please stay.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,708
I'm really sorry, Saiga...

238
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,833
I know it's not what
you wanted to hear.

239
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't worry about it.

240
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,208
Oh, yeah...
Had a question for you...

241
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,083
You familiar with a "Bacterial
Research Lab One Fifty-Two?"...

242
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,000
Defunct bio-weapon facility--

243
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,208
it was built before
the second world war.

244
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,458
Huh-uh... You think
it's got something to do

245
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,708
with what's going on now?

246
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,875
Possibly...
This catalyst Kagura has...

247
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,291
I think it was
engineered at that place.

248
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,333
Really...?
Say no more...

249
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,375
I'll look into it.

250
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,833
And take care of yourself...

251
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,375
Don't strain that eye.

252
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,208
Yeah, I'll be in touch, Doc.

253
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,958
Your condition is the result
of a latent virus

254
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,166
activated by a catalyst
present in the girl's saliva.

255
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,166
Latent virus...?
What do you mean?

256
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,291
In order for the Euphoria
Factor to be triggered,

257
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,166
you must've already
been a carrier...

258
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,958
I don't know
how you came by it,

259
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,791
but the virus was there in your
cells the night you were kissed.

260
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,208
I caught it somewhere,
before I met her...

261
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,458
Which battlefield?

262
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,708
Where?

263
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,791
Saiga...

264
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,875
Now back to the
day's lead story...

265
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,833
Corporate icon
Shinsen Tennozu...

266
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,541
President of the Tennozu Group
was found dead in her home

267
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,833
this morning...

268
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,625
In keeping with Ms. Tennozu's
final wishes...

269
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,666
described in an
emotional suicide note

270
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,958
found at the scene...

271
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,416
A wedding will
be held tomorrow

272
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,166
between her daughter
and Choji Suitengu,

273
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,291
one of her company's
top directors.

274
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,875
Bullshit...!
That can't be right...

275
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,750
Don't you get it...?

276
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,375
She must have found out
Suitengu was cheating on her...

277
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,333
Losing your man to
your own daughter.

278
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,041
I'd probably
kill myself, too.

279
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,416
You're wrong.

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,666
Don't act like Kagura's
some symbol of purity...

281
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,458
Like anything innocent
could live in a place

282
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,166
as screwed up as this...

283
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,541
And you know
she put out.

284
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,583
That's not true.

285
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,375
Yeah keep denying
it all you want...

286
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,708
I don't give a shit what
you did with that child...

287
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,375
Because I'm here to make
sure you never see her again.

288
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,666
Come back!

289
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,250
I'll shoot!

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,875
Damn it Saiga,
this is real easy...

291
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,041
Lose the camera,
forget about the girl...

292
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,250
Just walk away
and you live!

293
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,833
You keep
your eyesight...!

294
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,875
We could be together again,
like before...

295
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,208
I swear,
I'll try harder...!

296
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,625
Please, Saiga...
We could be happy!

297
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,416
I made an oath to
set that girl free.

298
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,166
And I'm sticking to it.

299
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,291
Made an oath...?
What the fuck...?

300
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,125
What are you,

301
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,250
a five year-old
on a playground?

302
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,750
God damn it, why won't
you just talk to me!

303
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm sorry...

304
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,958
Not what
I'm looking for!

305
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,958
Move!

306
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,708
Saiga!

307
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,333
At long last we meet.

308
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
Saiga...!
Get in!

309
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,291
Damn... He just
doesn't give up.

310
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,208
Oh fuck me...

311
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,458
Prick...
No, don't!

312
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,833
No choice.

313
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:41,458
You will both suffer for
what you've done to my skin.

314
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,500
Stop it!

315
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,916
Are you fucking insane?

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,250
You'll just get worse.

317
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,166
You'll get swept back in,
and go back to that girl!

318
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,291
Look, I'll do
what I have to do.

319
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,541
What does that cunt
have that I don't?

320
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,750
Well for one thing...

321
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,041
the Divine Goddess has
infinitely healthier skin

322
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,125
than a washed-up whore
like you, Captain.

323
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,541
Go to hell.

324
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,583
But you needn't worry
your poor, jealous heart.

325
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,625
Because Saiga is never going
to see the Goddess again.

326
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,166
He is going
to die right here!

327
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,125
Please, Captain...
Don't harm my skin again...

328
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,291
It's of a vastly higher
quality than yours.

329
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,875
You son of a--

330
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,083
Where is he?
Saiga...

331
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,625
I fucked up...

332
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,916
Don't move...

333
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,000
Ooh. It looks good
on you, Captain.

334
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,375
It's got me...

335
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,208
Saiga...!
Use your camera!

336
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,958
It's the only way-- you
have to take us both out!

337
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,625
Aarrgh!

338
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,125
Ginza!

339
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,291
Just...
do it...

340
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,791
I can't!

341
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,708
Hurry!

342
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,125
I can't.

343
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,750
At long last,
you are home...

344
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,916
Goddess...

345
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,250
Where you can shine
in all your glory.

346
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,416
It's the marriage
of the century,

347
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,875
and all the pretty faces
are putting on nice heels

348
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,541
and fancy ties...

349
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,000
But while Tokyo's
politicians plan a move

350
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,291
on their little club,

351
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,208
I'm gonna show up
for a coup of my own.
