1
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,958
Next time try standing up
for me, you little prick!

2
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,208
Nice one.

3
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,291
Is this urgent?

4
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,875
Representative Ochiai.

5
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,625
It's me, Saiga...

6
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,583
I've decided...

7
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,791
I'm gonna offer my
testimony at Parliament...

8
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,958
But Kagura stays out...
Help her...

9
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,250
Move her out
of the country

10
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,791
where she can get the
treatment that she needs.

11
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,958
And I want you to send
Dr. yogoku with her.

12
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,625
You have a good heart...

13
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,000
And the last thing I want
is to see her suffer...

14
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,750
You've got a deal...

15
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,833
I'll make plans to get Kagura
out as soon as possible.

16
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,208
I'll owe you for this.

17
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,333
It's Tokyo.
Everybody owes.

18
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,375
But you can
even the trade.

19
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,916
With you on board,
the revolution can begin.

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,541
I want everyone
to meet tomorrow.

21
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,875
Everyone?

22
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,958
The Order of the
White Eagles...

23
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,750
You don't know it, but we've
all been waiting for you...

24
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,708
You are the last
White Eagle, Mr. Saiga.

25
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,125
Me?

26
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
I wish I could raise
a glass with you now,

27
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,041
but we'll have to wait
for tomorrow.

28
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,208
I've got a
lot of work to do,

29
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,666
if we're going
to pull this off.

30
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,375
I won't be
sleeping tonight.

31
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,708
Tell me about it.

32
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,125
Something wrong?

33
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,166
Hey, Captain!

34
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,333
Glad you finally made--
Have you been drinking?

35
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,083
Oh, jeez, Captain,
that is foul!

36
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,125
What is it?

37
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,666
How should I know...?

38
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,666
Smells like something crawled
in your mouth and died.

39
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,958
The crime.

40
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,500
Oh... Right... Looks like
another random attack...

41
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,916
It's the fifth one this
week, and no explanations.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,333
Dragged my ass down here

43
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,833
'cause I thought you had
somethin' interesting for me.

44
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,541
Would you like
to take a look...?

45
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a real mess...
Multiple stab wounds...

46
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,125
I don't understand
what's happening.

47
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,000
Random murders,
robberies...

48
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,541
Fighting on every block...

49
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,375
We're lookin' at the highest
spike in violent crime in years.

50
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,750
Maybe everyone else
is as bored as me?

51
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,458
This is serious.
I can show you the numbers.

52
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,875
And even weirder, these guys
aren't repeat offenders.

53
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,208
They're all just
regular people.

54
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,000
It's like the entire
city's gone mad on cue...

55
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,250
What if there's
something big behind this,

56
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,833
something the brass
can't even fathom?

57
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,666
Captain, wait...
Where are you going?

58
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,125
Back to where I was before
you called, rookie...

59
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,916
I'm gettin'
shit-faced...

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,166
I am done bustin' my ass for a
city that doesn't give a fuck...

61
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,208
'Sides, rich girls
don't hafta work.

62
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,625
And this bitch just
made a fortune.

63
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,666
On stocks?!

64
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,208
See ya.

65
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,875
You invested in the
Tennozu Group, didn't you...?

66
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,958
Well I hope you feel
good about yourself,

67
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,958
swimming in
your dirty money!

68
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,333
Feel good about myself...?
How the hell could I?

69
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,708
Saiga...
Where are you...?

70
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,416
Are you still
babysitting that child?

71
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,375
Yeah,
I feel great.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,708
Kagura...
Saiga...

73
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,541
We're a pair,
aren't we...?

74
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,083
Well, ladies first.

75
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,583
There something
you wanna say?

76
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:21,458
Saiga... I want to testify--
at the Parliament hearing.

77
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,625
I want us both to testify.

78
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,458
How did you hear--...

79
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,416
Forget it...! You're not
going near that place!

80
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,791
Why can't I?

81
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,250
You just don't get it...

82
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,291
It's dangerous-- If we show up
at Parliament together,

83
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,333
we'll be sitting ducks
for Suitengu...

84
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,625
And I'm not going
to take that risk.

85
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,333
I don't care... It's better
than us getting separated!

86
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,333
I said no... If that's all you
came to say you can go now.

87
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,875
But Saiga... You said from
now on we'd stay together...

88
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,000
You promised me that.

89
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,291
I didn't mean it.

90
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,250
Kagura...

91
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,750
Trust me... There are things
you don't understand.

92
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,750
Like the sort of things
Professor Nishiya could tell me?

93
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,208
What's that supposed
to mean...?

94
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,500
Ah, hell...

95
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,166
What did he
say to you?

96
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,541
I don't want to be
away from you...

97
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,250
Please, Saiga...

98
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,875
Whatever time
I do have left...

99
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,375
I want to spend
it with you.

100
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,625
God damn it!

101
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,666
I should break
his fuckin' neck!

102
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,625
I'm glad
he told me...

103
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,750
I'm not afraid
of dying...

104
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,708
It's you I'm
worried about...

105
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,416
your eyes!

106
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,916
Kagura...

107
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,000
Saiga, wait!

108
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,333
Hey, buddy...

109
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,625
Don't tell me you're
drinking alone tonight.

110
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,291
Old habit.

111
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,833
I could go for
a drink myself.

112
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,208
Guess that's better'n
another slap in the face.

113
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,500
You uh...
You saw that didja?

114
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,208
Nothin' to be ashamed of,
I just got one of my own.

115
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,833
A girl hit you, too?

116
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,666
Hang on a minute,
aren't you--...?

117
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,083
Nah... What am I saying,
you couldn't be him.

118
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,416
All right, you want a drinking
buddy, I'm here for ya, man!

119
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,166
We're like members
of the same club!

120
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,333
If you say so.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,208
Kampai!

122
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,041
Hey, I didn't
get your name.

123
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,750
Everyone calls me Joe...

124
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,125
So what's yours?

125
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm uh...

126
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,166
I'm just another good-
for-nothin' loser like you.

127
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,125
It's funny, when I
first saw you outside

128
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,958
I thought you were
this amazing guy.

129
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,791
I heard of him through
this club I joined,

130
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,375
full of the most
awesome people...

131
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm not even in the same
league as them to be honest...

132
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,333
I'm half expecting them
to wise up and boot me out.

133
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,416
I tend to have trouble
with authority myself.

134
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,333
Yeah, right? But these people,
you gotta respect them.

135
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,875
They're working really hard
to turn this country around.

136
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,041
Yeah, good luck.

137
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,958
Joe... Who are you,
really?

138
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,541
It's like
you said earlier...

139
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,791
Just a good-
for-nothin' loser...

140
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,000
Born without courage...
So I drink instead.

141
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been there.

142
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,958
People think Japan's
peaceful now.

143
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,750
But we're still at war.

144
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,500
Only instead of rifles,
we kill each other

145
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,708
with great big wads of cash.

146
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,916
I've spent my whole life
ducking from danger...

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If there's a way
for somebody

148
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,583
like me to put an
end to this war...

149
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,208
Then I'd happily give
my life to that cause.

150
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,833
You got a good face, Joe.

151
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,250
I mean... You're
a total dumbass...

152
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,000
But you're a...
good guy.

153
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,750
Tell that
to my girlfriend.

154
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,708
I talk big... But the
fact is, I'm afraid...

155
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,458
When it comes to taking
risks, I just run and hide.

156
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,708
Any tips
for a chicken-shit?

157
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,666
My advice...?

158
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,083
This country went way
beyond fixing years ago...

159
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,583
Fuck it.

160
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,458
Why should I care?

161
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,875
I'm using Ochiai and his friends
just like he's using me.

162
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,833
Fuck it, huh?

163
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,708
Yeah, and forget about
that martyrous bullshit...

164
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,916
It's a joke...

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,833
Things get bad,
run away.

166
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,875
Sound advice...

167
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,750
Except that's not
what Saiga would do.

168
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,916
That's the guy's name...

169
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,375
The one I mistook
you for, I mean...

170
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,083
I've never actually met him,
just saw his picture once...

171
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,541
But I heard about him
from someone I respect...

172
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,500
He said, "Saiga would run
straight into battle

173
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,958
to get the shot he wanted.

174
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,958
That's the kinda
guy he is."

175
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,416
Even today...
He's still fearless...

176
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
What makes a guy
like that tick?

177
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,583
Who knows...

178
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,750
Maybe he's trying to save
some damsel in distress.

179
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,416
Cool... That would make
him even more heroic.

180
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,708
Ya think so?

181
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,208
Well if she's hot!

182
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,333
Hey. Closing time, Joe.

183
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,291
Face worth the film...
Who knew I'd find that again.

184
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,250
Saiga!

185
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,583
I'm sorry
about yesterday.

186
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,875
Me too...

187
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,458
We have a meeting with
the White Eagles today

188
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,541
to prepare us for
the official hearing.

189
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,250
It's safer if we
take two cars.

190
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,083
I'll be in the first car...

191
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,708
But the Doc'll be here soon
to ride along with you...

192
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,500
Okay?

193
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,375
Okay!

194
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,333
Kagura...
I won't let you die...

195
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,375
I promise... We're
gonna live-- Both of us.

196
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,875
'Kay...

197
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,833
Saiga.

198
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,291
Forgive me, Kagura.

199
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,291
I swear, this is the last
time I'll ever lie to you.

200
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,750
Christ... You never
give up, do you...?

201
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,875
I haven't heard
from Saiga, I swear.

202
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,791
For all I know
he's dead.

203
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,250
Considering the shape
this city's in,

204
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,833
a detective like you shouldn't
be wasting your time ...

205
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,500
In case
ya hadn't noticed,

206
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,416
we're in the middle
of a god damned crime spree.

207
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,208
Saiga's all that's
important to me.

208
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,250
Saiga, it's me... There's been
a little change in the plan...

209
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,166
You go on ahead... I think
I'm gonna be a bit late.

210
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,583
Gotcha.
Something come up?

211
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,041
Bit of trouble on my tail.

212
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,791
Eh, nothing
I can't handle.

213
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,791
See ya there.

214
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Wait... Would there
happen to be a young guy

215
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,166
in this
White Eagles club...?

216
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,250
Well meaning,
he goes by Joe...?

217
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,583
Yeah! That'd
be Joji Kitazawa.

218
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,916
Good man.

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,916
He's a Cub, but the kid's
got some definite promise

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
as a journalist...

221
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,041
You could say I've taken
him under my wing.

222
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,000
So you're the one...

223
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,875
The man Joe said
he respected...

224
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,416
Who'da thought?

225
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,833
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

226
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,250
I'm the most
respectable prick alive.

227
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,500
Now that
you mention it,

228
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,541
the kid reminds me of you
when you started.

229
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,375
Full of ideals, looking
to take some risks.

230
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,166
Startin' to feel like
I might pull this off.

231
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,208
Hey, if there's still people
like him left in this country,

232
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,791
people who believe in
something bigger

233
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,875
than what they can stuff
in their pockets,

234
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,666
maybe I could turn
things around.

235
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,125
Maybe I could
out-play Kamiya;

236
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,666
hell, take down
Suitengu, too.

237
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,833
Mister Saiga...
I'm so glad you've come!

238
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,500
Let me introduce you.

239
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,875
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present the last White Eagle!

240
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,958
Doctor...? Just how far
away is Saiga's meeting?

241
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,583
Kagura...
I'm sorry...

242
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,666
But I'm actually taking
you to the airport.

243
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,583
But, Doctor!
Saiga's waiting for me!

244
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,166
I'm just doing what
he asked, Kagura...

245
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,583
He wants to keep you safe.

246
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,041
No! You have to let me
out of this car!

247
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,541
I'm sorry,
I can't do that.

248
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,541
Exscuse me...
Madam...

249
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,375
Is Joji Kitazawa
gonna be here today?

250
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,708
Oh... So you've
already heard about him?

251
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,625
Look, I know it's a bad topic
for your first meeting...

252
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,583
But Ochiai gave
us some news...

253
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,166
He has reason to believe
there's someone in the group

254
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,541
feeding information
to Kamiya's people.

255
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,666
Are you saying you
think Joe's a spy?

256
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,125
Well no...

257
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,833
I mean we haven't been able
to prove anything yet...

258
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,583
But there's something
off about him,

259
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,541
he isn't like
the rest of us.

260
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,166
Fair enough...

261
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,375
But he doesn't come off
as a traitor.

262
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,958
Saiga!

263
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,208
Joe!

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,458
So, you realized
it was me...

265
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,666
When did you
figure it out?

266
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,833
When I hit my head
on the barstool.

267
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,458
I'm hoping you'll take a
photograph of me someday...

268
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,833
"Joe the Drunk."

269
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,916
Nah, I'd call it
"Slap-Happy Joe."

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,375
Sorry I made
such an ass of myself...

271
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,791
Not the first impression
I'd have hoped for ...

272
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,250
But still...
I'm lucky I guess...

273
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,708
I got to meet you without
all the pretense...

274
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,208
And after our discussion
I made up my mind.

275
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,208
I'm confident I can
give this to you.

276
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,166
You'll know what
to do with it.

277
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,041
My God!

278
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,666
Every single member
of Suitengu's club.

279
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,291
One of the members
they murdered

280
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,625
for outstanding debts left that
behind, as a sort of revenge.

281
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,125
Last night...
This was your big risk.

282
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,000
There's something else...

283
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,583
Ochiai... Your name's
on that list.

284
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,083
As a VIP.

285
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,208
He's a traitor?
He can't be...

286
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,666
But he's our leader...

287
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,833
You bastard...

288
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,333
Damn it...!

289
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,916
You are risking
your life!

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,833
All right, Ochiai...
Time for some answers.

291
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,541
My god... You were the one
betraying us this whole time?

292
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,750
The head of our own group,
reporting to Kamiya's faction?!

293
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,791
At last.

294
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,666
All the key
players are here.

295
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,958
My final obstacles.

296
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,958
You can't imagine how long I've
waited for this day to come...

297
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,166
I'm so pleased.

298
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,833
This is it,
White Eagles...

299
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,833
This is your end...

300
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,041
Allow me to play you some
music befitting the occasion.

301
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,583
Can you hear it?
Can you hear the overture?

302
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,583
Don't waste our time!

303
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,583
This is no joke!

304
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,791
We want answers, Ochiai!

305
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,958
Ah, you're not
really listening!

306
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,833
You mustn't use
just your ears,

307
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,250
you must listen
with your souls!

308
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,250
Joe, run!

309
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,333
Poor fools. You don't
appreciate true art.

310
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,041
You don't know what
real pleasure is.

311
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,750
You really thought
I was your comrade,

312
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,791
that I shared your
naïve goals for change?

313
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,500
Let me show you...

314
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,625
This is the
true revolution!!

315
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,416
Thought I'd lost ya.

316
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Shut up and
take me to him.

317
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,583
Joe...

318
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,750
Joe...!

319
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,375
Hey!

320
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,708
Damn you.

321
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,916
Why the hell'd
you do it?

322
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What'd I tell you...?

323
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,208
If things get bad, run,
don't be a fucking martyr!

324
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,000
Mister Saiga. What a
surprise to find you alive.

325
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,000
Clearly, you're
not one of them.

326
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,666
The old guard,
the human weak.

327
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,791
No, you're like me.

328
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,583
You're a
fucking monster.

329
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,000
And so are you.

330
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,833
Now, if you'll humor me,

331
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,500
I'd like to play a more
appropriate song...

332
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,291
A ballad of parting...

333
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,208
Listen to it well,
my friend,

334
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,291
while you picture
the girl you love.

335
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,916
Kagura...?
You son of a bitch!

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,500
What have you
done with her?

337
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,583
Another two-faced
politician.

338
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,791
Another betrayal.

339
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,500
Another obstacle between
the girl and her freedom...

340
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,416
And a surging
wave that shakes

341
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,208
to the very core
of those who believe.
