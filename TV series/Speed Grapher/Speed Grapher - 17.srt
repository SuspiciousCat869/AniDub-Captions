1
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,333
Yui...

2
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,250
Yui...? What are you
doing in my bed you goof?

3
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,791
It's scary all by myself,
Brother!

4
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,333
I'm gonna be late
for school!

5
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,750
You're late!
You're late!

6
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,333
Yui, did you turn off
my alarm again...?

7
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,416
Huh? Did you?

8
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,583
Wait, what am I doing? --

9
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,625
I've got to get ready!

10
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,875
I wonder why no one came and
woke me up this morning...?

11
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,541
All done...!
Now rinse your mouth.

12
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,250
Dad...?

13
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,458
Mom...?

14
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,125
Miss Maria...?

15
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,875
Miss Tamura?

16
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,125
Mommy!

17
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,125
Daddy!

18
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,791
Yui! Stay out!

19
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,250
What's wrong?

20
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,083
Good morning,
young man.

21
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,750
And to you as well,
young lady.

22
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,750
Ah. What a shame.

23
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,208
Truly an unfortunate
turn of events.

24
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,541
Who are you?

25
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,083
I don't know
if you're aware,

26
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,791
but your father was in
quite a bit of debt.

27
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,125
He was?

28
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,458
Oh, yes. And rather late
on his payments.

29
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,666
You're what,
thirteen now?

30
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,416
Then we'll speak as men.

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,375
Now that your father
is unable to pay his debts,

32
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,791
the burden falls upon
the shoulders of you

33
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,208
and your sister.

34
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,208
But...

35
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,041
I have some money.

36
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,958
I'll give you this...

37
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,750
Yui...

38
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,916
While I certainly appreciate
the gesture, young lady...

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,916
This is only play money--
utterly useless to me.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,208
Takeshi...! Takeshi!

41
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,125
Yui!

42
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,166
Takeshi!

43
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,541
Yui!

44
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
Yui!

45
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,541
This one's skin is so
delicate and wholesome...

46
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,250
I feel younger
just touching it--

47
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,208
his youth being sucked
through my fingers.

48
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,791
Do what you wish
with him, sir,

49
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,750
but try not to
leave any marks.

50
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,250
He's been
conscripted elsewhere

51
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,333
and I'd hate
to lower his value..

52
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Oh, God, I love it
when they scream!

53
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,875
Do it some more!
Louder!

54
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,500
What have you
done with Yui?!

55
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,708
Yui?

56
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,958
Listen up you
little pukes!

57
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,125
Your asses
have been bought!

58
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,541
If you wanna live...
kill the enemy...!

59
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,875
If you wanna go home to
your mommas, kill the enemy!

60
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,000
We spent a
lotta cash on you fucks,

61
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,208
so if you're gonna get
your dumb asses killed,

62
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,791
take the goddamn
enemy with you

63
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:29,291
or I will track you down in
Hell and rip out your balls!

64
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,041
If you want to see your
families again, kill the enemy!

65
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,625
Move!

66
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,708
You want outta this
godforsaken hellhole,

67
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,000
kill the enemy!

68
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,333
Every fucker you kill,
earns you cash!

69
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,250
Work for your money!

70
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,875
Kill and pay back
what you owe!

71
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,833
Our platoon
will parachute

72
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,541
in under the cover
of darkness......

73
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,500
Once we drop, we'll rendezvous
with another squad,

74
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,000
arriving via landing craft
from a nuclear sub offshore.

75
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,875
Our mission is to facilitate
their infiltration of the lab.

76
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,125
Any questions?

77
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,625
Who are these
bubbleheads anyways??

78
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,708
Don't know,
don't give a fuck.

79
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,791
Word has it the security forces
on this island are top-notch.

80
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,083
What are our chances of survival
against something like--...

81
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,291
Ah, forget it.

82
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,375
Pack it up, men.

83
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,458
Say man...

84
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,041
why you always playin'
that gloomy piece o' shit?

85
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,333
That "" "piece o' shit" is the
sumbitch's good luck charm.

86
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,666
Survived seven years
on the frontlines,

87
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,416
whole time playin'
that damn song--

88
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,166
tells ya somethin' huh...?

89
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,625
Sometimes you were the
only one come back alive--

90
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,958
and here you are one
mission away from freedom.

91
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,708
No hard feelings, huh?

92
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,083
Of course not...

93
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,833
Like always, my little
sister will protect me.

94
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,708
So she'll be
waitin' for ya?

95
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,291
When you get out?

96
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,541
Get the lead out
pantywaists!

97
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,500
Move!

98
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,125
This is Silent Dog.

99
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,750
We've reached our
target. Over.

100
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,166
What the fuck are they!

101
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,083
I'll check it out, sir.

102
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,208
Freeze!

103
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,458
What the...?

104
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,166
Oh, God..

105
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,166
What kind
of lab is this?

106
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,458
Hey... we got
a live one!

107
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,208
Hurry! Let's get him out of here
before the brass from HQ arrive!

108
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:44,125
Subject's pulse and blood
pressure are both dropping.

109
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,333
Appears he was exposed to the
virus before the explosion.

110
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,208
But his body was
so badly damaged...

111
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,625
You really think
we can save him?

112
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,208
We have no choice...! He's
our last remaining carrier...

113
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,416
If we lose him now,
all of our research,

114
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,750
all of our sacrifices,
will have been for nothing.

115
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,500
Even if we no longer have the
support of headquarters,

116
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,166
we must continue
with our mission.

117
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,291
Anyone ever
read Frankenstein?

118
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,333
If his body rejects even
one of the transplants...

119
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,166
That won't happen.

120
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,125
Don't forget, we still
have that left arm.

121
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,458
Wrap it up quick.

122
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,375
It's only a matter of
time before they find us.

123
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,791
If headquarters thinks they
can eliminate all traces

124
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,000
of this experiment,
they're in for quite a shock.

125
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,125
Go!

126
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,250
And no one
gets away!

127
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,125
Target located.

128
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,750
Fire!

129
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,750
Shit!

130
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,000
Fuck!

131
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,458
Damn it!

132
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,208
Die!

133
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,875
What the hell's
happened to my body?

134
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,208
Good evening.

135
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,875
Whatever it is you think I'm
doing I ain't even done it yet!

136
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,000
Tell me, is this where
I might find the gentlemen

137
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,000
who control
this neighborhood?

138
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,458
Huh? Uh,
yeah... but--

139
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,833
Then from now on
this will be my office.

140
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,458
Hey. Hey!
Hold up a second!

141
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,333
You gotta be batshit crazy to
go in there all by yourself!

142
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,125
So you're offering
to accompany me.

143
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,666
Nah...

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,541
You knock yourself
out though...

145
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,000
But ah...

146
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,791
if you're gonna be outnumbered
shouldn't you be armed?

147
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,958
That guy's
fuckin' nuts.

148
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,666
How do you like
this, bitch?!

149
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,250
Not so tough now,
are you!?

150
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,750
Fucker's out cold.

151
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,541
Then wake
'im the fuck up!

152
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,041
What the fuck
you want, grandpa?

153
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,833
I'll use small words for you:
I'm taking over your turf.

154
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,333
You're
shitting me!

155
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,416
Holy...

156
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,458
What the mother fuck?

157
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,583
No please,
don't kill me!

158
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,583
You're already dead.

159
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,083
Makabe!

160
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,541
What the fuck
they do to you?

161
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,583
You're late,
asshole!

162
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,166
Uh... What
about Tsujido?

163
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,833
Tsujido...

164
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,208
What is...
your name sir?

165
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,791
What is my name?

166
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,791
My name is...

167
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,458
Suitengu.

168
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,791
Mister Suitengu,
pardon me for saying it,

169
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,458
but you reek of death.

170
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,208
Tsujido!

171
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,083
Dispose of all
the garbage first,

172
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,250
then get your friend
cleaned up.

173
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,958
You got it... sir.

174
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,125
This is a private party.

175
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,791
Madam,
I am Choji Suitengu.

176
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,541
I've heard the name; you're
building quite a reputation...

177
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,416
I understand you've
recently seized control

178
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000
of this territory...

179
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,166
What is it I
can do for you?

180
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,750
Right to the point,
I like that...

181
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,208
Well,
Miss Tennozu...

182
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,208
You can do me
a great favor...

183
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,666
Please, place my organization
under your command.

184
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,000
A token of goodwill, should
I ever leave you unsatisfied.

185
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,458
What, pray tell,

186
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,791
can a man like you contribute
to my organization?

187
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,791
I will stimulate the continued
growth of the Tennozu Group--

188
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,375
making it the predominant firm
of this nation or any other..

189
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,833
And you,
as its queen...

190
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,583
will be on top, riding high
for as long as you desire.

191
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,833
Oh...? And how do you
intend to accomplish this?

192
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,916
I will share with you
the innermost secrets

193
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
of this country's
ruling class.

194
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,541
What kind of secrets?

195
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,625
The taboo kind.

196
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,791
Their desires and
their perversions--

197
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,250
the secrets men have
craved for all eternity...

198
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,916
Once my plan comes
to fruition,

199
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,458
and you've gained intimate
knowledge of these secrets,

200
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,458
not only will you have
Japan under your thumb,

201
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,333
but the entire world.

202
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,791
For though the
scenery may change,

203
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,291
the desires of
men are universal.

204
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,875
You've certainly aroused
my... "interest."

205
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,500
Come meet someone.

206
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,416
How do you do,
Miss Kagura?

207
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,833
I am Choji Suitengu...

208
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,583
Your mother has given me
the great honor

209
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,500
of taking care of
you from now on.

210
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,333
Pardon me, sir...

211
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,500
Come in.

212
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,833
Sorry, Mister
Kokuryo insists on speak--

213
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,708
Mister Suitengu!

214
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,500
I have something I think
you'll be very interested in!

215
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,375
Ta-da...! Money from that
old board game "Success"

216
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,041
that went out of production
fifteen years ago...

217
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,250
If I had only known

218
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,833
you were a collector
of this stuff earlier...

219
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,458
Ha! --Well anyway...

220
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,458
I had to raid a few old
warehouses but here it is...

221
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,041
two hundred million yen--
I'll take an even-trade in cash!

222
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,166
You must be joking...
This is play money.

223
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,083
Wait--but... the
other day, when you--

224
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,583
It held value for me
at the time...

225
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,333
Now?
It doesn't.

226
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,625
Oh, I gotcha...!

227
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,625
That's where your interests
lie, I understand now...

228
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,166
I'll bring you
my daughter then,

229
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,833
she's quite lovely--
Son of a--

230
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,416
Mister Kokuryo...

231
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,708
What I am about
to tell you,

232
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,500
I have never shared with
a single living soul...

233
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,416
The story of
my childhood.

234
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,333
Bu-- But why would
you tell this to me?

235
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,000
When I was thirteen
I was sold into slavery

236
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,791
to pay off my dead parents'
outstanding debts.

237
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,250
My sister was
only five.

238
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,958
It was the
Ashikaga Group--

239
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,375
which would later become
the Tennozu Group--

240
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,333
that bankrupted my family
and tore us apart--

241
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,375
I've exacted my revenge on them
but there's still someone else

242
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,625
who must pay for
destroying our lives.

243
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,041
Please stop this.
What'd I do?

244
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,625
You upper crust vermin...

245
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,666
And your bloodstained
pieces of paper...

246
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,625
You took my family's lives,

247
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,250
you took my life, you
made me into this monster...

248
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,708
But it wasn't just
my family...!

249
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,416
On the battlefields, so many
lives needlessly sacrificed...

250
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,125
Thrown away in pursuit
of the Almighty Yen.

251
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,666
Mister Suitengu!

252
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,791
Cell activity is at
eighty-two percent...

253
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,291
There's nothing more
we can do for him

254
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,791
if he should suffer
another attack.

255
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,500
It is time...
Let the endgame begin.

256
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,250
Destiny afloat
on a faraway sea,

257
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,750
drifting towards
its inevitable climax.

258
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:44,416
As in any battle, the best
defense is a strong offense.
