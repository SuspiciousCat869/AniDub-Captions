1
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,708
Sorry 'bout
this... Ginza.

2
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,208
Well, look who scored
himself an invite

3
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,166
to the "Wedding
of the Century."

4
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,083
We're closed...
Oh, you...

5
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,750
Long time no sale.

6
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,458
Yeah well...

7
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,958
I got a rush
order for ya, pal.

8
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,250
Father...

9
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,458
What have you done
with the contributions

10
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,583
that were in
the building fund?

11
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,833
Our parishioners trusted us
to spend that money

12
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,458
restoring the church!

13
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,958
Tell me... How in the name
of God do you explain this?

14
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,416
Electricity...

15
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,875
It is the guiding
force of all life.

16
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:35,875
Electricity giveith life,
and it taketh away.

17
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,333
And now that I have
its holy power I am God!

18
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,083
That's blasphemy...!

19
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,208
Just tell me how we're supposed
to pay for the repairs!

20
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,250
I will not restore a house of
worship unfit to worship me.

21
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,375
Father...
What is wrong wi-

22
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,333
"They shall know that
I am the Lord thy god...

23
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,625
when I shall lay my
vengeance upon them!"

24
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,958
From the ashes of this pyre
shall rise a temple

25
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,250
far more worthy a
testament to my glory!

26
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
Now there's a face
I haven't seen in a while.

27
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,958
Saiga!

28
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,291
You've come back
to me at last--

29
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,750
Wha--?

30
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,000
I need your help Bob...

31
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,875
I have to get the
girl back from him.

32
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,875
Are you...
serious?

33
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,500
Yeah... Because
Kagura needs me.

34
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,875
Or rather... I guess
the truth is I need her...

35
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,750
She fills my thoughts...

36
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,416
my dreams...

37
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,166
Since I first saw her
through my lens.

38
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,708
I just didn't realize
it until she was gone.

39
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,833
Saiga, you,
poor, tragic man.

40
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,583
You can only fall in love behind
the safety of your camera.

41
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,041
Ginza almost killed
me back there...

42
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,458
Maybe she's right-- What's
a guy like me doing running

43
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,791
around with a child?

44
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,541
Far be it from me
to cast judgment

45
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,500
on anyone else's tastes.

46
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,208
Whatever happens
between a man and a woman

47
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,333
or a man and a man

48
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,625
or, hell, even
a man and a goat--

49
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,208
do what you like...

50
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,958
But a grown man and a young girl
is something very different...

51
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't think it's the
best for either of you --

52
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,375
sooner or later she'll
break out of her shell

53
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,125
and step out into
the world as a woman...

54
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,416
Her hormones
will kick into gear,

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,708
and she'll need more than
just a "good friend."

56
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,875
She'll be surrounded
by young studs

57
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,083
with, tight butts
and rock hard...

58
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,291
Wait,
where was I...?

59
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,833
Oh yeah. You however,
will just be old.

60
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:11,916
Yeah.

61
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,791
You're only settin' yourself
up for heartbreak, darlin'.

62
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,041
When she's twenty and you're
ancient, she'll leave your ass.

63
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,750
I honestly don't care.

64
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,041
None of that
even matters--

65
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,291
shit I'd be happy
to see her turn twenty.

66
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,708
She doesn't
have long to live.

67
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,958
What?

68
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
But for her...

69
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,791
To spend the rest of her days
as a plaything for those sick,

70
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,083
twisted--

71
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,333
I can not
let that happen.

72
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,375
So, Mr. Privacy finally
emerges from the shadows.

73
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,208
Soon every paparazzo
in town's gonna be able

74
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,958
to snap his ugly mug.

75
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,083
Togoshi here--
what can I do ya for...?

76
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,583
Saiga is that you...?

77
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,375
I thought you'd dropped off
the face of the earth...

78
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,625
Eh...?
What ceremony?

79
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,000
You don't mean the Suitengu
wedding tomorrow...?

80
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,375
Mister Prime Minister,
was the Cabinet acting

81
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,791
under your authority
when they decided

82
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,416
to ease up on
corporate restrictions?

83
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,916
Again, no comment.

84
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,291
Before we talk
business--

85
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,666
what sort
of representation

86
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,708
will we have at the
wedding this afternoon?

87
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,208
I'm sending my secretary...

88
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,000
She loves to get dressed up.

89
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,083
Gentlemen we're talking about
the Tennozu Group's heiress...

90
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,250
marrying the man
who controls

91
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,458
our extracurricular
activities...

92
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,875
Can we risk
appearing so blasé?

93
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,833
Does anyone else find
something a tad...

94
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,250
unseemly about
this young Turk?

95
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,875
If there is something
unsavory going on,

96
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,708
our attendance could generate
public backlash down the line.

97
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,208
However...

98
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,708
This debate may be rendered
moot once the Prime Minister

99
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,541
shares the first item
on his agenda for today.

100
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,083
It may indeed.

101
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,958
Care to enlighten us?

102
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,916
Gentlemen I propose we take
steps to bring Suitengu's club

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,666
under state control.

104
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,083
We'll establish a secret
committee to oversee it--

105
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,083
siphoning operating expenses
from the federal budget.

106
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,166
Very intriguing...
Then I suppose...

107
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,833
Of course, as Parliament our
admission to the new State-

108
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,375
run club will be
free of charge.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We all know how problematic
it can be raising

110
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,250
those membership dues

111
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,208
without also raising
the wife's suspicions.

112
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,333
Excellent idea,
Mr. Prime Minister!

113
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,291
Thank you.
All those in favor?

114
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,750
It's unanimous, then.

115
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,250
We've finally succeeded in
cultivating the hormone

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,750
from Kagura's
genetic makeup.

117
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,416
Excellent... By all means,
Doctor, move on to pase two.

118
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,666
Kagura...

119
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,625
My beautiful soul mate who
shares this cursed affliction.

120
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,291
Siblings of a sort,
yet like parent and child.

121
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,583
And now we shall be
man and wife as well...

122
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,250
so this corrupt world
may be reborn anew.

123
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,625
Pardon me, sir...

124
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,416
Let me be the first to
offer my congratulations.

125
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,666
I've brought you the
current list of RSVPs.

126
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,958
As expected the politicians
are all sending their proxies...

127
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,708
Cautious as always...

128
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,416
Oh well. We have more
than enough glitterati

129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,916
attending to garner
the nation's attention.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,416
And if my presence is
validated by the public,

131
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,333
this ceremony will have
served its purpose.

132
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,916
The paperwork...?

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,166
The marriage license...

134
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,875
All the documents for
transfer of assets...

135
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,500
Everything is here.

136
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,333
That's rather conservative
attire for a wedding.

137
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,583
It is still a
time of mourning.

138
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,208
Are you not happy
now working for me?

139
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,583
I consider it the
greatest honor.

140
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,416
Have these
filed immediately.

141
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,041
Yes sir.

142
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,250
Kagura...

143
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,916
Captain, thank God you're
awake-- how do you feel?

144
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,666
Like shit.

145
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,416
Mister Saiga called and said
you were in the hospital...

146
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,666
But he didn't tell me
what happened to you.

147
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,041
I'm standing outside the church
where, in just a few moments,

148
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,416
the wedding of
Kagura Tennozu,

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,250
daughter of the
late Shinsen Tennozu

150
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,666
and heiress
to her fortune,

151
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,958
is slated to commence
in a fashion befitting

152
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,208
one of the wealthiest
women in the country...

153
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,208
The red carpet arrivals
are already underway,

154
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,875
as nobody would dare be late for
the social event of the season.

155
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,500
Take me there.

156
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,333
He won't miss that.

157
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,208
Finally I command
a church...

158
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,041
that is a worthy
tribute to my power!

159
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,041
Shouldn't Tsujido
be here by now?

160
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,458
Probably.

161
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,375
And now... Goddess on high
who is to be my bride...

162
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,958
I beseech you,
reveal yourself!

163
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,375
Hey, Captain...

164
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,833
Oh it's you...
What're you doing here?

165
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,166
Got a tip
something newsworthy

166
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,416
might actually
happen here today.

167
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,333
You don't say...

168
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,083
Choji Suitengu...

169
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,791
Do you take this woman
to be your wife,

170
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,250
for better or worse,
for richer or poorer,

171
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,583
in sickness and in health,
'til death do you part?

172
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,916
I do.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,041
And Kagura Tennozu...

174
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,791
Do you take this man to be your
husband, for better or worse,..

175
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,083
Yurigaoka?

176
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,125
Yeah he's here
I saw him come in...

177
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,875
What...?!
Son of a...

178
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,291
You have to say "I do"...
My darling...

179
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,291
She doesn't
have to do shit!

180
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,958
First you kill
her mother, and now,

181
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,000
in a last-ditch effort
to take over her empire...

182
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,375
You wanna acquire
this poor girl

183
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,583
like she's just
another commodity?

184
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,250
As if your backward idealism
wasn't a give-away...

185
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,791
I clearly recognize
your voice...

186
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,791
Tatsumi Saiga.

187
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,083
Saiga?

188
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,458
Hold on! That guy
ain't Yurigaoka!

189
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,458
Stop right there!

190
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,541
What the holy hell?!
Sounded like a bomb!

191
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,833
What are you,
mannequins?

192
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,416
In the news biz, this
is what we call "news!"

193
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Somebody run a live
feed to the networks!

194
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,208
Get the lead out!

195
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,791
Uh... okay...

196
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,208
That guy...
who is he again?

197
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,958
Quit jerkin' off
over there and move!

198
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,375
You people may not be
wearing the same masks today,

199
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,625
but I still recognize you
all from the Club...

200
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,416
Therefore... you should
recognize me too,

201
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,958
and you know what happens
when I press this shutter.

202
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,541
Suitengu!
Step away from the girl!

203
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,541
You want her for
your own sick pleasure?

204
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,291
What I want is for you to stay
the fuck away from that girl!

205
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,333
Go ahead. Take a picture--
I dare you..

206
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,583
But know this...
It'll be your last.

207
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,166
God damn--

208
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,708
Go ahead...
Suitengu...!

209
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,583
Let the whole
country see...

210
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,375
see what you
really are!

211
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,458
Saiga!

212
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,250
Well what're
you afraid of...?

213
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,791
That all the cockroaches are
going to go scampering back

214
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,375
into the shadows...?

215
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,750
'Cause you know...

216
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,875
that exposure spells the
end of every vermin in here!

217
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,333
This can't be...

218
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,125
I'm a... movie star
for Christ's sake!

219
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,083
Saiga!

220
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,500
Now you get to watch
me leave with the girl.

221
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,750
What a cruel fate...

222
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,041
That my glorious cathedral
would be christened

223
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,208
under such unholy
circumstances!

224
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,666
Suitengu my son...

225
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,041
I will rain divine retrobution
down upon these sinners!

226
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,541
Mister Suitengu!

227
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,291
Can you tell us what
happened in there?

228
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,500
How would you characterize
the relationship

229
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,125
between that man
and your bride?

230
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,500
Is Miss Tennozu
a runaway bride?

231
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,750
She's yet to be seen!

232
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,333
No need for concern...

233
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,500
I've moved her somewhere safe
and private until our honeymoon.

234
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,416
Tatsumi Saiga...
I will destroy you.

235
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,541
I have a marriage license that
needs to be filed right away.

236
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,750
Gladly.

237
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, it's...

238
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,458
Still unclear at this time...

239
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,791
exactly what happened
inside that church today...

240
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,125
I don't have all day.

241
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,208
Oh. Consider it done.

242
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,458
Then it's official.

243
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,375
Kagura's
a married woman.

244
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,958
Come on Kagura!

245
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,625
Wake up...!
It's all right.

246
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,916
You're with me now.

247
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,291
Sai-ga...?

248
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,000
Verily Lord,

249
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,125
unyielding Voltage
is the cross I bear...

250
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,666
Mister Saiga!!

251
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,791
It's good
to have you back.

252
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,000
Where are we?

253
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,291
The church... Outside.

254
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,625
That's right...!

255
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,458
They tried to force me
to marry Mr. Suitengu...!

256
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,416
But I knew it--
I knew you'd come save me!

257
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,666
Then let's go.

258
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,875
Okay!

259
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,541
I will not allow it!

260
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,166
The Wrath of God shall
sear your mortal flesh...

261
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,333
Now... it is time
to confess your sins.

262
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,166
Hey, are you all right?

263
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,083
Yeah...
I think so...

264
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,375
Good...

265
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,291
that jolt wasn't
intended for you --

266
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,125
it was for your cameras.

267
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,458
For electricity
is divine truth.

268
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,583
Electricity is
the blood of God!

269
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,458
Now prostrate yourselves
and prepare to repent.

270
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:04,250
But first I've got
some truth for you.

271
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,458
True pros never switched to
digital or point-and-shoot.

272
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,250
Our cameras are
entirely mechanical.

273
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,291
Means they've got no
circuits to short.

274
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,583
With you for a subject
it seems a bit redundant

275
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,250
to use a flash...

276
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,625
Almost!

277
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey...!
Need a lift?!

278
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,708
Nice ride...!

279
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,708
Kagura... Ready?

280
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,541
Uh-huh!

281
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,458
Blasphemy!

282
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,250
May lightning strike you
for your sins against me!

283
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,375
Holy fuck!!!

284
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,708
My Wrath against you
shall not be quenched!

285
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,375
Kagura!

286
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,041
Saiga!

287
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,375
Everything okay?

288
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah.

289
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,541
After all we've been
through we're right back

290
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,541
where we started.

291
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,791
But things are
different this time...

292
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,333
'Cause now
we're free too.

293
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,958
Yeah.

294
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,250
A mermaid beckons
from the water's edge.

295
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,541
Her tongue for a pair
of land-walking legs.

296
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,958
Will her watery kiss
lure the wayward prince

297
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,083
to the deep abyss?

298
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,375
Life ain't a fairy
tale, princess.
