1
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,791
There's nothing in here about
what happened at the church.

2
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,791
Despite all those reporters
standing right there...

3
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,708
Musta been bought off...

4
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,708
Shit, even the press in
this country is corrupt.

5
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,291
Something
tells me, though;

6
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,333
Suitengu won't
be so quick to forget.

7
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,250
I drink maybe I've had
too much to think...

8
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,750
Cap'n.

9
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,083
Saiga...
you asshole...

10
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,583
Next stop...
Omiya...

11
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,500
Omiya.

12
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,333
Where are
we going... Saiga?

13
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,208
Nevermind...

14
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,750
I don't care as
long as you're here.

15
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,708
Wow! The sea!

16
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,333
When I was a child,

17
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,583
The Little Mermaid was
my favorite storybook.

18
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,791
Hate to break it to ya
but you're still a child.

19
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,000
The Little Mermaid
lived under the sea...

20
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,708
and when she turned fifteen,

21
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,291
she was allowed to swim to
the surface for the first time,

22
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,541
and see the world above,
as she'd always dreamed.

23
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,000
And that's when she saw a
handsome prince on a ship

24
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,208
and fell in love with him.

25
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,250
Sorry kid... but
I'm no handsome prince.

26
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,125
You're really funny
sometimes Saiga...

27
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,750
That was just
a fairy tale.

28
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,666
She don't look
like no hitman.

29
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,458
She was in a film a few years
back-- made a big splash.

30
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,541
She's an actress?

31
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,458
She only did the one movie.

32
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,833
Just got another update
from the coppers...

33
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,708
They were last spotted
headed up north.

34
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,750
What, is she some kinda
fuckin' mute , too?

35
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,500
Fuck if I know.

36
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,000
The Little Mermaid lost
her beautiful voice.

37
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,583
She desired human legs,

38
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,833
so she could be with
her beloved prince...

39
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,166
The Sea Witch gave the Mermaid
what she desired,

40
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,916
but took away
her voice in exchange.

41
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,833
What have I lost
in exchange for this?

42
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,208
Oh Mother...!

43
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,083
Kagura...?

44
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,083
Kagura,
you're burning up!

45
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,166
Why didn't you say
something to me?

46
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,541
How long have you
had this fever?

47
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,083
I'm going to get
you some help, okay,

48
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,166
you just need
to hold on...

49
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,208
She's gone...
Mother's gone...

50
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,000
Miharu Tsurumaki...

51
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,583
When she was five, her mother
attempted a murder-suicide.

52
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,041
Only got it half-right,
though... Miharu lived.

53
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,250
Since then...
she hasn't uttered a word.

54
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,750
It wasn't her first
scare, either...

55
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,375
Her mother had dragged her
into the sea many times before.

56
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,375
Time and again,
she nearly drowned.

57
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,708
Poor kid--
That's fucked up.

58
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,416
There are plenty
of men who'll take pity

59
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,708
on a downtrodden
beauty like her...

60
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,458
Thanks to them she's
never missed a meal.

61
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,500
Can a fragile broad like
her really handle him?

62
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,041
Don't be misled, that is
the face of death itself.

63
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,375
I finally managed
to finagle us a car.

64
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,791
It's a hunk of junk,
but it'll have to do.

65
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,208
There's s'posed to be an inn
way up in the hills...

66
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,333
We're gonna have to lay
low some place off

67
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,916
the beaten
path for now...

68
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Think you can hang
on 'til we get there?

69
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,875
Don't worry
about me... I'm fine.

70
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,666
You're definitely
not fine...!

71
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,625
I can feel the heat coming off
your forehead from here.

72
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,958
So do you still
have a headache?

73
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,833
My mother must be really
upset with me right now.

74
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,958
It's not fair that
I'm still alive and she's...

75
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,750
But none of that
matters, does it?

76
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,458
As long as I've got you
by my side... even if I die...

77
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,958
Don't finish that sentence!

78
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,875
Quit with the dying crap...!
You're still just a child!

79
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,166
Don't get angry...

80
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,791
I'm not getting angry!

81
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,208
Look at you.

82
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,208
Saiga you've been acting
weird around me all day ...

83
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,916
Please tell me what
I did to make you so mad.

84
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,625
Why'd you even bother
coming to save me

85
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,583
if all I do
is make you miserable?

86
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,708
I'm sorry... It's not you
that I'm mad at.

87
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,666
I guess I'm just not cut out
for this parenting crap...

88
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,208
I mean I don't know if
I should give you medicine...

89
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,916
Or if that'll make
you sick or worse or--

90
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,708
I just don't know.

91
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,541
I'm sorry,...
I'm so immature.

92
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,125
Hey, if anybody's being
immature here... it's me.

93
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,333
Best I can hope to do...

94
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,791
is to go on
holdin' Kagura's hand

95
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,583
through the end of her
way too short life...

96
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,541
Well, at least until this
curse claims me, too...

97
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,250
The two of us, marching
towards our deaths,

98
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,166
like a god damned
double suicide.

99
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,458
I think I figured out
what your deal is...

100
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,750
Yeah, well try
not to talk...

101
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,041
You should rest.

102
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,708
Okay spit it out.

103
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,125
Well at first I thought...

104
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,708
you were like this
amazing superhero...

105
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,166
But...
turns out...

106
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,458
you're just
really awkward.

107
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,291
So I'm awkward, huh?

108
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,208
Go back to sleep, Kagura.

109
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,500
Thick fog...

110
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,458
Hey lady...! You might wanna
watch where you're goin'!

111
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,750
Are you out here
all by yourself?

112
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,083
Can't talk can you?

113
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,791
Hey... do I know
you from somewhere?

114
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,625
'cause I just can't kick
this feeling that...

115
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,666
I've seen you
before but I don't--

116
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,125
Look, I'd love to help you out
but now is not a good time.

117
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,750
Sorry I can't
give you a lift.

118
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,833
Look, if you keep followin' this
road, you'll reach a town...

119
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,500
Get someone there
to help you. I--

120
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,125
Hey!

121
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait, where
you taking me?!

122
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,291
Was there something
out here, or--?

123
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,333
Let... go 'a me!

124
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,208
What the hell
is goin' on here?

125
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,375
That kiss was
as cold as ice.

126
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,041
It's hot...
So hot...

127
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,375
Your fever's
actin' up again...

128
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,833
Want me to crack
open a window?

129
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,875
Please...

130
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,166
That's strange...

131
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,958
So cold...

132
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,833
What's wrong?

133
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,791
There's a woman...

134
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,458
She just appeared
outta nowhere...

135
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,291
Where?

136
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,333
There...

137
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,750
Is she a ghost?

138
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,250
A ghost...
Of course...

139
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,791
Saiga...
I'm scared...

140
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,541
There's no such thing...

141
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,125
I've seen too many people
die in my lifetime...

142
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,500
and not a one of
'em ever came back.

143
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,875
Ghosts only exist in
fairy tales and movies.

144
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,750
I remember one movie
with a ghost in it...

145
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,791
Saw it years ago.

146
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,541
And it was that woman.

147
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,750
The director cast some
mute actress in the role

148
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,166
since the ghost
had no lines

149
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,666
and he thought it'd make
her seem more otherworldly.

150
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,541
You think that
actress is here?

151
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,208
Let's go.

152
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, I remember now.
The rumors.

153
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,541
How the director
was screwing her,

154
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,541
and when things went sour
he tried to kill them both.

155
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,166
Only, she survived and cashed
in with a huge insurance payout.

156
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,583
One after the other, Miharu
wrapped her men in her arms

157
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,416
and dragged them
into the sea...

158
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,125
And every time, she's
emerged the sole survivor.

159
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,666
So you're sayin' this
murder-suicide shit's

160
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,875
like her gimmick?

161
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,000
I think she sees the water
as a surrogate

162
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,916
for her dead mother's
embrace...

163
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
only place she can go to
silence the guilt of living.

164
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,958
Saiga... something's
not right about this fog.

165
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,416
'cause there's
something in the fog.

166
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,875
In the fog?

167
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,750
Whatever it is it's
definitely not a ghost.

168
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,125
What is it?!

169
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,875
Whatever happens--
stay in the car!

170
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,541
Damn it. Lens
is all fogged up.

171
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,625
Saiga...!

172
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,333
Saiga!

173
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,416
A mermaid?

174
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,916
Saiga!

175
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,916
So...

176
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,375
Is this how I die...?

177
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,083
Guess there are
worse ways to go...

178
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,208
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but it's all too much...

179
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,791
Mommy has to leave you.

180
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,000
Mommy please
stop crying.

181
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,250
We could go
together again.

182
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,750
Take me with you.

183
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,541
At last...

184
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,166
I can be with her...

185
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,333
What's with the downpour
all of a sudden?

186
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,666
It's like--
glowin'...

187
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,541
It smells like Miharu.

188
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,375
She used too much power--
evaporated into the atmosphere.

189
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,208
I suppose her
wish was granted.

190
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,125
Kagura...!

191
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,750
Kagura...!
Don't die on me!

192
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,583
It's not your time!

193
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,875
Please... I thought you'd
figured out by now...

194
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,333
it'll take alot more than
just that to kill me.

195
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
You're right...
You're too strong to die...

196
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,333
Too strong.

197
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I was wrong just to
give up and accept it...

198
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,041
I swear, I will find
a way to fix you.

199
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,875
I will never...
let you die!

200
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,625
You see...
just awkward.

201
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,625
It's accounting time
for the corporate beast,

202
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,500
and even the most violent
exchanges must be valued,

203
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,250
and inked in the books.

204
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,500
What are the costs
of your actions?

205
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,958
And were they worth it?

206
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,083
What price can you
put on a human life?
