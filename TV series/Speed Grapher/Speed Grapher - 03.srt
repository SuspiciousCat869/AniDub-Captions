1
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:55,250
Death to the
intruder, at once!

2
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,916
He stole my ritual...

3
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,083
He stole my kiss!

4
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,333
He has to suffer!

5
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,166
It cannot be forgiven!

6
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,125
It should be my
right to kill him!

7
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,416
Kill him!

8
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,208
Yeah!

9
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,708
God damn it...!

10
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,541
This man is a Euphoric!

11
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,166
Bastard!

12
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,000
What the hell...?
My camera did that?

13
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,208
Unbelievable.

14
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,666
He's a natural carrier?

15
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,833
Detain that man!

16
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,333
And get Kagura to safety!

17
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,875
Yes sir.

18
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,875
Hey, girl.
Can you hear me?

19
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,583
Hey!

20
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,958
I've got their scent--
they're in Area B.

21
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,208
Ugh, dizzy. I've
lost too much blood.

22
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,333
Stop! Do you want
to kill her too??

23
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,125
I'm willing to let
you live, stranger...

24
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,250
Just give Kagura
back to us.

25
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,458
Kagura...?

26
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,625
I thought she was
your Divine Goddess.

27
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,958
In any case, she's obviously
an important part

28
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,708
of this fucked-up
operation...

29
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,833
So I'll take that to mean
I'm traveling safer

30
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,875
as long as she's with me.

31
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,833
Have you found them?

32
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,166
I'm sorry, sir,

33
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,958
but he's using her
as a hostage and he got away.

34
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,083
I think he's headed towards
the water purification plant.

35
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,166
Damn it-- what's going
on in this place...?

36
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,208
... It's gotta
be this camera...

37
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,791
There's no
mistaking that...

38
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,666
What the hell?

39
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,458
I should be dead.
But I'm healing.

40
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,125
Maybe it's not the camera.

41
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,625
Maybe it's me.

42
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,583
This way!

43
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,083
Hurry!

44
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,916
What am I
doing here...?

45
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,750
And who are you...?

46
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,875
Why am I--

47
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,666
What does this mean??

48
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,791
You tell me--

49
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,208
Stay away...!

50
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,000
What's happened to me?

51
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,083
That's my question...

52
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,416
My camera...

53
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,875
My body-- what the
fuck's going on here?

54
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,708
What are you
talking about?

55
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,916
Perhaps I should
answer that.

56
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,041
Kagura has used
her talents on you...

57
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,666
She has awoken
your potential,

58
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,250
and turned your deepest
desire into reality.

59
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,791
What do you mean,
"deepest desire?"

60
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,708
Mister Suitengu?

61
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,750
Yes, Kagura, it's me.

62
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,416
There's no need to worry.

63
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,958
I've come
to take you home.

64
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,750
But...
I don't understand...

65
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,166
How did I get here?

66
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,750
Why am I wearing this...
this costume?

67
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,833
I've seen it before...

68
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,833
It's the same costume
I've worn every night,

69
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,666
in those terrible dreams...!

70
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,375
Could it be...
Could it be real?

71
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,041
Did I really do those
disgusting things?

72
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,000
Of course not...
It's all in your head...

73
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,458
You're dreaming right now...

74
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,166
In the morning you'll awake
and tell me all about it.

75
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,333
Nice story...

76
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,791
But enough
of this bullshit--

77
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,625
What did you mean by her
fulfilling my desire?

78
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,458
How?

79
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,666
Kagura...

80
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,666
Come along now.

81
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,166
The things I remember...

82
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,375
What happened in here...

83
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,000
If everything those men
did to me in my dreams...

84
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,000
Is true...

85
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,583
I...

86
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,541
I can't...

87
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,458
Oh god...

88
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,291
No, wait!

89
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,791
Tsujido...

90
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,291
Have speedboats ready
at Shibaura Dock!

91
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,833
Quite a performance,
you have to admit...

92
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,875
He dropped this
in the hall.

93
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,750
"Explo-tography"...

94
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,041
No wait...

95
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,666
"Snap-Shooting"
--that has a better ring.

96
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,625
A unique ability.

97
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,208
I may call on your help,

98
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,791
should the situation
demand it...

99
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,833
Master Shirogane...

100
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,291
Of course...

101
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,166
Anything to ensure
the Club's survival.

102
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,833
You all right?

103
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't touch me...!

104
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,083
I didn't ask you
to save me...!

105
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,375
You should have
just let me drown.

106
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,166
I wanted to...

107
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,958
You're too young
for thoughts like that.

108
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,666
Please,
let go of me...!

109
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,791
How can I live if those
nightmares really happened...?

110
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,875
I have to die!

111
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,833
Don't say that!

112
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,958
You see that girl?

113
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,375
Her whole village
was wiped out

114
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,208
in a war she couldn't
hope to understand.

115
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,083
Still... She found
a reason to keep living.

116
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,708
But how...?

117
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,041
How can she smile,
after all that pain?

118
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,666
Because she's free.

119
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,000
Free?

120
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,750
Free to live, and dream,

121
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,833
without worrying about
what she doesn't have.

122
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,208
That's just an illusion.

123
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,250
Don't ever talk so lightly
about dying again.

124
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,541
Take me away.

125
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:47,000
To somewhere far off, where
nobody can ever find me...!

126
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm a prisoner here--
I can't take it any more...!

127
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,666
Please save me!

128
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,125
I'll die
if I have to stay!

129
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,541
There!
Straight ahead!

130
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,583
Damn it...
Take a deep breath.

131
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,458
Don't let go of me!

132
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,083
No! Let me go!

133
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,333
Don't take me back there!

134
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,916
Yes sir, we have Kagura,
safe and sound...

135
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,125
He's still underwater...

136
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,125
Right...

137
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,416
We'll bring her back now.

138
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,958
Okay, second team,
you keep searching...

139
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,916
'til sun-up
if you have to...

140
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,458
I want that man dead!

141
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,125
NO!!

142
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,375
Damn it...

143
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,583
She has awoken
your potential,

144
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,208
and turned your deepest
desire into reality.

145
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,958
So that's it...?

146
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,375
That's my deepest
god-damned desire--

147
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,833
to kill with
my own thirty-five?

148
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,666
That's so fucked up!

149
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,250
You comin' after me--

150
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,166
now that's a pleasant
role reversal,.

151
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,791
Your clothes're all ripped.

152
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,666
You been foolin' around with
dangerous elements again, Tiger?

153
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,625
Guess so.

154
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,791
We have a subterranean fire
in the Roppongi District.

155
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,541
All units--

156
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,250
Here...

157
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,875
That is what you
came for, isn't it?

158
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,666
A girl who can't
fuck without her gun,

159
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,291
and a guy
who can't get it up

160
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,625
without starin'
through a camera...

161
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,875
Don't we just make
the perfect couple..

162
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,291
Now come on, babe...

163
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,291
Give it to me
hard and slow,

164
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,791
I want to feel you
all the way through.

165
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,541
I don't think I can.

166
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,625
What...?!

167
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,708
You better not've
met another woman...

168
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,708
And if I have?

169
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,541
I'll kill you.

170
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,500
Saiga!

171
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,916
Jesus Christ...

172
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,166
I am not here to play
your goddamn nurse!

173
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,041
Thank you for receiving
us, Mrs. Morishita.

174
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,708
It's awfully early.

175
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,500
What do you want?

176
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,541
I'm afraid we're the bearers
of the most unfortunate

177
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,291
sort of news, madam...

178
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,875
Late last night your
husband passed away.

179
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,416
What did you say?

180
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,166
There was an accident
at our Club.

181
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,083
What club?

182
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,916
I hope we can settle
this amicably.

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,916
We've come to compensate
you for your loss.

184
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,541
You bastards...

185
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,875
You honestly think you can
pay for my husband's life

186
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,375
with your pocketbooks?

187
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,125
Now.

188
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,708
What's the
meaning of this?

189
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,250
Who are these men??

190
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,416
Three billion yen,
altogether.

191
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,708
Three billion?

192
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,666
The market value of his life,
by our calculation...

193
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,125
He was an older man,
well past his prime...

194
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,208
Planning for your son
run in his place

195
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,958
in the next
parliamentary elections.

196
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,083
Actually, his tragic death
should help your son

197
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,500
capture the sympathies
of the people...

198
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:31,083
I'd say it's more than
enough, Mrs. Morishita.

199
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,458
Or would you rather we leak
that photo to the press,

200
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,500
and destroy his
reputation as well?

201
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,208
His loser son is
a member too, correct?

202
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,500
Yes.

203
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,041
Get him into debt, then
seize the entire estate.

204
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,500
This is bad news.

205
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,583
I understand.

206
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,166
And I'm terribly sorry.

207
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,875
But the truth
of what happened

208
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,208
will never be reported
by the media.

209
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,291
We're in better
shape than you think.

210
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,958
Yes, but Morishita
was a Cabinet Minister.

211
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,541
I'm aware of that...

212
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,500
But the man was only
appointed as a figurehead...

213
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,166
The agendas that really matter
won't be affected at all.

214
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,541
Even so...

215
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,291
that means we now have
two legislative vacancies...

216
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,875
Our party could easily
lose those seats

217
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,666
in the special
elections.

218
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,875
The Tennozu Group will
finance all your campaigns,

219
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,458
one hundred percent.

220
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,125
Cut to the chase--
what about the Club?

221
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,000
We'll have to close
it for a while.

222
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,541
Close...?
That won't work.

223
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,750
Don't worry. I've already
instructed Suitengu to...

224
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,916
take care of you
in the interim.

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,208
Let's hope so...

226
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,375
I've explained things
to all our regular members--

227
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,750
they're not happy,
but they can be handled.

228
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,625
I sincerely apologize again
for this disgrace, Miss Tennozu.

229
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,000
Perhaps you
can enlighten me.

230
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,208
What was my daughter
doing there?

231
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,000
She stopped by
for a short performance,

232
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,000
at her piano
instructor's request.

233
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,041
I assure you, she has
no knowledge of the Club.

234
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,375
That's all...? It's not
because you love her

235
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,541
and have laid
your hands on her?

236
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,041
Never, my lady.

237
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,541
Just remember what
will happen if you do...

238
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,250
Finally awake?

239
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,708
Mister Suitengu...
Where am I?

240
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,125
Don't worry,
you're at home...

241
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,583
In one of the
mansion's back rooms.

242
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,708
But why?

243
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,416
For your safety...

244
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,166
You were tossing and turning in
your bed for hours last night...

245
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,041
You began sleepwalking, and we
were afraid you'd get hurt...

246
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,666
Your mother wants you
to recuperate here.

247
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,458
Sleepwalking...?

248
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,500
Mister Suitengu,
you're not saying everything

249
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,625
that happened last night was
just another nightmare, are you?

250
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,791
Well I'm afraid I don't know
what you're referring to Kagura,

251
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,666
but you were
home all night.

252
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,458
No, it can't be!

253
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,875
What about that man?
What happened to him?

254
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,291
What about what man?

255
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,041
That photographer
who saved my life!

256
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,750
You mean someone
from your dreams...?

257
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,541
Well... You'd best call on
Lord Morpheus for that one...

258
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,250
As for things in this
world, call on your maid.

259
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,625
Mister Suitengu,
wait! Please!

260
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,125
Let me out of here!
I'm awake now!

261
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,083
You don't have
to keep me like this!

262
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,583
Tell me you've found him.

263
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,875
No...
Not yet, sir.

264
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,666
And why not?

265
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,708
My best men are on it.

266
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,166
We'll get him.

267
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,125
Please let me out...!
You have to...!

268
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,250
Don't make me
stay in this cage!

269
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,500
Someone, help!

270
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,833
Don't make me
stay here!

271
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,000
Help me...

272
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,166
Be free...

273
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,250
What time's the
press conference?

274
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,875
2 p.m., sir.

275
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,458
God damn it! They don't want it
to the make the evening paper!

276
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,958
Ah hell, we'll
run an extra!

277
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,541
Yes, sir.

278
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,583
Son of a--

279
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,125
Saiga?

280
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,666
What're you doing
in my office?

281
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,916
I needed some information
on the Tennozu Group.

282
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,208
And how did
you sign on?

283
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:08,125
Your password was taped to
the back of your desk drawer.

284
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,666
Have you heard
the big news?

285
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,375
About what?...

286
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,708
where inside legislators
are scrambling to react

287
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,916
to the sudden deaths
of two of their own,

288
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,166
news that has
sent shockwaves

289
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,833
throughout a government
already in disarray.

290
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,375
Most notably,

291
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,208
the death of Education and
Science Minister Morishita--

292
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,833
And that's just
the start of it--

293
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,500
a number of high-profile
entertainers

294
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,958
and corporate executives
passed away last night,

295
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,166
with causes of death ranging
from household accidents

296
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,708
to cirrhosis
of the liver.

297
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,625
And none of the families
are letting the press get

298
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,916
within a hundred meters.

299
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,041
It doesn't make sense.

300
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,875
I don't suppose you know
anything about it...?

301
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,000
Have any luck with the
Roppongi Club last night?

302
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,125
I'd say they've
been put on hiatus.

303
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,125
Hiatus?!

304
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,000
What is it?

305
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,250
The picture you mentioned
is in this magazine.

306
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,458
I hope it helps.

307
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,625
Thank you.

308
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,166
Call if you need
anything else.

309
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,250
This is it...

310
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,541
"Photo by
Tatsumi Saiga,

311
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,125
Renowned War
Photojournalist."

312
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,208
That's him!

313
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,541
You are real...

314
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,083
You're not some figment of
my imagination, like he said.

315
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,666
To somewhere far off, where
nobody can ever find me...!

316
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,875
I'm a prisoner here--
I can't take it any more...!

317
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,333
Please save me!

318
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,166
I'll die if I have to stay!

319
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,250
So that's where
they keep you...

320
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,375
How fitting...

321
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,166
A lighthouse, in an
otherwise hopeless sea.

322
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,166
An innocent girl
asked for help,

323
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,541
and I'd be a
monster not to try.

324
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,625
I'm not the only one in this
city who's been changed

325
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,875
by the goddess' kiss.

326
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,666
What happens when two
warped desires collide?
