AT CAMP,

474
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:09,999
WE WERE THE ONES
CHOSEN TO GO TO THE DIGIWORLD.

475
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:11,999
I KNEW IT COULDN'T
JUST BE COINCIDENCE.

476
00:19:12,032 --> 00:19:15,499
SOMEHOW WE WERE ALL CONNECTED
BY SOME COMMON EVENT.

477
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,665
TODAY I DISCOVERED
WHAT THAT EVENT WAS.

478
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,965
WE ALL TOOK FRENCH
IN SCHOOL?

479
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,965
FOUR YEARS AGO,
WE WERE ALL LIVING

480
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,465
AT HIGHTON VIEW TERRACE.

481
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:25,765
ALL OF US SAW
THOSE TWO DIGIMON FIGHT.

482
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,232
THEN THE EIGHTH DIGIDESTINED
SAW THE DIGIMON, TOO.

483
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:31,565
THE EIGHTH DIGIDESTINED
HAD TO HAVE BEEN THERE AS WELL.

484
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,199
WHAT IF MYOTISMON
HAS FOUND THE KID ALREADY?

485
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,199
HE'S BEEN SEARCHING
THE CITY ALL DAY.

486
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,199
IF THE CHILD LIVED HERE
FOUR YEARS AGO,

487
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:39,665
MAYBE IT'S STILL HERE.

488
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,165
I DON'T THINK SO.

489
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,465
MAMMOTHMON WOULDN'T BE MAKING
ALL THIS COMMOTION

490
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:45,965
IF THEY'D ALREADY FOUND
THE EIGHTH DIGIDESTINED CHILD.

491
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,432
MYOTISMON IS STILL SEARCHING.

492
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,432
I SAY THE CHILD
IS STILL OUT THERE.

493
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,432
MAYBE HE MOVED,
LIKE YOU GUYS.

494
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:54,899
WE'LL FIND HIM
<i>BEFORE</i> MYOTISMON.

495
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,565
THE EIGHTH DIGIDESTINED --

496
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,599
HE MIGHT BE
SOMEONE WE KNOW.
