WHAT'S THAT YUCKY SMELL?

157
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,886
Matt sniffing: OH,
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,653
NOW YOU KNOW
WHY THEY CALL THEM
SWEAT SOCKS.

159
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,719
THIS BEACH WOULD BE
A LOT MORE POPULAR

160
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,419
IF IT JUST HAD
A COUPLE MORE THINGS

161
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:02,519
LIKE AN OCEAN,
A GENTLE BREEZE,

162
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:05,253

LIFEGUARDS. TEE-HEE!

163
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:08,219
HOLD IT.
I HAVE TO STOP.

164
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:09,286
I JUST
DON'T THINK

165
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,619
I CAN GO
ANY FASTER. HUH.

166
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,053
YOU HAVE TO
STAY POSITIVE.

167
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,953
LET'S ALL PRETEND
THAT IT'S RAINING.

168
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,219
YEAH, HA HA!

169
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:19,553
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I SIMPLY ADORE THE RAIN.

170
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,686
ME, TOO, BUT
IT'S TIME FOR
A REALITY CHECK.

171
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,186
THIS
ISN'T GETTING
ANY BETTER.

172
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,086
IT MIGHT BE
A GOOD IDEA
TO TURN AROUND

173
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,553
AND GET OUT
OF THIS DESERT
RIGHT NOW.

174
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,819
YOU MEAN BEFORE WE ALL
HAVE A POWER OUTAGE?
MM-HMM.

175
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:29,986
I'LL VOTE FOR THAT.

176
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:30,986
WAIT.

177
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,319
HOLD ON FOR
JUST A SECOND,
EVERYBODY.

178

IF I'M SEEING
WHAT I THINK
I'M SEEING...

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,753
WHAT IS IT, TAI?

180

182
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,186
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

183
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,919
NOW ALL WE NEED ARE
SOME LEMONS, SUGAR,

184
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,286
AND SOME BIG,
FAT ICE CUBES!

185
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,619
THAT LOOKS LIKE A VILLAGE.
MAYBE WE'LL FIND PEOPLE.

I'M
HUNGRY ENOUGH
TO EAT BROCCOLI!

191
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,819
WHAT'S
BROCCOLI? IS
THAT A JOKE?

192
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:59,986

FROM SO FAR AWAY,
EVERYTHING LOOKED SO BIG.

199

BUT THEY'RE SO CUTE
AND TINY.

200
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:28,153
OK, QUESTION:

WHO HERE KNOWS
WHERE WE CAN GET
A DRINK?

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,253
YES, WE KNOW
THEY LOOK FUNNY.
IN SPITE OF THIS,

206
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:39,819
THEY'RE ALL
ACTUALLY VERY NICE.

IF YOU ARE NOT DIGIMON,

THIS IS GREAT!
THERE IS NO WAY

WE'RE ALL GONNA FIT
INTO THIS PLACE.

213

RELAX, JOE.
AT LEAST THE NATIVES
HERE ARE FRIENDLY.

214

OH, MY, I WOULD JUST
LOVE TO TAKE ONE HOME

AND PUT IT ON MY BED
WITH ALL MY OTHER

DO YOU THINK MIMI HEARS
THE SAME THINGS WE HEAR?

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:03,819
I'M NOT SURE ANYMORE.

219
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,953
MAYBE SHE'S AN ALIEN SPY.

220
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,553
T.K. IS TIRED
AND HUNGRY.

THE ONLY ONE.

BIYOMON, JUST WHEN
DID YOU DIGIVOLVE?

223
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:15,019
WHEN I MET SORA.
WE SHARE A SPECIAL BOND,

224
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:16,053
WHICH IS MAGICAL.

225
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:17,886
YOU DON'T TALK
LIKE US ANYMORE.

226
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,753
IS THAT HOW
ALL BIYOMON TALK?

227
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:21,886
NO. IT'S HOW
THE BIG ONES TALK.

228
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,153
I SUPPOSE I JUST
PICKED IT UP FROM SORA.

229
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:26,153
SHE IS A WONDERFUL
AND KIND HUMAN BEING,

230
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:27,986
AND I'VE ALREADY
LEARNED A LOT FROM HER.

DON'T UNDERSTAND

ABOUT BEING AROUND

THAT MAKES IT
HAPPEN?

234
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:35,719
SORA NEEDED ME.

235
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:38,119
I HAD TO PROTECT HER.
WHEN SHE WAS IN DANGER...

236
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,653
SHE HAD TO PROTECT ME?

237
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,219
A POWER CAME FLOWING
THROUGH ME.

238

WAIT A SECOND.
NOW I GET IT.

239
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,619
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
ALWAYS FOLLOWING ME
AROUND.

240

ALL OF A SUDDEN I
REALIZED I'D DIGIVOLVED.

WHEN TAI NEEDED HIM,

TO KOROMON TO PROTECT HIM,

DID THE SAME FOR MATT.

A LITTLE CRAZY, TOO.

475
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:53,795
THE POOR GUY.

476
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,028
YAY, BIYOMON DID IT!

477
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:03,028
WOW, EVERY TIME
I'M IN DANGER,

478
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,561
BIYOMON COMES
TO MY RESCUE.

479
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,061
THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A FRIEND.

480
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,261
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, SORA!

481
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,528
OH, BI, I WAS
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

482
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:15,295
YOU'RE GREAT.
I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.

483
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,895
I WASN'T
THE LEAST BIT AFRAID.

484
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,895
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS SAVING YOU.

485
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,561
BECAUSE--
WELL, YOU KNOW.

486
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:22,195
OHH.

487
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,426
MERAMON, WHY DID YOU
ATTACK OUR VILLAGE?

488
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:37,826
I COULDN'T
STOP MYSELF.

489
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,059
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
AWFUL FOR YOU.

490
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,459
IF YOU COULDN'T
CONTROL YOURSELF,

491
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:43,026
WHO WAS CONTROLLING YOU?

492
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,293
THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER IS BEING
HIT BY THAT GEAR.

493
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,426
WELL, WE'RE JUST HAPPY TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE BACK TO NORMAL.

494
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,193
I HOPE NOTHING LIKE THIS
EVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

495
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,959
YOU'RE NEEDED TO PROTECT
MOUNT MIHARISHI.

496
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:56,626
GOOD-BYE, MERAMON!
MAY YOU ALWAYS STAY WELL.

497
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:02,193
GOOD-BYE! AND PLEASE,
TRY NOT TO BURN DOWN
OUR VILLAGE ANYMORE, OK?

498
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:05,693
HEY, I JUST REMEMBERED
YOU NEVER GOT THAT DINNER
WE PROMISED YOU.

499
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:06,893
YOU MUST BE STARVING.

500
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:08,859
MY TUMMY'S READY
FOR SOME ACTION.

501
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:11,726
YEAH, LET'S GO!
LET'S EAT!

502
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,226
Tai: WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

503
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,593
Mimi: BE POLITE
AND JUST EAT IT.

504
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,726
A GRACIOUS GUEST NEVER
INSULTS HIS HOST'S COOKING.

505
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,693
HMM. I CAN'T TELL
IF IT'S EVEN BEEN COOKED.

506
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,126
NUM-NUM...

507
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,159
EAT AS MUCH
AS YOU WANT.

508
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,793
WE HAVE MORE THAN
ENOUGH FOR SECONDS.

509
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,393
Tai: YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S PROBABLY
A GOOD REASON FOR THAT.

510
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:32,659
YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS AFRAID YOU
WERE GOING TO SAY.

511
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,559
IT SMELLS BETTER
THAN BROCCOLI.

512
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:38,026
AND WHO KNOWS,
IT MIGHT TASTE BETTER.

513
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,259
HAS ANYBODY NOTICED...
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT FOOD?

514
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:45,259
NAH, I'M NOT HUNGRY.

515
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,626
I'M SKIPPING
THIS ONE, TOO.

516
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,959
I JUST DON'T LIKE TO EAT
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

517
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:51,826
BESIDES, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THAT STUFF IS,

518
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,293
BUT I'M SURE
I'M ALLERGIC TO IT.

519
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,426
[LAUGHING]

520
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,893
HA HA HA HA HA.
HA HA HA.

521
00:19:56,926 --> 00:20:00,893
Sora: AND SO ENDS MY BIGGEST
ADVENTURE YET WITH BIYOMON.

522
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:02,326
ONE THING'S FOR CERTAIN:

523
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,659
FOR BEING SO LITTLE,
SHE SURE HAS A HUGE HEART.
