00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,747
WE'RE IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION,
AND NOW YOU'VE APPEARED.

158
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:01,414
WHOA, THAT'S AMAZING,
BUT TELL ME,

159
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,014
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT WE'RE
THE KIDS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

160
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,447
YEAH, DO YOU HAVE SOME PROOF
THAT WE'RE THE SAME ONES?

161
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,947
IT'S BEEN FORETOLD THAT
THE DIGI-DESTINED

162
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,981
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE
DIGIMONS DIGIVOLVE.

163
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:14,714
YOU'VE DONE THAT
AND IT'S ALL THE PROOF I NEED.

164
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,847
I, FOR ONE,
HOPE IT'S TRUE.

165
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:20,314
MY THEORY IS WE'LL BE RELEASED
AFTER WE SAVE THE ISLAND.

166
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:21,814
ONCE OUR PURPOSE IS SERVED,

167
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,947
THERE'S NO OTHER REASON
FOR US TO REMAIN.

168
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:27,247
Mimi:
AND I'LL FINALLY BE ABLE
TO CHANGE THESE CLOTHES!

169
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,247
THAT'S RIGHT--

170
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:31,481
IF LEOMON'S INFORMATION
IS CORRECT,

171
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,314
WE'LL BE HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR HOME.

172
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,881
I CAN'T WAIT!

173
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,547
HOW CAN
WE MAKE IT HAPPEN?

174
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,581
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE
WHO'S CAUSING IT?

175
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:42,847
WHAT IF IT'S A FORCE
THAT'S TOO BIG FOR US TO HANDLE?

176
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,447
DEVIMON IS THE MAIN CAUSE
OF ALL THIS EVIL.

177
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,247
TO SAVE THE ISLAND,
YOU'LL HAVE TO DEFEAT HIM.

178
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,147
LET'S GO FOR IT.

WHY NOT?

181
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,747
IF WE DON'T DEFEAT HIM,
IT'LL NEVER BE OVER.

182
00:08:56,781 --> 00:09:01,314
FINE WITH ME--BESIDES,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO LOSE

183
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:02,781
WITH THE DIGIVICES.

184
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:04,514
FIRST THING ON MY LIST

185
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:07,714
WHEN I GET HOME
IS TO DO SOME KILLER SHOPPING.

186

Palamon:
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,
WE HAVE TO GET YOU BACK HOME.

Tentomon:
IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER,
WE'RE SURE TO WIN.

188

I'M READY ANY TIME
YOU ARE, BUDDY.

189
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,314
HOW ABOUT IT, MATT?
ARE WE UP TO THE CHALLENGE?

190
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:20,347
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

191
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:24,047
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT,
WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

192
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,514
ALRIGHT THEN, TROOPS,
LET'S GET TO IT!

193

FAR OUT! IT'S A DONE DEAL!

194

Leomon:
DEVIMON IS VERY POWERFUL,

195

HE'S BROUGHT NOTHING BUT TROUBLE
TO FILE ISLAND.

196
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,347
WE MUST BE CAREFUL.

THAT TRAITOR LEOMON IS
LEADING THEM RIGHT INTO MY TRAP.

199
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:03,481
HE'S BEEN VERY VALUABLE TO ME.

200
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:06,681
I GUESS SO, BUT I'M LOYAL
AND BETTER-LOOKING.

201

LISTEN TO ME!

202

HUH?

203

YOU WILL PAY THEM
ONE FINAL VISIT.

204

MY POWER IS INFINITE!

207
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:27,581
YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS
ARE USELESS,

208
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,081
I AM THE SUPREME MASTER
OF THIS ISLAND!

209
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,614
IF YOU DARE TO DEFY ME,

210
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,981
I WILL UNLEASH THE POWERS
OF THE UNIVERSE AND CONQUER YOU!

211

THIS IS GOING TO BE

Tai:
IT MUST BE DEVIMON!

I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM
TO BE SUCH A BIG GUY!

223

00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,555
AAH!

316
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:45,488
HUH?

317
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,922
WHAT'S THAT?

318
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,522
IT'S PATAMON--
HE MUST BE DIGIVOLVING!

319
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,955
<i>PATAMON DIGIVOLVE INTO...</i>

320
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,155
<i>ANGEMON!!!</i>

321
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:08,822
HEY, PATAMON FINALLY DIGIVOLVED!

322
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:12,755
THAT'S SUPER-COOL!

323
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,622
NOT BAD--THAT LITTLE GUY
REALLY HAD IT IN HIM.

324
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,788
NICE HAIR--GOOD COLOR.

325
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:26,288
I WANT TO TAKE HIM
HOME WITH ME.

326
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,822
WHAT'S THIS?
ANOTHER FOOLISH ATTEMPT?

327
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,855
THE FORCES OF GOOD
ARE MORE POWERFUL--

328
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,722
EVEN YOU CAN'T STOP US.

329
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:37,155
I'LL DESTROY YOU
AND BRING PEACE TO THE ISLAND.

330
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,088
OH!

331
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:41,088
WHOA!

332
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,322
WOW!

333
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,755
THAT LIGHT IS SO BRIGHT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

334
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:49,555
GOMAMON!

335
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:55,555
STOP IT! I'M NOT GOING TO
ALLOW YOU TO TAKE MY POWER AWAY,

336
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:56,922
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT ME!

337
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:59,122
I'M AFRAID
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

338
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:03,355
IF I CAN HELP OTHERS,
MY FATE IS UNIMPORTANT.

339
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,022
ANGEMON!

340
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,222
YOUR POWERS HAVE GOTTEN
FAR OUT OF CONTROL

341
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,888
AND MUST BE EXTINGUISHED!

342
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:12,288
I AM READY TO FIGHT FOR PEACE!

343
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,755
HA HA HA!

344
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:18,555
AAH!

345
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,022
NOW YOU'VE DONE IT!

346
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,422
BE CAREFUL!

347
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:29,355
HA HA HA!

348
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,322
I'LL GET HIM--RELAX.

349
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:32,788
AAH!

350
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:34,755
COME HERE, PRETTY BOY!

351
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,422
I'LL STOP YOU!
AY-EEE!

352
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,322
AAH!

353
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:47,422
YOU HAVE USED UP
ALL YOUR POWER--

354
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,722
THAT WASN'T VERY SMART, ANGEMON.

355
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,522
NOW YOU'RE NO USE TO ANYONE!

356
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:54,222
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM THE DARK FORCES.

357
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:57,688
EVIL IS EVERYWHERE,
SO DON'T SAVOR YOUR VICTORY.

358
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:00,922
THERE ARE OTHER DIGIMON
JUST AS POWERFUL AS I AM.

359
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,822
SOME OF THEM
ARE EVEN STRONGER--

360
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:06,422
I WONDER WHAT YOU'LL DO
WHEN YOU RUN INTO THEM?

361
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,488
YOU HAVEN'T WON AT ALL--
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!

362
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,388
HA HA HA HA!

363
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:14,855
T.K.:
ANGEMON!

364
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:22,088
T.K., I'LL COME BACK AGAIN,
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

365
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:27,988
T.K.:
ANGEMON!

366
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:34,655
T.K., I'LL COME BACK AGAIN,
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

367
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,922
ANGEMON!

368
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,855
( <i>gasps</i> )

369
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:56,997
Tentomon:
WHAT DO YOU KNOW--
IT'S A DIGI-EGG!

370
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,097
T.K.:
DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE ANGEMON?

371
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,397
Gabumon:
I KNOW IT IS--

372
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,197
HE'S JUST RESTING FOR A WHILE
TO REGAIN HIS STRENGTH.

373
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,864
Palmon:
BUT DON'T WORRY--YOU'LL SEE HIM
AGAIN WHEN HE DIGIVOLVES.

374
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,064
T.K.:
I WILL MAKE SURE
TO TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE OF HIM.

375
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:10,997
YOU SAVED MY LIFE, ANGEMON.

376
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,597
HUH?

377
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,997
Sora:
LOOK, THE ISLAND
IS COMING BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

378
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,297
Izzy:
EXACTLY--DEVIMON'S
BEEN DEFEATED.

379
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,630
WHEN EVIL IS ELIMINATED,

380
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,964
THE ISLAND RETURNS
TO ITS NORMAL STATE.

381
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:27,197
WITH DEVIMON OUT OF THE WAY,
I CAN TAKE OVER NOW!

382
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,464
HELLO--YOU FORGETTING ABOUT ME?

383
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:31,897
LEOMON? GET ME OUT OF HERE!

384
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,997
WHY CAN'T THE BAD GUYS EVER WIN?

385
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,464
Matt:
WHAT'S WITH THOSE OTHER
EVIL DIGIMON ACROSS THE SEA?

386
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:41,597
Joe:
YEAH, I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING HOME.

387
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,964
Mimi:
I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO
FIGHT AGAIN--

388
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,730
I THINK I BROKE A NAIL.

389
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:48,530
Tai:
ACCORDING TO LEOMON'S LEGEND,
WE'VE GOTTA DO IT!

390
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,397
REMEMBER, HE SAID
WE'RE THE DIGI-DESTINED.

391
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,864
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING!

392
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,797
All:
WHOA!

393
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,097
AH, I'VE HEARD OF YOU KIDS.

394
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,764
I MUST SAY, I'M PLEASED.

395
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:04,230
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
TELL US--

396
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,697
WHO ARE YOU,
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?
