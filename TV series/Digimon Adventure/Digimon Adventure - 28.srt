BUT YOU ALWAYS
USED PROJECTIONS, RIGHT?

96
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,139
IT'S JUST A SHOW

WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

98
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,539
A HUMAN
OR SOME KIND OF DIGIMON?

99
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,039
THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT.

WHY US?

104
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,939
YEAH, WE ONLY SIGNED UP
FOR SUMMER CAMP.

105
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:59,939
THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
FOR NOW. COME INSIDE.

106
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,939
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS TO RETURN TO YOUR WORLD

107
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,905
AND FIND THE EIGHTH CHILD.

108

HAVE A NICE BOWL OF SOUP

114
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,672
YOU ARE RIGHT.

115
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,805
SO I HAVE
TO FEED THEM POPCORN

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,505

AND TONS OF SALTED NUTS.

MYOTISMON'S LOCATION.

124
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,072
MYOTISMON!

125
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:44,072
WOW, HE'S ONLY A MILE
FROM WHERE WE ALL LIVE.

126
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,772
I'M AFRAID SO.

127
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:48,739
I'LL BET YOU
THAT HE GOES DOWNTOWN.

128
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,939
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

129
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,139
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

130
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,605
NOTHING. CABLE'S FINE.

131
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,072
SO WHAT'S CAUSING
ALL THIS INTERFERENCE?

132
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,805
HA HA HA HA HA.

133
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,705
Tai: PLEASE TELL US HOW
TO OPEN THE GATE TO OUR WORLD.

134
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,705
YOU CERTAINLY ARE IMPATIENT.

135
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:12,539
KEEP YOUR GOGGLES ON,
MY YOUNG FRIEND.

136
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:16,005
YOU'LL NEED THESE.

137
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,505
CHECK 'EM OUT.

138
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,005
Matt: DIGIMON KEY CARDS.

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,172
Joe: IT'S
THE SPITTING IMAGE.

140
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,705
Tai: ALL RIGHT,
LOOK AT GOMAMON.

141
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,172
I'M CUTER IN PERSON.

142
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,172
Mimi: BUT WHAT
ARE THEY FOR?

143
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:30,139
YEAH, AND HOW DO THEY
HELP US OPEN THE GATE?

144
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,905
WELL, THERE ARE NINE HOLES
ON THE STONE WALL OF THE GATE.

145
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,839
HMM, YEAH, SO?
OH, WAIT.

146
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,539
DO THE CARDS GO
INTO THE HOLES?

147
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,939
THAT'S RIGHT. HOWEVER,
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

148
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,939
IT'S NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE
AS THAT.

149
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:45,939
DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM?

150
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,939
Izzy: YOU'RE GIVING US
ONE TOO MANY CARDS.

151
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,405
THAT'S RIGHT. MM-HMM.

152
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,572
ONE OF THEM IS A FAKE.

153
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:53,605
All: OH.

154
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,105
WE'LL TRY THEM ALL

155
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,105
TILL WE GET
THE RIGHT COMBINATION.

156
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,439
NO, YOU WILL NOT,
YOU SILLY BOY.

157
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,072
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD DO.

158
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,572
THERE ARE MANY WORLDS.
IF YOU PUT THE CARDS

159
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:07,072
IN THE WRONG HOLES,
YOU COULD END UP

160
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,772
IN A DIFFERENT WORLD
WITH NO WAY TO RETURN.

161

00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:20,629
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT MY CARD
WAS THE FAKE, TAI?

480
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,629
I DIDN'T. I KEPT YOUR CARD
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

481
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,595
HA HA.
THAT'S SO NICE.

00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:26,929
HEY, EVERYBODY.

00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:28,929
WE'VE GOT
TO FIND THE EIGHTH CHILD.

484
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:30,429
GET A MOVE ON.

486
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:35,629
I'M HAPPY THAT WE'RE FINALLY
HEADED BACK TO MY HOMETOWN,

00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:36,962
AND WE ALREADY KNOW

488
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:39,329
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING
