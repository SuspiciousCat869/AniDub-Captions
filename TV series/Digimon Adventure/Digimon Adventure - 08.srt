00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,166
Joe:
MATT AND TAI WERE ARGUING ABOUT
<i>CLIMBING INFINITY MOUNTAIN.</i> <i>TAI FIGURED FROM UP THERE</i>

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,900
<i>WE COULD SEE A WAY</i>
<i>OFF THE ISLAND.</i>

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,166
<i>MATT THOUGHT IT WAS</i>
<i>JUST TOO DANGEROUS.</i>

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME,

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:13,600
<i>BUT THAT NIGHT I TOOK IT</i>
<i>UPON MYSELF TO CLIMB IT.</i>

6
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,366
<i>ON THE WAY UP,</i>

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,700
ME AND GOMAMON SAW A BLACK GEAR
<i>EMBED ITSELF IN UNIMON!</i>

8
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,866
<i>IT WAS NO SURPRISE</i>
<i>WHEN UNIMON ATTACKED--</i>

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,833
<i>I WAS IN</i>
<i>QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE.</i>

10
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:24,533
<i>THAT'S WHEN GOMAMON</i>
<i>DIGIVOLVED INTO IKKAKUMON.</i>

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,066
<i>HE RESCUED ME,</i>
AND, USING HIS HARPOON TORPEDO,

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,866
<i>DESTROYED THE BLACK GEAR.</i>

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,033
<i>I DON'T THINK I'LL CLIMB</i>
<i>ANY MOUNTAINS FOR A WHILE.</i>

A GOOD BUS SYSTEM.

YEAH, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

WE'LL NEVER
GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

41
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,800
I KNEW I WOULDN'T LIKE CAMP--
BUT WOULD MY FOLKS LISTEN TO ME?

42
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,733
NOOOO.
I WANTED TO GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

YOUR KIND-HEARTED LEADERSHIP
IS UNIMPRESSIVE!

Leomon:
YOU ARE TRULY THE MOST EVIL

50
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,966
THERE IS NO LIMIT

I THINK NOT--

73

IT IS THE DIGI-DESTINED KIDS

74
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,033
THE DIGI-DESTINED?
WHERE ARE THEY?

75
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,633
THEY'RE ALREADY HERE
ON INFINITY MOUNTAIN.

76
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,500
NOW FIND THEM

YOU DOING?

THAT WAY WE'LL KNOW

EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE
AND WHERE WE'VE ALREADY BEEN.

THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.

WE DON'T NEED A MAP
TO KNOW WE'RE LOST.

99
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:12,966
I FIGURED THAT OUT
A LONG TIME AGO.

HEY--WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BAD GUYS?

191
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,463
THEY JUST
DISAPPEARED!

192
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:59,163
ARE YOU SURE?

193
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:02,530
DO YOU THINK THAT AVALANCHE
KNOCKED THEM OFF THE CLIFF?

194
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:04,530
HELLO!

195
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,430
UNLESS THEY CAN FLY,
THEY'RE GONERS.

196
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:09,297
NEITHER ONE OF THEM
HAD WINGS--

197
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,063
I'M SURE THEY WEREN'T
AIR-WORTHY.

198
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:12,897
NOTHING IS LOGICAL HERE--

ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE--
INCLUDING FLYING MONSTERS.

200

FOR ONCE,
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT, JOE.

201
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,297
IS SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU?

202
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,030
THAT AVALANCHE--

203
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:23,363
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT SET IT OFF.

204
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:26,797
STRESS ACCUMULATES
UNTIL A CRACK DEVELOPS

205
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,897
AND THE <i>TERRA FIRMA</i>
SUDDENLY ISN'T SO FIRMA.

206
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,297
Tai:
IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE SOMETHING

HA HA HA HA!

211
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:42,697
Izzy:
I'M INTRIGUED THAT OUR DIGIMON

212
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,563
WERE ABLE TO DIGIVOLVE
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

213
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:49,697
Tai:
IT WAS SURE LUCKY FOR US
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT.

214
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,897
I THINK THE DIGIMON
ARE GROWING STRONGER--

215
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,663
I WONDER IF THAT'S A NORMAL PART
OF THEIR EVOLUTION

216
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:56,397
OR IF WE'RE BRINGING OUT
SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THEM.

217
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,697
Izzy:
A FASCINATING HYPOTHESIS--
IF ONLY WE COULD TEST IT...

218

Matt:
I THINK TODAY
WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEM.

219
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:03,497
PALMON'S LOOKING
VERY TIRED.

220
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,563
I'VE BEEN TIRED BEFORE--
DON'T WORRY.

221
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:09,063
Biymon:
ADMIT IT, PALMON--
WE NEED TO STOP AND REST.

222
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:12,530
Joe:
I THINK THAT'D BE A GOOD IDEA
FOR ALL OF US.

223
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:15,130
REST WHERE?--I DON'T WANT TO
SLEEP ON THE GROUND.

224
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,997

COME ON!

Izzy:
WE MAY HAVE FOUND
OTHER LIFE FORMS.

227
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,397
LOOK AT THE GROUNDS--
THE LAWNS ARE MOWED PERFECTLY.

228
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,430
Tai:
WHAT A PLACE--
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!

229
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:29,363
IT'S JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!

230
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:31,297
I HOPE THEY HAVE A HOT TUB--

231
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,130
AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT <i>TOO HOT.</i>

232

Tai:
WAIT, YOU GUYS--

233
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:37,230
DON'T JUST GO CHARGING IN THERE,
IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS!

234
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,363
WAS THIS ON YOUR MAP?

235
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:41,363
HMM...SOMEHOW
I DON'T THINK SO.

236
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,097
GO AHEAD, JOE,
OPEN THE DOOR.

237
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,497
MAYBE WE SHOULD
KNOCK FIRST.

238
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,830
NOBODY KNOCKS AT THE DOOR
AT A HOTEL.

239
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:50,297
THIS PLACE SHOULD BE
ON YOUR MAP.

240
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,563
IF YOU RECALL,
YOU BURNED UP MY MAP.

241

ANYBODY HERE?

245
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,830
LOOKS WEIRD.
FEELS WEIRD.

246
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:04,163
Joe:
IT DOESN'T LOOK
OR FEEL WEIRD TO <i>ME.</i>

247
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,730
PERHAPS MY DEFINITION OF WEIRD
IS DIFFERENT THAN YOURS.

248
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,130
I'M WITH YOU.

249
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:09,663
THINK ABOUT IT--

250
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,763
ARE WE SAFER IN THE WOODS,
WITH NO SHELTER,

251
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:14,097
OR HERE IN THIS BUILDING
WE CAN DEFEND FROM ATTACK?

252
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,230
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
YOU HAVE A POINT.

253
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,563
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL!

254

WHAT'S AN ANGEL, T.K.?

258
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:26,763
SOMETHING SPECIAL
THAT WATCHES OVER YOU--

259
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:27,897
KIND OF LIKE YOU GUYS.

260

IF THIS IS A SPOOKED-OUT
HAUNTED HOUSE,

261
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,130
I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE
PICTURES OF ANGELS ON THE WALLS.

262

RELAX, WE JUST
WANT TO BE CAREFUL.

263

AND TALK QUIETER--
YOU'LL WAKE EVERYBODY UP.

I HOPE THEY HAVE A DRESS SHOP--

TWO DAYS IN A ROW BEFORE.

LET'S TAKE A NAP LATER.

268
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,430

LOOKS LIKE WE MUST HAVE
MISSED THE SUMMER RUSH.

269
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:52,297
WE KEEP
MISSING EVERYTHING.

270

THIS IS ONE KOOKY,
MIXED-UP WORLD.

HUH?
DO YOU
SMELL THAT?

272
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,763
I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING--
WHAT IS IT?

273
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,897
IT'S THE DELICIOUS ODOR
OF FOOD!

274
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,430
FOOD? FOOD?
FOOD?
FOOD?

275
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,430
AND PLENTY OF IT.

276

SHOW US WHERE,

00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:26,212
LOOK AT THAT SPREAD!

282
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,026
SORRY FOR SAYING THIS,
BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE A SET-UP.

283
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,392
YES--IT COULD BE
SOME SORT OF TRAP.

284
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,960
WHAT?
WHAT?

285

THAT FOOD IS SAFE TO EAT?

ARE <i>APPALLING.</i>

I GUESS THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY LIKE IT.

288
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:46,649
THAT'S IT!
I CAN'T BEAR TO LOOK ANY LONGER!

289
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:49,649
I'M GONNA EAT IT--
AT LEAST I WON'T DIE HUNGRY.

290
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:52,282

THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA EVER!

296
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:11,104

OKAY, IF ONE OF US GETS SICK,
WE ALL GET SICK.

297

Izzy:
POTATO CHIPS, BANANA CHIPS,
CHOCOLATE CHIPS--

298
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:17,237
I'LL EAT ANY KIND OF CHIPS
EXCEPT COMPUTER CHIPS...

299

Tai:
HEADS UP, MATT!

300
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,337
WATCH THE HAIR,
DUDE!

301
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,937
THAT'S HAIR?

302
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:24,871
I THOUGHT SOME BIRD
MADE A NEST ON YOUR HEAD.

DON'T BE SHY--
THERE AREN'T ANY GIRLS HERE.

310
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,637
COME ON IN--
SO FAR, NO SHARK ATTACKS.

HUMANS CAN BE SO SILLY.

313
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:51,404
NOT JUST HUMANS--
WHERE'S GABUMON?

314
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,871
Patamon:
HE'S NOT SILLY,
JUST SHY.

315
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,871
Joe:
OKAY, I'M GETTING IN.

316
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,537
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE
SO NOISY?

317
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:59,871
RELAX--
FORGET ABOUT 'EM.

318
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,004
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO RELAXED
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

319
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:03,837
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE OVER HERE!

320
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,804
GET BACK TO
THE BOY'S SIDE!

321
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:07,804
WHOOOOA!!

322
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,137
( <i>thud</i> )

323
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:10,971
Matt:
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

324
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:14,237
Tai:
WOW!

325
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:18,404
ONLY THING BETTER
IS BUNK BEDS!

326
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,171
THIS FEELS GREAT!

327
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,871
LAST TIME I HAD A BED THIS SOFT,
I WAS DREAMING.

328
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:25,704
HOW I'VE MISSED SLEEPING ON
SOFT, SILKY SHEETS!

329
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:26,904
MMM.

330
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,504
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I DON'T MISS--

331
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:30,637
HIKING THROUGH
THE DESERT.

332
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:34,004
ANOTHER THING I DON'T MISS
IS STARVING IN THE JUNGLE.

333
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:38,471
OH...WE ARE A LONG WAY
FROM HOME.

334
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,137
SORRY.

335
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:44,337
THAT'S OKAY, JOE.

336
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:46,271
WE ALL MISS HOME,
AND I'M SURE

337
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:48,937
WE'RE ALL WONDERING IF
WE'LL EVER GET BACK THERE.

338
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,237
I'LL BET OUR DISAPPEARANCE
CAUSED A BIG FUSS AT SCHOOL

339
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,471
AND ALL OVER TOWN.

340
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:54,971
WE'VE BEEN GONE SO LONG,

341
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,971
THEY'VE PROBABLY GIVEN UP
LOOKING FOR US BY NOW.

342
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,971
MOM AND DAD
WOULDN'T STOP.

343
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,837
I'M HOMESICK--
AREN'T YOU?

344
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,404
WE'LL FIND OUR WAY BACK--
DON'T WORRY.

345
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:08,304
Mimi:
LET'S JUST GO TO SLEEP
AND TRY TO HAVE NICE DREAMS.

346
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:10,004
Girls:
GOODNIGHT, GUYS.

347
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:12,004
Boys:
GOOD NIGHT.

348
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:19,637
Devimon:
IT WAS SO EASY TO DECEIVE THEM.

349
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:24,437
<i>EVEN THE DIGI-DESTINED</i>
<i>APPEAR TO HAVE SIMPLE MINDS.</i>

350
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,604
READY?

351
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:38,737
WHAT A JOY TO BE RID OF
THE DIGI-DESTINED AT LAST!

352
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,571
I CANNOT DISOBEY
YOUR ORDERS.

353
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:44,537
HEH-HEH-HEH...HUH?

354
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,071
Tai:
I CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM
BY MYSELF.

355
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:49,037
I DON'T MIND
KEEPING YOU COMPANY.

356
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,537
IT'S DARK AND SCARY HERE.

357
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,837
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I HAPPEN TO LIKE THE DARK.

358
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,837
STOP TREATING ME
LIKE A KID.

359
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:00,271
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS <i>YOU</i>
WHO WERE AFRAID.

360
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:02,304
DON'T BE UPSET WITH ME--

361
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:03,971
I'M NOT AFRAID.

362
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,804
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM,

363
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,337
I JUST CAME ALONG
BECAUSE I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU.

364
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:10,004
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

365
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:13,671
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

376

Devimon:

HE LOOKS BAD!

THIS GUY <i>INVENTED</i>

I HAVE NO FURTHER USE

OOOH!!

468
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,621
YOU CAN ESCAPE TOO!

469
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:34,487
I MUST PREVENT DEVIMON
FROM PURSUING YOU!

470
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:35,954
BE CAREFUL!

471
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:38,387
AAARRGGH!

472
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:42,521
Devimon:
<i>FEEL THE TOUCH OF EVIL...</i>

473
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:46,254
LEOMONNNNN!!!

474
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,087
Devimon:
THE DIGI-DESTINED
SURVIVED OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER...

475
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,054
BUT IT WON'T BE THE LAST...
I CAN PROMISE THEM THAT!

476
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,854
THEY MUST NOT INTERFERE
WITH MY PLANS--

477
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,954
THEY MUST BE DESTROYED!

478
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:01,921
WILL YOU DO THIS FOR ME,
LEOMON?

479
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:06,654
YOUR EVERY ORDER...
I SHALL OBEY.
