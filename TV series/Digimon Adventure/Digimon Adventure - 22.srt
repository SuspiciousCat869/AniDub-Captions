COROMON AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW,

2

BUT WE WERE TRANSPORTED BACK
TO MY REAL-LIFE HOMETOWN.

3
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:08,533
NOT ONLY WAS EVERYTHING
EXACTLY THE SAME

4

WHEN I LEFT FOR CAMP,

IT WAS EVEN THE SAME DAY
I ARRIVED IN DIGIWORLD.

6

OTHER THINGS WERE WEIRD, TOO.

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,533
MY LITTLE SISTER CORI
SOMEHOW KNEW ALL ABOUT COROMON.

8

FOR SOME REASON,
EVIL DIGIMON WERE TRYING

9

TO CROSS OVER
INTO THE REAL WORLD.

10
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,033
WE RECEIVED A TRANSMISSION
FROM IZZY

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,533
WARNING US
NOT TO RETURN TO DIGIWORLD,

12
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:31,000
BUT WE KNEW WE HAD TO GO BACK.
WE HAD TO SAVE BOTH WORLDS.

YOU THE <i>MON!</i>

471
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,782
<i>YOU WERE AWESOME PATAMON.</i>

472
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:42,148
NOW I FEEL EVEN WORSE
ABOUT THE WAY I TREATED YOU.

473
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:44,248
WE PROMISED
WE'D ALWAYS BE FRIENDS.

474
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:46,948
THE FIRST RULE OF FRIENDSHIP
IS FORGIVE AND FORGET.

475
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,948
LET'S FORGET IT
EVER HAPPENED, OKAY?

476
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:50,948
OKAY, I'LL PRETEND
I HAD A BITE

477
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:52,448
OF THAT FUNNY MUSHROOM.

478
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:53,782
ME, TOO.

479
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,615
[ LAUGHING ]

480
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:57,848
AW, THAT'S KIND OF COOL,
ISN'T IT?

481
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:58,915
YEAH.

482
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:00,415
AND IT WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED

483
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:02,415
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU,
AGUMON.

484
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,748
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT
THOSE MUSHROOMS ANYWAY?

485
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:06,282
A VOICE IN MY HEAD.

486
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,315
YOU'RE KIDDING.

487
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:08,315
NO.

488
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,148
I WAS CLOSE, SO CLOSE.

489
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,482
HUH?

490
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:15,182
UH-OH, NOW I'M IN FOR IT.

491
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,848
FORGIVE ME, O TERRIBLE ONE.
I'VE FAILED.

492
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,848
THE CREST OF HOPE
HAS REGAINED ITS LIGHT,

493
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:24,848
BUT I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

494
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:27,315
I'LL WORK OVERTIME
AND ON SUNDAYS, TOO.

495
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,815
Tai: OKAY, LISTEN UP.

496
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,815
IZZY WAS TOTALLY RIGHT
WHEN HE SAID

497
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:33,282
THAT THE WEIRD STUFF
GOING ON IN THE DIGIWORLD

498
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,782
SOMEHOW AFFECTS
OUR WORLD, TOO.

499
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:37,282
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT,

500
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:39,782
BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIX THINGS
IN THIS WORLD

501
00:19:39,815 --> 00:19:41,782
BEFORE WE CAN RETURN
TO OUR OWN WORLD,

502
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:44,282
WE'VE GOT TO WORK
TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

503
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,282
EVERY ONE OF US
IS IMPORTANT.

504
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:47,748
AM I IMPORTANT, TOO?

505
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:50,548
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
YOU'RE PART OF THE TEAM.

506
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:53,015
NOW LET'S GO FIND
THE OTHERS.

507
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:55,182
IT DOESN'T TAKE A MUSHROOM
OF FORGETFULNESS

508
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:58,182
TO MAKE US SOMETIMES FORGET
WHO OUR REAL FRIENDS ARE.

509
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:00,182
T.K.: YEAH,
SORRY, PATAMON.

510
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,815
Patamon:
IT'S FORGOTTEN, REMEMBER?

511
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:03,915
THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT.
