00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,993
Matt:
<i>T.K WAS THE NEXT</i>
<i>TO FIND HIS CREST,</i>
<i>AND IT LED US TO A PLACE</i>

2
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:06,560
<i>WHERE IZZY MADE</i>
<i>QUITE A DISCOVERY.</i>

3
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:07,960
<i>HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION</i>

4
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,593
<i>THAT WE ARE INSIDE</i>
<i>A GIANT PROGRAM,</i>

5
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:11,326
<i>AND EVEN US KIDS ARE JUST</i>
<i>PIECES OF COMPUTER DATA.</i>

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,393
<i>WITH THIS NEW INFORMATION,</i>
<i>TAI THINKS HE IS INVINCIBLE.</i>

7
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:19,260
THEN WE WERE SENT AN E-MAIL
BY SOMEONE BEING HELD BY ETEMON.

8
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:21,593
<i>FOLLOWING THE SIGNAL,</i>
<i>WE FOUND DATAMON,</i>

<i>A ROBOT-LIKE DIGI WHO CONTROLS</i>
<i>ETEMON'S NETWORK.</i>

Tentamon:
<i>WHEN DATAMON WASN'T ABLE TO GET</i>
<i>HIS REVENGE ON ETEMON,</i>

35
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>HE KIDNAPPED SORA AND BIYOMON</i>
<i>AND TOOK OFF.</i>

36
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,626
Joe:
WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHERE
TO START LOOKING FOR THEM.

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,126
BESIDES, WE CAN ALL
END UP DEAD...OR WORSE!

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
WHAT IF DATAMON
DOES SOMETHING TO SORA

39
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,593
BEFORE WE CAN RESCUE HER?

40
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:49,393
LOOK TAI, HE'S ALREADY BEATEN
OUR BRAINS OUT ONCE.

41
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,426
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE WON'T DO IT AGAIN?

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,226
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN
BEFORE WE GO ANYWHERE.

43
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,660
THIS MORE DEPRESSING
THAN A SOAP OPERA.

44
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:57,793
( <i>short sigh</i> )

45
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,426
T.K.:
WE BETTER GET SOME SLEEP.

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,026
I'LL STAY HERE JUST IN CASE
YOU GUYS GET SCARED.

47
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,260
YEAH.
THANKS.

48
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:05,493
T.K.:
GOODNIGHT GUYS.

00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,726
( <i>light snoring</i> )

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,893
Matt:
IT'S TOUGH NOT KNOWIN'
WHAT TO DO.

51
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:13,860
THE MINUTE I SAW WHAT HAPPENED
I SHOULD HAVE WENT AFTER HER.

52
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:16,026
IT'S NO USE
BLAMING YOURSELF, TAI...

53
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,426
WE'RE ALL TO BLAME.

54
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,160
YEAH, AND WE'RE ALL GOING
TO FIND A WAY TO GET HER BACK.

55
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,326
Izzy:
HEY!

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,293
I KNOW WHERE SORA IS!

57
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,926
Izzy:
I THINK DATAMON ONLY PRETENDED
TO TAKE HER AWAY.

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,993
IN REALITY, THEY'VE BEEN
RIGHT HERE THE WHOLE TIME.

59
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,793
ARE YOU SAYING
THEY'RE STILL IN THE PYRAMID?!

60
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:33,960
YES.

61
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:36,126
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT WAY DOWN
BELOW THE PYRAMID

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,260
THERE'S A SECRET ROOM...

63
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:38,926
AND I JUST KNOW
THAT'S WHERE HE IS HOLDING THEM.

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,593
HE'S FOUND THE PERFECT
HIDING PLACE

65
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,460
RIGHT UNDER ETEMON'S NOSE.

66
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,026
NOT A BAD PLACE,
AS LONG AS HE ISN'T SNEEZING.

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,860
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY IN!

68
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,793
I DON'T CARE
WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO,

69
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,026
I'M GOING TO FIND THAT ROOM...

70
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,793
I'M GOING TO BRING SORA BACK!

71
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:55,126
GUYS, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IF YOU'D RATHER WAIT HERE.

72
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,360
ENOUGH WITH THE GUILT TRIP...
I'M COMING WITH YA!

73
00:02:57,393 --> 00:02:58,993
REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING, TAI.

74
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:00,760
THERE'S NO "I" IN TEAM.

75
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,693
CAN I COME, TOO, IF I'M BRAVE?

76
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,126
SURE...ALL RIGHT THEN,

77
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,226
NOW...

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,126
LET'S GO GET SORA--TOGETHER!

79
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,693
Sora:
HAVE I BEEN DREAMING?

80
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,226
THIS ISN'T MY BEDROOM,
WHERE AM I?

81
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,160
( <i>with alarm</i> )
BIYOMON!
IT ISN'T A DREAM!

82
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,993
NOOOOO...!

83
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,976
( <i>moaning with fear</i> ) Datamon:
DON'T BE ALARMED, MY DEAR.

84
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:33,876
SHE'S SIMPLY EXHAUSTED
FROM ALL THE EXCITEMENT.

85
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:36,809
SHE'LL BE FINE WHEN I USE HER
IN MY PLAN TO DESTROY ETEMON.

86
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,809
BIYOMON CAN'T DIGIVOLVE
WITHOUT ME

87
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:41,042
AND I'D RATHER BE STUCK IN
A SEWER FILLED WITH RATS

88
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,176
THAN HELP YOU!

89
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,242
GOOD THEN,
I'LL REMEMBER YOU SAID THAT.

90
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,376
Sora:
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO TO ME?!

91
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,542
Datamon:
JUST REMAIN CALM!

92
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,009
OOHHH!

93
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,876
GET ME OFF THIS THING!

94
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,342
WE'VE JUST STARTED.

95
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,509
HUH!

96
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,909
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING
OVER THERE?

97
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,376
RELAX, I'M JUST MAKING
A COPY OF YOU.

98
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,676
WHA...

99
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,276
YOU SEE, I BELIEVE
BIYOMON'S POWER

100
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:11,809
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU, MY DEAR,

101
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,476
BUT RATHER WHOEVER HAPPENS
TO BE IN POSSESSION

102
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,142
OF THAT FANCY DIGIVICE
YOU SO PROUDLY WEAR.

103
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:19,109
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO
COMMAND, BIYOMON.

104
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:22,576
PERHAPS NOT... BUT WE'LL SEE
IF AN EXACT REPLICA OF YOU

105
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,042
CAN DO IT.

106
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:26,309
THIS JUST
CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

107
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,776
I COULD BE WRONG.

108
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,676
WHEN I FOUGHT
THE BEAST BEFORE

109
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,876
ETEMON DESTROYED
ALL OF MY MEMORY CIRCUITS

110
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:33,742
EXCEPT THOSE OF THE FIGHT.

111
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:36,442
FROM THAT MOMENT ON
I VOWED I'D HAVE MY REVENGE.

112
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,676
AND I WILL HAVE IT

113
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,676
WITH THE HELP
OF YOUR DIGI-PARTNER.

114
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,742
BUT ENOUGH OF THIS SMALL TALK.

115
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:44,642
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
HAS ARRIVED!

116
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,809
IZZY:
BOY, WITH SO MANY
OF THE DIGIMON

117
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,642
SURROUNDING THE PYRAMID
LIKE THIS,

118
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,576
THERE IS JUST NO WAY
WE CAN GET IN THERE

119
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:00,076
WITHOUT SOMEBODY SEEING US.

120
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:03,076
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE'RE GOING
TO BE ACTING AS DECOYS.

121
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,476
RIGHT.

122
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,442
NOW TAI, WHEN THE ENEMY STARTS
CHASING AFTER US

123
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:10,509
YOU AND AGUMON HAVE GOT TO GET
INSIDE THERE QUICKLY

124
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,442
WITHOUT BEING SEEN
BY ANYONE...GOT IT?

125
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:13,642
UH-HUH.

126
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:16,476
YOU DO HAVE DIRECTIONS
FOR ME, DON'T YOU?

127
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:17,742
YEAH, JUST ONE MORE THING.

128
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,309
WHY DO I WANT TO THROW UP
EVERY TIME YOU SAY THAT?

129
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:21,609
OKAY NOW,

130
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,109
TO ENTER THE SECRET ROOM
YOU HAVE TO TAKE

131
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,442
A HIDDEN PASSAGE.

132
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:26,876
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ELECTRIFIED
WALL TO GET PAST...

133
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,576
JUST LIKE THE ROOM
DATAMON WAS IN.

134
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,076
( <i>gasping</i> )

135
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,676
I CAN'T MOVE.

136
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,709
Agumon:
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN MAKE IT, TAI?

137
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:39,609
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE WALL IS!

138
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,076
I'M GOING THROUGH!

139
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,676
Joe:
NOW TRY NOT TO DO
ANYTHING STUPID

140
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,776
AND STAY OUT OF UNNECESSARY
TROUBLE, TAI.

141
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:50,342
REMEMBER, THE IMPORTANT THING
IS SAVING SORA.

142
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,742
Izzy:
AND YOU GUYS TRY NOT TO DO
ANYTHING STUPID EITHER.

143
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:55,442
IF YOU RUN INTO ETEMON
JUST TURN AROUND

144
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,642
AND RUN THE OTHER WAY.

145
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,776
YOU GOT THAT, T.K.?

146
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,276
WHOEVER DOESN'T
COME BACK ALIVE

147
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,742
IS GONNA BE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

148
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,476
GOT IT?

149
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,009
Tai:
IF THIS WORKS, EVERYBODY HAS TO
GET THEIR PART EXACTLY RIGHT.

150
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,609
THEY'RE COMING
OUT OF THE PYRAMID.

151
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:11,576
Matt:
TAKE COVER EVERYONE.

152
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:13,276
BATTLE POSITIONS!

153
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,876
THANKS, MIMI.

154
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,009

BUT LISTEN,
DATAMON DID SOMETHING

182
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:28,542
TO JAM UP THE NETWORK

183
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:29,709
AND WE CAN'T
FIND ANY EVIDENCE

AS TO WHERE THE TARGET
MIGHT BE.

204

IT'S CLEAR...
LETS GO.

HEY, DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
ON THE MIDDLE MONITOR?

JOE AND MATT
NEED OUR HELP.

210
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:41,776
PLEASE PALAMON,
YOU'VE GOT TO DIGIVOLVE NOW!

211

NOW, REMEMBER T.K.,

IT'S TIME TO GO.

Etemon:
AH, YOU'RE BECOMING
A NUISANCE, SON.

217
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,876
OF COURSE...
IT'S BECAUSE I'M A TEENAGER.

218
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,542
I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S BEEN
A LOT OF FUN

219

TOYING WITH YOU,
BUT NOW PLAYTIME'S OVER

220

IT'S THE END OF THE LINE
FOR YOU AND YOUR GOAT, BABY.

Datamon:
YOUR FRIENDS ARE VERY
PERCEPTIVE, MY DEAR.

IT'S SEEMS THAT THEY HAVE
ALREADY DISCOVERED

223
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:15,309
THAT I'M HOLDING YOU PRISONER
IN THIS PYRAMID.

WHAT WAS THAT EXPLOSION?

THERE'S A FEROCIOUS BATTLE
RAGING OUTSIDE,

AND SEVERAL OF YOUR FRIENDS

TO ENTER THE PYRAMID.

ETEMON, I'VE DISCOVERED
THE WHEREABOUTS

268
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,186
OF THE OTHER CHILDREN, SIR.

269
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,786
THEY ARE INSIDE THE PYRAMID.

270
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:59,219
WHY WOULD THEY?...
UNLESS DATAMON

271
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,719
WAS STILL INSIDE THE PYRAMID.

DATAMON IS SMARTER
THAN I THOUGHT,

00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,186
BUT NOT NEARLY AS SMART
AS ME.

HUH...NOW WHERE DID
ALL THOSE OTHERS GO?

WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER...

278
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,153
I'LL JUST DESTROY THE ONES
IN THE PYRAMID FIRST,

279
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,386
AND THEN I'LL COME BACK
FOR THE REST OF THEM LATER.

TO THE ROOM...

THAT LEADS

I'LL DO IT, AGUMON.

ARE YOU SURE?

NOT EXACTLY...

313

DO THIS ON MY OWN,
