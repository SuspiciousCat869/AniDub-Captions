OH, MY HEAD.

00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,258
OKAY, SO MAYBE I'VE LOST
A LITTLE BIT OF MY DOODLE,

WELL, THE WEATHER SURE
HASN'T GOTTEN ANY COOLER.

331
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:45,925
DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

THAT'S ONE MAD DIGIMON
WITH HIS FEATHERS OUT OF JOINT!

OH, LOOK!

YOU'RE RIGHT.

344
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,692
WHAT'S A SKYSCRAPER,
MIMI?

CHECK IT OUT, YOU GUYS!

IT'S JUST LIKE GENNAI SAID.

00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,859
THE TAGS AND CRESTS
SOMEHOW WORK TOGETHER, MIMI.

OH?
