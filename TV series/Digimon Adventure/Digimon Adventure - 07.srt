WITH THE COLD.

WE'LL THROW SOME SNOWBALLS.

THE BEST THING
ABOUT SNOWBALLS

IS THAT YOU CAN
THROW THEM EASY.

TO PLAY IN WINTER.

THROW FOOD?

TOUCH THEM!

IF I TURN PURPLE,
YOU'LL KNOW THEY'RE INEDIBLE.

THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH CHOICE.

00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,968
Sora:
SUNNY SIDE UP EGGS
ARE MY SPECIALTY!

Patamon:
THEY'RE DONE!

160
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,668
COME ON, MAN,
HOW ARE THOSE CHOPSTICKS COMING?

161
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:51,634
Sora:
HURRY! WE WANT TO EAT!

162
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,768
SORRY, THIS JUST MAKE ME
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

163
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,534
WE'D BE IN TROUBLE
IF SOMEONE GOT SICK--

164
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,101
NO DOCTORS, YOU KNOW.

165
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,168
I'M ALWAYS THE ONE TO
THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS.

166
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,801
Mimi:
<i>TRES GOURMET!</i>

167
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,568
Piymon:
GO ON! DIG IN!

168
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:07,668
I HAVEN'T HAD A MEAL LIKE THIS
IN A LONG TIME.

169
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,101
MY STOMACH'S CHIMIN'!

170
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,734
Matt:
IF WE HAD SOME KETCHUP,
IT WOULD BE PERFECT!

171
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:13,868
T.K.:
I LOVE KETCHUP AND EGGS!

172
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,734
Sora:
THAT SOUNDS GROSS!

173
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:18,301
WHAT'S THAT MATTER,
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING?

174
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,534
HUH?

175
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,401
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT IF WE
COULD GO HOME,

176
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,201
KETCHUP WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

177
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,568
OH WELL.

178
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,101
NOW I'M HOMESICK--
HOW DEPRESSING.

179
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:30,568
YOU'RE RIGHT--
NOW I WANT TO GO HOME.

180
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,668
IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE,

181
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:35,501
AND I DON' KNOW IF ANYONE'S
TRIED TO FIND OUT WHERE WE ARE.

182
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:37,968
CHEER UP!
TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS

183
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,334
AND I'LL TRY TO DO
MY VERY BEST.

184
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,868
I PREFER MY EGGS
WITH SALT AND PEPPER,

185
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,868
BUT I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER.

186
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,601
I LIKE SOY SAUCE.

187
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:45,868
HOW ABOUT SALSA?

188
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,334
HOW ABOUT A REALITY CHECK?

189
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,801
I'LL HAVE MY MINE
WITH MUSTARD AND JELLYBEANS.

190
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,434
HA HA HA!

191
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:52,768
GROSS!

192
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:53,768
JELLYBEANS--

193
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,201
THAT SOUNDS GOOD!

194
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:56,701
YOU'RE BOTH WEIRD.

195
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:00,268
MY FAVORITE IS EGGS
TOPPED WITH MAPLE SYRUP--YUMMY!

196
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,701
SOMETIMES I LIKE THEM
WITH CHERRIES ON TOP!

197
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,434
THAT'S WEIRD.

198
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:05,568
T.K.:
BUT I BET IT'S GOOD!

199
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,701
( <i>all giggling</i> )

200
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,934
YOU'RE MAKING ME
COMPLETELY LOSE MY APPETITE.

201
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,501
I JUST LIKE PLAIN EGGS!

202
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:17,068
I WISH WE COULD TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING BESIDES EGG RECIPES.

203
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:19,168
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF--'
WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.

204
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,968
JOIN THE PARTY!

205
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,868
I THINK IT'S
TOO LATE FOR HIM.

206
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,134
I THINK JOE THINKS
WE'VE GONE EGG-CRAZY.

207
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,434
WELL, REALLY!

208
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:30,001
JELLYBEANS AND CHERRIES
ON EGGS--THAT'S CRAZY!

209
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,634
SALT AND PEPPER'S
ALL WE NEED.

210
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,934
KEEP IT SIMPLE--
THAT'S MY MOTTO.

211
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:36,768
I'M AFRAID JOE'S
JUST NOT ADAPTABLE.

212
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,101
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

213
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:40,401
FACE IT--YOU'RE
A STICK IN THE MUD,

214
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,268
IF YOU GET MY DRIFT.

215
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,434
Joe:
I'M PRACTICAL!

216
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,068
Gomamon:
YOU'RE STUFFY!

217
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:46,601
IT NEVER FAILS--
HERE THEY GO AGAIN.

218
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,001
Gomamon:
YOU WANNA FIGHT?

219
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,101
HUH? HUH?

220
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:50,801
YEAH, SURE!

221
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,001
HEY! CALM DOWN!

222
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,801
I AM CALM--
HE'S THE ON WHO'S DINGY!

223
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,134
WHY'D YOU SQUEEZE MY ARM?

224
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,934
YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BE YOURSELF TODAY, JOE.

225
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,501
YOU'RE A BASKET CASE.

226
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:04,401
I AM JUST TRYING TO BE CAREFUL--
UNLIKE THE REST OF YOU WEIRDOS.

227
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:07,368
I'M TELLING YOU--
YOU'RE ALL ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

228
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,401
( <i>bubbling sounds</i> )

229
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:13,001
( <i>sighs</i> )

230
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:17,801
I'VE GOTTA BE
THE CAUTIOUS ONE AROUND HERE.

231
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,801
I HAVE TO BE...
THE VOICE OF REASON.

232
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,234
I HAVE TO...

233
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,434
Tai:
WHY ARE YOU MAKING SUCH
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS?

234
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,434
Matt:
BECAUSE IT'S
WAY TOO DANGEROUS!

235
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,068
THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE TO GO--
WE HAVE NO CHOICE!

236
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,868
BEFORE WE DO
SOMETHING FOOLISH,

237
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,401
WE SHOULD THINK IT OVER
A LITTLE MORE!

238
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:36,734
Tai:
YOU'RE JUST CHICKEN!

239
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,334
Joe:
WHAT'S THE RUCKUS ABOUT?

240
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:39,901
WHY ARE MATT
AND TAI FIGHTING?

241
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,334
Matt: I AM NOT!
Tai: YOU ARE TOO!

242
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:45,334
THEY'RE DEBATING WHETHER WE
SHOULD CLIMB INFINITY MOUNTAIN

243
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:46,768
WHICH IS WAY OVER THERE.

244
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,468
THAT'S PRACTICALLY
UP TO THE SKY.

245
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,434
Tentomon:
IT'S A DOOZY,
THAT'S FOR SURE!

246
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:52,801
IT'S THE PERFECT SPOT!

247
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,968
WE GOTTA CLIMB UP THERE--

248
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,468
IT'S THE BEST VIEW
OF THE ISLAND.

249
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,201
Joe:
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT
HE HAS A POINT.

250
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,434
Sora:
THAT'S NOT
HOW MATT SEES IT.

251
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,401
NOBODY WOULD MAKE IT
UP THAT PEAK.

252
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:03,834
IT'S MUCH TOO
BIG OF A GAMBLE.

253
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,401
HE MIGHT BE RIGHT.

254
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,001
THERE COULD BE LOTS OF
EVIL DIGIMON UP THAT PEAK.

255
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:12,801
THAT'S NOT GOOD--
IT WOULDNT' BE WORTH THE RISK.

256
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,434
DON'T BE A WIMP!

257
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:16,168
WE WON'T GET ANYWHERE
IF WE JUST STAND AROUND TALKING.

258
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,968
PUT YOUR FISTS DOWN
WHEN YOU TALK TO ME

259
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:21,201
AND STOP ACTING LIKE YOU CAN
BULLY YOUR WAY TO BEING LEADER.

260
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,301
WHAT?!

261
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,968
KNOCK IT OFF
AND CHILL OUT!

262
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,301
LET'S BE SENSIBLE.

263
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,768
SO WHAT'S YOUR OPINION
ABOUT THIS, JOE?

264
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,268
HUH?

265
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,601
Tai:
YEAH--TELL US WHO'S RIGHT,
ME OR MATT?

266
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,368
UH, UH..

267
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,468
WELL, I THINK TAI'S RIGHT
ABOUT GOING UP THAT PEAK.

268
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,068
IF WE WENT UP THERE

269
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,401
WE'D BE ABLE TO SEE THE ISLAND'S
LANDSCAPE A LOT BETTER.

270
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:42,001
SEE, MATT?

271
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,468
HOLD ON--MATT BROUGHT UP
A GOOD POINT ABOUT THE DANGER.

272
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,668
IT'D BE KIND OF DUMB
TO LEAD EVERYONE UP TO A PLACE

273
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,801
WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT--
IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE.

274
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,868
HMM.
HMM.
HMM.

275
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,834
LET'S GO AS FAR AS WE CAN
UP THE MOUNTAIN!

276
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:56,801
BUT WE CAN'T PROTECT OURSELVES
OUT THERE!

277
00:09:56,834 --> 00:10:00,234
STOP IT--YOU'RE <i>BOTH</i>
MAKING ME A NERVOUS WRECK!

278
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,768
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO THINK.

279
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,301
DON'T BE DIFFICULT.

280
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,801
YOU'RE THE MOST DIFFICULT PERSON
I EVER MET!

281
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,801
I AM <i>TRYING</i>
TO MAKE A DECISION HERE!

YOU'RE JUST CHICKEN, MATT!

283
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,834
TAKE THAT BACK!

284
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:15,768
ENOUGH! YOU'RE GIVING ME
A HEADACHE!

285
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,634
GROW UP, YOU THREE--
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

286
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,734
IT'S GONNA GET DARK SOON!

287
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:24,668
THERE WILL BE PLENT OF TIME
TO ARGUE LATER.

288
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,234
WE NEED TO FIND
A GOOD PLACE TO SLEEP.

289

LET'S HEAD FOR THE CAVE.

I COULDN'T EVEN STOP THE FIGHT.

293
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,533
INSTEAD, I GOT INVOLVED MYSELF.

294

<i>THAT WASN'T TOO SMART.</i>

WHOA THERE!
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, JOE?

301
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,600

<i>WELL...NOTHING.</i>
