NARRATOR:
<i>DemiDevimon tricked Izzy</i>

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,072
<i>and made him fall into</i>
<i>Vademon's universe.</i>

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,007
<i>Convincing Izzy to</i>
<i>give up his curiosity,</i>

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,877
<i>Vademon turned him into</i>
<i>a total like zombie.</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,545
<i>To make things worse,</i>

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,614
<i>that brainhead got hold</i>
<i>of his tag and crest.</i>

7
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:17,251
<i>Tentomon got so bummed out that</i>
<i>he De‐digivolved to Pabumon.</i>

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,686
<i>Thankfully, Izzy finally</i>
<i>snapped out of it</i>

9
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,523
<i>and with Pabumon's help,</i>
<i>got back the tag and crest.</i>

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,892
<i>Pabumon digivolved</i>
<i>to MegaKabuterimon</i>

11
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,728
<i>and sent Vademon clear</i>
<i>into another dimension.</i>

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,830
<i>Later, brainhead.</i>

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,167

AGUMON: Hey,
what's wrong you guys?

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,963
Can't you make this
bucket go any faster?

29
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,798
JOE: What are
you doing to help?

30
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,299
Watching for icebergs.

31
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,368
We'd gladly trade
places with you,

32
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:46,440
but unfortunately, our little
legs won't reach the pedals.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,209
Hey, we could go faster
if we threw you off.

34
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,210
You wouldn't.

35
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,478
It's tempting.

36
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,914
GOMAMON: Better not.

37
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,383
JOE: Wow, that
palace is huge.

38
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,554
And way up there.

39
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,489
As if my legs weren't
tired already.

40
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,594
But there's no doubt about it.

41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,997
That is Mimi, so up we go.

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,102
JOE: How do they
get their mail?

43
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,105
( voices chattering )

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,712
Is this a palace or
some kind of a loony bin?

45
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,280
Seems like it's both.

46
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,282
Her highness is getting angry.

47
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,018
GOMAMON: These are Gekomon?

48
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,186
I've heard of them,
they really love music.

49
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,522
Not surprising, since they're
born with those horns.

50
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,858
Hurry, before
she blows her top.

51
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,493
AGUMON: And I've heard
of the other Digimon.

52
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,695
They're called Otamamon.

53
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,665
Hurry, hurry.

54
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,967
Can you help us?
We're looking for someone.

55
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,301
About time you got here.

56
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,836
Where's the triple
hot fudge sundae

57
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,605
we ordered for delivery
to the princess?

58
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,240
GROUP: That's not us.

59
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,941
GEKOMON: Then you must be
delivering her bacon chili

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,477
cheeseburger with fries and
a super‐sized milkshake.

61
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,812
GROUP: That's not us either.

62
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,414
Of course not.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,215
They're delivering
the garden fresh salad

64
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,217
with low‐fat dressing
without dessert.

65
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,353
GROUP: We'd like to ask
a question if you don't mind.

66
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,555
Her Highness asked
for a fudge sundae.

67
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,090
No, she wants
a bacon chili cheeseburger.

68
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,693
Excuse me, she said
she wanted a green salad.

69
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,760
Hey, excuse me.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,729
Have you seen a girl in a hat?

71
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,197
OTAMAMON: Hey, we're
ordering lunch here.

72
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,565
Well, then I'll have a burger.

73
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,200
All the princess
really cares about

74
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,103
is that polka dot party
dress she ordered.

75
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,006
Old news, now she
wants pink leather pants

76
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,708
with matching boots
and accessories.

77
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,109
No one told me that.

78
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,777
Get with the program.

79
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,114
( Digimon arguing )

80
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,616
It sounds to me like
this princess of theirs

81
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,085
is extremely picky.

82
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,253
She sounds kinda
spoiled, if you ask me.

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,457
I wonder what happens if
they don't do what she says.

84
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,891
DIGIMON: Here she comes.

85
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,432
GEKOMON: Presenting
her highness, the princess.

86
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,701
TAI: Cool, we're gonna
get to meet the princess.

87
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,237
Huh, it's Mimi.

88
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,007
Oh, bummer. (sighs)

89
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,380
Huh.

90
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,715
What a surprise.

91
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,783
You're telling me.

92
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,784
What are you doing up there?

93
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,085
What do you think?

94
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,287
I'm being a princess,
of course.

95
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,124
So you're the spoiled princess
we've been hearing about.

96
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,126
GROUP: We should've
known it was Mimi.

97
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,894
Don't call me Mimi anymore.

98
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,729
That's Princess, now.

99
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,598
DEMIDEVIMON: Don't you
worry, your mighty wickedness.

100
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,299
This time, we cannot fail.

101
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,368
GHOSTLY VOICE: We?
You'd better not fail.

102
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,270
It's in the bag,
piece of cake.

103
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,506
GHOSTLY VOICE: Is the
plan at the palace working?

104
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,441
Couldn't be better.

105
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,643
The Gekomon are spoiling her
rotten and she's eating it up.

106
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,645
If she keeps this
up much longer,

107
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,548
her Crest of Sincerity's
gonna be useless, master.

108
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,183
GHOSTLY VOICE: Do you
know what will happen

109
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,819
if you disappoint me
again, DemiDevimon?

110
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,487
I got a vague idea.

111
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,525
GHOSTLY VOICE: Good,
then see that you don't.

112
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,660
JOE: Well, the important
thing is that you're alright.

113
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,829
Yeah, that's for sure.

114
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,531
Well, come on,
let's get a move on.

115
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,032
No way.

116
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,600
Right, you wanna
change first, we'll wait.

117
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,536
For what? I'm
keeping this dress on.

118
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,471
And it's beautiful,

119
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,706
but it's not the best thing to
wear to walk long distances.

120
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,509
Walking? I have no
intention of walking anywhere.

121
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,944
Are you expecting us

122
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,180
to carry you out of
here, your majesty?

123
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,548
No, I'm not going.

124
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,916
GROUP: Huh?

125
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,718
Why would I leave?
I am a princess here.

126
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,154
Besides, who knows if we'll
ever find our way home,

127
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,223
so I might as well live
large and in charge.

128
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
You must be kidding.

129
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,892
No way, take a look around.

130
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,328
I've got a nice bed,
pretty clothes, food.

131
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,030
It's like having
a birthday every day.

132
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,565
I am a princess.

133
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,300
And you want me to give this up?

134
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,734
I don't think so.

135
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,102
PALMON: Is something wrong?

136
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,270
Another servant?

137
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,572
GOMAMON: No, it's Palmon.

138
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,940
JOE: Finally,
a voice of reason.

139
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,309
Palmon, come talk
some sense into Mimi.

140
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,543
As in princess?

141
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,948
Oh, no, not you too.

142
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,616
Okay, that's enough.

143
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,251
This is no time
for playing games.

144
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,019
Both of you change out
of those dumb clothes

145
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,120
and let's get out of here.

146
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,356
I am not playing a game, Tai.

147
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,025
I'm staying, you can go anytime.

148
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,760
Why don't you guys go
look for the others?

149
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,562
Begone from my palace.

150
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,731
Wait, Mimi, don't be
mean, they're our friends.

151
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,666
If you wanna go, be my guest.

152
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,101
You are coming with us.

153
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,803
Get down off that
high horse of yours

154
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,271
and shift your rear
into high gear.

155
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,873
Yeah, come on,
why do you think

156
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,975
we almost killed ourselves
trying to find you?

157
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,743
'Cause you are part of the team.

158
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,912
That's very nice,
but I am not going.

159
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,280
That's it, Mimi.

160
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,315
Like it or not, Joe's right.

161
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,217
We've gotta stick together so
I'm not budging from this spot

162
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,253
until you come to your
senses and leave with us.

163
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,388
‐ Yeah.
‐ Right.

164
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,624
Really? You all
keep forgetting

165
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,560
who's in charge around
here. (bell ringing)

166
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,529
Your Highness, what
is it that you desire?

167
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,232
I desire these rude
and bothersome peasants

168
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,234
to be removed from
my boudoir at once.

169
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,302
GEKOMON: Yes, Princess.

170
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,804
( all arguing )

171
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,277
Oh, Mimi.

172
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,346
TAI: I won't dissect
frogs in biology, okay?

173
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,183
If that's the way
you treat your guests,

174
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,852
we're never coming back.

175
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,420
Now what are we gonna do?

176
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,856
She's totally into
this digi‐fairy tale.

177
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,524
I wonder what she
could've done to get them

178
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,459
to wait on her hand
and foot like this.

179
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,228
GEKOMON: You
really wanna know?

180
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,296
TAI: Sure.

181
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,000
JOE: You're not taking us
to an evil Digimon, are you?

182
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,335
TAI: What if Mimi catches us?

183
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,336
She won't.

184
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,243
Here's our master,
Lord Shogunmon.

185
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,579
TAI: Whoa, somebody's
had a few too many donuts.

186
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,748
JOE: Is it a statue or what?

187
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,053
No, it's not a statue,
he's very much alive.

188
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,722
He may be alive, but
he's not lively, is he?

189
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,190
He's sleeping.

190
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,793
He's been this way
for over 300 years.

191
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,295
You see, Lord Shogunmon
was proud of his voice

192
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,665
and entered this singing
contest, but he lost.

193
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,034
He felt so bad, he
fell into a deep sleep

194
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,370
from which he's never recovered.

195
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,605
It's said only
a voice as beautiful

196
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,441
as the one that beat
him can wake him.

197
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,043
For centuries we've tried,
but every song's failed.

198
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,113
We Gekomon love music but
unfortunately, not one of us

199
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,915
has a voice that would
be considered beautiful.

200
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,550
Then we got a break.

201
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,185
A strange little Digimon spoke

202
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,153
of a girl with a pretty voice.

203
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,256
He told us where to
find her and we did.

Wow, you mean all

211
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,257

you remember the words.

You know, this
place is too dark.

216
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,179
How about we get a disco ball
and some spotlights, huh?

217
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,915
And of course, we'll need
hair, makeup and costumes.

218
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,254
( Digimon cheering )

219
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,561
I'm tired, let's
pick it up tomorrow.

220
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,364
And that's the way it's been.

221
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,598
One excuse after another.

222
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,367
We've done all she's wanted.

223
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,336
We've even redecorated
the entire palace for her.

224
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,473
I used to like pink, but now
I can't stand to look at it.

225
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,742
And if any one of
us complains to her.

226
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,844
Whoa, be careful,
you wouldn't want me

227
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,546
to lose my voice now, would you?

228
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,314
So we're in a terrible
position, you see?

229
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,882
We're totally helpless.

230
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,484
Unfortunately, you've
given Mimi the life

231
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,352
she's been accustomed
to and then some.

232
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,188
Well, since your
friends of hers.

233
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,156
Could you please
reason with her, please?

234
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,858
We'd be so eternally grateful.

235
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,893
I don't think she
knows what reason is.

236
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,063
TAI: Just leave it to
me, guys, I've got it.

237
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,465
GROUP: Huh?

238
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,900
I knew it, I knew
you'd come through.

239
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,901
Yay.

240
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,503
What are you thinking, Tai?

241
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,738
Well, who says you need
Mimi to wake up Jumbo?

242
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,242
Crank it up
and let me take a shot.

243
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,510
ALL: You? ( laughing )

244
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,878

After that, he might not wake
up for another 300 years.

266
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,145
‐ Hey, guys.
‐ Palmon.

267
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,080
Why did you all
disappear like that?

268
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,283
It's like you weren't
even happy to see us.

269
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,051
What're you talking about?

270
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,719
In case you hadn't
noticed, Mimi's gone nuts.

271
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,854
Yeah?

272
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,955
Hmm.

273
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,291
Now that I think of it,

274
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,992
she has kind of gone
off the deep end.

275
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,194
I mean, even for her.

276
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,361
Oh, you noticed?

277
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,863
You're so observant.

278
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,168
So she'll be performing
and won't even know it.

279
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,137
Yeah, and we'll get
the whole thing on tape.

280
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,038
Watch it.

281
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,675
What's this?

282
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,943
PALMON: It's a karaoke set.

283
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,611
Yes, I can see that.

284
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,113
But what's it doing
in my royal chambers?

285
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,950
I just love hearing you sing.

286
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,152
I thought you might give
us a private concert.

287
00:11:59,252 --> 00:11:59,986
Here.

288
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,091
Thanks, you're the greatest.

289
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,127
Now, feel the music,
feel the music.

290
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,696
JOE: <i>Tai, is</i>
<i>she falling for it?</i>

291
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:10,897
Mhmm.

292
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,200
(Mimi humming)

293
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,669
What's that cord for?

294
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,304
I see.

295
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,841
(screams)

296
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,878
So you thought you
could pull a fast one

297
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,447
on Princess Mimi, did you?

298
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,716
‐ That's Princess Meanie.
‐ Yeah.

299
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,417
Who do you think
you are, anyway?

300
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,453
Don't you remember
we're your friends?

301
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,488
I remember you
tried to trick me.

302
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,124
We tried to trick you because
we're trying to save you.

303
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,394
Have you completely forgotten
about the Crest of Sincerity?

304
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,062
Have you completely
forgotten it's not nice

305
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,497
to lock people up
in your dungeon?

306
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,565
Where's your manners?

307
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,369
Wait.

308
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,005
Before you go, I have
something I wanna tell you.

309
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,708
Nobody likes you more than I do.

310
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,910
It hurts me deeply
to have to say this,

311
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,246
but you're a spoiled brat.

312
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,381
( gasps )

313
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,317
Is that a fact?

314
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,386
Well, it's nice to know

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,068
Hurry, stop them.

319
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,569
I've got to have your help.

320
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,570
DIGIMON: Sorry.

321
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,139
( gasps )

322
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,441
Oh, yeah, well, then
I won't sing anymore.

323
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,109
Big deal.

324
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,011
You didn't sing even when
we did what you wanted.

325
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,413
You're on your own.

326
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,848
Wait, don't leave me.

327
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,383
I'll sing for you, I promise.

328
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,723
Help me, please.

329
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,491
Sorry, but we only
help our friends.

330
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,793
What's wrong, Mimi?

331
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,328
What's the matter?

332
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,196
I thought you were having
the time of your life.

333
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,631
Palmon.

334
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,166
I've gotta go
now, Mimi, goodbye.

335
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,604
(Mimi screams)

336
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:05,712
Won't anybody help me? Please,
Palmon, don't leave me.

337
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,948
Hey, hey, hey, Mimi.

338
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,550
Where am I? What?

339
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,353
Do you have any idea
what that horrible dream

340
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,254
was trying to tell you, Mimi?

341
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,957
I'm sorry, oh, I really am.

342
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,859
Well, then you know
what you have to do

343
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,094
to make things right.

344
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,228
Yes.

345
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,500

you'd find yourself again.

347
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,276
Sora?

348
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,682

349
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,752
GEKOMON: Alright, wake up.

350
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,053
TAI: What now?

351
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,388
GEKOMON: The
princess wants you.

352
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,789
TAI: Is she gonna
chop off our heads?

353
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,290
JOE: Don't even joke.

354
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,926
OTAMAMON: What's going on?

355
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,566
GROUP: What's she up to?

356
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,834
First of all,
there's something

357
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,336
I have to say to everyone here.

358
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,306
Tai and Joe, Agumon
and Gomamon, Palmon,

359
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,309
all of you've been so
nice, I'm so sorry.

361
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,514
I've been such a little idiot.

362
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,382
If you can find it in
your hearts to forgive me,

363
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,751
and I don't know why you
would, but if you can,

364
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,921
then I'd be honored to
sing for you one more time.

365
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,091
We forgive you.

366
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,326
Of course we do,
sing, Your Highness.

367
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,164
Thank you.
