2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,900

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,633
IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE CITY
IS MOVING OUT OF TOWN.

00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:44,566
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
TOUGH PACKING FOR CAMP.

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,000

ANOTHER DARK MASTER.

THOSE CREEPY DARK MASTERS

319

CROSS THE WATER LAST NIGHT.

352

ONE OF THOSE NIGHTMARE SOLDIERS.

I SHOULD STAY AND HELP,

375

TO COUNT ON ME.

376
