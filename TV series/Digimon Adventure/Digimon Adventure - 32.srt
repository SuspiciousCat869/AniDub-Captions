DIGIVICES FOR A REASON.

161
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,015
LAST NIGHT I PICKED UP

162
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,182
AN UNIDENTIFIED
DIGIVICE READING.

163
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:11,615
I THINK IT WAS
THE EIGHTH CHILD.

164
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:13,215
OBVIOUSLY, I LOST THE SIGNAL,

165

BUT IT'S CLEAR THE EIGHTH CHILD
IS IN THIS VICINITY.

166
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,615
THAT'S WHY THE MONSTERS
ARE HERE, TOO.

168
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:22,215
AND THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO HELP US? I'M LOST.

169
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,215
MY CONCLUSION
IS THAT THE EIGHTH CHILD

170
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:26,849
IS SOMEWHERE IN ONE
OF THESE ADDRESS BOOKS.

171

CONCENTRATE ON CALLING

187
