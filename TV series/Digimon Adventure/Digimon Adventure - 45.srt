TO BE THE DIGIDESTINED?

9

YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

IS PRETTY EASY TO FIGURE OUT.

YOU WANT TO BE THE BOSS.

322
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,469
THE QUESTION IS,

323
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:43,469
WHAT EXACTLY ARE
THE DARK MASTERS PLANNING?

324
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,469
WE ARE WORKING
DAY AND NIGHT

325
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:47,035
TRYING TO FIND OUT.

326
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,035
FOR NOW,
ALL WE CAN DO IS GUESS

327
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:50,535
AND TRY TO OUTWIT THEM

328
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:52,035
BEFORE SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENS.

329
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:53,535
WHOA. WELL,
IF THAT'S TRUE,

330
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,035
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

331
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,535
IT'S HARD TO SAY,

332
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:00,035
BUT I BELIEVE YOU'LL ALL FIND
AN ANSWER ON YOUR OWN.

00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,443
HEY.

335
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,176
ARE YOU GOING TO
BE ALL RIGHT?

336
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,143
Kari's voice: OH, HI, THERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?

337
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,643
YOU'VE COME BACK.

338
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:14,943
WE MISSED YOU.

339
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,443
DID IT HURT?

340
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,243
NO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

341
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:21,909
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

342
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,409
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

343
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:24,909
REMEMBER WHAT, TAI?

344
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,876
NEVER MIND, KARI.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.

345
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:30,376
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT HOW
WE BECAME THE DIGIDESTINED.

346
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,343
WE SAW IT HAPPEN.

347
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:33,843
WE SURE DID.

348
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,309
SO NOW THE ENTIRE WORLD
IS DEPENDING ON US,

349
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:38,609
AND WE ALL HAVE
TO SAVE IT TOGETHER.

350
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:41,176
HOW ABOUT IT, MATT?
ARE WE STILL A TEAM?

351
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,343
WHAT'S WRONG?

352
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,676
HEY, LET'S PUT
THE PAST BEHIND US.

353
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,343
I KNOW, BUT YOU
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

354
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:48,943
SURE, I WOULD.

355
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:51,976
I SAY THAT YOU AND I
LET BYGONES BE BYGONES.

356
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:53,609
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM, TAI.

357
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,609
THIS THING IS BIGGER
THAN EITHER OF US.

358
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,609
IT'S NOT ABOUT RIGHT
OR WRONG.

359
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,776
I HAVE MY PATH
AND YOU HAVE YOURS.

360
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,276
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THIS PATH
IS GOING TO LEAD ME,

361
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,243
BUT I HAVE TO FIND IT
FOR MYSELF.

362
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,176
BUT I STILL BELIEVE
IN ALL OF US.

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,143
I MEAN, WITHOUT ANY OF YOU,
WHERE WOULD I BE?

364

THIS IS ALL
JUST SO CONFUSING,

365
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:14,143
AND I LET IT GET TO ME.

AH, THAT'S WHY WE FOUGHT.

367

IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME,

368
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:21,576
BUT I'M GOING TO DO THIS
BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

SO I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

MATT, IF YOU
APPROACH THIS LOGICALLY,

BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN
TOO MUCH OF A FRIEND.

376
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,543
MAYBE IT'S
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

377
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:41,576
THE TRUE MEANING OF THE WORD
OR I'VE JUST FORGOTTEN.

NEED TO DO THIS ALONE.

TO STAND IN YOUR WAY.

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITHOUT YOU?

384

YOU'RE A BIG KID NOW.

00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,343
YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, T.K.

HOW BIG BROTHERS ARE.

WE'VE GOT THE WORLD TO SAVE.

SO WE'RE DOWN
ONE DIGIDESTINED?

00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,843
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
WE CAN DO IT, RIGHT?

395
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:24,309
HMM? MIMI.

396
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:27,609
I'M SORRY, SORA.
I'M NOT GOING.

397
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:29,109
HUH? WHY NOT?

398
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,609
COME ON, WHAT?

399
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,043
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANYBODY ELSE FIGHT

400
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,576
OR HURT THEMSELVES.

401
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,043
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

402
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:38,876
THEN I'M STAYING, TOO.

403
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,309
BUT WHY?

404
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,909
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR MIMI
TO BE HERE ALONE.

405
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:44,409
I'LL MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY,

406
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:47,409
AND THEN HOPEFULLY LATER
WE CAN REJOIN YOU GUYS, OKAY?

407
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,143
OKAY. GOOD LUCK, JOE.

409
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:51,976
WAIT FOR ME.

410

NOW WE'RE ALL GOING TO
BE SPLIT UP AGAIN.

411
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,476
JUST WHEN WE WERE
FINALLY ALL TOGETHER.

YOU MAY THINK
WE'RE SEPARATED,

BUT WE'RE REALLY NOT.

414

THE ROADS
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT,

415
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,276
BUT THE PLACE WE END UP IN
IS THE SAME.

416
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,143
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

417
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,243
IF THEY TRULY ARE
THE DIGIDESTINED,

418
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,243
THEY'RE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN --

AT LEAST THAT'S THE WAY
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT.
