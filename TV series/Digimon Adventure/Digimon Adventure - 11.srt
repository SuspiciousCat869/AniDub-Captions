AND HUNG ON UNTIL
YOU PULLED US IN.

159
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:47,928
Sora:
MY GOODNESS--!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BOTH OKAY.

160
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,061
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT JOE.

161
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,895
YOU ARE?

162
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,061
JOE'S GOING TO BE
JUST FINE.

163
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:59,561
PHYSICALLY, YES--BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HIS CONFIDENCE.

164
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,461
FIGHTING OGRAMON BACK THERE
REALLY KNOCKED HIM OUT.

165
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,461
HE NEEDS TO REBUILD
HIS SELF-CONFIDENCE.

166
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,028
HOW CAN WE HELP HIM?

167
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,661
VERY SIMPLE--
WE JUST MAKE HIM OUR LEADER.

168
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:10,728
HUH?

169
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:14,161
HEY--WHERE'S OGRAMON?

170
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:16,461
HUH? HUH?

171
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,795
HE'S GONE, BUT WE'VE GOT
A BIGGER PROBLEM.

172
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:20,928
WE CAN'T FIND THE OTHERS--
WHAT SHALL WE DO?

173
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:24,061
WE'RE STUCK ON THIS ISLAND
WITH NO LEADER.

174
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,895
I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
LEAD US, JOE.

175
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:28,861
WHAT?

176
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,228
I'M FOR HIM!

177
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,828
AND ME!

178
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:34,295
NOT ME--I AM NOT A LEADER.

179
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,595
YOU HAVE TO,
YOU'RE THE STRONGEST ONE HERE.

180
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,995
UM-HMM.
UM-HMM.

181
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,861
NOT TO MENTION
THE BRAVEST.

182
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,428
Gomamon:
COME ON, JOE--REMEMBER HOW
YOU FOUGHT THE UNIMON?

183
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,195
I AM BRAVE.

184
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,928
YOU'RE RIGHT--I <i>AM</i>
THE BRIGHTEST ONE HERE.

185
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,395
Sora:
LET'S NOT GET <i>TOO</i>
CARRIED AWAY.

186
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,495
OH.

187
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:54,328
BUT IF I FAIL,
WHO WILL SAVE YOU OR ME?

188
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:57,095
MY FISH LINE...HA HA.

189
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,195
HUH?
HUH?

190
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,461
Joe:
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

191
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:04,528
Sora:
YEAH, IT SEEMED TO COME
FROM UP THERE.

192
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,928
Biyomon:
WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE IT IS?

193
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,095
LOOKS KIND OF LIKE
A CHURCH.

194
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,995
WHEREVER THERE'S A CHURCH
THERE'S USUALLY PEOPLE.

195
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,561
MAYBE OUR FRIENDS!

196
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,528
SOMEONE SHOULD
CHECK IT OUT.

197
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,528
I'LL GO!

198
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,061
WAIT--JOE'S OUR LEADER NOW.

199
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:17,061
WHAT?

200
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:19,261
WELL, LEAD US.

201
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,261
WHAT IF WE SEE
A BAD DIGIMON?

202
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,995
I, UH...
I NEED A MOMENT.

203
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,228
OKAY.

204
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,595
Joe:
HUP, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

205
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,995
YOUR LEFT, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

206
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,928
Sora:
MUST YOU KEEP UP
THAT ARMY MARCH DRIVEL?

207
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,228
Joe:
HALT!

208
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:38,228
NOTICE ANYTHING?

209
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,695
Sora:
IT ALL LOOKS
SORTA FAMILIAR TO ME.

210
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,761
AS IF IN A DREAM,
OR <i>DEJA VU--</i>

211
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,828
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'VE
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

212
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:47,061
YOU'RE RIGHT--

213
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:49,928
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE PART OF
THE ISLAND THAT BROKE WAY.

214
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,295
YEAH.

215
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:54,328
SO WE SHOULD FIND
OUR FRIENDS

216
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,495
OR SOME OTHER PEOPLE
TAKING SHELTER IN THAT CHURCH.

217
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,095
YOU'RE ASSUMING
QUITE A BIT THERE.

218
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,695
FINE! THAT'S MY OPINION!

219
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:02,961
I'M JUST GIVING YOU
ANOTHER VIEW.

220
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:04,961
I'M THE LEADER HERE!

221
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,461
<i>EXCUSE ME.</i>

222
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:07,528
MOVE OUT!

223
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,861
WOW.

224
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:11,228
WE'VE CREATED A MONSTER.

225
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,895
YOU THINK A BLACK GEAR
GOT HIM?

226
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:20,161
Joe:
STEP LIVELY, TROOPS,
LET'S HAVE NO STRAGGLERS.

227
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,861
THERE'S THE CHURCH.

WHAT'S WRONG?

233
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:30,761
WELL, BOSS?

234
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:33,728
Gomamon:
JOE, YOU'RE THE LEADER.

235
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,428
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE A PEEK?

236
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,595
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TAKING A PEEK!

237
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,795
I CAN'T <i>WAIT</i>
TO GO IN THERE.

238
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:41,495

I THINK IT WORKED.

( <i>all giggling</i> )

240
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:46,961
OKAY, I'M AFRAID.

241
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:56,828
I WAS RIGHT--
JUST A NORMAL GROUP OF PEOPLE.

242
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,328
GUYS--WHOA!

243
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,395
THERE <i>ARE</i>
PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH--DANCING.

244
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:04,461
BADLY, I MIGHT ADD.

245

Sora:
THERE <i>ARE</i>

00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:13,628
THEY'RE DANCING,
AND THEY'RE WEARING MASKS.

249
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,795
LIKE IT'S...HALLOWEEN.

250
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:16,595
HALLOW...WHAT?

251
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:18,395
AH!
AH!
AH!

252
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:27,475
THEY'RE CELEBRATING
THE BAKEMON HOLIDAY. IT REMINDS ME OF HALLOWEEN!

253
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:32,115

WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU JOIN US--
WE DON'T GET MANY YOUNG PEOPLE

254
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,082
AND NO HOLIDAY IS COMPLETE
WITHOUT THEM.

255
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:38,615
YOU ARRIVED JUST IN TIME
FOR SOME....FUN.

256
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:41,615
Joe:
LIKE TRICK OR TREAT?
YOU DO THAT FOR BAKEMON?

257
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,582
YES.

YES.

260
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:49,882
BUT THE ONLY BAKEMON
I KNOW OF IS A HORRIBLE DIGIMON

261
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:53,049
WHO LIVES AMONG GHOSTS
AS THEIR RULER.

262
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:56,449
WHY WOULD YOU HONOR
AND CELEBRATE SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

263
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,982
HE'S A LOSER!

264
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,515

THE TRICK OR TREATING STARTS.

YOU THINK WE CAN FINAGLE HIM
INTO DINING ON SOMEONE BIGGER?

318
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:10,182
WHAT KIND OF FIEND IS THIS GUY?
WHERE JUST KIDS!

319
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,449
Biyomon:
THERE MUST BE A WAY OUT OF HERE!

320
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:16,182
MAYBE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES.

321
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:18,815
THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM
TO LOOK IN THIS PLACE.

322
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,849
HEY!
WHAT?

323
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:23,815
MAYBE WE CAN TRICK THE GUARD
AND ESCAPE.

324
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:28,382
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN--
HE DOESN'T LOOK TOO SMART.

325
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:30,782
FIRST WE HAVE TO
TRY AND WAKE HIM UP.

326
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,882
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

327
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,749
FOR A GHOST,
HE SLEEPS LIKE A LOG.

328
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:39,282
WE HAVE TO GET HIS ATTENTION
OR WE'LL NEVER ESCAPE.

329
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:41,215
BUT I'M ALL OUT OF IDEAS!

330
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,015
I THINK I HAVE
JUST THE THING.

331
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:47,715
AAH!

332
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,182
OOHHH!

333
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:52,215
HEY! WHAT'S THE IDEA?

334
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:53,415
WHEN DO YOU START?

335
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:54,582
START WHAT?

336
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,649
START TAUNTING US,
YOU FLOATING BAG O' WIND!

337
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:57,515
HUH?

338
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,382
YOU GIVE BAD DIGIMON
A BAD NAME.

339
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:02,515
BUT I HAVEN'T LEARNED
HOW TO TAUNT YET.

340
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:03,949
IT'S EASY!

341
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:06,515
JUST FIND OUT WHAT WE WANT,
THEN DON'T LET US HAVE IT.

342
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,782
HUH?

343
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,149
HERE'S HOW YOU TAUNT--
WE'RE STARVING,

344
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:13,482
SO YOU SHOW US FOOD BUT
DON'T GIVE US ANY--GOT IT?

345
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:17,449
I THINK I GOTCHA--
I'VE GOT SOME BANANAS.

346
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,349
THEN TAUNT IS WITH 'EM--
COME ON.

347
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:20,582
OKAY.

348

HOW'S THIS...
LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

349
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,915
WE CAN'T SEE...
COME A LITTLE CLOSER.

350
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,449
HUH?

351

HERE?

352
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,715
YOU HAVE TO COME EVEN CLOSER
TO TAUNT US,

353

WE CAN'T REALLY SEE YOU.

THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

359
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:48,149
NEVER GET BETWEEN A DIGIMON
AND HIS MEAL.

360

YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME,
I'M MOSTLY GRISTLE, ANYWAY.

ARE YOU SAYING
THEY SHOULD EAT ME FIRST?

WE'RE BOTH FINISHED!

ARRGGGH!

BUT I KNOW GOOD CAN BEAT HIM.

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO FIGHT EVIL--

OKAY, YOU'RE IN CHARGE--
