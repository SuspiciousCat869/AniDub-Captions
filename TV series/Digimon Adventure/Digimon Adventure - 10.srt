WHOA! TENTOMON,
I WOULD SAY WE ARE TRAVELLING
AT A VERY HIGH SPEED,

35
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:36,889
PLUMMETING TOWARD
AN UNIDENTIFIED ISLAND.

36
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,556
AND, UH,
CRASH LANDING IS IMMINENT.

37
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:42,356
Tentemon:
TRY TO THINK OF IT AS
WE'RE JUST HITTING THE BEACH!

38
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,656
( <i>screaming</i> )

39
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:50,489
Mimi:
NOW THAT SHOULD BE GOOD
FOR SOME FREQUENT-FLYER MILES!

40
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:51,756
Palmon:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

41
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,456
OH NO--HUMIDITY!

42
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,456
SOME KIND OF TROPICAL RAIN
FOREST,

43
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,389
BUT NOT ONE
I'M FAMILIAR WITH.

44
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:59,789
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST--
WHERE ARE WE?

45
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,422
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT HUMIDITY DOES TO MY HAIR?

46
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:05,222
IT GOES ALL POODLE-Y!
NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.

47
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:08,822
PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO
LOOK FOR THE OTHERS.

48
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:10,322
YEAH, LET'S GO--

49
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:12,889
MAYBE WE CAN FIND
SOME AIR CONDITIONING.

50
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:14,656
Tentomon:
HERE WE ARE, IZZY--

51
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:19,489
HARDLY THE LIGHT AND BREEZY
LODGINGS I WAS EXPECTING.

52
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,622
WHOA...

53
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,389
VERY INTERESTING,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

54
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,356
WE SHOULD KEEP SEARCHING
FOR THE OTHERS?

55
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:26,856
NOW REALLY ISN'T THE TIME--

56
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,422
I KNOW,
BUT LOOK AT THIS PLACE!

57
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,956
IT'S PRODIGIOUS--
I GOTTA CHECK IT OUT.

58
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,422
ALL RIGHT,
BUT JUST FOR A MINUTE.

59
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:36,022
Mimi:
YUM! BANANAS!

60
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,322
BANANA?

61
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,956
CAN YOU REACH
HIGH ENOUGH?

62
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,189
UM-HMM.

63
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:44,856
I WAS REALLY STARVED!

64
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,022
NOW WE CAN PRETEND
WE'RE HAVING BANANA SPLITS.

65
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:52,489
HUH?
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

66
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:55,956
THEY CERTAINLY DO
LOOK DELICIOUS.

67
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,556
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

68
00:02:57,589 --> 00:03:01,522
THIS PLACE IS <i>SERIOUSLY</i>
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

69
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,989
HMM?

70
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:05,956
IS THAT HAIR MOUSSE?

71
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,256
YUK!

72
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,122
HUH?

73
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,022
DUH, GOODBYE!
MEET TO NICE YA.

74
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,822
HE MEANS HELLO,
NICE TO MEET YA.

75
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:20,834
YEAH, WHAT HE'S SAYING.

76
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,101
ME MEANS I'M RIGHT.

77
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,734
PALMON,
WHO'S THE TALKING DESSERT?

78
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:26,734
IT'S SUKAMON AND CHUUMON,
ALSO KNOWN AS THE DIGI-LOSERS.

79
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,001
HEY! THANKS!

80
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,914
Palmon:
THEY'RE ALWAYS TOGETHER

81
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:33,548
BECAUSE THEY SHARE
THE SAME BRAIN--

82
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,652
AND IT'S NOT A VERY BIG ONE.

83
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,252
YAAH!

84
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,918
( <i>goofy laughter</i> )

85
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,018
WAIT!

86
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,618
LEAVE US ALONE!

87
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:46,085
OKAY--BUT FIRST YOU GOTTA PAY
A WHATTAYA-CALL-IT.

88
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,085
A TOLL.

89
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,992
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A TOLL?

90
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:51,725
DOES SHE THINK SHE CAN USE
OUR WOODS FOR FREE?

91
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,892
SHE'S GOTTA PAY--
THAT PURSE WOULD DO.

92
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:56,425
I LIKE THE HAT!

93
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,392
NO!

94
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,825
HUH?
HUH?

95
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,432
WHAT PART OF "NO"
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

96
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:02,832
GET OUT OF HERE!

97
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,998
I THINK SHE INSULTED US.

98
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,565
BINGO, EINSTEIN.

99
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,665
SHE DID?

100
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:09,798
LET HER HAVE IT!

101
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,698
DO IT AGAIN!

102
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:19,432
( <i>laughing moronically</i> )

103
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:22,065
I GIVE UP--I WANT TO SEE
THE CAMP THERAPIST.

104
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,965
Sukamon:
OH, PRETTY...

105
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:34,065
Chuumon:
WOW! THAT'S BETTER THAN
CHEWING TIN FOIL!

106
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,998
I FEEL ALL TINGLY AND REFRESHED
LIKE A WHOLE NEW PERSON!

107
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:38,765
YEAH!

108
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:41,732
IS THIS ONE AS MUCH OF A PAIN
AS THE LAST ONE?

109
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:45,198
NO, REALLY--
WE'LL BE NICE FROM NOW ON!

110
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:46,732
SO YOU'LL LEAVE
US ALONE?

111
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,898
BUT FIRST TELL US IF YOU'VE SEEN
ANY OTHER HUMANS AROUND HERE.

112
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,232
ANY WHAT?

113
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,665
CREATURES THAT
LOOK LIKE THIS ONE.

114
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,898
AS A MATTER OF FACT...
DUH...

115
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,198
YEAH, I FORGOT!

116
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,665
TELL ME!

117
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:01,132
IT WASN'T NEARLY AS PRETTY
AS YOU ARE,

118
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:05,065
BUT WE SAW SOMETHING FALL INTO
THE RUINS WITH TENTOMON.

119
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,865
WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL US--
NEXT WEEK?

120
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:09,832
THEY MUST HAVE
SEEN IZZY, TOO!

121
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,532
CAN YOU TAKE US THERE?

122
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,165
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE FIND THEM.

123
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:14,398
OKIE-DOKIE.

124
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,265
NO FUNNY BUSINESS!

125
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,265
CROSS OUR HEARTS--

126
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:17,498
AND HOPE TO DIE.

127
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:20,465
OF ALL THE RIDICULOUS
THINGS TO SAY!

128
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:24,298
Sukamon:
RIGHT-OVER-THERE!

129
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,432
Mimi:
HUH?

130
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:29,432
Mimi:
OH, THAT'S JUST <i>GREAT.</i>

131
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,198
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
GET OVER THERE?

132
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,365
Chuumon:
WHY DON'T <i>YOU</i>
THINK OF SOMETHING?

133
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:37,398
A GORGEOUS GIRL LIKE YOU
MUST HAVE A BIG BRAIN!

134
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:40,832
THANKS A <i>LOT.</i>

135
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:44,865
BEFORE YOU GO,
GIVE US A THANK-YOU KISS, HUH?

136
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:45,998
( <i>kissy sounds</i> )

137
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:47,832
PLEASE TELL ME
THEY'RE KIDDING!

138
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:50,265
CLIMB ABOARD, QUICKLY!

139
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:53,765
OH...MAYBE WE JUMPED THE GUN.

140
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:59,232
BLEECH! JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT
IS MAKING ME QUEASY.

141
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:01,698
THAT'S OKAY!
WE'LL WAIT TILL YOU COME BACK!

142
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,098
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

143
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,198
( <i>raspberry</i> )

144
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,732
Tentomon:
IZZY, I HIGHLY SUGGEST WE END
THIS ARCHITECTURAL TOUR.

145
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:11,698
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE,
I'M GATHERING INFORMATION.

146
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:14,965
I'M SURE THIS PLACE
IS CRAWLING WITH CLUES.

147
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,932
LOOK! IT'S ONE OF
DEVIMON'S BLACK GEARS!

148
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,165
SO IT IS.

149
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:20,465
KNOW WHAT I THINK?

150
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:21,865
IF WE KEEP THIS GEAR
FROM TURNING,

151
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,598
WE'LL JAM THAT CREEP UP!

152
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:26,398
OR BETTER, WE COULD <i>NOT</i>
DO THAT,

153
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,965
AND LOOK FOR THE OTHERS,

154
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,065
LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

155
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,598
WAIT A MINUTE--

156
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,365
THIS IS THE SAME WRITING
WE SAW THE LAST TIME.

157
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:35,998
REMEMBER?

158
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:37,998
IT MADE ME REALIZE
THAT IN DIGI-WORLD,

159
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,065
BASIC DATE IS
A LIVING, VIABLE SUBSTANCE.

160
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,698
ALL THAT DATA IS STORED
ON MY HARD DRIVE...

161
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:46,465
IF ONLY THERE WAS
A POWER SOURCE HERE.

162
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:48,465
GET A POWER SOURCE,
STOP THE GEAR--

163
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:52,032
IS "FIND OUR FRIENDS"
ON THAT LIST?

164
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:55,065
THOSE LIGHTS ARE GETTING
POWER FROM <i>SOMEWHERE.</i>

165
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,065
HEY, AN OUTLET!

166
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,465
CHECK IT OUT.

167
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:01,998
IT WORKS!

168
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:04,398
OH, <i>GOODY.</i>

169
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:07,665
NOW LET'S SEE
IF I CAN DECIPHER THIS.

170
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,098
( <i>computer sounds</i> )

171
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:10,632
Mimi:
WELL, HERE ARE THE RUINS.

172
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:13,465
LET'S JUST HOPE THAT
KISSY-FACE CUSTARD

173
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,765
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

174
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,732
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT!

175
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:21,632
OH!
HURRAY!

176
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,598
IT'S THEM!

177
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,032
TENTEMON AND IZZY!
HEY!

178
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,565
UH...HI, MIMI.

179
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,565
FINALLY A FRIENDLY FACE!

180
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,032
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE GANG?

181
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,632
I HAVE NO IDEA.

182
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:37,198
BUT SHOULDN'T WE LIKE
LOOK FOR THEM OR SOMETHING?

183
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:39,165
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
ANYWAY?

184
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:42,498
TRYING TO DECIPHER
THESE HIEROGLYPHS.

185
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:43,998
CAN'T THAT WAIT?

186
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,932
THAT'S WHAT <i>I</i>
KEEP TELLING HIM.

187
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,632
"LET'S LOOK FOR THE OTHERS,"
I SAY,

188
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:49,632
BUT DOES HE LISTEN?
NO.

189
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,465
IZZY, GET UP.

190
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:54,698
I'M SURE THE KEY TO FIGURING
EVERYTHING OUT IS IN HERE.

191
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:56,132
THE QUESTION IS,

192
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:59,565
DOES EACH GLYPH REPRESENT
A LETTER, A WORD, OR A PHRASE?

193
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:00,865
HMM....

194
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,298
I'LL HAVE TO CROSS-REFERENCE
THE CHARACTERISTICS.

195
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,565
( <i>all sigh</i> )

196
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:10,898
Mimi:
IZZY, ANY IDEA HOW LONG
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE?

197
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:14,232
I MEAN CAN WE GO
BEFORE WINTER SETS IN?

198
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:15,698
IZZY!

199
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:19,032
IZZY, YOUR FRIEND
IS ASKING YOU A QUESTION.

200
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,165
AND HER REAR END IS GETTING COLD
SITTING HERE DOING NOTHING.

201
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:26,632
WAIT--THAT MIGHT WORK!

202
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:29,698
UH-OH...IZZY!

203
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:32,598
ARE YOU IGNORING ME,
YOU COMPUTER GEEK?

204
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,765
( <i>Izzy muttering to himself</i> )

205
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,198
( <i>sputtering</i> )

206
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,165
HEY! HERE'S SOMETHING!

207
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,498
THESE RUINS ARE
A GIGANTIC MAZE!

208
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:48,932
I'M LEAVING!
RIGHT NOW!

209
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,365
BOO HOO HOO!

210
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,132
BOO HOO!
NOT YOU TOO!

211
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,632
IZZY--DO SOMETHING!

212
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:59,365
DO WHAT?
MY LAPTOP CAN'T DO EVERYTHING!

213
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:00,932
I DON'T KNOW--
TELL HER YOU'RE SORRY!

214
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:02,665
SORRY? FOR WHAT?

215
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,465
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

216
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:07,165
I'M STARVING
AND MY FEET ARE KILLING ME

217
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,365
AND A GIANT LEMON CUSTARD
TRIED TO KISS ME

218
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,598
AND ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GET OUT OF HERE!

219
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:16,032
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO INSENSITIVE?

220
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,532
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

221
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:20,432
YOU IGNORE US WHILE YOU
POKE AWAY AT YOUR COMPUTER!

222
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:23,498
I'M NOT IGNORING YOU--
THIS IS ULTRA-IMPORTANT,

223
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,398
LIKE MAYBE SAVING THIS WORLD.

224
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,232
IF I CAN JUST
DECIPHER THESE HIERO--

225
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:30,365
JUST KEEP
YOUR STUPID HIEROGLYPHICS!

226
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:33,832
BOO HOO HOO!
MIMI, WAIT!

227
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,632
YOU THINK I'M JUST
PLAYING AROUND HERE?

228
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:38,332
I THINK YOU LIKE COMPUTERS
MORE THAN PEOPLE!

229
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,798
BOO HOO HOO!

230
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:44,165
Izzy:
DON'T LOOK NOW,
BUT MIMI AND TENTOMON ARE GONE.

231
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:46,265
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

232
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:47,698
Mimi:
I HATE THIS PLACE!

233
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:49,765
I'LL NEVER RECOMMEND
THIS RESORT TO ANYONE!

234
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,065
MIMI, WAIT!

235
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,632
( <i>thud</i> )

236
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:55,032
OH, DEAR!

237
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,698
MIMI, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

238
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,465
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON...

239
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,265
WHY IS ALL THIS
HAPPENING TO ME?

240
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:03,132
WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

241
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,998
ONE WRONG TURN
AND WE COULD GET LOST IN HERE!

242
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:08,465
ALL I WANT TO DO IS GET HOME--
THAT'S ALL!

243
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:11,865
PLEASE WAIT--WE REALLY SHOULD
FIND OUR WAY BACK.

244
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:14,265
I WANT MY OWN BED,
MY OWN BATHROOM...

245
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:16,165
I'M EVEN STARTING
TO MISS MY BABY BROTHER!

246
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,032
STOP RUNNING OFF!

247
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,432
Palmon:
I DON'T SEE THEM ANYWHERE--
WHERE COULD THEY HAVE GONE?

248
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:24,165
THEY DIDN'T GO DEEPER
INTO THE MAZE, DID THEY?

249
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,298
THAT'D BE MY GUESS.

250
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,398
THESE DECIPHERED HIEROGLYPHS
TELL ME

251
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,832
THE INSIDE OF THESE RUINS
IS A GIANT LABYRINTH.

252
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:31,298
SO IF THAT'S THE CASE...

253
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,732
THEY COULD BE
LOST IN THERE FOREVER.

254
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,732
FOREVER? OH!

255
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,449
Mimi:
HEY, UH, TENTEMON...

256
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:46,715
Tentemon:
YES?

257
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,449
DO YOU GET THE FEELING
WE'RE GOING IN CIRCLES?

258
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,449
SEE THIS SMUDGE
ON THE WALL?

259
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,815
I REMEMBER PASSING IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

260
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,149
YOU'RE RIGHT!

261
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,815
COULD WE BE LOST?

262
00:10:56,849 --> 00:11:00,071
THIS IS PROBABLY A BAD TIME
TO SAY "I TOLD YOU SO..."

263
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:01,571
OH, QUIET!

264
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:05,004
I CAN'T BEAR IT--
I'M GOING IN!

265
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:06,271
AND GET LOST TOO?

266
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:08,371
NO PALMON--
WE HAVE GOT TO USE OUR HEADS.

267
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,604
BUT WE CAN'T
JUST LEAVE THEM!

268
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:12,038
WE WON'T,

269
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,871
BUT THIS IS
A SUPER-COMPLICATED MAZE.

270
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,371
I'VE GOTTA TRY TO
GET A HANDLE ON IT.

271
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:19,338
THEN MAYBE I CAN
HELP GET THEM OUT.

272
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:21,304
Tentomon:
WELL, BEING LOST
ISN'T SO BAD.

273
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,371
OH DEAR--
ARE YOU HURT?

274
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:27,771
NO, I'M FINE,
I'M GETTING USED TO IT BY NOW.

275
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:29,738
IF I HAD JUST GONE TO
CHEERLEADING CAMP

276
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:31,304
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

277
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,371
LET'S TRY A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH
TO THIS.

278
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:36,738
IF WE KEEP TURNING TO THE LEFT--
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT--

279
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,271
WHY SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU?

280
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:41,038
IT'S YOUR FRIEND IZZY
THAT GOT ME INTO THIS MESS.

281
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:44,604
YES, HE GETS A LITTLE
WRAPPED UP IN HIS WORK

282
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,771
AND DOESN'T ALWAYS
INTERACT WELL WITH OTHERS,

283
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,271
BUT HE'S A GOOD BOY.

284
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:50,738
Izzy:
THERE THEY ARE!

285
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:54,638
THAT BLINKING LIGHT
IS MIMI?

286
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,171
PRECISELY.

287
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,238
Tentomon over the computer:
No, not that way!

288
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,638
Mimi:
Buzz off--leave me alone!

289
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,271
THAT'S MY GIRL!

290
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,604
I HOMED IN ON THE SIGNAL
FROM HER DIGI-VICE.

291
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:07,638
WE CAN HEAR HER--
LET'S HOPE SHE CAN HEAR <i>US.</i>

292
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,971
IZZY TO MIMI--
DO YOU READ ME?

293
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,738
Izzy:
Repeat--do you read me?

294
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:13,938
IZZY, IS THAT YOU?

295
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:15,671
ALL RIGHT! IT'S WORKING!

296
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,638
MIMI, I'M GONNA NAVIGATE
FOR YOU

297
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,571
SO WALK EXACTLY WHERE
I TELL YOU TO.

298
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:20,871
Mimi:
Uh...

299
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,071
DON'T WORRY--
IT'LL BE OKAY!

300
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,871
Tentomon:
IS THAT YOU, PALMON?

301
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:27,838
JUST FOLLOW IZZY'S DIRECTIONS
AND YOU'LL BE OUT OF THERE.

302
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,804
SEE? I TOLD YOU
IZZY WAS A GOOD BOY.

303
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:33,271
OKAY--TAKE THE FIRST DOORWAY
ON THE RIGHT.

304
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,171
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END,
TURN LEFT,

305
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:39,238
BUT BE CAREFUL OF THE NEXT ROOM,
THERE'S A BIG HOLE IN THE FLOOR.

306
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:42,204
Mimi:
OH!

307
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:44,038
AH!

308
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:48,038
Izzy:
There should be a narrow ledge
you can use to get across.

309
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,404
Mimi:
DID WE HAVE TO TAKE
THE SCENIC ROUTE?

310
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:56,204
( <i>beeping</i> )

311
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:57,338
UH-OH!

312
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,804
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"UH-OH"?

313
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:01,338
OKAY, I'M READY--
WHICH WAY SHOULD WE GO?

314
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:04,138
Tentemon:
