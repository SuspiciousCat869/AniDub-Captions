158
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:29,277
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
AN ETERNITY FOR THIS ENCOUNTER.

159
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,177
WHAT?

160
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,244
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

161
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:36,411
AS I SAT ALONE IN THE COLD,
MISERABLE DARKNESS OF MY WORLD,

162
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,277
I WATCHED ALL OF YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE

163
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:42,211
LAUGHING AND HAVING FUN
IN THE LIGHT.

164
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:44,911
WELL, NOW IT'S MY TURN...
TO SHINE!

165
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:48,744
All: AAH!

166
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:51,711
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

167
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,244
Matt: I THINK SO.

168
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:55,244
Sora: I'M OKAY, TAI.

169
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:56,744
NOT FOR LONG.

170
00:06:56,777 --> 00:07:00,977
DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR
I SHOULD HAVE ALL THIS AGONY?

171
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:04,177
WHY SHOULD YOU LAUGH
WHEN I AM FORCED TO CRY?

172
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:08,177
WHY DO YOU GET TO TASTE
THE BEST LIFE HAS TO OFFER

173
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,644
WHILE ALL I DO IS CHOKE
ON ITS LEFTOVERS?

174
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,111
ANSWER ME THIS!

175
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:16,244
WHY DO YOU GET THE PIZZA
WHILE I GET THE CRUST?

176
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,211
OH! I CAN'T TAKE
ALL THESE METAPHORS!

177
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,177
BOY. THIS GUY
REALLY HOLDS A GRUDGE.

178
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,611
I WILL RULE THE WORLD
AND PLUNGE IT INTO DARKNESS

179
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:27,011
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO
BE ALONE ANYMORE IN MY MISERY!

180
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,744
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

181
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,477
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT AM I LAUGHING AT?

182
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,644
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DEPRESSED.

183
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:37,111
RIVER OF POWER!

184
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:41,044
KARI!

185
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:43,011
AAH! ANGEWOMAN, NO!

186
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:47,011
THAT WAS METAL SIDRUMON
WITH HIS CLASSIC RIVER OF POWER.

187
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:49,444
NOW, HERE'S MYOTISMON
WITH HIS NUMBER ONE HIT,

188
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:51,877
CRIMSON LIGHTNING!

189
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,111
AAH!

190
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,444
UNH! AAH!

191
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:00,411
NEXT, MACHINERUMON --
GIGA-CANNON.

192
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:02,144
SORA!

193
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,811
AAH!

194
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:05,244
HE'S USING ALL THE ATTACKS

195
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,811
OF THE EVIL DIGIMON
WE'VE DEFEATED IN THE PAST.

196
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:10,344
YOU MEAN WE HAVE TO
FIGHT THEM ALL OVER AGAIN?

197
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:13,277
THIS IS THE WORST NIGHTMARE
I'VE EVER BEEN AWAKE FOR!

198
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,744
WE WERE ABLE
TO BEAT THEM ONCE.

199
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:16,977
SORA'S RIGHT.

200
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,711
WE DID BEAT THEM,
AND WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

201
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:22,677
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGHT
TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

202
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,144
I AGREE. WE'VE SACRIFICED
TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP NOW.

203
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:29,611
YOU FOOLS! YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN SEEN MY TRUE POWER YET.

204
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:32,044
REVERSE DIGEVOLVE!

205
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,177
AAH!

206
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:36,411
UNH!

207
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:37,744
LILLYMON!

208
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:38,977
All: AAH!

209
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,077
AAH!

210
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:42,777
I'LL MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW IT FEELS

211
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,511
TO BE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO EXTINCTION.

212
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:54,144
[ GASPS ]

213
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:55,944
THEY'RE ROOKIES!

214
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:58,111
HE CHANGED THEM BACK
SO EASILY!

215
00:08:58,144 --> 00:08:59,211
I'M SORRY, T.K.

216
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:01,411
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S HIS.

217
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,544
GREAT. THIS TIME
WE'RE FINISHED.

218
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,811
YOU BETTER LOSE
THAT 'TUDE, KARI.

219
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,344
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE AT
THE ROOKIE LEVEL

220
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:10,777
DOESN'T MEAN
WE STILL CAN'T FIGHT.

221
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,744
THAT'S IT! START FROM SCRATCH.
YOU CAN DIGEVOLVE AGAIN.

222
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:15,744
WE'D HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING.

223
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:16,744
I <i>AM</i> HUNGRY.

224
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:19,211
FORGET FOOD. WE HAVE
THE POWER WITHIN US.

225
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:22,477
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP.

226
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:25,677
Matt: EVERYBODY
GET YOUR CRESTS READY.

227
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,811
DEATH CLAW!

228
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,777
All: AAH!

229
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,277
HA HA HA!

230
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:42,611
AAH! OUR CRESTS AND TAGS!

231
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,577
HE BROKE THEM ALL!

232
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,044
THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO DIGEVOLVE WITHOUT THEM.

233
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:50,044
I HOPE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.
ALWAYS SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS.

234
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:53,511
THE WARRANTY WAS PROBABLY
STILL GOOD ON THOSE THINGS.

235
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:55,477
ISN'T THIS
USUALLY THE TIME

236
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,577
ONE OF US COMES UP
WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA?

237
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:02,377
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
CAN SAVE US THIS TIME, JOE.

238
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:09,248
HOW CAN WE FIGHT APOCALYMON
WITHOUT DIGEVOLVING?

239
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,881
HERE'S NO WAY!

240
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:13,715
ALL THE ROOKIE DIGIMON
COMBINED COULDN'T DEFEAT

241
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:16,415
<i>ALL</i> THE EVIL DIGIMON
FROM THE PAST.

242
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,548
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY.

243
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:22,015
HOW DID THE ORIGINAL
DIGIDESTINED KIDS

244
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:24,015
DEFEAT THIS ENEMY?

245
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:27,415
I'LL TAKE THESE CHILDREN
AND USE THEIR FEAR

246
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:30,281
TO MAKE THEM DIGITAL
AND DISAPPEAR!

247
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:31,981
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

248
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,448
AAH!

249
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,048
AAH!

250
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,615
OHH!

251
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:38,881
WHAT'S THIS?

252
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,381
FASCINATING. OUR BODIES
ARE BEING BROKEN DOWN

253
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:44,081
INTO LITTLE BITS
OF DIGITAL INFORMATION.

254
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:48,381
LET'S STAY CALM, EVERYONE.
DON'T FALL TO PIECES.

255
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,481
TOO LATE.

256
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,415
All: AAH!

257
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:02,881
UNH! WHERE ARE WE?

258
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,315
WE'RE INFORMATION NOW.

259
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,981
THIS IS WHERE ALL
DIGITAL INFORMATION GATHERS.

260
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,981
IT'S THE WORLD OF DATA.

261
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,981
DATA? I'M TOO YOUNG
TO BE DATING.

262
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,481
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

263
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:15,481
SOMETIMES TOO MUCH
INFORMATION'S A BAD THING.

264
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:16,981
CAN WE GET BACK?

265
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:18,481
I DON'T KNOW, KARI.

266
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,815
NOTHING LIKE THIS
HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

267
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,815
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

268
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,815
IS THIS IT?
HAVE WE LOST?

269
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:27,315
I'D SAY THAT'S
A PRETTY GOOD CONCLUSION.

270
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:29,481
COME ON, YOU GUYS.
DON'T QUIT NOW.

271
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:30,648
WHY NOT?

272
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,481
WE CAN'T STOP FIGHTING NOW.

273
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:34,981
WE HAVE NO TAGS AND CRESTS.
WE CAN'T DIGEVOLVE.

274
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,481
WE'RE FACING

275
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:38,481
THE MOST POWERFUL ENEMY
OF ALL TIME.

276
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,481
I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

277
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,548
YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT ATTITUDE,

278
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:44,915
BUT POSITIVE THINKING
CAN'T GUARANTEE

279
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,815
WE'LL FIND A WAY
BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL FORMS.

280
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:50,615
I TRIED
POSITIVE THINKING ONCE,

281
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:52,815
AND I <i>POSITIVELY</i> HATED IT!

282
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:56,415
WE'RE THE FIRST HUMANS
TO BE DIGITALLY PROCESSED.

283
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,981
TECHNICALLY, WE'RE PIONEERS --
LIKE MARCO POLO!

284
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:02,481
I KNOW WHAT HE'S
FAMOUS FOR. MARCO --

285
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:03,915
Agumon: POLO!

286
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,415
MARCO --

287
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:06,915
Gatomon: POLO!

288
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:09,415
IN EVERY BATTLE, YOU'RE
BOUND TO FACE UNKNOWNS.

289
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:12,415
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW
OTHER FIGHTS WOULD TURN OUT,

290
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,915
BUT YOU FOUGHT ANYWAY.

291
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,748
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE DID FIGHT.

292
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:17,548
<i>WHEN I GOT</i>
<i>TO THE DIGITAL WORLD,</i>

293
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:20,281
<i>I WAS AFRAID OF</i>
<i>ANY LITTLE THING THAT MOVED.</i>

294
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:23,348
<i>WE FACED ALL KINDS</i>
<i>OF NEW MONSTERS.</i>

295
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:25,815
<i>WE ALWAYS FOUND THE STRENGTH</i>
<i>TO BEAT THE ENEMY,</i>

296
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,815
<i>REGARDLESS OF HOW BIG</i>
<i>IT WAS. DIDN'T WE, JOE?</i>

297
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,781
<i>THAT'S RIGHT. WE DID.</i>

298
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,381
<i>WE WORKED TOGETHER</i>
<i>AS A TEAM,</i>

299
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,715
<i>EVEN THAT TIME</i>
<i>WE ALMOST LOST T.K.</i>

300
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,848
<i>BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SWIM.</i>

301
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,748
<i>OF COURSE, I FORGOT</i>
<i>THAT I COULDN'T SWIM, EITHER.</i>

302
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:44,381
I REMEMBER TIMES
WHEN ALL I WANTED TO DO

303
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,781
WAS BREAK DOWN AND CRY.

304
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,581
INSTEAD, YOU FOUGHT ON
WITH YOUR NEW FRIENDS.

305
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:51,881
I'VE BECOME A STRONGER PERSON
SINCE I MET ALL OF YOU.

306
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,015
<i>LIKE THAT TIME</i>
<i>AT THE CONVENTION CENTER</i>

307
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,915
<i>WHEN ALL THOSE BAKIMON</i>
<i>WERE ATTACKING.</i>

308
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,415
<i>I DIDN'T CRY</i>
<i>A SINGLE DROP.</i>

309
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:00,915
<i>ALL RIGHT.</i>
<i>MAYBE JUST ONE DROP.</i>

310
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,415
BEFORE I MET YOU, T.K.,

311
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:06,848
I DIDN'T THINK IT MATTERED
IF I EVER DIGEVOLVED OR NOT.

312
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,948
<i>BUT WHEN DEVIMON</i>
<i>WENT TO GRAB YOU AND GOT ME,</i>

313
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,115
<i>I KNEW IT WAS</i>
<i>MY TIME TO SHINE.</i>

314
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,848
<i>I BECAME ANGEMON, AND I'VE</i>
<i>BEEN FLYING HIGH EVER SINCE.</i>

315
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,981
T.K.: <i>I LEARNED SOMETHING</i>
<i>FROM YOU, TOO.</i>

316
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,315
<i>I LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES</i>
<i>YOU HAVE TO FIGHT</i>

317
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,848
<i>FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.</i>

318
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:25,848
YOU'VE CHANGED MY LIFE,
TOO, SORA.

319
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:27,348
REALLY?

320
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,848
OF COURSE. AFTER ALL,

321
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:31,748
I'VE NEVER HAD
A BEST FRIEND BEFORE.

322
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,915
<i>I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU,</i>

323
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:37,115
<i>LIKE THAT TIME I TOOK</i>
<i>MYOTISMON'S CRIMSON LIGHTNING</i>

324
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,881
<i>RIGHT IN THE CHEST.</i>

325

<i>TALK ABOUT HEARTBURN!</i>

326
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:43,915
IZZY, WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,

327
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,315
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST
ONE OF THOSE COMPUTER GEEKS.

328
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,881
AFTER I GOT TO KNOW YOU,

329
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,915
I REALIZED YOU <i>ARE</i>
ONE OF THOSE COMPUTER GEEKS!

330
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,848
WHERE WOULD THE REST OF US BE
WITHOUT YOU?

331
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,181
THANKS, PAL.

332
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,115
I PROMISED MYSELF
I WOULDN'T CRY,

333
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:01,248
<i>ALTHOUGH I WANTED TO CRY</i>
<i>WHEN I FELT THAT ASTEROID BELT</i>

334
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:03,181
<i>TIGHTENING AROUND MY WAIST.</i>

335
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:06,615
<i>BUT YOU AND I</i>
<i>TOOK CARE OF VADAMON TOGETHER.</i>

336
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,915
AS FOR YOU, MATT --

337
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,615
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING. I KNOW.

338
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,115
<i>THERE WAS THAT TIME --</i>

339
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:13,415
<i>YEAH. I REMEMBER.</i>

340
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,515
<i>THEN YOU AND I --</i>

341
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:15,648
<i>I KNOW.</i>

342
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,415
<i>REMEMBER WHEN WE --</i>

343
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:20,615
<i>I SAID YOU DON'T</i>
<i>HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING!</i>

344
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,981
YOU AND I KNEW
FROM THE BEGINNING

345
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,581
THAT TOGETHER WE MADE
AN INVINCIBLE TEAM. RIGHT, TAI?

346
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,015
<i>I PROBABLY COULD HAVE</i>
<i>TAKEN CARE OF ETEMON</i>

347
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,015
<i>WITHOUT YOU, BUT IT WAS NICE</i>
<i>HAVING YOU AROUND,</i>

348
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:35,615
<i>AND YOU DID GET ME OUT</i>
<i>OF A FEW JAMS.</i>

349
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,115
WE CAN'T GIVE UP.

350
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:39,615
IF WE DO, WHAT WAS
THE WHOLE POINT

351
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,948
OF SEARCHING FOR KARI
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

352
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,315
I'VE WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE
TO MEET YOU AND FIND MY PURPOSE,

353
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:48,315
AND THAT IS TO PROTECT YOU
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST.

354
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:52,515
<i>WHETHER THAT MEANT FACING</i>
<i>MYOTISMON'S GRISLY WING ATTACK</i>

355
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:56,448
<i>OR FACING THE REALITY</i>
<i>OF LOSING WIZARDMON.</i>

356
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:03,381
<i>YOU KNOW I WILL ALWAYS</i>
<i>BE THERE FOR YOU.</i>

357
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:06,215
BOY! IF I HAD NEVER
MET YOU, GATOMON...

358
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,781
AND IF I HAD NEVER
COME TO THE DIGITAL WORLD...

359
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,881
AND IF NONE OF US BECAME
FRIENDS IN THE FIRST PLACE...

360
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:15,048
WE WOULDN'T HAVE BECOME
THE PEOPLE WE ARE TODAY!

361
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,548
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE WON
ALL THOSE BATTLES

362
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,548
WITHOUT EACH OTHER.

363
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,881
I'VE GROWN UP A LOT.

364
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,715
WE'VE ALL GROWN UP
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

365
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,448
I'VE GROWN UP, TOO.

366
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:27,481
I'M A MUCH BETTER
FIGHTER NOW.

367
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:32,748
YOU CAN DO IT!

368
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,981
COME ON -- FOR EARTH!

369
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:37,781
WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!

370
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,415
GIVE IT YOUR ALL.

371
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:51,381
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M NOT READY TO QUIT YET!

372
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,381
I'M WITH YOU, TAI.
I WON'T LET

373
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:55,381
THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE
BE FOR NOTHING!

374
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,048
ME NEITHER.

375
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,048
THERE IS NO WAY I'M ABOUT
TO LET MY FRIENDS DOWN.

376
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:03,381
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
COUNTING ON US ON EARTH.

377
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:04,815
LET'S FIND A WAY!

378
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:05,981
LET'S FIGHT!

379
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,148
WE'RE READY!

380
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:09,115
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

381
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,648
CRESTS OR NO CRESTS,
WE'RE GOING TO WIN!

382
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,040
ARE WE TOGETHER?
WE ARE.

383
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:20,540
THEN LET'S FIGHT!

384
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:24,207
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
WITHOUT OUR CRESTS.

385
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,207
CRESTS? WE DON'T NEED
NO STINKING CRESTS!

386
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,440

IT'S YOUR CRESTS.

389
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,140
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CARRY THEM ANYMORE.

390
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:49,107
THEIR POWER HAS BEEN
INSIDE OF YOU THIS WHOLE TIME.

391

YOU MEAN, IN OUR HEARTS?

392
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,340
PRODIGIOUS! THAT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

393
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:56,007
IF YOUR SPECIAL TRAITS
ARE WITHIN YOU,

394
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,773
YOU DON'T NEED YOUR CREST.

395
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,573
YOUR POWER WILL BE
WITHIN YOU AS WELL.

396
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,773
IT WASN'T THE FRIENDSHIP
INSIDE ME

397
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,273
THAT MADE MY CREST GLOW.

398
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:07,540
THE FRIENDSHIP FROM ALL OF YOU
GATHERED INSIDE MY HEART.

399
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,473
THAT BROUGHT MY CREST TO LIFE.

400
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,073
EACH PERSON'S CREST
ISN'T POWERED BY THEMSELVES.
