471
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:39,085
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO SPLIT UP AGAIN.

472
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:42,085
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
T.K., YOU HANG WITH ME.

473
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:45,252
AND JOE WILL COME WITH ME.
JUST SO NOBODY GETS LOST,

474
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,085
LET'S MEET AT THE FOOT
OF THAT MOUNTAIN, OKAY?

475
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:49,585
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

476
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:52,085
MATT, DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE'LL MEET AGAIN?

477
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:53,752
I GUARANTEE IT.

478
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:55,752
FAREWELL! BYE-BYE!
<i>AUF WIEDERSEHEN.</i>

479
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:58,752
WAIT. DON'T GO YET.
I HAVE TO TIE MY SHOE.

480
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:01,752
Tai: YOU'RE RUINING
OUR BIG DRAMATIC EXIT.

481
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,752
[ LAUGHTER ]
