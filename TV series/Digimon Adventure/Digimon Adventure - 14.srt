<i>AND JUST IN TIME, TOO.</i>

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,733
<i>LATER, DEVIMON</i>
<i>CHANNELED HIS POWER</i>

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,066
<i>AND BECAME ENORMOUS!</i>

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,500
<i>NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES</i>
<i>THEY TRIED,</i>

6
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,066
<i>THAT'S WHEN</i>
<i>THE INCREDIBLE HAPPENED.</i>

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,033
<i>PATAMON FINALLY DIGIVOLVED</i>
<i>INTO ANGEMON</i>

8
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,966

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,866
<i>WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH GONE,</i>

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,300

Tai:
<i>AFTER THE DIGIMON</i>
<i>DEFEATED DEVIMON,</i>

36
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,300
<i>WE THOUGHT THE WORST</i>
<i>WAS OVER.</i>

37
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,466
<i>AND THEN...</i>

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,966
MMM...

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>A MYSTERIOUS BEING</i>
<i>APPEARED BEFORE US.</i>

40
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,300
SO YOU CHILDREN
ARE THE DIGI-DESTINED.

41
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,666
YOU MUST BE STRONG
TO HAVE DEFEATED DEVIMON.

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,833
WHO ARE YOU?

43
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,500
ARE YOU A FRIEND
OF DEVIMON'S?

44
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,666
FEAR NOT,
FOR I AM A FRIEND TO ALL.

45
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,133
AND YET,
I AM A FRIEND TO NONE.

46
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,566
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT--

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,066
THERE ARE OTHER HUMANS
BESIDES US IN THIS WORLD.

48
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,500
I AM HUMAN,
AND YET I AM NOT HUMAN.

49
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,433
THIS IS CONFUSING ME!

50
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,666
HMMMPH!

51
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,400
NO, MY NAME IS GENNAI.

52
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,300
I WAS UNABLE TO SEND YOU
THIS TRANSMISSION

53
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,066
DURING YOUR BATTLE WITH DEVIMON,

54
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,700
BUT NOW THE LINES ARE CLEAR
AND ONLY TEN CENTS A MINUTE.

55
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:10,966
WELL, WHO ARE YOU?

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,433
AND WHERE ARE YOU?

57
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,200
I AM SPEAKING TO YOU
FAR AWAY FROM FILE ISLAND,

58
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:17,666
ON THE CONTINENT OF SERVER.

59
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,833
TALK ABOUT LONG DISTANCE--
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

60
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:23,266
SINCE BEFORE THE BEGINNING
AND UNTIL AFTER THE END.

61
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,966
ARE YOU THE ONE WHO GOT US STUCK
HERE IN THE DIGITAL WORLD?

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
IT WAS NOT I.

63
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,433
THEN WHO WAS IT?

64
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,433
IT WAS...

65
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,533
...I DON'T KNOW.

66
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:34,466
All:
AWW!

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,166
BUT MR. GENNAI, SIR...

68
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,066
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO
SO WE CAN ALL GET BACK HOME?

69
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,500
NO, I DON'T.

70
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,800
YOU'RE A REGULAR FOUNTAIN
OF INFORMATION, AREN'T YOU?

71
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:49,266
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU,
BUT YOU CAN HELP ME.

72
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,800
WHAT?
HUH?

73
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,666
PLEASE COME TO SERVER
AND DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES.

74
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,233
AS THE DIGI-DESTINED,
I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

75
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,833
THAT'S CRAZY.

76
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,333
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR EXACT LOCATION.

77
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,666
GOOD POINT--I FORGOT
YOU'RE FROM OUT OF TOWN.

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,066
LET ME CREATE A MAP FOR YOU
ON YOUR COMPUTER.

79
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,266
HUH?!

80
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,433
WHAT IF YOUR ENEMIES
ARE HUMUNGAZOID?

81
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,866
DO YOU THINK WE CAN BEAT
ANYTHING TOUGHER THAN DEVIMON?

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,066
NOT PRESENTLY,

83
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,633
BUT IF YOUR DIGIMON
CAN DIGIVOLVE ONCE MORE

84
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,533
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT.

85
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,700
SO WE CAN DIGIVOLVE
EVEN MORE?

86
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,500
BUT YOU'LL NEED
SOMETHING SPECIAL TO DO IT.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,433
IF YOU HAVE
THE TAGS AND CRESTS,

88
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,966
YOUR DIGIMON WILL BE ABLE TO
DIGIVOLVE EVEN FURTHER.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,400
PLEASE TELL US WHERE WE CAN FIND
THESE TAGS AND CRESTS.

90
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,633
THE CRESTS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT,

91
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,000
YOU CAN LOCATE THEM THROUGHOUT
THE CONTINENT OF SERVER.

92
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:41,466
AND THE TAGS WERE SEALED AWAY
SOMEWHERE BY DEVIMON.

93
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,700
OH, NO! DEVIMON!

94
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,433
YOU MUST COME...AAHH!!!

95
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,933
WHAT'S GOING ON?

96
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,600
( <i>Gennai in pain:</i> )
COME QUICKLY!

97
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:52,866
I'LL BE WAITING ON SERVER!

98
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,833
HE'S GONE!

99
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,233
Mimi:
WHAT WAS THAT?

100
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,594
GENNAI'S TRANSMISSION
ENDED RATHER ABRUPTLY.

101
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:07,061
AT LEAST HE WAS ABLE TO
SEND A MAP THROUGH

102
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:08,227
BEFORE HE WAS CUT OFF.

103
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,927
I HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT--
WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

104
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,694
Tai:
I'VE GOT A FOOLPROOF PLAN.

105
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,761
FIRST WE'LL EAT SOMETHING,

106
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,627
AND AFTER THAT
I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

107
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,561
( <i>Agumon giggling:</i> )
THAT WAS DELICIOUS!

108
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:30,027
Biyomon:
I WAS SO HUNGRY.

109
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,127
Tentomon:
NOW THAT MY STOMACH'S FULL,
I'M READY FOR LUNCH.

110
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:38,361
T.K.?

111
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,228
I WAS JUST WISHING MY DIGI-EGG
WOULD HURRY UP AND HATCH

112
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,835
SO IT COULD GROW UP.

113
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,435
DON'T SWEAT IT,
LITTLE BRO,

114
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,668
WHEN YOUR DIGIMON HATCHES,
IT'LL BE THE COOLEST ONE YET.

115
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,768
EGG-ZACTLY!

116
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:52,668
Tai:
OKAY, WE'VE STUFFED OUR FACES,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NEXT?

117
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:53,935
Sora:
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NEXT--

118
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,135
WE HAVE TO GO TO SERVER
TO SAVE GENNAI FROM HIS ENEMIES.

119
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:58,968
Izzy:
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS
OF LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE,

120
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,701
I'D SAY SERVER IS
QUITE SOME DISTANCE FROM HERE.

121
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,368
I CAN'T EVEN SWIM
ACROSS THE BATHTUB,

122
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,501
LET ALONE AN OCEAN,
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

123
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,701
WHY DO WE
HAVE TO GO, ANYWAY?

124
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:10,301
WHAT I MEAN IS,
DEVIMON'S GONE FROM THE ISLAND,

125
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,468
THE BLACK GEARS
HAVE DISAPPEARED, TOO.

126
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,868
WE'VE BEEN
ONCE AROUND THE ISLAND,

127
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:16,501
SO WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW
WHERE EVERYTHING IS.

128
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,768
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT FOOD OR WATER.

129
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,801
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

130
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:23,801
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE
WHAT THIS WEIRDO GENNAI SAYS?

131
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,935
WHAT I MEAN IS,
HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW

132
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,701
THAT THIS PLACE SERVER
REALLY EXISTS?

133
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,268
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!

134
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,668
IF WE HANG AROUND HERE,
WE'LL NEVER GET BACK HOME!

135
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,835
I DON' KNOW, GUYS--
DEVIMON ALMOST GOT US.

136
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,501
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO,

137
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,335
AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST OVER HERE.

138
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,768
AND EVEN IF WE WANTED TO GO,

139
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,101
WHAT MODE OF TRANSPORTATION
COULD WE UTILIZE?

140
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,968
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THE FASHIONS ARE LIKE ON SERVER.

141
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:54,201
MAYBE WE SHOULD STAY HERE
A WHILE AND THINK IT THROUGH.

142
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,868
WHAT'S WITH YOU, MAN?

143
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,668
T.K.:
LET'S GO!

144
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,301
All:
HUH?!

145
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:01,735
T.K.?

146
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:05,468
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DANGER
WILL BE WAITING FOR US,

147
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:06,468
BUT LET'S SEE!

148
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,368
I'M SURE ANGEMON
WOULD SAY THE SAME THING

149
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,435
IF HE WERE STILL AROUND.

150
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,901
SO I'M GOING!

151
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,035
Agumon:
WE'LL GO TOO!

152
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:17,868
IF WE HAVE THE TAGS AND CRESTS,
WE CAN DIGIVOLVE AGAIN, RIGHT?

153
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,535
ONCE WE TRANSFORM
INTO OUR NEW SHAPES,

154
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,268
WE'LL BE ABLE TO
PROTECT YOU FOR SURE!

155
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,335

00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,511
GO AWAY--NOT AGAIN!

315
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:51,877
Whamon:
SORRY ABOUT THAT--

316
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:54,977
I MUST HAVE HAD A TUMMYACHE
OR SOMETHING.

317
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,344
IT'S OKAY--WE ALL KNOW
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

318
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,444
THAT'S RIGHT--IT WAS
THE BLACK GEAR INSIDE YOU.

319
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:02,111
THOSE BLACK GEARS ARE RUDE--
I'LL BET THAT WAS THE LAST ONE.

320
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:03,577
Joe:
I BET YOU'RE WRONG!

321
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,144
Whamon:
THANKS, KIDS--I OWE YOU ONE.

322
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:08,411
DON'T MENTION IT, WHAMON,
IT WAS OUR PLEASURE.

323
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:10,944
BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW
HOW FAR IT IS TO SERVER?

324
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,811
YES, IT WOULD TAKE ME
FIVE DAYS--

325
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:16,144
MAKE THAT THREE AND A HALF
WITHOUT TRAFFIC.

326
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,611
T.K.:
GREAT--OUR RAFT'S BROKEN.

327
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,477
Whamon:
ARE YOU GOING TO SERVER?

328
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,077
Agumon:
YEAH, WE WERE TRYING TO.

329
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,644
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE MYSELF.

330
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,044
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
YOUR LUNCH SAVES YOUR LIFE.

331
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:27,911
Sora:
REALLY?

332
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:30,244
YEA! ALRIGHT!

333
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,111
THIS IS GREAT.

334
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:54,377
SURE IS A WHOLE LOT FASTER
AND SMOOTHER THAN THAT RAFT!

335
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,244
WHICH MEANS
I WON'T GET SEASICK.

336
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,011
NOW IF WE ONLY KNEW
WHERE WE COULD FIND

337
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:01,044
THOSE TAGS AND THOSE CRESTS
THAT DEVIMON HID SOMEWHERE.

338
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,111
Whamon:
DID YOU SAY DEVIMON?

339
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:04,611
Tai:
YEAH, DO YOU KNOW HIM?

340
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:07,444
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT TAGS OR CRESTS,

341
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,977
BUT A WHILE AGO

342
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,411
DEVIMON HID SOMETHING
DEEP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

343
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:13,477
WHERE?

344
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:15,044
Whamon:
IT'S ON THE WAY TO SERVER--

345
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:18,211
YOU CAN ALL RIDE INSIDE ME
AND I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.

346
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,011
BUT NO TICKLING.

347
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:37,611
Whamon:
I'M SO OUT OF SHAPE,

348
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,577
I HAVE TO REST HERE FOR A WHILE.

349
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,777
I GOTTA DROP
A COUPLE THOUSAND POUNDS.
