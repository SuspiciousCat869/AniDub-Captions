1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,066
A STRANGE BEING
NAMED GENNAI ASKED US TO
COME TO HIS CONTINENT

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,800
TO DEFEAT HIS ENEMIES.
HE TOLD US WE HAVE THE POWER
TO DIGIVOLVE EVEN MORE,

3
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,266
BUT NOT WITHOUT SPECIAL TAGS
AND CRESTS THAT WERE HIDDEN
BY DEVOMON.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,133
WE BUILT A RAFT, WITH THE HELP
OF SOME ISLAND DIGIMON,

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:18,033
AND T.K.'S DIGIEGG HATCHED
INTO POYOMON.

6
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:22,100
WHILE ON THE RAFT,
WE MET WHAMON, AND
WERE SWALLOWED BY HIM.

7
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:25,800
HE TOOK US TO AN UNDERWATER
STORE WHERE WE FOUND THE TAGS.

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,566
NOW ALL WE NEEDED
WERE THE CRESTS.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
BUT WHERE TO LOOK NEXT?

ALMOST 5 DAYS AGO.

43
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,000
Whamon: WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

44
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,966
HUH?

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,433
HEY, I THINK
I SEE AN ICEBERG!

46
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,900
EITHER THAT, OR IT COULD BE
THE CONTINENT OF SERVER.

47
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,100
IT'S SERVER.

48
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,866
ALL RIGHT!

49
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,200
ALL RIGHT EVERYBODY,
WAKE UP! RISE AND SHINE!

50
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,333
WE'RE LANDING AT SERVER!

51
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,800
I WAS ONLY RESTING MY EYES.

52
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,766
WELL, YOUR EYES WERE
SNORING PRETTY LOUDLY.

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,300
COME ON, WE'RE GONNA
BE THERE IN A FEW MINUTES!

54
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,100
GOTTA MAKE SURE WE HAVE
EVERYTHING WE NEED!

55
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,166
Sora:
WE'RE REALLY THERE?

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,233
Izzy: WELL, I'M READY
FOR LAND AGAIN!

57
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,766
T.K.: I'D SURE LIKE A BED
THAT DIDN'T MOVE!

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,533
Agumon: WOW, THAT ISLAND
IS HUGE!

59
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,866
Biyomon: I'VE NEVER SEEN
AN ISLAND SO BIG!

60
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,333
Tentomon: IT'S NOT AN ISLAND,
IT'S THE CONTINENT OF SERVER.

61
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,900
MIMI, YOU'VE JUST
GOTTA WAKE UP AND
LOOK AT THIS!

62
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,200
WE'RE GOING TO
LAND ON A
BIG CONTINENT!

63
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,066
NO, I'M GETTING
A PEDICURE...

64
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,533
AW, MIMI.

65
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,333
[LAUGHTER]

66
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,433
ALMOST THERE!

67
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:37,666
SERVER, HERE WE COME!

68
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,500
WHOAH!
[LAUGHTER]

69
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,233
Sora: COME ON, MIMI!

70
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,866
UH, THIS IS A LITTLE TOO
EXTREME SPORTS FOR ME.

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,966
IS THERE SOME WAY
I CAN BE AIRLIFTED
ONTO THE ISLAND?

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
SORRY WE CAN'T JUST MOVE
THE CONTINENT FOR YOU, MIMI.

73
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:57,600
ACCORDING TO THE MAP, THIS IS
THE BEST BEACH TO COME ASHORE.

74
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:00,666
JUST PUT ONE FOOT
IN FRONT OF THE OTHER,
AND YOU'LL BE FINE!

75
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,933
IT'S AS EASY
AS FALLING OFF A LOG!

76
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:08,133
YEAH? I'VE FALLEN OFF PLENTY
OF LOGS, AND BELIEVE ME, IT'S
NOT AS EASY AS IT--AHH!

77
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,966
UGH!

78
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,133
I THINK I BROKE A NAIL!

79
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,700
Whamon: GOOD LUCK
FINDING THE CRESTS!

80
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,333
All: GOOD-BYE, WHAMON! SO LONG!

81
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,519
All: GOOD-BYE, WHAMON!

82
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,440
SO, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO, NOW?

83
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,273
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP,
WHAMON TOLD US WHERE TO GO.

84
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:43,740
IN THE FOREST,
A FEW MILES FROM HERE,
THERE'S A KOROMON VILLAGE.

85
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,073
KOROMON. WHY, THAT
SOMEHOW SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

86
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,173
I WAS A KOROMON
THE DAY YOU GOT HERE!

87
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,140
I FORGOT!

88
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:52,273
Tentomon: THE KOROMON
ARE A GROUP OF DIGIMON,

89
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,607
ALWAYS WILLING TO
HELP OUT THOSE IN NEED.

90
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,173
OK, GANG,
LET'S MOVE OUT!

91
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,807
All: YEAH! YOU BETCHA!

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
Sora: THIS PLACE IS BIGGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

93
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,573
Gomamon:
IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS.
THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING.

94
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:05,407
I THINK MY FEET
ARE EXPANDING.

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,107
WE'VE BEEN WALKING
ALL DAY LONG,

96
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,540
AND THERE'S NO SIGN
OF THE VILLAGE YET!

97
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:10,540
OH, I'D GIVE ANYTHING
TO BE IN A BATHTUB

98
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,673
WITH LOTS OF BUBBLE
BATH IN IT!

99
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:15,073
YOU CAN DO THAT
ONCE WE GET
TO THE VILLAGE.

100
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:17,507
YOU HONESTLY THINK THEY
HAVE BATHTUBS, PALMON?

101
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,507
WELL...

102
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,040
HMMM? [SNIFFS]

103
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,007
AGUMON, WHAT IS IT?

104
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,907
TAI, I SMELL KOROMON
OVER IN THIS DIRECTION.

105
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,340
REALLY?

106
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:33,473
A FOREST!

107
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,807
All: A FOREST!?

108
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,640
Matt: IS THAT WHERE
THE KOROMON VILLAGE IS?

109
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:38,740
IT MUST BE!
COME ON!

110
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,407
Sora: TAI, WAIT A MINUTE!

111
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,040
TAI!

112
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:51,373
Tai: ALMOST THERE!

113
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,540
All: AHH! WOW!

114
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,307
T.K.:
GREAT! PUP TENTS.
WE CAN REST!

115
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,107
EVEN BETTER, A BATH!

116
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,273
WAIT, STOP!

117
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:03,040
UHH...

118
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,040
TAI: AGUMON, WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

119
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,840
SOMETHING DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT.

120
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,640
All: UH-OH!

121
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:09,907
A BATH!

122
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,440
SOMEBODY GRAB ME
A RUBBER DUCK!

123
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:12,507
EXCUSE ME,
WHERE'S THE SHAMPOO?

124
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,607
HMMM?

125
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,773
PALMON, DO YOU REALLY
THINK THESE ARE KOROMON?

126
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:19,073
NO WAY, MIMI,
THESE ARE PAGUMON.

127
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:22,107
[LAUGHTER]

128

DON'T LET 'EM GET AWAY!

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,140
AROUND THAT CORNER!

134
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,107
All: HUH?

135
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,173

136
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,940
