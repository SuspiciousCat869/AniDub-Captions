1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,398
Tai: SO THERE WE WERE,
FALLING LIKE CRAZY.

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,898
THAT'S WHEN GOMAMON TELLS
ALL THE FISH IN THE RIVER

3
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:08,898
TO SWIM CLOSE TOGETHER
AND MAKE A BOAT FOR US.

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:12,465
LATER WE FIND A BEACH
WITH A WHOLE BUNCH
OF THESE PHONE BOOTHS.

5
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:15,498
WE TRIED CALLING HOME, BUT
NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO WORK.

6
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:17,965
NEXT, WE GOT TOTALLY
THRASHED ON BY SHELLMON.

7
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,631
HE SPRAYED SEA WATER
LIKE A FIRE HOSE.

8
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:22,431
MY BUD AGUMON
GOT STEPPED ON,

9
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:23,998
AND THAT MADE HIM MAD.

10
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:27,231
HE DIGIVOLVED INTO GREYMON
AND GAVE SHELLMON A RIDE
HE WON'T FORGET,

11
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:29,065
THEN HE TURNED BACK
INTO AGUMON.

12
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,898
DUDES, THIS PLACE IS WILD!

Tai: WE'VE ALMOST
SEARCHED THE WHOLE ISLAND,

46
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:34,331
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND ANY PEOPLE,

47
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:36,498
JUST SOME MONSTERS
WITH ATTITUDE.

48
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,531
BUT THEY COULDN'T
BEAT OUR DIGIMON FRIENDS,

49
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,465
WHO CAN TURN INTO
THESE AWESOME FIGHTERS,

50
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,331
LIKE WHEN AGUMON
DIGIVOLVED INTO GREYMON

51
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,331
AND KICKED SHELLMON
TO THE CURB.

52
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,665
HE WAS SO COOL.

53
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:48,998
YO, AGUMON!

54
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,398
WHAT'S UP, TAI?

55
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,898
I LIKE IT WHEN
YOU'RE GREYMON.

56
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:54,665
NO OFFENSE, BUT WHY DON'T
YOU JUST STAY THAT WAY?

57
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,165
I CAN'T.
HUMPH!

58
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,398
BUT EVEN SUPERHEROES
NEED A REST.

59
00:01:58,431 --> 00:01:59,398
AH! OOGAH!

60
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,398
HA HA HA!

61
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,331
HUH?

62
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:04,765

00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:05,898
RAWWRR!

64
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,098
WHO'S THAT DIGIMON?

65
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,165
IT'S A MONOCHROMON.

66
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,331
BUT DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM.

67
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:10,565
HE'S A LAID-BACK
DIGIMON.

68
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,665
RAWWRR!

69
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,765
Tentomon: ALTHOUGH IT
IS WISE TO BE A BIT CAUTIOUS
WITH THE MONOCHROMON,

70
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:21,498
THEY DO TEND TO GET A BIT
MIFFED WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY.

71
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:22,765
Tai: THEN HE
MUST BE STARVING

72
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:24,465
'CAUSE HE
LOOKS REALLY MAD.

73
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,265
Mimi: AND I THINK
HE WANTS TO EAT US!

74
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:27,431

HUH!
HUH!HUH!

THERE ARE 2 OF THEM!

76
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:31,065
WE'RE CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK
AND 2 SETS OF TEETH!

77
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:31,831
RAWWRR!

78
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,555
WE'RE CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK
AND 2 SETS OF TEETH!

79
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:41,720
AAH!
AAH!
RUN!

80
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,713
Tai: SOMETHING MUST HAVE
SET THOSE MONOCHROMON OFF.

81
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:53,679
Tentomon: THEY'RE
FIGHTING OVER TERRITORY.

82
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:56,179
THEY CAN JUST
HAVE IT, THEN.

83
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:57,213
HEY!

84
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,679
PARUMON, DON'T LEAVE
WITHOUT ME!

85
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,313
THEY DEFINITELY DON'T
NEED US HANGIN' AROUND.

OUCH!

00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,813
T.K., COME ON!

90
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,218
BETTER HURRY UP, YOU GUYS!

91
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:12,185
OK, WE'RE COMING!

92
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:14,385
RAWWRR!
RAWWRR!

[SPLASH]

94
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:29,085
Mimi: I DON'T WALK
THIS MUCH UNLESS
I'M AT A MALL,

95
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:31,985
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
WE'RE NOWHERE
NEAR ONE.

96
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:33,718
MIMI, STOP WHINING.

97
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:35,085
NO! MY FEET HURT!

98
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,352
MAYBE IF YOU'D TAKE OFF
YOUR BOOTS AND SOCKS,

99
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,585
YOU'D FEEL BETTER, MIMI.

100
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,418
IT'S MUCH MORE
PRACTICAL, I THINK.

101
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,852
I'M NOT WALKING IN DIRT
IN MY BARE FEET!

102
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:45,285
I LOVE THE FEEL
OF DIRT UNDER MY FEET,

103
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:47,085
ESPECIALLY
BETWEEN MY TOES.

104
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,852
Mimi: GROSS!

105
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,818

BE LOSING OUR LIGHT SOURCE.

106
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,818
Sora: WHAT
A WEIRD SUNSET.

107
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,185
THIS WHOLE ISLAND
IS WEIRD,

108
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:57,085
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT
WILL COME OUT AT NIGHT?

109
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:58,352
WAIT! I DETECT WATER!

110
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,318
STAY HERE
WHILE I CHECK IT OUT.

111
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:01,952
YES, AS USUAL, I'M RIGHT!

112
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,618
IT'S A LAKE
WITH FRESH, CLEAN WATER,

113
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,185
AND A VARIETY OF TASTY FISH.

114
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:07,218
IT'S A PERFECT CAMPSITE.

115
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:10,185
MAYBE I CAN FINALLY SOAK
MY POOR ACHY FEET.

116
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,185
YAY! WE GET TO SWIM!

117
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,952
GOMAMON, YOU BETTER
WAIT AND MAKE SURE
IT'S SAFE FIRST!

118
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:17,818
THAT'S WHY I THINK
WE SHOULD KEEP WALKING

119
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:19,685
AND STOP
ALL THE COMPLAINING.

120
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,685
EVERYBODY'S HUNGRY.

121
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,152
WE HAVE TO
FIND SOME FOOD.

122
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,085
THAT IS A GOOD PLAN.
I LIKE THAT PLAN A LOT.

123
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:33,685
Piyomon: IT SHOULD BE SAFE
TO REST HERE TONIGHT.

124
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,785
Sora: YEAH. I LOVE
CAMPING OUTSIDE.

125
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,352
IF I WON'T WALK IN DIRT,

126
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,852
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'LL SLEEP IN IT?

127
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:41,118
MIMI, DO YOU
SEE A HOTEL HERE?

128
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,218
[GASP]

130
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,352
T.K.: IT LOOKS
LIKE A TROLLEY CAR.

131
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:51,685
Chip: THAT'S ODD.
THE LIGHTS JUST CAME ON.

132
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:53,685
MAYBE THERE ARE SOME
REAL PEOPLE IN THERE.

133
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:55,018
LET'S CHECK IT OUT!

134
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,452
Mimi: MAYBE THEY CAN
TAKE US BACK HOME

135
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:04,818
IN AIR-CONDITIONED COMFORT!

136
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:07,185
MIMI, WAIT UP!

137
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:08,418
BUMMER! IT'S EMPTY!

138
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:09,952
TOTALLY EMPTY.

139
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:11,652
NO TROLLEY CAR'S
THIS CLEAN.

140
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,652
OH, GOODY!
THESE CUSHIONS ARE COMFY.

141
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:14,918
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:17,718
REMEMBER THOSE
WEIRD PHONE BOOTHS
WE SAW ON THE BEACH?

143
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,852
SOMETHING
JUST AS FREAKY
COULD HAPPEN HERE.

144
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,318
YEAH, LIKE
THIS SUDDENLY MOVING
ALL BY ITSELF.

145
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:25,618
POSSIBLY, BUT THEN AGAIN,
MAYBE THAT'S HOW WE'RE
GOING TO GET HOME.

146
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:27,652
SO WE HAVE NOTHING
TO LOSE BY STAYING HERE.

147
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:30,252
OH, CAN WE EAT NOW?

148
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,485
THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT.

149
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,485
Chip: GOMAMON,
STOP PLAYING IN THE WATER!

150
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:39,452
I CAN'T CATCH ANY FISH
IF YOU KEEP ON

YUM! YUM!

UGH!
