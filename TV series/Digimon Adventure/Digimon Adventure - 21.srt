Tai: <i>DATAMON KNEW SORA</i>
<i>WOULDN'T HELP HIM FIGHT ETEMON,</i>
<i>SO HE CREATED</i>
<i>AN EXACT DOUBLE OF HER.</i>

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,166

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,166

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,166
<i>A PLAN SO GOOD</i>
<i>IT ACTUALLY WORKED.</i>

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,166

<i>TO THE CENTER</i>

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,166

Tai: <i>WHEN WE DEFEATED ETEMON,</i>

38
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,500
<i>SOMETHING VERY STRANGE</i>
<i>HAPPENED.</i>

39
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,800
NO WAY!

40
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,933
WHAT HAPPENED?

41
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:39,033
WE MUST HAVE BEEN PULLED
THROUGH SOME SORT

42
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,133
OF DIMENSIONAL OPENING
BETWEEN DIGIWORLD AND THIS ONE,

43
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,633
WHEREVER THIS ONE IS.

44
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,633
I BET THAT OPENING'S THE WAY
I GOT TO DIGIWORLD,

45
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,133
BUT WHERE ARE WE NOW?
THEY LOOK LIKE HUMAN BEINGS.

46
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,600
THIS LOOKS LIKE EARTH,
BUT IS IT REALLY?

47
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:53,066
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,533
THIS CAN'T BE.

49
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,600
THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARK
I PLAYED IN AS A KID.

50
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,566
WE'RE IN MY HOMETOWN.

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,066
Koromon: NO WAY!

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,066
YEAH, THAT'S THE TOY FACTORY,

53
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,166
AND THAT'S CITY HALL
OVER THERE.

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,633
I DON'T MEAN TO CUT
THE SIGHTSEEING TOUR SHORT,

55
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,133
BUT HAVE YOU NOTICED
I'M NOT METAL GREYMON ANYMORE?

56
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,133
I'M BACK TO KOROMON.

57
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,100
UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

58
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,633
IT FEELS REAL TO --

59
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,800
OHH!

60
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,233
HUH? HEY!

61
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,933
TELL ME, WHERE ARE WE?

62
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,900
IS THIS WORLD FOR REAL,
OR AM I IMAGINING IT?

63
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,600
WHAT?

64
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,800
WE WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE REAL.

65
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,300
PLEASE TELL US.

66
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,766
ARE YOU A REAL GIRL
OR A DIGITAL GIRL?

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,766
WAAH!

68
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,833
WHAT DID I DO?
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

69
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,833
YOU SCARED HER. SHE'S GOING
TO TELL THE PARK POLICE.

70
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,233
<i>THE POLICE?</i>

71
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,700
WILL THEY ARREST ME
FOR MAKING HER CRY?

72
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,900
SAVE ME, TAI.
THEY'RE GOING TO GET ME.

73
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,400
BE QUIET. LISTEN UP.
PRETEND YOU'RE A SOCCER BALL.

74
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,066
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE

75
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,366
SO I CAN CHILL AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,500
THIS ALL LOOKS SO FAMILIAR.
THIS HAS TO BE MY HOME.

77
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,500
WELL, FOR YOUR SAKE,
I HOPE SO.

78
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,966
HOW CAN YOU BE CERTAIN
YOU'RE NOT IMAGINING IT

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,466
IN THE DIGIWORLD, TAI?

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,233
WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN WE GO
TO MY HOUSE AND SEE.

81
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,300
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?
"UNTIL WE GO TO MY HOUSE."

82
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,300
WOW! THIS HAS GOT TO BE
THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

83
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,333
I'M HOME, I'M HOME, I'M HOME!

84
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,324
IT'S TRUE, I'M HOME.
THIS IS SO COOL.
I'M FINALLY HOME!

85
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:23,308
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE MY FAMILY.

86
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,108
WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU,

87
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,141
THEY'LL KNOW
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

88
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,474
THEN WE'LL SEE
IF THE OTHERS GOT HOME

89
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:30,974
AND HOOK UP WITH THEM.

90
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,974
MM, I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

91
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,641
IT'S A GOOD THING

92
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:37,141
I STILL HAD SOME
OF MY CAMP MONEY LEFT.

93
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:39,674
THE SUBWAY'S A LOT NICER
THAN WALKING HOME.

94
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:44,541
WOW! EVERYTHING LOOKS
EXACTLY THE WAY IT DID

95
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,808
ON THE DAY I LEFT FOR CAMP.

96
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,308
Boy: COME ON!

97
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,774
THAT'S WHERE I LIVE.
PRETTY NEAT, DON'T YOU THINK?

98
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,774
ALL THOSE ROOMS?
YOUR FAMILY'S BIG.

99
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:55,774
IT'S AN APARTMENT BUILDING.
LOTS OF FAMILIES LIVE THERE.

100
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,574
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT.

101
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,774
EVERYTHING'S BEEN SO WEIRD.

102
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,174
BEING IN DIGIWORLD,
I'VE LOST TRACK OF TIME.

103
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,674
I WONDER IF THEY'RE EVEN
GOING TO RECOGNIZE ME.

104
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,908
Koromon: WE WON'T KNOW
UNLESS WE GO IN.

105
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:12,374
RIGHT. WELL, HERE GOES.

106
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:14,574
IT'S UNLOCKED.

107
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,274
THEY MUST BE HOME.

108
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:18,774
I REMEMBER WHEN MY MOM
PLANTED THOSE FLOWERS.

109
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,274
I REMEMBER BUZZING
MY FRIENDS UP ON THAT INTERCOM

110
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,774
TO COME OVER AND PLAY
VIDEO GAMES AND WATCH TV,

111
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:25,774
OH, AND THE TIME WHEN MY DAD

112
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,774
PUT OUR FAMILY NAMEPLATE
ON THIS DOOR,

113
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,274
BUT THOSE MEMORIES
WON'T MEAN A THING, KOROMON,

114
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,508
IF WE CAME OUT
OF THAT DIMENSION RIFT

115
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,008
AT THE WRONG TIME.

116
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,008
WHAT IF I NO LONGER EXIST?

117
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,908
CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION?

118
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:38,974
HUH?

119
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,441
OPEN THE DOOR.

120
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:43,374
HERE WE GO.

121
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,608
HELLO? LOOK.
THEIR SHOES ARE HERE.

122
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,574
MOM? DAD?

123
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,041
NO ONE'S ANSWERING.

124
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,341
MAYBE THEY'RE OUT.

125
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,574
I WONDER
WHERE THEY'VE GONE.

126
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,074
MAYBE THEY WENT
TO DIGIWORLD.

127
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:00,974
THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

128
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,208
HEY, TAI, OVER HERE.

129
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,208
I'M THIRSTY.

130
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,874
SORRY,
IT'S THE LAST ONE.

131
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:08,374
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED
BEFORE I STARTED DRINKING IT.

132
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,374
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D BE SO STINGY!

133
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,041
I WAS JUST JOKING,
CRYBABY.

134
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:13,274
REALLY?

135
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:15,308
I LEFT YOU HALF OF IT.

136
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:20,041
I SURE WISH I KNEW
WHERE MY FAMILY WAS

137
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:22,674
AND HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN GONE.

138
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,008
HUH? AHA!

139
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,841
DON'T SCARE ME
LIKE THAT!

140
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,108
IT'S BEEN RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

141
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,808
TODAY'S AUGUST 1st --
THE DAY WE LANDED IN DIGIWORLD.

142
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,008
WE'VE GONE BACK
IN TIME?

143
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,974
THIS IS THE DAY THE DIGIVICES
DROPPED INTO OUR HANDS

144
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,141
AND THIS CRAZY ADVENTURE BEGAN.

145
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:42,141
THIS IS ALSO THE DAY
MOM AND DAD WERE PLANNING

146
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,608
TO VISIT MY GRANDMOTHER,
WHO LIVES OUTSIDE THE CITY.

147
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:47,108
SEE, MY MOM MARKED THE DATE
ON THIS CALENDAR

148
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:48,774
SO SHE WOULDN'T FORGET.

149
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:51,341
THEY MUST HAVE TAKEN
MY SISTER KARI WITH THEM.

150
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,341
THAT'S WHY NOBODY'S HOME NOW.
COOL!

151
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:56,408
LET'S JUST KICK BACK AND WAIT
FOR THEM TO COME HOME.

152
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,408
SPEAKING OF TIME,
IT'S TIME TO EAT.

153
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,941
HOLD YOUR DIGIHORSES.

154
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:02,941
I'VE JUST LEARNED I'M RELIVING
A DAY I'VE ALREADY LIVED.

155
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,041
SORRY, TAI.

156
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,041
NO, I'M SORRY.

473
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,354
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I KNOW YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

474
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:57,020
I REALLY DO. OKAY?

475
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,320
OKAY.

476
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,320
AGUMON CAN'T DIGIVOLVE
WITHOUT ME.

477
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,254
THIS IS MY FIGHT, TOO.

478
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:09,654
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

479
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:22,487
GOODBYE, KARI.

480
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,020
<i>IT WAS REALLY HARD</i>

481
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,020
<i>TO WATCH KARI</i>
<i>AS I FLOATED AWAY,</i>

482
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:35,920
<i>BUT THERE WAS NO WAY</i>
<i>I COULD HAVE TAKEN HER WITH ME.</i>

483
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,920
<i>I KNEW IT WAS WAY TOO RISKY.</i>

484
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:40,920
<i>MOM WOULD HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>REALLY MAD AT ME IF I HAD,</i>

485
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:42,920
<i>BUT WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW</i>

486
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:47,120
<i>IS THAT KARI WOULD SOON FIND</i>
<i>HER OWN WAY TO DIGIWORLD.</i>

487
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,420
Tai: AGUMON,
WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS.

488
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:54,420
NOW WE'VE GOT TO DECIDE
WHAT OUR FIRST MOVE IS.

489
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,520
WELL, WE HAVE TO FIND
OUR FRIENDS.

490
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:58,520
THEN WE HAVE
TO MAKE SURE

491
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,554
YOU AND THE OTHERS
GET HOME SAFELY.

492
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:02,687
NOT UNTIL WE CONQUER
ALL THE EVIL DIGIMON.

493
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,887
OTHERWISE, NEITHER ONE OF
OUR WORLDS WILL EVER BE SAFE.
