00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:04,948
Matt: <i>METALSEADRAMON</i>
<i>HAD FOLLOWED US</i>
<i>FROM THE UNDERWATER CHANNELS</i>

2
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:07,782
<i>AND WAS NOW IN A FIERCE BATTLE</i>
<i>WITH OUR DIGIS.</i>

3
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,982
<i>IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF IT,</i>
<i>HE RELEASED HIS RIVER OF POWER</i>

4
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:13,415
<i>AND HIT WHAMON</i>
<i>WITH A DEVASTATING BLAST.</i>

5
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:16,682
<i>WARGREYMON HAD NO OTHER CHOICE</i>
<i>BUT TO USE HIS TERRAFORCE</i>

6
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:19,115
<i>TO FINALLY PUT AN END</i>
<i>TO METALSEADRAMON.</i>

7
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:22,082
<i>SADLY, OUR FRIEND WHAMON</i>
<i>WAS RECONFIGURED AS WELL.</i>

8
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,215
<i>AS THE OCEAN</i>

<i>WE TOOK IT AS A SIGN</i>

10
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,948
<i>THAT THINGS</i>
<i>MIGHT GET BACK TO NORMAL.</i>

Joe: MATT! HEY, MATT!

36
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:37,015
Sora: MATT, WHERE ARE YOU?

37
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,182
I'M WORRIED.

38
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,082
WHAT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO HIM, TAI?

39
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:42,915
MATT'S A BIG BOY.
HE CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

40
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,415
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,415
WHAT IF HE WAS
KIDNAPPED BY PUPPETMON?

42
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,982
YEAH, OR
SOMETHING WORSE.

43
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:51,948
NO, IT WASN'T
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

44
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:53,915
All: HUH?

45
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,882
Tai: HOW
DO YOU KNOW?

46
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,148
<i>COME ON, LET'S GO.</i>

47
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:00,548
Tai: WHAT? HE JUST
WALKED AWAY,

48
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:03,382
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
TRY TO STOP HIM?

49
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,648
WELL, NO.
WAS I SUPPOSED TO?

50
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:09,715
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GO
USE THE BUSHES OR SOMETHING.

51
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,582
HUH. THIS IS WEIRD.

52
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,582
IT'S ONE THING
IF HE WAS KIDNAPPED,

53
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,582
BUT WHY WOULD HE
DISAPPEAR LIKE THIS?

54
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,582
HE'S BEEN GONE TOO LONG
FOR JUST A POTTY BREAK.

55
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,782
WAIT A MINUTE.

56
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:21,748
HAS MATT BEEN
KIND OF STRANGE LATELY?

57
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,582
Izzy: HE HAS BEEN
ACTING HIGH-STRUNG.

58
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:25,948
<i>AAH!</i>

59
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:28,848
REMEMBER WHEN GABUMON HAD
THAT DIGEVOLVING PROBLEM?

60
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,882
YEAH, I BET
THERE'S A CONNECTION.

61
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:35,382
KARI, WHAT IS IT?

62
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,382
I THOUGHT I HEARD A VOICE.

63
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:38,582
WAS IT MATT'S?

64
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:40,048
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

65
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:43,115
COME ON, KARI, DON'T
YOU START LOSING IT, TOO.

66
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,948
HE COULDN'T BE FAR AWAY.
WE SHOULD LOOK FOR HIM.

67
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:49,282
YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

68
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:52,315
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GO.

69
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:58,682
GATOMON, IT WASN'T
MATT'S VOICE I HEARD.

70
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,848
WHOSE WAS IT?

71
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:04,215
Gabumon: MATT, COME ON.

72
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:06,215
I'M ALL FOR EXERCISE,

73
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:08,148
BUT I'M NOT BUILT
FOR LONG DISTANCES.

74
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,615
MATT, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

75
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,082
JUST AWAY.
I NEED SOME SPACE.

76
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,582
Puppetmon: HA HA HA!

77
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:17,415
OH, THE POOR LITTLE KID
NEEDS A LITTLE SPACE,

78
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,748
FAR AWAY FROM HIS LITTLE
FRIENDS AND CLOSER TO ME.

79
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,682
Cherrymon:
I AGREE COMPLETELY.

80
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:25,515
I'M NOT WAITING. I'LL
PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.

81
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:27,915
THOSE DIGIDESTINED KIDS
REALLY BUG ME.

82
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:29,748
WAIT A MINUTE, PUPPETMON.

83
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:33,048
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

84
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,015
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE
OTHER DIGIDESTINED CHILDREN,

85
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,015
BUT AS FOR THIS ONE,

86
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,515
LEAVE HIM TO ME.

87
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:43,348
I'LL HAVE HIM CLIMBING UP A TREE
BEFORE I'M THROUGH WITH HIM.

88
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,248
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

89
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:53,660
YOU EVER FELT LIKE
A FIFTH WHEEL, GABUMON?

90
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,760
THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE.

91
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,760
ALL THIS TIME,
I THOUGHT I HAD,

92
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,760
LIKE, A PURPOSE,
YOU KNOW?

93
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:02,260
TO LOOK OUT
FOR MY LITTLE BROTHER.

94
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:04,460
I THOUGHT T.K. WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO SURVIVE

95
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,293
WITHOUT ME
WATCHING OVER HIM.

96
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:10,027
BUT SUDDENLY,
IT'S LIKE HE'S GROWING UP.

97
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,593
HE DOESN'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

98
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,727
OH, AND IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

99
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:16,660
IT'S EVERYBODY, MAN.

100
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:21,127
WHEN I THINK OF TAI AND MIMI
AND SORA AND THE OTHERS,

101
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,627
THIS PLACE HAS CHANGED THEM
FOR THE BETTER.

102
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,127
THEY'RE STRONGER NOW.

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,693
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'VE
DIGEVOLVED OR SOMETHING.

104
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,293
BUT YOU SEE,
THE PROBLEM IS I HAVEN'T.

105
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:33,460
I'M STILL STUCK
IN THE SAME PLACE.

106
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,293
I HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

107
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:38,660
YOU MAY NOT SEE IT, MATT,
BUT YOU'VE CHANGED A LOT.

108
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,060
OH, PLEASE, GABUMON,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

109
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,127
I'M THE SAME JERK
I ALWAYS WAS.

110
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,727
HEY, COME ON.

111
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,193
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN --
NOT THIS WAY.

112
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:49,160
I'VE FINALLY GOT IT
FIGURED OUT.

113
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:52,127
IF I'M EVER GOING TO CHANGE,
I HAVE TO DO IT ON MY OWN.

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,793
ON MY OWN.
THE OTHERS CAN'T HELP ME.

115
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:58,793
Cherrymon:
WELL, WELL, WELL.

116
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,627
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE.

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,560
GREETINGS, NATURE LOVERS.

118
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:08,093
WHAT -- YOU MEAN YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN A TALKING TREE?

119
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:09,693
NOT MANY.

120
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,060
BE CAREFUL. THAT'S CHERRYMON,
LORD OF THE FOREST

121
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:16,160
AND THE BEST REASON
FOR THE EXISTENCE OF TERMITES.

122
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:18,660
STOP RIGHT THERE, OR I'LL
TURN YOU INTO TOOTHPICKS.

123
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,627
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE THAT RUDE.

124
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,627
CALM DOWN. MY FIGHTING
DAYS ARE OVER.

125
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,593
I ONLY WANT TO TALK WITH YOU.

126
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:28,560
IN FACT, YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY
I'VE TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF.

127
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,793
HA HA HA HA!

128
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,793
Izzy: OH,
IT'S NO USE.

129
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,260
I'M GETTING NOTHING.

130
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,727
FOR SOME REASON,

131
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,227
THE DIGEVICES AREN'T
WORKING IN THIS FOREST.

132
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,693
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SO SURE WE
SHOULD BE TRYING TO FIND HIM.

133
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,193
EVERYONE NEEDS
TO BE ALONE SOMETIMES.

134
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:48,060
I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM
BREAK UP THIS TEAM.

135
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,660
WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM.

136
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,727
WE'RE ALWAYS WALKING AROUND,
SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE.

137
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,627
I'VE NEVER DONE
SO MUCH WALKING.

138
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,127
YEAH, IT'S DISGUSTING.

139
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,627
MY CALVES ARE STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE A BODYBUILDER'S.

140
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,027
LIKE A WHAT?

141
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,027
OH, MIMI.

142
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,493
Puppetmon: YOO-HOO!

143
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,427
Sora: HUH?

144
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,160
Tai: PUPPETMON?

145
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,360
HI, EVERYBODY!

146
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:07,393
HEY, T.K.,
DID YOU MISS ME?

147
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:11,360
NO, AND I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY
WITH YOU ANYMORE, EITHER!

148
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,360
NO?

149
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:13,360
WELL, FINE.

150
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,327
YOU'RE NOT
A LOT OF FUN, ANYWAY.

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,827
FRONT AND CENTER, EVERYBODY!

152
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,827
YES, SIR!

153
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,793
YES, SIR!
YES, SIR!

154
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,293
Sora: UH-OH!
GARBAGEMON!

155
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,293
THEY'RE AS TOUGH
AS THEY ARE MEAN.

156
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,260
AND THEY DON'T
SMELL VERY GOOD, EITHER.

00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:14,784
BY DEFEATING HIM.

320
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:15,951
DON'T LISTEN.

321
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:17,884
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO CAUSE TROUBLE.

322
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,884
HE'S PLAYING GAMES
WITH YOUR MIND.

323
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,884
IT'S ALL PART
OF SOME KIND OF TRAP.

324
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,351
TAI IS YOUR FRIEND.

325
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,117
HE'S MY FRIEND, YEAH.

326
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:28,317
HE MAY NOT ALWAYS
ACT LIKE IT, BUT --

327
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,251
HE'S RIGHT.
TAI IS MY FRIEND.

328
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:32,284
YOU DON'T FIGHT
YOUR FRIENDS.

329
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:35,284
FRIEND? HA!
NOW THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

330
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:36,951
YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE

331
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,251
THAT SUCH A THING
REALLY EXISTS --

332
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:42,217
NOT IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS, ANYWAY.

333
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,951
HA HA HA HA HA!

334
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:47,451
HIT THE NAIL
ONE THE HEAD, DIDN'T I?

335
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,217
WHAT'S HE MEAN?

336
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:54,451
FRIENDSHIP,
LOYALTY, COMRADES --

337
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:56,451
FINE-SOUNDING WORDS,

338
00:13:56,484 --> 00:14:00,951
BUT THAT'S ALL THEY ARE --
WORDS, DELUSIONS.

339
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:04,117
AND YOU'RE WISE ENOUGH
TO SEE THAT NOW.

340
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,051
YOU KNOW THAT ULTIMATELY
THE ONLY PERSON

341
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,451
YOU CAN DEPEND ON
IS YOURSELF.

342
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:11,117
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MATT?

343
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,884
HE'S WRONG, ISN'T HE?

344
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,884
I DON'T KNOW.

345
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,717
I-I DON'T KNOW.

346
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,551
YOU DON'T?

347
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,051
ALL RIGHT THEN.

348
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:23,051
THAT'S ENOUGH
MOPING AROUND FOR NOW.

349
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,051
LOOK, KID, STOP STARING
AT YOUR SHOES.

350
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,551
THE CHOICE IN FRONT OF YOU
IS SIMPLE.

351
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,717
IF YOU TRULY WANT TO CHANGE
TO REACH YOUR FULL POTENTIAL,

352
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,484
YOU MUST DEFEAT TAI.

353
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,484
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR BE CONTENT

354
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:37,451
TO BE LIVE YOUR LIFE
FOLLOWING IN THE SHADOWS

355
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:39,051
OF HIM FOREVER.

356
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:44,217
WHAT A CHOICE.
WHAT DO I DO?

357
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,851
OH, WHAT DO I DO?

358
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,284
[ SOBBING ]

359
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,751
OH, THAT'S A LAUGH.

360
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:55,751
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW
THAT MY CREST

361
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,217
HAD TO BE THE CREST
OF FRIENDSHIP?

362
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:03,184
MATT, THERE'S ONE THING
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT.

363
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:06,584
WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING
TO DO, DO IT.

364
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,584
BUT DO WHAT?

365
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,817
YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR
WHAT YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE

366
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:11,984
IS TELLING YOU

367
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:13,984
AND NOT LISTEN
TO ANYBODY ELSE --

368
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:15,984
NOT TAI
OR CHERRYMON OR ME.

369
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,551
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
FAITH IN YOURSELF.

370
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,551
WHAT IF I MAKE
THE WRONG DECISION?

371
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:24,651
I KNOW THAT WHATEVER IT IS,
IT WILL BE THE RIGHT ONE,

372
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:27,651
BECAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN YOU,

373
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:30,917
AND WHICHEVER PATH YOU TAKE,
I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU.

374
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,884
YOU MEAN THAT?

375
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,484
MM-HMM.

376
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,484
YOU DO HAVE A FRIEND.
NEVER FORGET THAT.

377
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:40,451
I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE,
MATT, NO MATTER WHAT.

STILL, I'M SURPRISED
BY THE STRENGTH

I MEANT
WHAT I SAID, MATT.

400
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,284
CHERRYMON WAS WRONG.
FRIENDSHIP, LOYALTY --

401
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,251
THEY'RE MORE
THAN JUST WORDS.

402
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,217
THEY'RE REAL,
AND THEY MATTER.

403
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,117
I'M GOING
TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

404
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:05,684
YUCK! SPLATTERING ME
WITH THEIR GUNK.

405
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:08,017
THOSE BUCKET BRAINS
WILL PAY FOR THIS.

406
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:09,517
THERE YOU ARE.

407
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:12,184
THE PLAN WENT PERFECTLY,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

408
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:13,517
PLAN? WHAT PLAN?

409
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,017
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

410
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,684
I PLAYED THAT TRUSTING SAP
LIKE A VIOLIN.

411
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,484
HE'S GOING TO DO
OUR DIRTY WORK FOR US.

412
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,451
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

413
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:24,517
ANY SECOND NOW,
WE'LL HEAR THE SOUNDS

414
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,517
OF WARGREYMON
AND METALGARURUMON

415
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,017
LOCKED IN MORTAL COMBAT.

416
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,417
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

417
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:32,417
OH, YEAH. WITH ANY LUCK,
THEY'LL DESTROY EACH OTHER.

418
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,417
WITH THE TWO STRONGEST
DIGIMON OUT OF THE WAY,

419
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,684
THE REST WILL FALL
LIKE ROTTEN FRUIT.

420
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,017
MORTAL COMBAT?
THIS I'VE GOT TO SEE.

421
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,384
LET'S GO.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

422
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,851
WAIT A MINUTE.
WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

423
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:48,084
THE DIGIDESTINED ARE STRONG,
STRONGER THAN I SUSPECTED,

424
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,884
AND TO UNDERESTIMATE THEM
COULD BE DISASTROUS.

425
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,851
WHAT? ARE YOU SAYING
I MIGHT LOSE?

426
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,017
I'M ONLY SAYING
THAT I THINK

427
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,317
YOU SHOULD
TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.

428
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,017
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THEM.

429
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,317
SOMETHING?

430
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:05,717
HMM, YOU MEAN LIKE SOMETHING
I MIGHT BE MISSING?

431
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,684
WELL, NOT TOTALLY.

432
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:10,951
I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU!

433

434
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:16,517
OH, THE HORROR!

435
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:19,617
HUH? MAN, THAT KIND
OF NEGATIVE ATTITUDE

436
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:21,551
REALLY BRINGS ME DOWN.

437
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:24,451
OKAY, OKAY,
I KNOW WHEN I'M BEAT!

438
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:27,417
YOU WIN! I SURRENDER!

439
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,384

HA HA HA HA HA!

440

TRASH DAY!
EVERYBODY IN THE CAN.

441
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,951
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU'LL GET RECYCLED.

442
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,184
All: NO!

443
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,584
THIS NASTY LITTLE CREEP'S

444
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,051
REALLY STARTING TO GET
ON MY NERVES.

445
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,517
TAI, HELP ME!
KARI!

446
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:44,984
KARI -- NO!

452
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,536
MATT!

453
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,036
MATT, YOU'RE BACK!

454
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,970
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
WHERE YOU BEEN, BUDDY?

455
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,836
THANKS FOR SAVING
OUR NECKS,

456
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,470
BUT DID YOU HAVE
TO CUT IT THAT CLOSE?

457
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:16,836
AAH!

458
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,936
HUH? WHAT'S HE DOING?

459
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,503
HEY, WHAT IS THIS?

460
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,903
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S A CHALLENGE.

461
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:25,370
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO DIGEVOLVE, AND FAST.

462
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:28,336
WHAT HAVE BEEN EATING
OUT THERE IN THE FOREST?

463
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,870
YOU WANT TO FIGHT ME?

464
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,836
THIS IS INSANE.
IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

465
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,836
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING,
BUT CALL HIM OFF NOW.

466
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,803
NO, TAI, I WON'T.

467
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:45,170
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
YOU WON'T?

468
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,836
I'M WARNING YOU.

469
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,770
HURRY UP AND DIGEVOLVE
INTO WARGREYMON,

470
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,770
BECAUSE I WON'T MISS
NEXT TIME.

471
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:53,736
I THINK
HE REALLY MEANS IT.

472
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,170
WELL, TIME'S
RUNNING OUT, AGUMON.

473
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:00,270
TAI, STOP HIM!

474
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:03,903
WISH I COULD, BUT THERE'S
ONLY ONE PERSON

475
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,503
WHO CAN STOP HIM.
