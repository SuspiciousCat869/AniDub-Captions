00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:37,557
DIGITAL MONSTERS.
EXACTLY WHO CAME UP
WITH THAT NAME ANYWAY?

159
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,990
JUST CALL US DIGIMON,
WE LIKE THAT.

160
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,023
I ONLY ASK, BECAUSE
YOUR COMPOSITION

161
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:43,390
ISN'T AT ALL
MACHINE-LIKE.

162
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:45,090
OH, REALLY?

163
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:46,190
HEY, WATCH IT!

164
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,857
SO, PATAMON,
CAN YOU REALLY FLY?

165
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,557
OF COURSE.

166
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,657
WOW, THAT'S COOL,

167
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,757
BUT YOU'RE GOING
THE WRONG WAY.

168
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,923
I'M FASTER THAN THAT.
WATCH.

169
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,890
WOULDN'T IT BE FASTER
TO WALK? HUH?

170
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:03,257
PALMON, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO ASK,
WHO DOES YOUR HAIR?

171
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,590
IT'S NATURAL.
I WAKE UP IN THE
MORNING LIKE THIS.

172
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,690
WOW, MAYBE YOU CAN
LET ME WORK WITH IT.

173
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:10,190
DO YOU THINK YOU PUT
TOO MUCH EMPHASIS
ON APPEARANCE?

174
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,157
WELL, HONESTLY I'VE NEVER
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

175
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,623
HONESTLY, I KIND
OF LIKE MY HAIR
THE WAY IT IS.

176
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:20,690
ONCE I GET BACK,
THIS IS GONNA MAKE
ONE GREAT STORY, YEP.

177
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:25,590
BUT, OF COURSE,
NOT A SINGLE SOUL
WILL EVER BELIEVE ME.

178
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:29,457
THAT KUWAGAMON
BACK THERE,
HE WAS HUGE.

179
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,557
AND HE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

180
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,523

LISTEN, WHAT'S THAT?

185
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,123
A PHONE.

186
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:49,190
EITHER THAT

WHY'D IT STOP
RINGING, TAI?

193

T.K.:
MY THEORY IS ALIENS.

196
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,890
THEY'VE SET THESE PHONE
BOOTHS OUT AS A TRAP.

197
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:16,323
Matt: IF WE COULD FIND
A PLACE THAT DELIVERS,
LET'S ORDER PIZZA.

198
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,490
Mimi: WHATEVER YOU GET,
NO ANCHOVIES FOR ME.

199
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,923
Sora: THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT ARE THESE DOING HERE
AT THE BEACH?

200
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:23,890
SO PEOPLE CAN
CALL THEIR PARENTS

201
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:26,223

THAT'S IT,
I'M OUTTA HERE.

203
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:33,657
DOES ANYBODY HAVE
ANY LOOSE CHANGE?

204
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,990
WHY?

205
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,890
OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA
MAKE A PHONE CALL
TO GET SOME HELP.

206
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:41,657
AH, USE MY PHONE CARD.
THE ALIENS CAN BILL ME.

207
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,890

217
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,090

221
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:12,157
Third Operator:

THAT ONE OVER THERE?

226
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,957

00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:35,190
I GOT A STRANGE FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

232
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:44,928
MAYBE THIS ONE WILL.

233
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,461
Operator:

00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,761

DOES JOE ALWAYS
BEHAVE LIKE THIS?

00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,195
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

239
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,519
NO MATTER WHAT NUMBER
OR HOW MANY TIMES
HE DIALS,

240
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,319
THOSE PHONES
AREN'T GONNA WORK.

241
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,652
WELL, I'M GONNA KEEP
SEARCHING FOR A BOAT
OR SOMETHING.

242
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:06,652
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

243
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,752
EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T
CALL OUT OF HERE,

244
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:10,352
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
SOMEONE ELSE

245
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:13,019
MIGHT BE ABLE
TO CALL INTO US.

246
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:15,585
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME
DOING NOTHING
BUT SITTING HERE.

247
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,619
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
AND SEE IF ANYONE CALLS.

248
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,552
BESIDES, EVERYONE
COULD USE A LITTLE REST.

249
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,019
[ALL GROANING]

250
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,952
AND I'M GETTING
PRETTY HUNGRY, TOO.

251
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,052
YOU KNOW WHY?

252
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,485
BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T EATEN
ANYTHING ALL DAY.

253
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,785
OK, BREAK TIME,

254
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,352
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE ANY FOOD?

255
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,752
I THINK THE ONLY THING
I HAVE IS...HUH?

256
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,485
IT'S THAT GADGET THAT
FELL OUT OF THE SKY
AT CAMP.

257
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,185
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT
THOSE WEIRD GISMOS.

258
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,052
IF ANYBODY'S
GOT A PINK ONE,
I'LL TRADE.

259
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,252
WHAT ARE THEY ANYWAY?

260
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,019
WE WOULDN'T
HAVE THEM IF THEY
WEREN'T IMPORTANT.

261
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:55,152
IF I COULD
TAKE MINE APART...

262
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:57,119
UM, THAT IS,
AFTER I GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

263
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,419
I'M REALLY FAMISHED.

264
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:01,285

266
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:05,819
BUT THAT'S ABOUT
ALL I'VE GOT.

267
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:09,785
I HAVE MY TRUSTY
LAPTOP COMPUTER
AND A DIGITAL CAMERA.

268
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,252
OH, AND I'VE GOT
A SMALL CELL PHONE, TOO.

269
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:15,585
OF COURSE,
NOT ONE OF THEM'S WORKED
SINCE WE GOT HERE.

270
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:17,119
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DRAGGED

271
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:19,185
ALL THAT
COMPUTER STUFF
TO SUMMER CAMP.

272
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,385
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

273
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:24,252
UH, LET'S SEE.
THERE'S MY
MINI-TELESCOPE.

274
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,785
SORRY, BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO EAT EITHER.

275
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,652
HEY,
LOOK AT WHAT I GOT.

276
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,685
CHECK IT OUT.

277
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:34,152
WOW, LOOK AT
ALL THOSE GOODIES!

278
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:35,785
WHY DON'T YOU BE
A GOOD LITTLE BOY

279
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,619
AND SHARE THOSE TREATS
WITH DEAR SWEET MIMI?

280
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:39,619
AWW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SO NICE, MIMI.

281
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,119
I'M HAPPY TO SHARE.
YOU'RE THE BEST.
ISN'T SHE CUTE?

282
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,152
FORGET IT.

283
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,285
I'M SO HUNGRY
I COULD EAT A HORSE.

284
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,785
I'D SETTLE
FOR A SMALL COW.

285
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,052
MIMI, WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT IN THAT BIG BAG?

286
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,685
SOME HAIRBRUSHES
AND MAKEUP?

287
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,652
UH, WELL,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

288
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:56,752
HERE'S A COMPASS,
COOKING FUEL, FLASHLIGHT,

289
00:11:56,785 --> 00:12:00,052
ONE OF THOSE KNIVES
WITH ALL THE THINGS
AND SOME OTHER STUFF.

290
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,252
[ALL GASP]

291
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,019
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU HAD A COMPASS

292
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,019
BACK WHEN
WE NEEDED ONE?

293
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,585
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
KIND OF FUN TO SEE

294
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,419
HOW FAR WE COULD GET
WITHOUT ONE.
BESIDES, IT'S BROKEN.

295
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,752
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR FINDING OUR WAY
OUT OF HERE.

296
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:15,385
ALTHOUGH, WE COULD USE
THE COOKING FUEL
TO MAKE A SIGNAL FIRE.

297
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,352
THAT'S TRUE, OR I GUESS
WE CAN BARBECUE
SOME TELEPHONES.

298
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,652
OH, BOY,
CHECK OUT THE GENIUS.

299
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:24,885
SEE, HE'S TRYING
TO CALL THE TELEPHONE
REPAIR MAN

300
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,552
BECAUSE THE TELEPHONES
DON'T WORK.

301
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:29,252
PROBLEM IS--LOOK!

302
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:30,985
JOE'S GOT
THE EMERGENCY FOOD.

303
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,219
NO WAY.

304
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,219
Tai: JOE! HEY, JOE, LOOK,
YOU'VE GOT ALL THE FOOD.

305
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,819
HEY, DON'T YOU KNOW
IT'S RUDE TO
INTERRUPT SOMEONE

306
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,385
WHEN THEY'RE
