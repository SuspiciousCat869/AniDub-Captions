Sora:
<i>WE WERE STILL IN THE DESERT</i>
<i>TRYING AVOID ETEMON</i> <i>AND HIS DARK NETWORK</i>
<i>WHEN A BIG SHIP PULLED UP.</i>

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,200
<i>WE GOT ON BOARD</i>
<i>AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE--</i>

3
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:09,600
<i>AT LEAST WE THOUGHT SO--</i>

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,100
<i>BUT THE SHIP WAS JUST A TRAP</i>
<i>SET UP BY KAKATREEMON.</i>

5
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,766
<i>HE USED HIS PETRIFIER</i>
AND TURNED SOME OF US TO STONE!

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,666
<i>FORTUNATELY,</i>
NOTHING BEATS A GOOD DIGIVOLVE!

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,600
<i>WE SENT KAKATREEMON FLYING</i>

8
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:23,466
<i>AND A WELL-PLACED CACTUS</i>
<i>TOOK CARE OF THE SHIP.</i>

DON'T YOU THINK?

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,366
MAYBE FOR A SCORPION.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,933
Mimi:
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT, JOE?

38
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:47,266
EVERY CREST WE'VE FOUND SO FAR
HAS BEEN DIFFERENT.

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,533
YEAH--BUT WE NEED
TO LEARN HOW TO USE THEM.

40
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,700
OR OUR DIGIMON COULD DIGIVOLVE
ALL MESSED UP, RIGHT?

41
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:57,800
Matt:
BUT NONE OF THAT REALLY MATTERS
UNTIL WE FIND ALL THE CRESTS.

42
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,466
HMM--I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT ONE.

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,266
MAYBE THE CREST POWER
COMES FROM HAVING THEM <i>ALL.</i>

HEY! WE GOTTA MOVE ON.

47
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,500
IF WE'RE GONNA
TAKE SOME DOWNTIME,

WE NEED TO FIND SOME SHADE!

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,433
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
A SERIOUS DIGICONVERSATION

AND YOU MADE ME FORGET
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

51

YOU FIND THE SHADE--
WE'LL CATCH UP.

WHAT IF
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME,

WHAT IF I CAN'T
BECOME GREYMON?

76

I AM NO ENEMY, NOPE, NOPE--

<i>BUT FEW HAVE EVER MET HIM.</i>

THE GREAT DIGIMON FIGHTERS!

YEP, YEP--
WITHOUT MY SPEARS AND MAGIC,

107
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:51,578
KUWAGAMON WOULD BE EATING YOU

BUT HE <i>DID</i>
SAVE AGUMON AND ME--

131
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,011
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT

HE DIDN'T HAVE A BLACK GEAR
ANYWHERE ON HIM--I CHECKED.

IT'S AN HONOR TO BE CHOSEN
BY PIXIMON FOR TRAINING.

136
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,678
Mimi:
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,645
Sora:
HE'S RIGHT THOUGH--
WE COULD USE SOME HELP.

138
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:58,911
Tai:
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

139
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:01,245
JUST 'CAUSE' WE'VE
NEARLY BEEN EATEN 100 TIMES!

140
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,578
Matt:

FOR DIRECTIONS?
