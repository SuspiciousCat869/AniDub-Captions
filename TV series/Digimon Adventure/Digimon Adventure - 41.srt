SHELLMON'S BREATH WAS GNARLY.

00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:17,084
IT WAS A RARE PLEASURE
KNOWING YOU --

347
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,584
MEDIUM RARE.

WHO'S THE HOT-TEMPERED
FOUL-MOUTH WHO --

352
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,984
OH, IT WAS YOU, BOSS.

353
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:33,751
OKAY. NO PROBLEM.

354
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,851
HUH? NO! NO!

355
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,584
THEY'RE GONE!

357
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:45,851
SCORPIOMON,
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

358
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:48,084
WELL, YOU SEE,
THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

359
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,317
SILENCE!

360
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:50,817
YOU FAILED ME,

361
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:53,584
AND I WILL NOT
FORGIVE FAILURE!

362
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:54,984
NO, I DIDN'T THINK THAT --

Sora: THEY'RE GONE. WHEW.
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

365
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,984
Tai: BUT WE CAME OUT
OF IT OKAY.

366
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,384
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

367
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,351
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS --
EVERYTHING'S NOT OKAY.

368

MIMI'S RIGHT.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

370
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,351
THE DIGIMON STILL
MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH.

371
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:22,351
BOTH OF OURS
HAD TO DIGEVOLVE AGAIN

372

BEFORE THEY COULD BEAT
SCORPIOMON,

AND HE WAS A FLUNKY.

374

FRANKLY, IT'S HARD TO SEE
HOW THEY STAND A CHANCE

375
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,751
AGAINST A FULLY DIGEVOLVED
MONSTER LIKE METALSEADRAMON.

MAYBE PIXIMON
MEANT SOMETHING ELSE

WHEN HE SAID
WE WERE MISSING SOMETHING.

378
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,017
WHATEVER THE SECRET IS,
WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT

379
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:39,451
IF WE EVER HOPE
TO SAVE THE WORLD.
