00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,431

Tai:
WHAT IS IT, IZZY?
SOME KIND OF POWER GENERATOR?

35
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,533
Izzy:
EVEN BETTER--ETEMON HAS
HARD-WIRED THE ENTIRE DESERT,

36
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,533
CREATING
AN EXTENSIVE COMPUTER NETWORK.

37
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,666
MY GUESS, THIS IS ONE OF HIS
REMOTE DATE ACCESS TERMINALS.

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,966
GREAT, LET'S CRASH IT!

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,833
IT COULD BE A BOOBY TRAP.

40
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,066
IF IT IS ETEMON'S,
I SAY WE CROSS THE WIRES

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,800
AND MESS IT UP GOOD!

42
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,433
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH THAT?

43
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,633
I WONDER,

44
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,400
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

45
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,600
THAT OUR COMPUTERS
HAVE COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS.

46
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,266
AND IF THEY DO,
I CAN TAP INTO ETEMON'S NETWORK.

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,033
HEY, YOU HAVE MAIL!

48
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:07,033
THAT WAS QUICK,
WHO EVEN KNOWS I'VE LOGGED ON?

49
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,733
Joe:
OH NO, IT'S ETEMON!

50
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,666
Tai:
OPEN IT,
IT'S PROBABLY JUST SPAM.

51
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,466
Computer:
HELP ME! S-O-S!

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,133
MAYDAY!
I AM BEING HELD PRISONER!

53
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,966
HELP ME AND I'LL GUIDE YOU
TO THE CRESTS YOU SEEK!

WHOA!!

55
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,433
Sora:
IS HE FOR REAL?
I MEAN, WHO COULD IT BE?

56
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:27,900
Etemon:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE SYSTEM'S DOWN?

57
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,533
I DON'T WANT EXCUSES!

58
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,200
I WANT THOSE STUPID KIDS
LOCATED NOW!!

59
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:36,100
YES, OH MIGHTY ETEMON,
MOST MAJESTIC ROYAL ONE.

60
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,166
THE PROBLEM IS,
WE GOT A GLITCH

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,766
IN THE PYRAMID HOST COMPUTER.

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,166
DATAMON...

63
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,233
TAKE ME THERE IN A HURRY,
YOU FLOPPY-EARED FREAKS!

64
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,833
LET'S ROLL!

65
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:56,295
Joe:
I DON'T LIKE THIS,
NOT ONE LITTLE BIT, I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT
OR THE SMELL OF IT,

66
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:57,361
I DON'T LIKE THE--

67
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:58,534
Mimi:
DON'T HAVE A BRAIN CRAMP, JOE,

68
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,734
YOU'RE TURNING GREEN
AROUND THE EDGES.

69
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:04,167
Tai:
SOMEBODY ASKED FOR OUR HELP,
WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.

70
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:08,401
ACCORDING TO MY LAPTOP,
WE SHOULD BE GETTING CLOSE.

71
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,401
T.K.:
HEY, LOOK!

72
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:11,601
IT'S GLOWING!

73
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:12,867
OOH!

74
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,234
T.K., COME OVER HERE--
LOOK WHAT I FOUND!

75
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,034
Sora:
LOOK! ANOTHER CREST!

76
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,534
Tai:
WATCH IT!

77
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,601
( <i>groaning</i> )

78
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,467
AWESOME! MY OWN CREST!

79
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,001
CONGRATULATIONS!

80
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,634
Matt:
DON'T THINK THIS MEANS
YOU GET TO STAY UP ANY LATER.

81
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,734
Izzy:
SORA'S CREST IS
THE ONLY ONE LEFT TO FIND.

82
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,367
IF WE RESCUE THIS GUY,
MAYBE HE CAN LEAD US TO IT.

83
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,001
WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
TO THE RESCUE!!

84
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,201
Mimi:
OH! WHAT'S THAT?!

85
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:51,667
All:
HUH?

86
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:58,001
Izzy:
SEE THESE HIEROGLYPHS?
LOOK FAMILIAR?

87
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,501
THIS IS DEFINITELY

88
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,001
THE SAME WRITING
WE'VE COME ACROSS BEFORE.

89
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,467
WAIT A SECOND...
THIS IS A NEW ONE.

90
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,567
All:
OH!

91
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,701
PRODIGIOUS!
THIS IS AMAZING!

92
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,434
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING?

93
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,901
Mimi:
I HAVE A FEELING
YOU'RE GONNA TELL US.

94
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,634
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE

95
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,001
THAT THESE HIEROGLYPHS ARE NOT
A FORM OF WRITING AT ALL...

96
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,601
BUT RATHER CODE,
COMPUTER CODE.

97
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,734
CHANGE A PIECE OF THE CODE,
THEN YOU CHANGE THE PROGRAM.

98
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,167
All:
WHOA!

99
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,501
LIKE THAT, FOR EXAMPLE.

100
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:29,267
WAIT...ARE YOU TELLING US

101
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,901
THAT THIS WHOLE PLACE
IS SOME KIND OF COMPUTER GAME,

102
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,867
AND THAT NONE OF IT
IS REALLY REAL?

103
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,401
IT'S REAL, ALL RIGHT.

104
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:37,601
HUH?

105
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,801
YOU KNOW,
I'M THINKING EVERYTHING WE SEE

106
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,534
AND EVERYONE WE MEET
IN THIS PLACE

107
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,634
ARE ACTUALLY PIECES OF DATA
OR PROGRAMMING,

108
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,934
GIVEN PHYSICAL FORM.

109
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,801
IF YOU'RE RIGHT

110
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,301
AND THIS WHOLE THING IS
ONE BIG COMPUTER,

111
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,067
THEN HOW DID WE GET HERE?

112
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,734
DID WE SQUEEZE IN
THROUGH THE FLOPPY DRIVE?

113
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,067
NO, WE'RE JUST
KILOBYTES OF DATA TOO--

114
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,467
I MEAN THE VERSIONS OF US
THAT ARE IN HERE.

115
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,901
IF I'M JUST DATA...

116
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:00,901
WHY DO I STILL FEEL LIKE
I'M FLESH AND BLOOD?

117
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,334
AND I STILL HAVE TO GO TO
THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM.

118
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,301
YOU DON'T REALLY,
YOU JUST THINK YOU DO.

119
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,067
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT,
'CAUSE--

120
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:09,434
WHERE'S THE REAL US--
OUR FLESH AND BLOOD BODIES?

121
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,567
I DON'T KNOW...

122
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,767
I SUPPOSE WE'RE BACK AT
THE CAMPGROUNDS STILL.

123
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:14,967
( <i>gasping</i> )

124
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:17,301
Izzy:
YEAH, WE'RE ALIVE BACK THERE,

125
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,201
WE EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH OUR OTHER SELVES,

126
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,767
WE'RE IN
A PARALLEL DIGITAL UNIVERSE,

127
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,034
LIKE THE DIGIMON.

128
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:26,234
DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T HAVE TO
BRUSH MY TEETH ANYMORE?

129
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,101
WE'VE GOT BIGGER THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT NOW.

130
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:33,649
ALTHOUGH DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND DON'T STOP BRUSHING.

131
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:36,783
HEY...

132
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,396
WAIT A SECOND,
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

133
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:43,062
LET ME SEE, IF I CAN
JUST CRACK THIS PROGRAM...

134
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:47,096
Mimi:
HE'S IN COMPUTER-DORK MODE,
THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE.

135
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:51,396
All:
WHOA!!

136
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:52,896
I'VE CALLED UP

137
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:54,362
A HOLOGRAPHIC MAP
OF THE DIGIWORLD.

138
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,929
YOU CAN SEE THE SIMILARITIES
TO THE PLANET EARTH.

139
00:05:57,962 --> 00:06:01,596
IN FACT, THERE ARE A <i>LOT</i>
OF PARALLELS WITH OUR WORLD.

140
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,096
THAT'S TERRIFIC, IZZY.

141
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,129
GREAT TIME
FOR A GEOGRAPHY LESSON.

142
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,262
PAY ATTENTION,
YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.

143
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,629
YEAH?

144
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,462
IF I ENTER THE E-MAIL ADDRESS
OF THE PERSON WHO CONTACTED US,

145
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,196
I CAN FIND HIS LOCATION
IN THE DIGIWORLD HERE.

146
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:16,896
NOW, LOOK--

147
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:19,496
THAT E-MAIL ADDRESS IS FROM
A WEB DOMAIN IN <i>OUR WORLD...</i>

148
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,862
I'VE LOGGED ONTO IT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

149
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:23,362
IS THERE A POINT TO THIS
SOMEWHERE?

150
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:25,229
IS THE PERSON
WHO SENT THE MESSAGE

151
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,729
IN OUR WORLD,
OR THE DIGIWORLD?

152
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,462
THAT'S JUST IT--
HE'S IN BOTH!

153
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:31,529
LOOK,
THE DIGIWORLD'S ON THE LEFT,

154
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,462
THE WORLD WE KNOW
IS ON THE RIGHT,

155
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:36,429
AND IF I OVERLAY THEM LIKE SO...

156
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,396
THE WHITE LINES MATCH UP
PERFECTLY!

157
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,062
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

158
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,862
Mimi, tearfully:
REMINDS ME OF THE BALLS OF YARN
MY KITTY USED TO PLAY WITH!

159
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,862
THAT'S THE WORLD'S
DIGITAL NETWORK.

160
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,796
THROUGH THOSE LINES,
EVERY COMPUTER ON EARTH

161
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:48,362
IS CONNECTED TO
EVERY OTHER COMPUTER.

162
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,662
THE DIGIWORLD IS
A PHYSICAL EMBODIMENT

163
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:52,162
OF THE DATA
PASSING THROUGH THEM.

164
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:55,029
WE'RE SEEING SOMETHING
NOBODY ELSE HAS EVER SEEN,

165
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,129
THAT NOBODY EVEN KNOWS ABOUT:

166
00:06:57,162 --> 00:07:00,229
THE DIGITAL SHADOW WORLD
THAT EXISTS ALONGSIDE OUR OWN.

167
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:02,962
NOT JUST PARALLEL,
BUT PHYSICALLY LINKED,

168
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:06,129
SO EVERYTHING WE DO HERE
WILL HAVE EFFECTS ON THE OTHER.

169
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:07,329
Matt:
FOR REAL?

170
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:09,062
Joe:
INTENSE.

171
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,029
Izzy:
YEAH, AND HERE'S
THE COOLEST PART.

172
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,996
WHEREVER THIS PERSON IS
IN THE DIGIWORLD,

173
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,929
I THINK I CAN TAKE US THERE
JUST BY ENTERING

174
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,762
HIS E-MAIL ADDRESS
AND CLICKING ON IT--

175
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:19,229
LIKE ACCESSING A WEB PAGE.

176
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:23,696
HEY, ALL THIS TECHNO-TALK'S
MAKING MY HEAD SPINNY!

177
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,962
COMPUTER GUYS
CAN NEVER JUST DO SOMETHING,

178
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:28,062
THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY.

179
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,162
THEY'VE GOTTA SPEND ALL DAY
TELLING YOU HOW THEY'LL DO IT.

180
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,662
THIS IS DEPRESSING--

181
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:35,062
EVEN WHEN I'M COMPUTE DATA
I HAVE ALLERGIES.

182
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,896
Gomamon:
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

183
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,129
IF YOU WEREN'T HERE,
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE MET ME.

184
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,896
SORA, DOES THIS MEAN
THAT WE DON'T EXIST?

185
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,462
THAT WE'RE REALLY NOT FRIENDS?

186
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,296
OF COURSE NOT.

187
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,196
THIS MAY BE
A MAKE-BELIEVE WORLD,

188
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,329
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
OUR FRIENDSHIP ISN'T REAL.

189
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:53,096
TRUTHFULLY, I DON'T GET IT--
BUT IT SOUNDS RIGHT.

190
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,496
WHEREVER WE ARE,
WE'RE HERE,

191
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,429
SO LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NEXT.

192
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:00,029
COME ON, BRAINIAC,
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

193
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,229
OKAY, OKAY.

194
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,596
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CLICK ON
THE GUY'S E-MAIL ADDRESS,

195
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:06,762
AND THEN BINGO.

196
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:08,196
Mimi:
I HATE BINGO--

197
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,062
IT'S SO CONFUSING,
WITH ALL THOSE LETTERS AND--

198
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:13,962
HEY LOOK...A DOOR!

199
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,696
LAST ONE THROUGH'S
A ROTTEN EGG!

200
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,662
OUR ELECTRONIC PEN PAL
IS RIGHT OUT THERE.

201
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:21,162
OR IT COULD BE A TRAP.

202
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:24,162
NO WAY--WE'RE JUST BITS OF DATA,
SO I UPLOADED US AS--

203
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:26,362
Sora:
OKAY, I BELIEVE YOU.

204
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:31,129
Tai:
WHOA, CHECK THIS OUT!

205
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,762
HEADS UP!
ETEMON AT 9 O'CLOCK!

206
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:37,996
IT'S THE DUMPSTER FOR YOU,
DATAMON,

207
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,162
YOU OLD PILE OF JUNK.

208
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:44,162
Joe:
UH, I THINK I LEFT THE WATER ON
BACK AT THE SPHINX.

209
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,629
Sora:
OKAY, TAI, YOU'RE RELIEVED.

210
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,529
Biyomon:
IT'S OUR TURN TO STAND WATCH.

211
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,662
Agumon:
FINALLY! IT'S NOT MUCH FUN
WATCHING A BUNCH OF ROCKS.

212
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,862
Tai:
I THOUGHT BEING IN
A COMPUTER CARTOON ADVENTURE

213
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:58,096
WOULD BE MORE FUN THAN THIS.

214
00:08:58,129 --> 00:08:59,529
ABOUT TOMORROW...

215
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:00,929
WHAT?

216
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:03,596
I'M WORRIED--
THAT ETEMON IS BAD NEWS.

217
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,196
IS IT REALLY WORTH IT
JUST TO FIND MY CREST?

218
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,062
SURE.

219
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,896
DON'T WORRY,
PIECE OF CAKE.

220
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,096
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

221
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:13,029
SPINNING THE UGLY MONKEY AROUND
BY HIS TAIL!

222
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,462
HEY COME ON,
SNAP OUT OF IT.

223
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,996
HUH?

224
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,396
IF IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE'S CREST
WE WERE GOING AFTER,

225
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,962
YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T
HESITATE FOR A SECOND.

226
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,396
OH...

227
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,196
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S JUST AFTER WHAT IZZY SAID--

228
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:32,629
YOU MEAN ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT US BEING

229
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:36,962
NOTHING BUT KILOBYTES
IN THE COMPUTER PROGRAM OF LIFE?

230
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,829
IT JUST MAKES US SEEM
SO SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT,

231
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,796
LIKE NOTHING WE DO
REALLY MATTERS.

232
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,696
OF COURSE IT MATTERS--

233
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,562
WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE
THAT IT DOESN'T.

234
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,691
Izzy:
REMEMBER, THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT
TO KEEP IN MIND.

235
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,779
THIS IS MORE THAN
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE,

236
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,546
IT'S A SHADOW WORLD,
PHYSICALLY LINKED TO OUR OWN,

237
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,012
AND ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE

238
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:03,679
CAN HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT
ON THINGS IN THE OTHER.

239
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:06,346
AND THE SAME THING
GOES FOR US, RIGHT?

240
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,612
WE'RE SHADOW VERSIONS
OF OUR OTHER SELVES?

241
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:11,146
RIGHT,
EXACT COMPUTER COPIES.

242
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,812
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS,
WE HAVE TO BE JUST AS CAREFUL

243
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,012
AS IF WE WERE STILL
OUR PHYSICAL SELVES.

244
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:17,979
Tai:
HEY! SOMETIME THIS YEAR!

245
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:20,779
YOU GUYS TALK MORE THAN
MY MOM'S BOOK CLUB.

246
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,246
CAN WE GO?

247
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,712
Izzy:
I GOT INTO THE PROGRAM

248
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:37,379
AND FOUND THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE
TO THE CENTER OF THE PYRAMID.

249
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,579
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT:
WE'RE ONLY GOING IN THERE

250
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,446
TO FIND THIS GUY
AND GET SORA HER CREST, RIGHT?

251
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,912
Tai:
RIGHT.

252
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,846
THAT MEANS NO FIGHTS
OR DANGEROUS STUFF.

253
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,846
YOU WHIMPER MORE THAN
MY PUPPY!

254
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,679
MATT, MIMI, T.K.,
STAY HERE AND STAND GUARD.

255
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:51,846
LET'S GO IN!

256
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,379
IF YOU REALLY
DON'T NEED ME...

257
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:56,312
I MISS YOU GUYS ALREADY.

258
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:57,912
WE'LL BE BACK IN TIME
TO EAT.

259
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,779
OR GET EATEN.

260
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:08,179
SEE YOU GUYS,
COME BACK AS SOON AS YOU CAN!

261
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,379
Tai:
OKAY, KEEP TOGETHER.

262
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,912
Izzy:
THERE'S A HIDDEN BACK DOOR
TO THE PROGRAM.

263
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:28,846
IT SHOULD BE
RIGHT UP AHEAD.

264
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,746
THAT'S FUNNY,
IT SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE.

265
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,412
Etemon:
WHERE'S
MY FRIED BANANA SANDWICH?

266
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,046
YOU KNOW I LIKE TO EAT
AFTER MY NAP!

267
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,379
HUH?

268
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:39,746
TAI, WHAT IS IT?!

269
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,746
IT'S ETEMON!

270
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,912
HUH!

271
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,479
WHO'S THERE?

272
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:46,412
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

273
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,946
QUITE, BIYOMON.

274
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,646
GRRR...

275
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:51,746
BOO!

276
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,346
GREAT,
NOW I'M HEARING THINGS.

277
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,446
YOO HOO!

278
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,746
HUH?

279
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,646
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
THIS PLACE EXTERMINATED.

280
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,512
BECAUSE SOMETHING'S
STARTING TO BUG ME!

281
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,079
WE'VE GOT HIM
TALKING TO HIMSELF!

282
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,046
REALLY FUNNY, TAI--
ARE YOU CRAZY?

283
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,746
WHAT IF YOU HAD
GOTTEN US CAUGHT?

284
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:14,912
BUT WE WEREN'T,
WERE WE?

285
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,712
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

286
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:19,912
I GUESS NEXT WE TRY TO FIND
A WAY THROUGH THESE WALLS.

287
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,246
THE TRICK IS
FINDING THE WEAK POINTS.

288
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,579
Agumon:
HEY, I FOUND ONE!

289
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:24,679
AH!

290
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:26,046
OW...

291
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,212
AS I WAS SAYING,
WE NEED TO FIND THE WEAK POINTS.

292
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,012
LET'S USE HEADS, NOT HANDS.

293
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:39,046
CHECK IT OUT--YOU CAN SEE
RIGHT THROUGH THIS WALL.

294
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,146
YEAH, HERE IT IS.

295
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,346
IT'S ANOTHER BREACH IN
THE SYSTEM'S SECURITY.

296
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,012
LOOK! GAZIMON!

297
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,146
BE STILL.

298
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:49,846
AH!

299
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,512
HEY--WHAT'S
THE BIG IDEA?

300
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:54,612
WHADDYA MEAN?

301
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:56,146
DON'T GIMME THAT!

302
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,846
ARE YOU NUTS?

303
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,112
NUTS TO YOU!

304
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,746
( <i>giggling</i> )

305
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:08,312
Sora:
YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN US ALL CAPTURED, TAI.

306
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:09,612
YOU'RE SO IMMATURE!

307
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,746
COULD YOU
YELL A LITTLE QUIETER?

308
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,979
RELAX, SORA,
GET A GRIP.

309
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,479
WHO ELECTED YOU
QUEEN OF THE FUN POLICE?

310
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:17,646
YEAH, THIS IS
TONS OF FUN,

311
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,146
AND GETTING CAUGHT
WILL BE A BLAST.

312
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,946

IT'S QUIETER.

313
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:28,312
THIS LOOKS NASTY!

314
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,879
WE DON'T HAVE TO
PASS THROUGH HERE, DO WE?

315
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,512
THIS FIRE WALL IS THE SYSTEM'S
LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.

316
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,879
BUT THERE APPEARS TO BE
ONLY ONE SAFE WAY THROUGH IT.

317
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,346
AND IF WE PICK THE WRONG WAY,

318
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,946
THEY'LL SCOOP US UP
WITH A SPATULA.

319
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,479
YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU, JOE?

320
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:42,512
MAYBE I AM,
A LITTLE.

321
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,812
RELAX, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE HUMAN OR ANYTHING.

322
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,946
WE'RE JUST BUNCHES OF KILOBYTES,
REMEMBER?

323
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,046
THE WEAK POINT SHOULD BE...

324
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,012
HERE.
COOL.

325
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:53,046
( <i>gasping</i> )

326
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,579

327

OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
STAND THERE ALL DAY?

YOWZA.

331
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:13,679
DO YOU THINK IT COMES
WITH A CD-ROM DRIVE,

332
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,846
OR IS THAT OPTIONAL?

333
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,312
Sora:
AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT THING IS?

334
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:20,779
I'VE HEARD OF HIM--
HIS NAME'S DATAMON,

335
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:23,012
<i>A SUPER-INTELLIGENT</i>
<i>ROBOTIC DIGIMON.</i>

336
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,279
<i>HE DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE</i>
<i>SOME TIME AGO.</i>

337
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:27,746
<i>NOBODY EVER KNEW</i>
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

338
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,179
Sora:
MAYBE THAT'S THE THING
THAT SENT US THE E-MAIL.

339
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:31,546
IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE
HE'S A PRISONER.

340
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,412
Datamon:
OF COURSE IT WAS--WHO ELSE?

341
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:34,679
All:
HMM...

342
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:36,546
TODAY IS YOUR LUCKY DAY...
AND MINE.

343
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,546
I GET IT,
HE'S COMMUNICATING WITH US

344
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,246
THROUGH THE INFRARED PORT
ON MY LAPTOP.

345
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,679
OH, A HARDWARE FAN.

346
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:44,712
WELL, LISTEN,
WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME.

347
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:47,712
LONG, LONG AGO,
I FOUGHT ETEMON AND LOST--

348
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:50,946
ONE OF MY RARE MISCALCULATIONS.

349
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:53,779
ANYWAY, I WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED
AND HE IMPRISONED ME HERE

350
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:56,146
AND FORCED ME TO
ACT AS HIS WEBMASTER,

351
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,846
ADMINISTERING HIS NETWORK.

352
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,946
WITHOUT ETEMON KNOWING,
HOWEVER,

353
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:02,712
I WAS ABLE TO
SLOWLY REPAIR MYSELF,

354
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:06,246
RESTORING MY CAPABILITIES
BIT-BY-BIT OVER THE YEARS.

355
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,446
EVENTUALLY I GAINED CONTROL
OVER ETEMON'S NETWORK--

356
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,946
NOT TOTAL CONTROL,

357
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,746
BUT ENOUGH TO BRING SOME MISERY
TO THAT BLUBBERING BABOON.

358
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,012
AT LAST,
I'M READY TO FREE MYSELF,

359
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,746
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
TO BREAK THE CYBER-LOCK.

360
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,179
Sora:
WHAT ABOUT MY CREST?

361
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,712
YOU SAID IN YOUR MESSAGE
THAT YOU COULD LEAD US TO IT.

362
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:26,746
UM, YES, WHATEVER YOU WANT--
JUST PLEASE HELP ME OUT OF HERE!

363
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:30,179
CAN WE TRUST
THIS TALKING CAN OPENER?

364
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,346
ETEMON IS YOUR ENEMY
AS WELL AS MINE.

365
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,912
THAT MAKES US ALLIES.

366
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,146
PLEASE, YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE!

367
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,612
OKAY, YOU'RE ON--
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US?

368
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,046
I AM TRANSMITTING INSTRUCTIONS
FOR DISENGAGING THE CYBER-LOCK.

369
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,779
PUSH THAT LEVER FOR ME,
WOULD YOU?

370
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,112
GOT IT.

371
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:50,379
RIGHT-THREE, LEFT-FIVE.

372
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:52,846
QUICKLY!
BEFORE ENTEMON RETURNS!

373
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,779
Izzy:
PUSH THE BUTTON...

374
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,712
OKAY, PULL THE LEVER BACK TO
ITS ORIGINAL POSITION,

375
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,612
THAT SHOULD BE THE LAST STEP
IN THE PROCESS.

376

Etemon:
HOLD IT!

WHY DIDN'T YOU GO THROUGH
THE FIRE WALL AFTER THEM?

468
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,747
I COULDN'T...
I COULDN'T MOVE!

469
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,613
Joe:
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

470
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,880
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, TAI,

471
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,380
WE'LL FIND A WAY
TO GET THEM BACK.

472
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,047
( <i>crying:</i> )
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

473
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,680
SORA, IT'S ALL MY FAULT!!
