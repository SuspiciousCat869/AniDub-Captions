00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,000
Kari: <i>I THOUGHT IF I GAVE UP</i>
<i>TO MYOTISMON,</i>
<i>HE WOULD STOP HIS ATTACKS.</i>

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:08,033
<i>HIS PLAN WAS TO DESTROY ME</i>
<i>AND GATOMON.</i>

3
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:11,100
<i>THE OTHERS TRIED TO RESCUE ME,</i>
<i>BUT THE DIGIMON POWERS</i>

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,400
<i>STILL WEREN'T ENOUGH</i>
<i>TO DEFEAT MYOTISMON.</i>

5
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:16,833
<i>HE RELEASED A BIG BLAST AT ME</i>
<i>AND MY LITTLE GATOMON.</i>

6
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>WIZARDMON WANTED TO SAVE US,</i>

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,166
<i>SO HE JUMPED IN AND TOOK</i>
<i>THE FULL FORCE OF THE BLOW.</i>

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,700
<i>GATOMON DIGEVOLVED</i>
<i>TO ANGEWOMON</i>

9
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,833
<i>AND STRUCK MYOTISMON,</i>
<i>AND HE WAS FINALLY BEATEN,</i>

10
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,533
<i>EXCEPT FOR SOME REASON</i>

11
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:31,000

UH!

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,266
THAT LOUSY FOG BARRIER'S
STILL UP.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,733
SO BEATING MYOTISMON
DIDN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

39
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,666
HANG ON.
WE'VE GOT MAIL FROM GENNAI.

40
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,166
<i>WONDERFUL NEWS, MY FRIENDS.</i>

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,166
<i>I MAY HAVE FOUND THE WAY</i>
<i>TO DEFEAT HIM.</i>

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,133
<i>ALTHOUGH THIS LOOKS LIKE</i>
<i>A GRAHAM CRACKER,</i>

43
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,633
<i>IT'S ACTUALLY AN ANCIENT TEXT</i>
<i>WHICH I'VE TRANSLATED.</i>

44
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>"THE SKY WILL BE DARKENED</i>
<i>BY THE WINGS OF MANY BATS.</i>

45
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,466
<i>"THE FALLEN PEOPLE WILL INVOKE</i>

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,466
<i>"THE NAME OF THE UNDEAD</i>
<i>DIGIMON KING,</i>

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,400
<i>"AND WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES</i>
<i>THE HOUR OF THE BEAST,</i>

48
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,400

<i>WILL REVEAL HIMSELF</i>

49
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,566
<i>"IN HIS TRUE FORM</i>
<i>AS THE BEAST,</i>

<i>OF HOPE AND LIGHT</i>

<i>PLEASE ALWAYS RECYCLE."</i>

53
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:18,500
THAT LAST PART SEEMS WEIRD,
BUT GOOD LUCK!

54
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,566
THAT WAS AS CLEAR AS MUD.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
CAN YOU MAKE HEADS
OR TAILS OF IT?

56
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,500
LISTEN, TAI,

57
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,500
WE SHOULD FIND
MOM AND DAD.

58
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,666
YOU'RE RIGHT.

59
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,133
I WOULDN'T MIND
CHECKING OUT MY PLACE.

60
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,133
AND I'D LIKE
TO CHANGE MY PAJAMAS,

61
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,666
OR AT LEAST GET
A MATCHING ROBE.

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,233
Tai: YEAH, LET'S GO.
NO REASON TO STAY HERE.

63
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:43,847
ALL RIGHT.

64
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,747
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON?

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,180
IT'S A PRETTY LONG STORY,
BUT I'LL TRY.

66
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:50,647
Mimi: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WAIT FOR ME.

67
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,114
SORRY I'M LATE.

68
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:54,114
HUH? AREN'T WE
MISSING SOMEBODY?

69
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:56,947
WE'RE WAITING FOR JOE.
HE'S STILL UPSTAIRS.

70
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,280
Joe: MOM? DAD?

71
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,280
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF ANYONE.

72
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,314
DO YOU THINK
THEY'VE BEEN CAPTURED

73
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:07,280
WITH ALL THE REST?
THAT WOULD BE SAD.

74
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,147
AAH!
DON'T DO THAT!

75
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,114
RELAX.
IT'S ONLY YOUR BROTHER,

76
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,614
WHO'S TOTALLY FREAKED.

77
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:15,114
JIM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HIDING IN THERE?

78
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:17,114
WELL, I'M NOT PLAYING
HIDE-AND-SEEK.

79
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,114
THOSE CREEPY THINGS
TORE THE PLACE APART.

80
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:20,814
THEY ARE CREEPY,
AREN'T THEY?

81
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:22,780
I WOULDN'T TALK
IF I WERE YOU.

82
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:24,780
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THIS LITTLE GUY.

83
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:27,747
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE,
AND I'VE GOT MORE GOOD NEWS --

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,247
MYOTISMON'S BEEN DESTROYED.

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,747
JUST WHO IS MYOTISMON?

86
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,214
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU ACTUALLY SOUND LIKE

87
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,214
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

88
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,814
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

89
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,480
FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
AT THE CONVENTION CENTER,

90
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:44,414
AND WE'LL TRY TO FIND A WAY
THROUGH THE FOG BARRIER, RIGHT?

91
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,047
SO TELL ME, JOE,

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,547
ARE YOU STILL PLANNING
ON BEING A DOCTOR?

93
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,580
JOE IS SMART.
HE COULD BE A DOCTOR.

94
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,580
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.

95
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,580
JOE COULD BE
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

96
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:59,547
IT'S WHAT MY DAD
WANTS ME TO BE.

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,514
POOR DAD.
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

98
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:02,914
NO.

99
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:05,780
ARE YOU IMPLYING JOE'S
NOT SMART ENOUGH OR SOMETHING?

100
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,280
YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT --

101
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,780
NOW CALM DOWN!

102
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,780
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'LL BE HARD FOR HIM

103
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:12,280
TO BE A DOCTOR

104
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,880
WHEN HE PASSES OUT
AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.

105
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,214
YEP, THAT'S MY PAL JOE.

106
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,180
I THINK YOUR FRIENDS
ARE COMING.

107
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:21,647
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
LATER, JOE.

108
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,780
Agumon: THERE'S ONE
OF THEM NOW. LET'S GO.

122
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,314
Mimi: DADDY,
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM?

123
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,280
THEY'RE ALL
SO TOTALLY STILL.

124
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:52,280
ARE THEY...

125
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:54,280
NO. THEIR PULSES ARE NORMAL.

126
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:56,247
THAT'S GOOD.

127
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,780
JOE, LISTEN TO ME.
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

128
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:01,947
YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE IT
YOUR WAY, NOT DAD'S WAY.

129
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
I GUESS.

130
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:05,147
AFTER I BECOME A DOCTOR,

131
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,714
I'M GOING TO SOUTH AMERICA,
AFRICA --

132
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,714
SOMEPLACE I CAN REALLY
BE OF HELP.

133
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:13,614
DAD'S ALREADY TOLD ME
HE DOESN'T APPROVE.

134
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,580
I CAN IMAGINE.

135
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,047
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO SEE
TO ALL THESE PEOPLE.

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,547
WHAT CAN WE DO?

137
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,214
IF ONLY WE COULD GET HELP
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

138
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,714
IT'S HOPELESS.

139
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:27,414
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET
THROUGH THIS FOG.

140
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,480
HELLO, ANYBODY?

141
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,714
COME OUT, COME OUT
WHEREVER YOU ARE!

142
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,214
NO, LIKE THIS.
IF YOU SAVE US,

WHEN YOU WENT OFF

THEN I MADE-BELIEVE
I MISUNDERSTOOD,

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,580
THEN I TRIED TO WIPE IT
FROM MY MIND

AND JUST ACT LIKE EVERYTHING
WAS THE SAME AS BEFORE,

BUT IT WASN'T,
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO,

AND A BRILLIANT
MATHEMATICIAN.

194

IN FACT, HE WAS A LECTURER
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

HE AND I
WERE DISTANT COUSINS.

I WAS HIS ONLY
LIVING RELATIVE,

AND YOUR MOTHER HAD
NO FAMILY OF HER OWN,

PATAMON'S THE ONLY DIGIMON
I NEED TO COME WITH ME.

318
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:04,070
THE REST OF YOU STAY HERE.

319
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:07,603
I JUST WANT ALL OF YOU
TO SAVE UP YOUR STRENGTH.

320
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:10,103
IF MY PLAN DOESN'T WORK,
YOU'LL ALL BE NEEDED.

321
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:11,603
LET'S DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

322
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:13,603
SHE KNOWS THESE BAD DIGIMON
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

323
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,603
I DON'T MEAN TO BE A DOWNER,

324
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:17,603
BUT HOW CAN ANY OF US HOPE

325
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,603
TO STAND UP
AGAINST THAT GUY?

326
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:21,037
HE'S BIGGER
THAN MOST BUILDINGS.

327
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,037
I'VE GOT A PLAN,
LIKE I SAID.

328
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,970
COME ON, PATAMON,
LET'S FLY.

329
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,237
WE'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
GATOMON.

330
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,737
LET'S GO, SON.

331
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,703
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER,
RIGHT?

332
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,170
RIGHT.

333
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:36,170
PATAMON DIGEVOLVE TO...

334
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:39,370
ANGEMON!

335
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:42,237
GATOMON DIGEVOLVE TO...

336
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,570
ANGEWOMON!

337
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:50,037
ANGELS? WHAT'S GOING ON?

338
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,737
IT'S KIND
OF COMPLICATED.

339
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,303
THEY DIGEVOLVED, MOM.

340
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:56,303
ANGEMON IS THE FULLY EVOLVED
VERSION OF PATAMON,

341
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:59,170
AND ANGEWOMON IS THE SAME
FOR GATOMON, YOU SEE?

342
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:01,170
WELL, TRUST ME ON THIS, HUH?

343
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:03,103
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
OUTSIDE INTERESTS,

344
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,037
BUT I HOPE YOUR SCHOOLWORK
HASN'T SUFFERED.

345
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,037
THIS IS THE FATE OF THE PLANET
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

346
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,337
I CAN TAKE A MAKE-UP TEST
FOR ANYTHING I MISSED.

347
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,537
I SURE WISH I'D BROUGHT
THE CAM-CORDER.

348
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,070
UH-OH! AAH!

349
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,537
LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE.

350
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,970
AAH!

351
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:34,403
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

352
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:36,370
HE MUST HAVE DRAINED THEM
OF THEIR ENERGY.

353
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,337
GOODBYE, SMALL FRY.

354
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,737
CELESTIAL ARROW!

355
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,703
HAND OF FATE!

356
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,570
HA HA HA!

357
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:48,037
THIS WON'T BE EASY.

358
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,037
NOBODY EVER SAID
IT WOULD BE, ANGEMON.

359
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,703
I SHALL ENJOY DEVOURING YOU.

360
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,937
ANGEL FOOD IS ONE
OF MY FAVORITES.

361
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,037
I'M SO SORRY, MATT.
WE TRIED.

362
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,270
HE WAS TOO MUCH FOR US.

363
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,137
WHY IS THAT MONSTER
SO MUCH BIGGER

364
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,537
THAN THE OTHER DIGIMON?

365
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,670
SEARCH ME.

366
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,637
HMM. I THOUGHT
HE WAS FULLY EVOLVED,

367
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,570
BUT HE FOUND SOME WAY
OF DIGEVOLVING

368
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,970
INTO AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL --

369
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:15,170
SOME KIND
OF MEGA-ULTIMATE LEVEL.

370
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,670
Matt: HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

371
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,670
IT'S LIKE CHANGING THE RULES
IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME.

372
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:23,103
STOP IT. YOU'RE TICKLING ME.
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

373
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,637
YOU CAN DO IT, ANGEMON!

374
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,470
GO, ANGEWOMON!

375
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:28,570
WAIT A MINUTE.
THE PROPHECY -- THAT'S IT.

376
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:32,137
QUICK, IZZY, WHAT DID IT SAY
IN THERE ABOUT ANGELS?

377
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:40,569
I BEGIN TO GROW BORED
WITH YOU.

378
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,069
WHAT DOES THE PROPHECY SAY?

379
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,836
"ANGELS WILL SHOOT ARROWS
OF HOPE AND LIGHT

380
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,569
"AT THE LOVED ONES OF THOSE
THEY HAVE BEEN SENT TO PROTECT,

381
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:51,269
AND A MIRACLE WILL HAPPEN."

382
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,036
OKAY,
IF ANGEMON AND ANGEWOMON

383
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:55,036
ARE THE ANGELS
IN THE PROPHECY...

384
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,269
SO THEN WHO ARE THE ONES
THEY'VE BEEN SENT TO PROTECT?

385
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:00,269
THAT MUST MEAN T.K. AND KARI.

386
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:03,036
"THE ANGELS WILL SHOOT ARROWS
AT THEIR LOVES ONES."

387
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:05,036
IT'S SIMPLE.
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

388
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,969
SAY I'M KIND OF LIKE
A GUARDIAN ANGEL.

389
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,802
WHOSE GUARDIAN ANGEL
AM I? YOURS.

390
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:10,702
AND WHO DO YOU LOVE
THE MOST?

391
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,802
I WAS GETTING TO THAT.
MY MOM AND DAD, OBVIOUSLY.

392
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:16,302
T.K. AND KARI NOT ONLY
HAVE MOMS AND DADS,

393
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,802
THEY HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.

394
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,136
THEY HAVE BROTHERS.

395
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,802
IN A WORD, BINGO!

396
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,302
WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM
SHOOTING ARROWS

397
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,769
AT YOUR LOVED ONES?

398
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,169
SOUNDS DANGEROUS TO ME.

399
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,636
THEY'RE ANGELS, IZZY.
MAYBE THEY'RE LIKE CUPID.

400
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,636
HE WAS SORT OF AN ANGEL.

401
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,602
WHEN HE SHOT ARROWS,
THEY WERE ARROWS OF LOVE.

402
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,802
MOM, ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE CORNY?

403
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,802
IT MAY BE CORNY,
BUT I BUY IT.

404
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:39,702
ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO

405
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:42,302
IS GET ANGEMON AND ANGEWOMON
TO HIT YOU GUYS

406
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,802
WITH THEIR ARROWS OF LOVE.

407
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,736
HEY, LET'S NOT BE
TOO HASTY HERE.

408
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,302
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

409
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,202
T.K.!
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.
KARI!

410
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,402
YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO?

411
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,302
LET'S SEE THESE ARROWS
OF HOPE AND LIGHT.

412
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,702
YOU HAVE TO GET THEM
TO SHOOT AT US.

413
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,302
Tai: THEY'LL ONLY DO IT
IF YOU TELL THEM TO.

414
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,302
YOU REALLY WANT THEM
TO SHOOT YOU?

415
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:00,669
WHAT IF YOU GET DEAD?

416
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,302
NEVER HAPPEN, RIGHT?

417
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,636
RIGHT.

418
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,302
OKAY. ANGEWOMON!

419
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:08,336
ANGEMON, LISTEN UP.

420
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:13,036
I KNOW THIS MAYBE
SOUNDS CRAZY...

421
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:15,269
BUT SHOOT MATT AND TAI
WITH YOUR ARROWS.

422
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,269
Kari: YOU, TOO, ANGEWOMON.

423
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,569
HE'S RIGHT.

424
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:22,169
SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT...

425
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,736
WAIT.
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

426
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,136
WHAT IF THAT PROPHECY'S
ALL WRONG?

427
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,236
YOU GUYS WANT A MIRACLE
TO HAPPEN OR NOT?

428
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,602
YEAH, MIRACLES REQUIRE
A LITTLE FAITH.

429
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:33,569
SCARED, TAI?

430
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:36,536
NO, NOT AT ALL.
HOW ABOUT YOU, MATT?

431
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,002
OF COURSE NOT.
PIECE OF CAKE,

432
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,569
BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST
HANG ON TO YOU

433
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:44,069
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
CHICKEN OUT OR ANYTHING.

434
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:46,502
YEAH, RIGHT. I'LL DO
THE SAME FOR YOU, BUDDY.

435
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:47,902
ONE MIRACLE...

436
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,436
COMING UP.

437
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,769
HUH?

438
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,169
