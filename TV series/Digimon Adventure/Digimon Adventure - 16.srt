1
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:03,066
AFTER REACHING
THE CONTINENT OF SERVER,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,166
WE FOUND A KOROMON VILLAGE,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,100
BUT IT WAS OCCUPIED
BY THE PAGUMON.

4
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:09,633
LATER, DURING DINNER,
POYOMON DIGIVOLVED TO TOKUMON.

5
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,166
THAT NIGHT, LITTLE TOKO
WAS TAKEN FROM OUR CAMPSITE.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,233
AGUMON FINALLY FOUND HIM
AND ALL THE KORUMON IN A CAVE.

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,666
THEY WERE BEING GUARDED
BY THE GAJIMON,

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,900
WHO WERE PLANNING ON GIVING US
TO THEIR LEADER,

9
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:22,400
THAT ROCK AND ROLL
DIGIJERK, ETEMON.

10
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,000
HE USED HIS MUSIC
LIKE A WEAPON

11
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,500
AND TRIED TO DESTROY
THE VILLAGE.

12
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,466
WE FOUND THE CREST
FOR TAI'S TAG,

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,766
AND IT CREATED
AN ESCAPE FORCE.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,566
NEVER A DULL MOMENT!

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,166

Mimi: HOW FAR DO WE
HAVE TO WALK?

45
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:37,234
UNTIL EDOMON CAN'T FOLLOW US
ANYMORE

46
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:40,034
I DON'T THINK
THERE IS SUCH A PLACE!

47
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,734
Matt: WE CERTAINLY
CAN'T STOP HERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

48
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:47,001
FOR ONE THING, IF WE
WERE ATTACKED, THERE'D
BE NO PLACE TO RUN TO.

49
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,368
[THINKING]
THIS IS STARTING
TO LOOK BAD.

50
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,701
EVERYONE'S BECOMING
SO TIMID AND AFRAID.

51
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:53,668
HEY, COME ON, YOU GUYS!

52
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:56,634
WHY'D WE STOP?
WHY'S EVERYONE SO SCARED?

53
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,601
AFTER ALL, WE DO
HAVE THE CREST, YOU KNOW.

54
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:00,034
THAT'S TRUE.

55
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,301
BUT DO WE REALLY KNOW
THE CREST WILL HELP
AGUMON TO DIGIVOLVE?

56
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:03,634
OF COURSE.
RIGHT, AGUMON?

57
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:04,634
HMM?

58
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:06,434
LISTEN, BUDDY,
THIS IS YOUR BIG CHANCE.

59
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:07,568
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

60
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,568
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN DIGIVOLVE FURTHER,

61
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,434
SO EITHER YOU TRY
TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL

62
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:14,734
AND SAVE US FROM ETEMON,
OR I'LL GET A NEW DIGIMON!

63
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:15,734
[WHIMPERS]

64
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,734
NOT MUCH OF A CHOICE!

65
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:17,734
ARGH!

66
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,234
BY THE WAY,

67
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,001
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO USE
THE CREST TO DIGIVOLVE AGAIN?

68
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,534
WELL, FROM WHAT
WE'VE SEEN SO FAR

69
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:23,668
WITH THE OTHER
DIGIVOLUTIONS,

70
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,234
IT TAKES
A LOT OF ENERGY.

71
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:26,501
FOR EXAMPLE,
THEY CAN'T DIGIVOLVE

72
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:27,568
IF THEY'RE HUNGRY.

73
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,001
IN ADDITION,
THE PARTNER
OF THE DIGIMON

74
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,601
MUST BE IN SOME
SORT OF DANGER.

75
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:34,168
LIKE BEING UNDER
ATTACK OR SOMETHING.

76
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,268
BUT SINCE IT'S A HIGHER
LEVEL OF DIGIVOLVING,

77
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,468
MY THEORY IS EVEN MORE
ENERGY IS NEEDED.

78
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,901
SO WE'LL PROVIDE THE FOOD,
AND ETEMON WILL PROVIDE
THE DANGER. [LAUGHS]

79
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,701
YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT,
YOU DIGIDESCENT KIDS,

80
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,001
I'LL FIND YOU,

81
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,834
AND WHEN I DO, YOU'LL WISH
YOU'D NEVER CROSSED ETEMON!

82
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:54,601
I'LL GET YOU!

83
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,518
AAH...HEY, NO MORE!

84
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,851
JUST ONE MORE
TEENSY BITE!

85
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:04,062
OHH!

86
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,462
READY FOR
THE SECOND COURSE?

87
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,529
BRGGGH.

88
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,729
OH, STOP
YOUR BELLYACHING
AND OPEN WIDE!

89
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,029
YOU'VE GOTTA
KEEP ON EATING!

90
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:13,296
EVERYONE'S
GIVING YOU THEIR FOOD
SO YOU CAN DIGIVOLVE.

91
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:14,796
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

92
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:15,896
YEAH.

93
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,996
Mimi: WE DIDN'T GIVE HIM
OUR FOOD. HE TOOK IT.

94
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:17,996
OF ALL THE NERVE!

95
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,162
THE FOOD WON'T
DO US ANY GOOD.

96
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:21,296
WE STILL
CAN'T DIGIVOLVE.

97
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,362
THOSE OF US
WHO DON'T WORK,
DON'T EAT, HUH?

98
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:24,562
BUT I'M HUNGRY!

99
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,729
Tai: HEY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU,
I SAID, "IS THAT RIGHT?"

100
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,429
All: THAT'S RIGHT!

101
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:32,396
THAT'S WHY YOU
GOTTA TRY YOUR BEST
TO PROTECT EVERYBODY!

102
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:35,362
NOW, COME ON, BUDDY,
KEEP EATING!

103
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:37,762
I GUESS THERE'S NOT
MUCH ELSE WE CAN DO
TO HELP.

104
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:40,062
I DON'T KNOW IF
AGUMON CAN TAKE
MUCH MORE.

105
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,062
YEAH, TAI IS
REALLY PUSHING HIM.

106
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,029
AGUMON'S STUFFED LIKE
A THANKSGIVING TURKEY.

107
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,229
EAT UP!
YOU NEED THAT ENERGY!

108
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:49,329
TAI'S PERSONALITY
HAS TAKEN A TURN
FOR THE WORSE.

109
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,396
I REMEMBER HIM
BEING FRIENDLIER,

110
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:51,962
EVEN TO US
YOUNGER KIDS.

111
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,929
ACTUALLY, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

112
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,862
HE WAS COOL
DURING SOCCER CAMP.

113
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,229
TAI, PASS IT TO ME!
I'M OPEN!

114
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,129
NOW'S MY CHANCE TO SHOOT!
HERE I GO!

115
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,729
YEAH...UGH!

116
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,962
OOF!

117
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:12,329
AAHH...

118
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,496
NICE PASS, TAI!

119
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:17,896
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING THE SHOT YOURSELF.

120
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:21,862
REMEMBER, THERE'S
NO "I" IN TEAM! HA HA!

121
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:25,362
TAI MIGHT LOOK LIKE
HE'S TRYING TO RUN THINGS
ALL BY HIMSELF,

122
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:29,296
BUT WHATEVER CRAZY ACTION
HE TAKES, HE DOES IT
FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM.

123
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,362
MM-HMM.

124
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,296
BUT NOW ALL THIS...

125
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,996
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN HELP NOW!

126
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,162
SO YOU GOTTA
KEEP EATING, OK?

127
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:37,962
UGH, I CAN'T.

128
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,496
TAI'S PERSONALITY
SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED

129
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,929
EVER SINCE HE GOT
THAT CREST OF COURAGE.

130
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:46,896
BOY, I'M HUNGRY.
HMM? HEY, GUYS!

131
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,462
MY TAG IS GLOWING!

132
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,362
IT MUST BE
REACTING TO SOMETHING!

133
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,762
Izzy: THE CREST
MUST BE NEARBY!

134
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,262
Tai: YOU THINK SO?

135
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,862
HEY, LOOK!

136
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,629
THERE'S SOMETHING
OUT THERE!

137
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,829
IT LOOKS LIKE
A BIG BUILDING
OR SOMETHING.

138
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:03,962
THAT MUST BE
WHERE MY CREST IS!

139
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:07,429
WHOA!

140
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,429
WHAT'S A CABLE DOING
OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE?

141
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,396
WHOA!

142
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,962
WHAT IS IT,
LORD ETEMON?

143
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:21,829
AHA! SOMETHING'S CAUGHT
IN MY NETWORK! [LAUGHS]

144
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,296
THE INTRUDER'S
IN THE L-7 SECTOR.

145
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,929
LET'S SEE, L-7...
HOW'S THIS THING WORK?

146
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:28,996
OH, HERE IT IS.

147
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,262
WHERE IS IT?

148
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,229
[LAUGHS] IT'S NEAR
THE COLISEUM!

149
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:34,796
THAT'S WHERE
I HOLD MY ANNUAL
"TRIBUTE TO ME" SHOW.

150
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,596
I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE DOING
ALL THE WAY OVER THERE.

151
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,696
YOU GOT ANY IDEA?

152
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,896
MAYBE THEY WANNA
GET GOOD SEATS, BOSS.

153
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,196
OH, THEY'LL HAVE
A PERFECT VIEW

154
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,829
FOR THE SURPRISE SHOW
I'M PLANNING FOR THEM.

155
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:43,662
[LAUGHS]

156
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,596
HELLO, AREA L-7,
CAN I HELP YOU?

157
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:52,829

HEY, LITTLE BUNNY,

00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,362
YOU'LL BE HAVING
SOME GUESTS SOON.

161
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:58,896
YOU BETTER GET READY
TO WELCOME THEM.

162
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,096
WELCOME THEM?

163
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,429
SO, DO YOU MEAN--

LIKE THE ROMAN COLISEUM.

167
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:35,229
Tentomon: WHAT'S
THE ROMAN COLISEUM?

168
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,929
WELL, TENTOMON,
IT'S AN ANCIENT ARENA.

169
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,129
Mimi: BUT THE ANCIENT ONE
DIDN'T HAVE BIG SCREENS!

OK, LET'S SPLIT UP
AND LOOK FOR THE CREST!

A REST,

180
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,729
THE ONLY CLUE
WE HAVE IS MY TAG,

181
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,862
SO GOMAMON AND I WILL
SEARCH FOR THE CREST.

A GREAT IDEA!

THE HUMAN TEAM
WILL PLAY AGAINST
THE DIGIMON TEAM.

189
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,329
WHAT ON EARTH
IS SOCCER?

190
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:24,529
IT'S EASY.
USE YOUR FEET TO GET
THIS BALL IN THE GOAL.

191
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,962
YOU CAN ALSO USE
YOUR CHEST OR YOUR HEAD.

YOU CAN'T USE
YOUR HANDS.

UNLESS YOU'RE
THE GOALKEEPER,

THEN YOU CAN
USE YOUR HANDS!

WAS A TRAP!

DON'T STOP ME.

317
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,687
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO MAKE HIM

318
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,154
DIGIVOLVE
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

319
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:53,320
PLEASE MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS, SORA.

320
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,654
BUT, TAI,
WITHOUT A REACTION
FROM THE CREST,

321
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:57,820
THERE'S NO WAY FOR
HIM <i>TO</i> DIGIVOLVE.

322
00:13:57,854 --> 00:13:59,287
I CAN MAKE HIM DO IT.

323
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,154
WATCH!

324
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:03,654
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA DO?

325
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,487
THE OTHER CONDITION
FOR DIGIVOLVING

326
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,220
IS THEIR PARTNER
MUST BE IN DANGER.

327
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:09,987
Sora: HE WOULDN'T!

328
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,687
HURRY UP AND
FINISH HIM OFF!

329
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,187
USE YOUR NOVA BLAST!
HA HA HA!

330
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,287
Tai: STOP!

331
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,520
I'M NOT AFRAID OF
A BIG FAKE LIKE YOU.

332
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:24,387
OK, FIRE BREATH,
COME AND GET ME!

333
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,554
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

334
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,087
A DOPE WHO THINKS
HE'S A SUPERSTAR?

335
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,620
WELL, YOU GOT IT. NOW START
SINGING YOUR FINAL NUMBER.

336
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,120
AAH!

337
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,820
BIYOMON, YOU'VE
GOT TO HELP TAI.

338
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:38,620
YOU GO, TOO,
GABUMON.

339
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:39,387
GOT IT.

340
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,820
BIYOMON, DIGIVOLVE TO...

341
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:56,220
BIRDRAMON!

342
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:05,120
GABUMON, DIGIVOLVE TO...

343
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,620
GARURUMON!

344
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,020
Tai: GREYMON,
I BELIEVE IN YOU!

345
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,187
YOU CAN DO IT, GREYMON!
DIGIVOLVE!

346
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:58,687
OH!

347
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,154
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

348
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:07,154
WHAT DO YOU
THINK THAT IS?

349
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:09,920
OH, MY! IS THAT
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

350
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,487
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THAT THING?

351
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,420
Tentomon: SKULL GREYMON.
THE SIGHT OF HIM MAKES
OTHER DIGIMON TREMBLE.

352
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,587
HE IS A FULLY
DIGIVOLVED DIGIMON

353
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,954
WHOSE EXPLOSIVE POWER
CAUSES HIM TO CONSTANTLY
SEARCH FOR BATTLE.

354
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,520
THIS COULD
BE VERY BAD.

355
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:23,720
THERE'S BEEN
SOME MISTAKE,

356
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:25,687
AND HE'S DIGIVOLVED
INTO A HORRIBLE MONSTER.

357
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,487
THIS IS GREYMON'S
DIGIVOLVED FORM?

358
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,354
WHOA!

359
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,387
LISTEN TO ME,
SKULL GREYMON.

360
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,554
IF YOU'RE REALLY
THE DIGIVOLVED
FORM OF GREYMON,

361
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:50,687
THEN YOU CAN'T
HURT ME!

362
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,020
Matt: TAI,
GET OUT OF THERE!

363
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,254
LEAVE IT TO ME!

364
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,220
TENTOMON, DIGIVOLVE TO...

365
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,554
KABUTERIMON!

366
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:30,620
OH, NO!

367
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:34,854
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

368
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,220
OH, NO! MY POOR NETWORK.

369
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:42,587
THEY'RE DESTROYING
EVERYTHING

370
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,054
THAT I WORKED
SO HARD TO CREATE. AAH!

371
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:52,420
All: AAH!

372
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:00,287
METEOR WING!

373
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,754
HOWLING BLASTER!

374
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:03,354
ELECTRO SHOCKER!

375
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,987
Izzy: I WONDER
WHAT HAPPENED.

376
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,387
Tentomon:
HIS ENERGY RAN OUT.

377
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:47,154
T.K.: HE'S KOROMON AGAIN!

378
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:58,278
T.K.: HE'S KOROMON AGAIN!

379
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:00,545
WHOA!

380
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:01,978
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

381
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:05,445
WELL, YES...BUT...

382
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,512
I'VE DONE SOME TERRIBLE,
HORRIBLE THINGS.

383
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:14,312
I SAVAGELY ATTACKED
3 OF MY FELLOW DIGIMONS.

384
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:15,645
IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT.

385
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:16,645
SHE'S RIGHT.

386
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:18,778
WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

387
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,512
I'M REALLY SORRY
I DIDN'T LIVE UP

388
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,745
TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS
OF ME, TAI.

389
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,745
Matt: IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT.

390
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:25,845
I KNOW WHO'S
TO BLAME.

391
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,478
I KNOW, IT'S
ALL MY FAULT.

392
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:28,712
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

393
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,712
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT
IT ALL ON YOU, TAI.

394
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:33,145
IT'S OK.
IT'S MY FAULT.
RIGHT, SORA?

395
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,245
YEAH, I MEAN--

396
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:35,312
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS DOING,

397
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,312
BUT I KEPT PUSHING
PEOPLE AROUND
ANYWAY.

398
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,112
I FELT LIKE BECAUSE
I HAD THE CREST,

399
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,212
I HAD TO BE
IN CHARGE AND
FIGHT ON MY OWN

400
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,078
WITHOUT ANY HELP
FROM THE REST
OF YOU.

401
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:46,245
I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY.

402
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:47,678
PLEASE FORGIVE ME

403
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:56,145
YOU WERE FINALLY ABLE TO
DIGIVOLVE

404
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:57,978
BUT IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE

405
00:19:58,012 --> 00:20:00,212
I WONDER IF OUR DIGIMON WILL
EVER

406
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:02,678
BE ABLE TO DIGIVOLVE THE RIGHT
WAY.

407
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:05,712
ONE THING'S FOR SURE, I LEARNED
MY LESSSON.
