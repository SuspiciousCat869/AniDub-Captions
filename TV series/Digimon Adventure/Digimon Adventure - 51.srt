NOW THEY'RE
JUST SITTING DUCKS

474
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:04,410
WAITING FOR ME
TO TAKE TARGET PRACTICE.

475
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:05,710
TAI.

476
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:07,310
MATT, YOU MADE IT.

477
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,310
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HERE.

478
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:12,777
YEAH, I MADE IT, TAI.
HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.

479
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,977
I NEVER DOUBTED YOU
FOR A SECOND, MATT.

480
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,243
I KNOW IT DIDN'T
ALWAYS SEEM THAT WAY.

481
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:21,743
THANK YOU, TAI,
FOR BELIEVE IN ME.

482
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:23,743
I'M JUST SORRY
I WAS SO LATE.

483
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:26,743
TAI, YOU HAVE TO KNOW
HOW MUCH OUR FRIENDSHIP

484
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,243
HAS ALWAYS MEANT TO ME,

485
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:29,743
AND I SWEAR

486
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,677
NOTHING WILL EVER
COME BETWEEN US AGAIN.

487
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,343
Matt: WARGREYMON.

488
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:42,777
NOW WHAT?

489
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,143
MATT, YOUR CREST
OF FRIENDSHIP

490
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:47,643
GAVE ME STRENGTH

491
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:49,643
AND BROUGHT WARGREYMON
BACK TO NORMAL.

492
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:51,810
THANK YOU, GARURUMON.

493
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,810
NOW I CAN FIGHT AGAIN.

494
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,243
Izzy: COME ON, GUYS.
GET OUT OF THERE.

495
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,743
Joe: TAI, ARE YOU OKAY?

496
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:00,243
Tai: I THINK SO.

497
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,243
MY FIRST THOUGHT
WAS TO DESTROY YOU

498
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,243
ALL TOGETHER IN ONE
NICE LITTLE PACKAGE,

499
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,677
BUT NOW I BELIEVE
I'D RATHER DO IT INDIVIDUALLY

500
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,143
SO AS TO PROLONG YOUR SUFFERING
A LITTLE LONGER.

501
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:12,143
YOU SURE TALK A LOT
FOR A CLOWN.

502
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:15,077
TRUMP SWORD.
