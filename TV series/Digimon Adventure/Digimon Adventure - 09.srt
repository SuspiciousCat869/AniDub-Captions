00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,860
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

164
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:26,860
AAH! SUBZERO
ICE PUNCH! AAAH!

165
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:34,160
Tai: HE REALLY LIKES
TO BURY HIMSELF
IN HIS WORK.

166
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:35,627
ALL RIGHT,
NOW'S OUR SHOT.

167
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,160
ROLL UP INTO A BALL.

168
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,160
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

169
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:39,460
YEAH. NOW I'LL SHOW YOU

170
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,627
WHY I'M MY SOCCER TEAM'S
BEST STRIKER!

171
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,593
AAAAH!

172
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,160
HEY, UNH!

173
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:50,560
POI!

174
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,160
AAAHH! AAH! AAH!

175
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:56,327
WHOO!

176
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,527
Agumon:
YAHOO! WE DID IT!

177
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,060
UHH. WHAT AM I
DOING LAYING HERE?

178
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:03,027
WHAT HAPPENED?

179
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,327
A BLACK GEAR
WAS ON YOU,

180
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,993
AND YOU ALMOST TURNED US
INTO ICE SCULPTURES.

181
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,160
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

182
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,493
I JUST HATE
WHEN I DO THAT.

183
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,927
BUT THANK YOU
FOR DESTROYING
THE GEAR.

184
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,327
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BOTH
ALL RIGHT.

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,827
HAVE YOU SEEN
ANYONE ELSE HERE?

186
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,027
SOME MORE KIDS LIKE ME?

187
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,260
HMMM. COME
TO THINK OF IT,

188
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:19,827
I DID SEE ANOTHER
BOY LIKE YOU.

189
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,227
HE WAS
WITH A GABUMON.

190
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,660
THEY FELL
ONTO THAT OTHER
ISLAND OVER THERE.

191
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:24,693
YOU SAW
GABUMON?

192
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:25,693
AND MATT!

193
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,860
PERFECT. MATT WOULD LAND
THAT FAR AWAY.

194
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:29,993
IT'S TOO COLD TO SWIM,

195
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:32,660
AND WE'RE DRIFTING
AT 100 MILES A YEAR.

196
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:33,793
YOU'RE A WEIRD KID,

197
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,460
BUT, SINCE YOU GOT
THAT BLACK GEAR OUT

198
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,727
OF MY ACHING BACK,

199
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
I'LL HELP YOU GET
ACROSS THE WATER.

200
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:42,760
SUBZERO ICE PUNCH!

201
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,060
HEY, IT'S
AN ICE BRIDGE!

202
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,727
NOW WE CAN WALK
TO THE ISLAND!

203
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,227
I HOPE
YOUR PUNCHES
DON'T...

204
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,727
UH, YOU KNOW...
FREEZE UP?

205
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,127
DON'T WORRY.
AS LONG AS IT'S COLD,

206
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,260
I'M FULL OF PUNCH.
YEAH, BABY.

207
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:54,327
WHAT IF THE ICE BREAKS
WHILE WE'RE OUT THERE?

208
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,960
WE COULD BE
SEADRAMON BAIT!

209
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,560
UHH...AAH!

210
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,760
WHOA!

211
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,360
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WE GET IT!

212
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:01,960
QUIT SHAKING UP
THE WHOLE ISLAND!

213
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,160
MAN, DOES EVERYBODY
IN THE DIGITAL WORLD

214
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:05,793
ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE SO NOISY?

215
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:07,827
COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S START WALKING!

216
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,827
Matt:
T.K.! T.K.!

217
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,960
T.K.,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

218
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,460
[COUGHS]

219
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:18,460
MATT! OH!

220
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:21,393
WHERE ARE YOU, T.K.?

221
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:23,393
MATT, YOU MUST SAVE
YOUR STRENGTH!

222
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:25,260
OH... [COUGHS]

223
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,260
WAIT!

224
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,260
LOOK, MATT.

225
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,993
THERE'S A CAVE
RIGHT OVER THERE.

226
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:31,227
LET'S GO IN AND GET WARM
UNTIL THE STORM'S OVER.

227
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,927
UHHH! A CAVE!

228
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,893
OF COURSE!
THAT'S WHERE
T.K. IS! YES!

229
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,093
T.K.!

230
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,093
HUH?

231
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,860
Gabumon:
I'M SORRY, MATT.

232
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,893
DON'T GIVE UP
HOPE.

233
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,927
I WAS SO SURE
HE'D BE IN HERE.

234
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,693
BUT THEN AGAIN, T.K.
NEVER LIKED CAVES THAT MUCH.

235
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:48,593
AAAH...CHA!

236
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:52,827
THERE NOW. COME AND SIT
BY THE FIRE.

237
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,527
YOU CAN'T HELP T.K.--NOR
ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER--

238
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,860
IF YOU GET SICK.
YOU MUST REST
TO STAY STRONG.

239
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:00,193
NO, I GOTTA GO
BACK OUT THERE
AND FIND HIM.

240
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,127
I FEEL FINE!
[COUGHS]

241
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,260
OH, SIT DOWN.

242
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,593
YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING THIS CAVE.

243
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,960
HEY!
I'LL GO LOOK
FOR T.K.

244
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:07,393
HUH?

245
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,460
HEY, COME ON, MATT.

246
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:10,360
I'M YOUR DIGIMON,
REMEMBER?

247
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:12,127
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU
THROUGH THICK AND THIN,

248
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,327
WHETHER IT'S HOT OR COLD.

249
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,127
HA HA. BESIDES, I'VE GOT
A BUILT-IN WARM FUR COAT

250
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,293
WHICH YOU HAVEN'T.

251
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,560
HA HA HA HA. COME ON.

252
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,227
JUST SIT RIGHT HERE
AND GET WARM.

253
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,293
I MEAN IT.

254
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:27,260
I'LL BE BACK
IN 2 SHAKES
OF A DIGITAIL!

255
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:28,027
[COUGHS]

256
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,193
OHHH.

257
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,427
[THINKING]
POOR LITTLE T.K.

258
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,260
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.
HE'S MY LITTLE BROTHER.

259
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:42,793
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
OUT THERE LOOKING FOR HIM.

260
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:44,327
T.K.!

261
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,727
HEY, DAD,
ARE WE THERE YET?

262
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,727
Tai: HUH?

263
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,327
SORRY. I JUST HAD
TO SAY THAT.

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,427
SUBZERO ICE PUNCH!

265
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,827
MAN, THAT ISLAND'S JUST
AS FAR AWAY AS EVER.

266
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,360
LET'S TAKE 5, YOU GUYS,

267
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:00,927
AND THEN WE'LL
KEEP ON GOING.

268
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,193
THE ISLAND'S
STILL MOVING.

269
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:03,727
IF WE STOP,
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE

270
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,460
TO CATCH UP WITH IT.

271
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,360
AGUMON, IF YOU COULD
FLY LIKE BIRDRAMON,

272
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:08,393
WE'D BE THERE
ALREADY.

273
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,027
HMMPH.
WELL, I CAN'T.

274
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,527
BIRDRAMON
PROBABLY CAN'T FLY
IN THE COLD ANYWAY.

275
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,193
NO ONE TOASTS
MY CLOTHES LIKE YOU.

276
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:16,193
COME ON, LAUGH!

277
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:17,193
NO WAY.

278
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:18,893
OH, I HATE TO SEE
FRIENDS FIGHT.

279
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:21,060
I'LL CARRY YOU BOTH
ACROSS. LIKE THIS.

280
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,527
THERE. NICE AND COMFY?

281
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,360
YEAH. COMFY AS
A MACKEREL ON ICE.

282
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:27,293
BUT AT LEAST
WE'LL STILL BE
NICE AND FRESH

283
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:28,327
WHEN WE GET THERE.

284
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,893
HEY, DID I EVER TELL YOU

285
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,027
ABOUT THE PARTY
I WENT TO

286
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,127
THAT THE NUMEMONS
CRASHED? HA.

287
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,093
NOW, THAT'S A PARTY
NO ONE WILL FORGET.

288
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,593
WELL, NO SIGN OF T.K.
OUT HERE ANYWHERE.

289
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,060
OH, MATT'LL BE
SO DISAPPOINTED.

290
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:44,093
OHHH! MATT!

291
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,060
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT?

292
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,560
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LEAVE!

293
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,027
UHHH.

294
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:58,927
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
MATT!

295
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,060
HE'S FROZEN.

296
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,893
I HAVE GOT
TO WARM HIM UP,
OR ELSE...

297
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,760
OR ELSE HE WILL
NEVER MAKE IT.

298
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:05,860
BUT HOW?

299
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,460
ALL I HAVE IS MY OWN FUR,
AND...

300
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,660
HEY, THAT'S IT!

301
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,327
WHY NOT? NO ONE'S HERE
TO SEE ME.

302
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,993
THERE. HERE YOU GO,
MY FRIEND.

303
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,793
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
IN NO TIME.

304
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,160
GOOD THING
WE'RE ALONE HERE.

305
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:36,560
THIS ONE NUMEMON KEPT
FOLLOWING MY SISTER,

306
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,560
BUT I HANDLED IT. HA HA.

307
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:40,760
A LITTLE SUBZERO
ICE PUNCH SHOW-AND-TELL.

308
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,760
HEY, YOU TWO, WAKE UP!
WE'RE HERE!

309
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:43,993
YAY!
HOORAY!

310
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:46,293
UNH.

311
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:48,593
I WONDER WHERE GABUMON
AND MATT LANDED.

312
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,760
HMMM.

313
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:50,760
RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE, I THINK.

314
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,627
SO THEY MUST
BE UP THERE
SOMEWHERE.

315
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,793
IN--IN THAT
FOREST.

316
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,593
Tai: SURE,
LET'S GO FOR A HIKE.

317
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,993
THEN AFTER THAT WE'LL HIKE.

318
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,060
THEN WE CAN HIKE SOME MORE.

319
00:10:59,093 --> 00:10:59,893
SHEESH.

320
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,660
HEY, THERE'S A BED.
