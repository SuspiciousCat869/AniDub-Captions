00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:15.556
AS I'VE SHOWN YOU
BEFORE, YOU, TOO,

00:07:15.556 --> 00:07:18.693
CAN TRACE YOUR ORIGINS
BACK TO ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:07:18.693 --> 00:07:20.728
ALL RIGHT!
THAT IS ENOUGH!

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:22.597
I KNOW WHO I AM!

00:07:22.597 --> 00:07:25.133
I'M A FAR BETTER
DUELIST THAN YOU,

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:27.935
AND I PLAN TO WIN
THIS TOURNAMENT--

00:07:27.935 --> 00:07:29.570
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.639
AND YOUR DEMENTED
BROTHER MAY BELIEVE.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.208
YOU MADE TWO MISTAKES:

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:36.277
THE FIRST WAS HANDING
OBELISK TO ME;

00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:38.679
THE SECOND WAS
EXPECTING IT BACK!

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:40.281
THAT CARD IS MINE!

00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:43.985
AND SOON I'LL POSSESS THE OTHER
TWO EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:46.587
THEN I'LL HAVE THE WORLD'S
MOST POWERFUL DECK!

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:48.856
AND YOU CAN DO
A FAVOR FOR ME,

00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:50.825
TAKE YOUR HOCUS
POCUS NONSENSE

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.727
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S
TOURNAMENT!

00:07:52.727 --> 00:07:55.696
'CAUSE TO ME IT'S
A COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME!

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:57.431
LET'S GO, ROLAND.

00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:59.300
BEGIN THIS DUEL AT ONCE!

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.635
YES, SIR!

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:02.837
BEGIN NOW!

00:08:02.837 --> 00:08:04.105
ALL RIGHT.

00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:06.207
MY MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE PREDICTS

00:08:06.207 --> 00:08:07.575
THAT KAIBA'S
LACK OF FAITH

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:10.811
WILL BE HIS
DOWNFALL.

00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:12.079
I'LL GO FIRST!

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:15.082
I DON'T NEED A MAGIC TRICK
TO PREDICT YOUR DEMISE!

00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:19.320
SO, I WILL SUMMON
THE MIGHTY VORSE RAIDER!

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.522
[ROARS]

00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:23.891
[THINKING] NOW HE'LL
PLACE A CARD FACE DOWN.

00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:27.094
AND NOW I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:28.896
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:31.899
KAIBA, THE POWER OF
MY MILLENNIUM NECKLACE

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:33.634
SHALL PREDICT
YOUR EVERY MOVE,

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.336
AND YOU WILL
SUFFER DEFEAT.

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:37.738
[THINKING] KAIBA MAY
BE A SKILLED DUELIST,

00:08:37.738 --> 00:08:39.040
BUT HE'S NO MATCH
FOR THE POWER

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.541
OF A MILLENNIUM ITEM!

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:41.876
THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN WIN!

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:45.413
THIS ISN'T GOOD!

00:08:45.413 --> 00:08:46.714
THE KAIBA CORP MAINFRAME

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:48.950
CAN'T SEEM TO DECIPHER
THE LAST LINE OF TEXT

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.484
ON THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:08:50.484 --> 00:08:52.620
I SUMMON KELDO.

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:56.824
WHOA?

00:08:56.824 --> 00:08:58.693
HEY, YUG, DID YOU
SEE THAT, MAN?

00:08:58.693 --> 00:09:00.461
SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK
AT THAT CARD!

00:09:00.461 --> 00:09:02.263
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY.

00:09:02.263 --> 00:09:04.165
HER MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
SHOWS HER EVENTS

00:09:04.165 --> 00:09:05.633
BEFORE THEY OCCUR.

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:08.436
SO, SHE KNOWS
EVERYTHING THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN

00:09:08.436 --> 00:09:09.637
BEFORE IT HAPPENS!

00:09:09.637 --> 00:09:11.205
HEY! HUNG ON!

00:09:11.205 --> 00:09:14.709
THIS SOUNDS JUST LIKE THAT
TRICK ESPA ROBA PLAYED ON ME!

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:16.477
YES, JOEY, BUT
I CAN ASSURE YOU

00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:18.613
THAT THIS IS
NOT A TRICK!

00:09:18.613 --> 00:09:21.482
ISHIZU'S POWER IS
VERY MUCH REAL!

00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:23.918
[THINKING] WHAT THOSE
FOOLS DON'T REALIZE

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:26.487
IS THAT MY SISTER'S
POWER HAS LIMITS.

00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:29.790
I WILL NOW ACTIVATE
A POWERFUL MAGIC CARD,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.592
MICHIZURE OF DOOM!

00:09:31.592 --> 00:09:33.160
[THINKING] OH, NO!

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.396
THAT CARD ALLOWS HER
TO SELECT TWO CARDS

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:37.832
FROM MY HAND
AND DISCARD THEM.

00:09:37.832 --> 00:09:40.501
BUT THEN I GET TO DO
THE SAME THING TO HER HAND.

00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:44.472
I CHOOSE POLYMERIZATION
AND KAISER GLIDER.

00:09:44.472 --> 00:09:45.973
[THINKING] SHE COULDN'T
POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:48.542
I HAD THOSE TWO
CARDS IN MY HAND...

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:50.444
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
SHE'S CHEATING.

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:52.213
ENOUGH TRICKERY!

00:09:52.213 --> 00:09:54.448
SHOW ME YOUR CARDS
RIGHT NOW!

00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:58.419
YOU'LL REGRET EVER HAVING
PLAYED THAT MAGIC CARD.

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:00.655
TIME FOR YOU TO DISCARD

00:10:00.655 --> 00:10:03.090
REVIVAL MAGIC
AND MONSTER REBORN!

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.394
AS YOU WISH.

00:10:06.394 --> 00:10:08.429
THAT ENDS
MY TURN.

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:10.831
[THINKING] AHHH...
I REMEMBER ISHIZU'S

00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:13.167
DUELING TACTICS
ALL TOO WELL.

00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:16.537
SHE MAY HAVE DEFEATED ME
WHEN I WAS A WEAK CHILD,

00:10:16.537 --> 00:10:19.807
BUT NOW SHE WOULDN'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST ME!

00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:22.677
ISHIZU, YOU'LL
NEVER TRANSFORM ME

00:10:22.677 --> 00:10:25.112
BACK INTO THE PATHETIC
FOOL I ONCE WAS!

00:10:25.112 --> 00:10:26.747
[THINKING] HE IS WRONG.

00:10:26.747 --> 00:10:29.183
I KNOW MY BROTHER'S
KIND AND GENTLE SPIRIT

00:10:29.183 --> 00:10:32.320
IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE,
AND I WILL SET HIM FREE!

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.389
I PROMISE, IN THE NAME
OF THE TOMB KEEPERS,

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:37.124
MARIK WILL BE SAVED.

00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:39.026
LISTEN, MY BROTHER--

00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:41.796
YOUR BROTHER HAS BEEN
GETTING IN MY WAY!

00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:43.130
SO, HE MUST BE BANISHED!

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.666
SAY GOOD-BYE!

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.568
[LAUGHS]

00:10:48.936 --> 00:10:51.706
SISTER!

00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:58.541
Kaiba: LET'S SEE
WHICH IS STRONGER,

00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:01.210
YOUR TRICKS OR MY SKILLS!

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.647
VORSE RAIDER,
ATTACK HER KELDO NOW!

00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:07.917
OH!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.454
WELL NOW, MAYBE YOUR
FUTURE ISN'T SO BRIGHT!

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:13.623
PERHAPS IF YOU
SPENT LESS TIME

00:11:13.623 --> 00:11:15.158
PREDICTING THE FUTURE
AND MORE TIME

00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:18.127
FOCUSING ON YOUR DUELING
YOU WOULDN'T BE...LOSING.

00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:20.897
YOU STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?

00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:24.767
I AM AWARE OF EVERY TWIST
AND TURN THAT WILL OCCUR.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.070
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT CARD
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.204
BEFORE YOU DO...

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:30.406
AND I KNOW HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO LOSE.

00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:33.710
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
IMBECILE YOU THINK I AM,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.113
BUT YOUR LITTLE MIND GAMES
WON'T WORK ON ME, ISHIZU.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.549
[THINKING] I HAVE
THE PERFECT PLAN.

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:41.384
WITH THE MAGIC CARD
SHRINK IN MY HAND...

00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:44.687
AND THE TRAP, CRUSH-CARD,
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD,

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:47.757
I'LL BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY
DEVASTATE ISHIZU!

00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:51.461
SHE WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT HER
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE!

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.397
I STILL THINK IT'S
GONNA BE A TOUGH DUEL.

00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:56.566
ISHIZU MAY BE ABLE
TO SEE THE FUTURE,

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.835
BUT KAIBA'S GOT
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:02.672
NOW I'LL PLACE ONE MORE
CARD FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD

00:12:02.672 --> 00:12:05.308
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.577
JUST AS I'D EXPECTED.

00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:10.647
THIS CARD WILL
BE NEEDED LATER.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.282
[THINKING] SHE'LL NEVER
EXPECT MY NEXT MOVE.

00:12:13.282 --> 00:12:16.052
I'LL DESTROY EVERY POWERFUL
MONSTER IN HER DECK

00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:18.755
USING SHRINK AND CRUSH-CARD.

00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:21.791
NOW I SUMMON MUDORA!

00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:26.429
I AM LEFT
WITH NO CHOICE

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:27.964
BUT TO CALL
UPON THE POWERS

00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:29.632
OF MY MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE

00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:31.734
TO ENSURE MY VICTORY!

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.436
AND IT SHOWS ME
THAT KAIBA

00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:35.004
WILL ATTEMPT TO
WIN THIS DUEL

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.707
USING THE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD I GAVE TO HIM.

00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:40.443
HOWEVER, OBELISK
WILL FALL BY MY HAND,

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:42.278
CAUSING KAIBA'S DEFEAT.

00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:44.180
AND HIS LOSS
SHALL BE MY GAIN

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.283
AS I MOVE CLOSER TO
RESCUING MY DEAR BROTHER.

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:49.986
Kaiba: WHAT'S
THE HOLD UP?

00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:51.888
Ishizu:
PATIENCE, KAIBA.

00:12:51.888 --> 00:12:53.856
I USED UP MY PATIENCE

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.825
WAITING FOR YOU TO
SHOW UP TONIGHT.

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:57.293
NOW, GO ALREADY!

00:12:57.293 --> 00:13:00.930
THE LESS I HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR INSANE BROTHER THE BETTER.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.733
HOW DARE YOU
INSULT MY FAMILY!

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:05.868
YOU'LL REGRET
THOSE WORDS!

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:09.939
Marik, thinking:
I DON'T BLAME SETO KAIBA
FOR HIS FRUSTRATION.

00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:13.509
I, TOO, AM GROWING TIRED
OF ISHIZU'S SPEECH.

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:17.213
I WILL NOW PLAY THE MAGIC
CARD SWORD OF DAGRA!

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.482
IT INCREASES
THE ATTACK STRENGTH

00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:25.254
OF MY MUDORA
BY 500 POINTS!

00:13:25.254 --> 00:13:27.557
NOW ATTACK
HIS VORSE RAIDER!

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.625
[BATTLE CRY]

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:31.828
[THINKING]
WHY, THANK YOU!

00:13:31.828 --> 00:13:34.030
FACEDOWN CARDS, GO!

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.598
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:13:35.598 --> 00:13:37.867
FIRST UP IS
MY SHRINK CARD!

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:43.706
THIS CUTS MY
VORSE RAIDER'S ATTACK
POINTS IN HALF!

00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:45.641
[THINKING] IN ORDER TO
ACTIVATE HIS CRUSH CARD,

00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:48.411
KAIBA HAD TO FIRST LOWER HIS
OWN MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:52.448
Kaiba: AND AS IF
THAT WORD ENOUGH,

00:13:52.448 --> 00:13:55.351
WATCH AS MY CRUSH CARD
DESTROYS BOTH MONSTERS

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:57.987
ON THE FIELD AS WELL AS
EVERY POWERFUL MONSTER

00:13:57.987 --> 00:13:59.322
IN YOUR ENTIRE DECK!

00:13:59.322 --> 00:14:01.657
[LAUGHS]

00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:03.926
[GASPS]

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:06.863
OH, MAN! KAIBA'S
MOVE WAS BRUTAL!

00:14:06.863 --> 00:14:08.564
IF I WERE ISHIZU,

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:10.333
I'D TRADE IN THAT
MILLENNIUM NECKLACE

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:11.901
FOR A CRYSTAL BALL
OR SOMETHING!

00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:13.069
[THINKING] JOEY'S RIGHT.

00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:14.370
IF SHE CAN SEE THE FUTURE,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.472
WHY DIDN'T SHE SEE THAT COMING?

00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:17.740
[LAUGHING]

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.509
NOW EVERY MONSTER
IN YOUR DECK

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:22.612
WITH OVER 1,500 ATTACK POINTS
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.681
YES, I KNOW.

00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:27.550
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
LEFT WITH NOTHING

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.585
BUT A DECK FULL
OF WORTHLESS MONSTERS

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:32.355
WHO POSE ABSOLUTELY
NO THREAT TO ME!

00:14:32.355 --> 00:14:34.190
ACCORDING TO MY
MILLENNIUM NECKLACE,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.826
I DON'T NEED A POWERFUL
MONSTER TO DEFEAT YOU.

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:39.562
SO, WATCH AS I STOP
YOU FROM ATTACKING ME

00:14:39.562 --> 00:14:41.330
FOR 3 WHOLE TURNS!

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.100
FOR NOW I PLAY THIS:

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.035
SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:52.942
[GROANS]

00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:54.210
YOU'RE TRAPPED!

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.778
PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME.

00:14:55.778 --> 00:14:59.015
IF MY FUTURE'S BLEAK,
WHY ARE YOU STALLING?

00:14:59.015 --> 00:15:01.417
I'M NOT STALLING, KAIBA.

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:03.519
FATE DICTATES OUR MOVES.

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:05.688
AND IT'S YOUR
DESTINY TO LOSE!

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:07.990
REALLY?
REALLY.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.526
AND I CAN CLEARLY
ENVISION YOUR DOWNFALL

00:15:10.526 --> 00:15:12.728
AS YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT DESTROY YOURSELF.

00:15:12.728 --> 00:15:15.331
WELL, I HAVE
A PREDICTION OF MY OWN:

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.633
ONCE YOUR SWORDS OF
REVEALING LIGHT ARE GONE,

00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:20.269
I'LL CRUSH YOU WITH
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:22.872
SO, WHILE YOU COUNT
ON FATE TO WIN THIS,

00:15:22.872 --> 00:15:24.707
I'LL COUNT ON BRUTE FORCE!

00:15:24.707 --> 00:15:29.645
FINE, AND I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:31.714
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:15:31.714 --> 00:15:33.716
IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:36.419
[THINKING]
VIRUS CANNON! PERFECT!

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:39.188
SHE MAY HAVE PREVENTED
MY MONSTER FROM ATTACKING,

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.324
BUT I CAN STILL PLAY
THIS MAGIC CARD!

00:15:41.324 --> 00:15:42.625
AND WHEN I DO,

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.861
SHE WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT HER!

00:15:49.492 --> 00:15:52.095
[THINKING] WATCHING ISHIZU
TOY WITH KAIBA'S MIND

00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:53.863
IS QUITE AMUSING.

00:15:53.863 --> 00:15:56.666
I ALWAYS KNEW SHE
HAD A DARK SIDE.

00:15:56.666 --> 00:16:00.436
STAND BACK!
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:16:00.436 --> 00:16:03.406
AND I SUMMON DARK GREMLIN...

00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:04.440
[ROARING]

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.742
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:05.742 --> 00:16:07.043
AND THEN...

00:16:07.043 --> 00:16:10.380
I'LL PLACE THIS
CARD FACE DOWN.

00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:14.751
VERY WELL, I SHALL
DRAW ONE CARD.

00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:18.187
BUT I DON'T NEED IT YET,
SO, I SHALL PASS.

00:16:18.187 --> 00:16:19.722
HOW SAD.

00:16:19.722 --> 00:16:22.458
YOU STOPPED ME FROM
ATTACKING YOU FOR 3 TURNS...

00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:24.761
YET YOU STILL
CAN'T DESTROY ME.

00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:26.996
SO, MUCH FOR
YOUR PREDICTION, ISHIZU.

00:16:26.996 --> 00:16:30.266
ACTUALLY, KAIBA,
YOU SHALL DRAW THE CARD

00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:31.734
THAT WILL LEAD TO
YOUR DEMISE

00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:33.169
IN TWO MORE TURNS.

00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:35.071
[LAUGHS]

00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:37.940
YOU'RE EVEN MORE INSANE
THAN I FIRST THOUGHT!

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.742
THE ONLY THING
I'M GONNA DRAW

00:16:39.742 --> 00:16:41.010
ARE CARDS THAT
WILL LEAD TO

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.279
YOUR OWN DEMISE,
ISHIZU!

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:45.815
DUEL MONSTERS IS ABOUT
SKILL AND POWER,

00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:47.517
NOT FAIRY DUST AND FATE!

00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:48.851
HOW POETIC.

00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:50.887
HE'S GOT SUCH
A WAY WITH WORDS.

00:16:50.887 --> 00:16:52.822
HE'S A REGULAR
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE!

00:16:52.822 --> 00:16:55.091
I GOT A COUPLE
OF WORDS FOR HIM,

00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:56.592
HOWEVER THERE'S
A LADY PRESENT.

00:16:56.592 --> 00:16:58.895
Kaiba: ALL THIS
TALK IS POINTLESS!

00:16:58.895 --> 00:17:02.698
IT'S TIME FOR ACTION NOW!

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:03.833
I'LL SAVE THIS CARD.

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.301
AWESOME!

00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:06.869
THE TRANSLATOR'S
WORKING NOW!

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.971
HANG IN THERE, BRO!

00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:10.440
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW!

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.709
SOON WE'LL KNOW ALL THE SECRETS
OF THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:15.878
AND THEN NO ONE CAN STOP YOU!

00:17:15.878 --> 00:17:17.713
MAKE YOUR MOVE,

00:17:17.713 --> 00:17:19.348
FOR THE END IS NEAR.

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:21.117
YOU FASCINATE ME.

00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:23.586
YOU SPEAK SO MUCH
ABOUT YOUR VICTORY,

00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:25.721
YET OTHER THAN
STALL FOR MORE TIME

00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:27.690
WITH YOUR SWORDS OF
REVEALING LIGHT,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.126
YOU'VE DONE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO WIN THIS!

00:17:30.126 --> 00:17:33.029
AND NEXT TURN YOUR
SWORDS WILL BE GONE

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:34.497
ALLOWING ME TO STRIKE BACK

00:17:34.497 --> 00:17:37.834
AND DEFEAT YOU ONCE
AND FOR ALL, ISHIZU!

00:17:37.834 --> 00:17:39.368
SO, BEWARE!

00:17:39.368 --> 00:17:42.572
I BELIEVE YOU'LL PASS.

00:17:42.572 --> 00:17:43.873
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:17:43.873 --> 00:17:45.842
I KNOW.

00:17:45.842 --> 00:17:48.377
[THINKING]
MY SACRIFICE'S
BLAST TRAP CARD

00:17:48.377 --> 00:17:50.780
WILL SEAL HIS FATE
IN MY NEXT TURN.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.950
MY MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
WAS INDEED CORRECT.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.519
THE TIME FOR YOU TO
MAKE YOUR FINAL MOVE

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.054
HAS ARRIVED, KAIBA.

00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:02.391
FOR 3 WHOLE TURNS YOU FAILED
TO SUMMON A SINGLE MONSTER.

00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:03.826
AND NOW I HIGHLY DOUBT

00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:06.429
THAT I'M FACING ANY
SORT OF DANGER AT ALL.

00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:08.164
SO, SPARE ME THE THREATS.

00:18:08.164 --> 00:18:10.132
MY SWORDS ARE GONE.

00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:11.267
YOU ARE FREE TO ATTACK.

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:13.870
WELL, THANK YOU FOR
STATING THE OBVIOUS.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.138
AND NOW STAND BACK!

00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:19.408
[THINKING] IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO DESTROY ISHIZU

00:18:19.408 --> 00:18:22.945
WITH THE VERY CARD
SHE GAVE TO ME.

00:18:22.945 --> 00:18:26.115
Ishizu: PEGASUS CREATED
3 ALL-POWERFUL CARDS

00:18:26.115 --> 00:18:28.384
THAT WERE NEVER RELEASED
TO THE PUBLIC.

00:18:28.384 --> 00:18:31.053
THEY ARE KNOWN AS
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS:

00:18:31.053 --> 00:18:33.189
OBELISK, THE TORMENTOR;

00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:35.324
SLIFER, THE SKY DRAGON;

00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:38.261
AND THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA.

00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:40.496
YOU CANNOT FATHOM
THE MAGICAL ENERGY

00:18:40.496 --> 00:18:41.797
CONTAINED WITHIN!

00:18:41.797 --> 00:18:43.699
PEGASUS COULD NOT CONTROL

00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:45.968
THE POWER OF
THE CARDS HE CREATED.

00:18:45.968 --> 00:18:49.005
THEY THREATENED TO
OVERWHELM AND DESTROY HIM!

00:18:49.005 --> 00:18:51.307
RARE HUNTERS THEN
STOLE THESE CARDS

00:18:51.307 --> 00:18:53.609
TO BUILD ALL-POWERFUL DECKS!

00:18:53.609 --> 00:18:55.578
BUT THEY DIDN'T STEAL ALL 3...

00:18:55.578 --> 00:18:58.114
THIS CARD IS FOR YOU...

00:18:58.114 --> 00:18:59.782
HMM? THAT'S IT!

00:18:59.782 --> 00:19:01.617
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR!

00:19:01.617 --> 00:19:04.320
I MANAGED TO RETRIEVE
ONE IN TIME.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.222
YOU MAY BORROW IT
DURING THE TOURNAMENT,

00:19:06.222 --> 00:19:08.491
BUT I EXPECT IT BACK.

00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:09.959
Kaiba: SHE WILL
REGRET THE DAY

00:19:09.959 --> 00:19:12.461
SHE HANDED ME
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:15.264
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE DAY
SHE SEALED HER DOOM!

00:19:15.264 --> 00:19:17.800
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO
FINISH HER OFF!

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.402
IT'S OVER!

00:19:19.402 --> 00:19:22.305
ISHIZU WILL BE ELIMINATED
BY THE VERY BEAST

00:19:22.305 --> 00:19:25.074
THAT SHE PLACED IN MY HAND...

00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:27.610
OBELISK, THE TORMENTOR!

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.612
BEFORE I PLAY THIS CARD...

00:19:29.612 --> 00:19:33.115
DARK GREMLIN, ATTACK
HER LIFE POINTS NOW!

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:34.116
[ROARING]

00:19:34.116 --> 00:19:35.117
OH!

00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:40.022
SO, TELL ME,

00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:42.792
DID YOU PREDICT THAT
WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU?

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:46.629
THE DARK GREMLIN IS THE LEAST
OF YOUR PROBLEM'S, ISHIZU!

00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:51.067
'CAUSE I PLAN TO DESTROY YOU
WITH MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD NOW!

00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:53.169
YOUR FUTURE IS DECIDED.

00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:55.271
USE OBELISK AND YOU'LL
BE DESTROYED.

00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:56.872
WRONG!

00:19:56.872 --> 00:19:58.507
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:19:58.507 --> 00:20:00.876
NOTHING CAN SAVE YOU
FROM OBELISK'S WRATH!

00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:02.845
SO, DON'T RESIST IT!

00:20:02.845 --> 00:20:05.348
FOR THE END IS HERE!

00:20:05.348 --> 00:20:07.216
[LAUGHS]
