HA! WHAT A JOKE!

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:14.501
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH
OUTTA DA PEANUT GALLERY, HAH?

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:15.669
I PREDICTED
YOU WERE DUMB,

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.437
BUT WHO KNEW YOU WERE
THAT MUCH OF A FOOL?

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.873
WATCH YASELF,
YA MIND-READIN'
FREAK SHOW!

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:21.908
I WAS JUST GIVIN' YA
A HEAD START

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.810
SO I DON'T
BEAT YOU TOO BAD.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.745
HMMMMMM...

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.214
COSMIC ENERGIES,
COME TO ME!

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:31.584
AH, THE CELESTIAL FORCES
AND THE UNIVERSAL VIBE

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:34.154
OF PSYCHIC TRUTH
TELL ME THAT THE TOP CARD

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.690
IN YOUR HAND
IS THE SWORDSMAN
OF LANDSTAR!

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.625
WHAT?
HMM...

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.560
HUH? HE'S RIGHT!

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.496
COULD HE REALLY HAVE
PSYCHIC POWERS?

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.832
NO WAY. I'VE SEEN
DIS TRICK BEFORE!

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.100
THIS IS A SCAM!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.104
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
OF MY TELEPATHIC POWERS.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.807
MY ABILITY TO TAP
INTO THE COSMIC UNIVERSE

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.242
IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOUR
PEANUT-SIZED BRAIN

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.011
TO COMPREHEND,
JOEY WHEELER.

00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:59.446
NOW YOU'RE
TICKIN' ME OFF!

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:02.349
TOO BAD.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.484
NAAH!

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.519
NOW I'LL SUMMON
CYBER RAIDER!

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.258
AND SINCE YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS ON THE FIELD....

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.695
I CAN DIRECT THE ATTACK
AT YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.634
UNH!

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.770
THIS ISN'T MY DAY,
SO FAR.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.438
I CAN'T LOSE
TO THIS MISFIT.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.374
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
WHEELER?

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:30.377
CYBER RAIDER
GOT YOU DOWN?

00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:33.146
OR, YOU READY FOR MORE?

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.081
[BEEPING]

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.583
[THINKING]
HMM. WHAT'S
GOING ON?

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.318
JOEY'S GETTING WHIPPED
BY THIS GUY.

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:39.552
IF HE LOSES
THIS DUEL,

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:40.887
HE'S OUTTA
THE TOURNAMENT!

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.756
HOW'S HE DOING?
OH!

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.257
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE GIVING ME

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.658
THE PLAY-BY-PLAY,
REMEMBER?

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.093
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.328
UM, NO.

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:49.662
IT'S ALL GOOD!

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.064
IT'S JUST THAT
THIS DUEL HAS BEEN

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.700
SO TOTALLY ONE-SIDED,
IT'S A SNOOZE.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.335
AH! SO THAT MEANS
MY BROTHER

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:56.336
IS WINNING, RIGHT?

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:57.804
UM...SURE!

00:08:57.804 --> 00:09:00.407
COME ON, HE WAS
THE RUNNER-UP
AT DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:02.709
AND THIS TIME,
HE'S GOING STRAIGHT
TO THE TOP!

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.646
THANKS, TRISTAN.

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:07.847
[SIGHING]

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.883
DON'T MAKE ME
A LIAR, JOEY.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.585
Roba: I PREDICT
THAT YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.020
YOU WISH, ROBA!

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.489
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:22.262
HMM.

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:23.396
HANG IN THERE, JOEY.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.800
I KNOW YOU CAN BEAT
THIS GUY ON YOUR OWN!

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.869
I HAVE A FEELING
THIS SO-CALLED
PSYCHIC DUELIST

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.805
ISN'T ALL
HE CLAIMS TO BE.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:34.274
Boy: LET'S TELL ESPA
WHAT ELSE THIS GUY'S GOT.

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:35.375
I'M PRETTY SURE

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.944
THAT I SEE GRACEFUL DICE
UNDER HIS SWORDSMAN.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.212
OKAY, BIG BROTHER.

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:42.148
GRACEFUL DICE IS
UNDER HIS SWORDSMAN.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.384
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE IS A FAKE!

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.524
I PREDICT YOU'RE READY
TO QUIT!

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:54.127
YEAH? WELL,
GUESS AGAIN, ROBA.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.562
THIS DUEL'S NOT OVER.

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:57.964
AND I KNOW YOU'RE
UP TO SOMETHING.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:58.965
First brother:
HOLD ON.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:01.067
HE JUST DREW ANOTHER
GRACEFUL DICE.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.869
OKAY, BRO,
NOW LISTEN UP...

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:06.806
YOUR OPPONENT JUST PICKED UP
ANOTHER GRACEFUL DICE.

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:09.742
TAPPING IN...
OHM.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.911
[GROANING]
NOT THIS STUFF AGAIN!

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.380
AHHHHHHHHH...

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.850
YOU JUST DREW YET ANOTHER
GRACEFUL DICE CARD,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.218
AM I RIGHT, WHEELER?

00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:19.385
HUH?

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.055
THAT GUY'S ABOUT
TO LOSE HIS MIND!

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:23.289
Yugi, thinking:
THIS LITTLE SCHEME

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.725
MAY HAVE GOTTEN
THEM THIS FAR
IN THE TOURNAMENT,

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.895
BUT I KNOW JOEY WILL
DEFEAT THESE CHEATS!

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.063
DON'T FEEL BAD...

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.397
NO ONE EXPECTS YOU
TO KEEP UP

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:34.033
WITH MY UNIQUE
TELEPATHIC DUELING POWERS.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:37.470
I FORESEE THAT YOUR
BATTLE CITY DAYS ARE OVER

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.471
AND THAT
YOUR RAREST CARD

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.640
WILL BE SITTING
IN MY DECK SOON!

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.409
IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,
WHEELER!

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.677
HMM!

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:45.945
OHH.

DEFINITELY
UP TO SOMETHIN'.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:49.816
HE SAID HE "KNEW"
I PICKED UP

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.918
A SECOND
GRACEFUL DICE CARD
FROM THE DECK,

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.486
AND HE WAS
ALMOST RIGHT...

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.155
BUT NOT QUITE.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.756
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO PLAY

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.158
SOME MIND GAMES
OF MY OWN

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.492
WITH THIS CHEAT!

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.927
IT'S MY TURN!

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.099

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.403
AND NOW,

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.238
I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN,

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:13.773
AND END MY TURN!

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:19.012
BOTH GRACEFUL DICE
CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.447
[SNORTING]
HOW PREDICTABLE.

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:24.017
GRACEFUL DICE ALLOWS
WHEELER TO ROLL ONE DIE

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.419
TO BOOST THE POWER
OF ONE OF HIS MONSTERS.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.987
ITS ATTACK POINTS
ARE THEN MULTIPLIED

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.522
BY THE NUMBER ROLLED.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.990
[SPEAKING]
LET ME GUESS.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.158

TO ACTIVATE

BOTH OF YOUR
GRACEFUL DICE CARDS

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:36.262
AS SOON AS MY
CYBER RAIDER ATTACKS...

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:39.566
AND MULTIPLY YOUR
SWORDSMAN OF LANDSTAR'S
ATTACK POINTS.

AM I WARM?

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.869
YOU'RE BURNING UP.
HMM.

BUT YOU'LL BE
EVEN MORE STEAMED

WHAT A FRAUD
YOU REALLY ARE.

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:49.375

YOU CAN ONLY PLAY

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.845
ONE GRACEFUL DICE CARD

A SKULL DICE
TRAP CARD!

OF TRICK?

DON'T CHEAT ME!

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.873

YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

DEPENDING
ON THE ROLL
OF THE DIE.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.676
THE HIGHER
THE NUMBER,

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:31.411
THE MORE
YOUR MONSTER'S
POINTS ARE REDUCED!

LOOKS LIKE YOUR PSYCHIC
FRIENDS DROPPED THE BALL.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.896

YOU KNEW I HAD
TWO DICE CARDS,

BUT YOU COULDN'T
TELL WHICH ONES...

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:02.842

YOUR ESP GAME
WAS JUST A CON!

YOU COULDN'T SEE
MY CARDS AT ALL!
