MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
FOR YOU TO GET TO HIM.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.795
HUH?

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.831
Man: I TRUST YOU'VE MADE
YOURSELF AT HOME IN THERE.

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.337
RISE AND SHINE.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:52.339
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH ALL OF THIS,

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.840
YOU CAPED CLOWN?

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.110
YOU'LL LEARN WHAT
WE HAVE PLANNED
FOR YOU SOON ENOUGH.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.678
FOR NOW, YOU ARE
TO KEEP QUIET

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:00.413
AND DO WHAT YOU
ARE TOLD TO DO.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:01.581
OR WHAT?!

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.850
YOU RARE HUNTERS THINK
YOU'RE SO TOUGH, DON'T YOU,

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.052
RUNNING AROUND IN
YOUR DARK HOODS!

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.854
WHY DON'T YOU UNTIE
ME FROM THIS CHAIR

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.256
AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT
BEING A TOUGH GUY'S ALL ABOUT,

DON'T YOU
THINK THAT

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.857
YOU'RE JUST
A LITTLE TOO OLD

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:53.560
TO BE PLAYING
WITH DOLLIES,
RARE HUNTER?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.863
ESPECIALLY ONES
THAT HAVE SUCH
LOW ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.098
[THINKING] THAT'S WEIRD.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.866
WHY WOULD THEY PLAY
SUCH A WEAK MONSTER?

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.268

WELL, AS ITS NAME
SUGGESTS, KAIBA,

MY MASK OF WEAKNESS IS
WEAKENING YOUR BLUE EYES.

AND THEN...

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.377
I'LL PLAY MASK

DEPENDING ON SOMEONE
ELSE FOR MY VICTORY,

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.186
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
I MAY NEED TO USE YUGI

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:03.423
TO DEFEAT THESE TWO
AND SAVE MY LITTLE BROTHER.

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:04.524

AS I RECALL, ROGUE DOLL
WAS YOUR MONSTER!

LIKE LUMIS AND UMBRA

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.355

IN THE END,

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:38.458
THAT COULD CAUSE THEM
TO LOSE THE WHOLE DUEL!

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.360
THAT'S WHAT I KEEP
TRYING TO TELL KAIBA!

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.861
WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING
A DOUBLE DUEL,

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:44.030
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS TEAMWORK.

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.400

FAR FROM OVER!

BUT I HAVE
A CARD IN MY HAND

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.374
THAT WILL ANNIHILATE
IT FOR GOOD!

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:56.676
IF LUMIS FOILS
MY PLANS AGAIN,

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:58.811
KAIBA'S DRAGON
WILL DESTROY ME!

00:12:58.811 --> 00:12:59.879
SO, FROM NOW ON,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:03.616
I WON'T DEPEND ON
ANYONE BUT MYSELF!

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.619
I PLACE ONE CARD

YOUR FRIEND LUMIS?

YES, LUMIS.

WHITE DRAGON

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.334

INSTEAD OF UMBRA?

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:04.170
WOULD HE HAVE PROTECTED
YOU WITH HIS MAGIC CARD?

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.205

LET YOU LOSE?

THAT'S THE DANGER IN
DEPENDING ON SOMEONE ELSE

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.512
TO HELP YOU
WHEN THE REALITY IS

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:15.114
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON

YOU OTHERWISE,

FOR ME, LUMIS!

[THINKING] NOW I GET WHAT
KAIBA'S TRYING TO DO!

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:33.900
HE NOTICED THAT
LUMIS AND UMBRA

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.335
WERE BEGINNING TO DOUBT
ONE ANOTHER'S LOYALTY,

ADVANTAGE OF THAT

THEIR TEAM TRUST.

KAIBA'S RIGHT.

UMBRA SEEMS TO BE
IN THIS FOR HIMSELF.

TAKE ALL THE CREDIT

ALWAYS LIKE HIM BETTER!

FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.596

THREE CARDS GOES THE CHOOSER.

ONE CARD AT RANDOM.
