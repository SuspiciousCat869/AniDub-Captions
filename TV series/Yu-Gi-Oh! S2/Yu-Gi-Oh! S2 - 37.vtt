LISTEN CLOSELY,

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.273
THE TIME HAS COME

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:08.408
TO PUT THE FINAL
PART OF MY PLAN
INTO MOTION.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:11.778
THIS IS WHERE I
NEED YOUR HELP, ODION.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.081
I MUST HIDE MY IDENTITY.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.949
EVERYONE SHALL THINK
YOU ARE ME.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.618
AS FOR MYSELF,

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:20.621
THOSE FOOLS ALREADY
BELIEVE ME TO BE
A FRIEND NAMED NAMU.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.222
I'LL GAIN
THEIR TRUST,

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.025
THEN CRUSH THEM
WITH THE WINGED
DRAGON OF RA!

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.961
I'LL KEEP BAKURA'S
MILLENNIUM RING,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.463
AND I'LL ALSO
MAINTAIN

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.265
OCCASIONAL CONTROL
OVER TEA'S MIND.

THE SECOND DUEL OF THE BATTLE
CITY FINALS IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

AND THE FIRST DUELIST

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.488
JOEY WHEELER!

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.489
Serenity:
AWESOME!

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.557
YEAH!

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:05.726
IT'S TIME TO KICK
SOME MAJOR BUTT!

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:09.830
AND MR. WHEELER'S
OPPONENT IN THIS DUEL IS

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.799
NUMBER 7--MARIK ISHTAR!

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.301
IT'S GO TIME!

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.703
Thinking: JOEY'S
FACING OFF AGAINST MARIK!

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.805
I'M SURE HE'S PLANNING
ON USING HIS MILLENNIUM ROD

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:23.210
TO WIN THIS DUEL,
SO JOEY'S GOT TO BE
READY FOR ANYTHING.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.212
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
A PARACHUTE

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.114
'CAUSE I'M BLASTING
YOU RIGHT OFF THIS BLIMP!

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.915
YOU GOT THAT, MARIK?

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.186
ALL RIGHT!

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.188
BOTH DUELISTS WILL NOW TAKE
THEIR PLACES IN THE ARENA.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.657
ELEVATE THE FIELD!

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.125
Tristan: COME ON, JOEY!

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.926
THE WINNER OF THIS DUEL
WILL ADVANCE

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.095

THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.364

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.565

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.267
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.536
SO IF YOU'LL PLEASE
TAKE YOUR PLACES

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.538
ON EITHER END
OF THE PLAYING FIELD,

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.173
WE CAN GET THIS DUEL
UNDERWAY.

[GROWLING]

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:56.343

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.678
YEAH!

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.814
SHOW TATTOO-FACE WHAT
DUELING'S ALL ABOUT, JOEY!

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.883
WOW! JOEY LOOKS REALLY
FIRED UP TO DUEL MARIK!

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.718
OF COURSE, WHEN JOEY
GETS REALLY STEAMED,

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.653
HE TENDS TO SHOOT
HIS MOUTH OFF.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.056
BUT HE BETTER WATCH
WHAT HE SAYS TO THIS GUY.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.458
MARIK'S MEAN ENOUGH
WITHOUT JOEY'S LIP!

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.093
Thinking:
TRISTAN'S RIGHT.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.529
JOEY'S GOT TO STAY
FOCUSED. AND STOP SHUFFLING
HIS DECK ALREADY!

[GROWLING]

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.667
I HOPE
THAT JOEY'S OK.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.269
SERENITY!
I ALMOST FORGOT,

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.604
THIS IS YOUR
FIRST TIME SEEING YOUR
BROTHER DUEL, ISN'T IT?

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:25.939
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.575
WELL, I'M SURE WITH YOU
HERE CHEERING HIM ON,

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.911
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL LOSE.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.145
Roland:
LET'S GO, HUH?

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:35.215
YOU'VE SHUFFLED
ENOUGH CARDS
FOR 10 DUELS.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.384
NOW BOTH
OF YOU TAKE
YOUR POSITIONS!

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.720
Thinking: I'LL MAKE
THIS WACKO WISH

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.889
HE NEVER TRIED
TO CONTROL MY NOGGIN!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.859
YO! LISTEN UP,
YOU BALD-HEADED FREAK!

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.296
ACCORDING TO MY MATH,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL
WASHED UP IN 9 TURNS.

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.964
THAT'S IF YOU
CAN COUNT!

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.632
WHERE'D HE
COME UP
WITH 9?

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.434
Tristan: LOOK, WITH
JOEY YOU DON'T ASK.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.002
MY BROTHER'S
SO AWESOME,

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.538
HE'S GOT THIS WHOLE
DUEL CALCULATED
IN HIS HEAD ALREADY.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.940
THAT'S RIGHT, SERENITY.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.708
YOU JUST KEEP BELIEVING
EVERYTHING HE SAYS.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:08.415
Joey: THAT MUST BE
WHAT HE USED
TO CONTROL ME.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.517
Thinking:
THE MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.719
I KNEW MARIK
WOULD USE IT
TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.755
THAT COWARD CAN'T
WIN ON HIS OWN!

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:18.458
Joey: POINT THAT
THING SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND DUEL LIKE A MAN!

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.660
VERY WELL.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.095
LOOK, MARIK...

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.664
DID YOU SAY,
"VERY WELL"?

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:27.134
Thinking: THAT'S A RELIEF.

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.635
MARIK MUST HAVE REALIZED

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.438
THAT JOEY'S MIND IS
TOO STRONG TO BE CONTROLLED.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.707
THAT'S WHY
THE MILLENNIUM ROD
DIDN'T WORK LAST TIME!

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:35.342
Thinking:
LITTLE DO THEY KNOW

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:37.611
THAT ODION'S
MILLENNIUM ROD IS

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:41.515
MERELY A REPLICA OF
THE ORIGINAL ITEM
HELD BY ME.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.617
THESE FOOLS
WILL NEVER SUSPECT

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.887
THAT I AM THE ONE
THEY FEAR AND DESPISE
SO GREATLY!

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:49.222
AND WHILE I HIDE
SAFELY IN THE SHADOWS,

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.892
ODION WILL FIGHT
MY BATTLES FOR ME.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.794
BUT SOMETHING ELSE
CONCERNS ME.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.896
IT'S SETO KAIBA
AND HIS ROLE
IN THIS STRUGGLE.

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.964
LITTLE YUGI
ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.468
STANDING BETWEEN ME
AND THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH,

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.738
FOR THE ANCIENT TABLETS
ALSO DEPICT A SORCERER,

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:08.208
WHO BEARS A STRIKING
RESEMBLANCE TO KAIBA.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.277
AND WHAT CONCERNS ME
EVEN MORE IS

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:13.880
WHAT APPEARS TO BE
MY MILLENNIUM ROD IN
THE HANDS OF THIS SORCERER!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.416
SO I'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM AS WELL.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.518
AND BEFORE
THE FINALS ARE OVER,

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.420
KAIBA'S EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.489
OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.891
WILL BELONG TO ME!

[LAUGHING]

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.898
KAIBA COULD NEVER COMPREHEND
THAT CARD'S POWER!

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.734
AND AS LONG
AS ODION CONTINUES
TO DECEIVE EVERYONE

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.403
INTO BELIEVING HE IS ME,

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:40.173
MY PLAN TO OBTAIN
THE TWO REMAINING
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.710
AND YUGI'S MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE SHOULD BE SIMPLE.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.048
I'LL SHOW SETO KAIBA
WHAT TRUE POWER
IS ALL ABOUT.

00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:49.649
HEY, SETO!
IF MARIK REALLY IS

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.384
THE LEADER OF
THE RARE HUNTERS,

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.454
HE MUST HAVE, LIKE,
A TON OF RARE CARDS
IN HIS DECK!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.756
THERE'S ONLY ONE
CARD IN HIS DECK
I CARE ABOUT...

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.725
AND THAT'S HIS
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD--

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.560
THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.896
AND HOPEFULLY
THAT HACK JOEY WHEELER

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:04.731
WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH
IN THIS DUEL

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.133
FOR ME TO SEE HOW
MARIK'S CARD WORKS

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.569
SO I CAN WIN IT
FOR MYSELF.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.638
LISTEN TO ME, ODION!

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.507
IF YOU CAN'T DEFEAT THIS
PATHETIC FOOL--JOEY WHEELER,

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:18.044
THEN YOU DON'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST THE PHARAOH!

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.146
SO UNLESS
YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:23.049
AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY
TO THE SHADOW REALM,

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.086
I'D SUGGEST YOU REFRAIN
FROM DISAPPOINTING ME.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:28.622
YES, MASTER MARIK.
I PLEDGE MY WORD

AS UNPREDICTABLE
AS THIS GUY.

WELL, WE'VE ALL SEEN
THE KIND OF EVIL
MARIK'S CAPABLE OF,

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.404

HE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

TO KEEP HIS COOL.

I'LL HAVE
KNOCKED HIM OUT
OF THE COMPETITION

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.853
AND SAVED
THE WORLD. I'LL BE
FAMOUS, BABY.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.472
NICE CATCH,
BIG BROTHER!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.441
Thinking:
NOTE TO SELF,

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:56.042
BEWARE OF
GUSTY WINDS!

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.811
WHAT WAS KAIBA
THINKING, HOLDING
A DUEL UP HERE?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.347
Thinking: COME ON, JOEY.
STAY FOCUSED.

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:02.182
NOW, THEN,
WHERE WAS I?

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.817
ACTING
LIKE A FOOL!

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.652
THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU, MARIK!

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.721
SO CHECK THIS OUT.

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.222
NOW I SUMMON

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.757
GEARFRIED
THE IRON KNIGHT

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:13.927
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.162
AH, NOW THIS IS
LOOKING LIKE A DUEL!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.298
AND THERE'S
MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.667
NOW LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT,
TOUGH GUY.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.702
I'M WAITING.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.338
I'LL PLAY
TEMPLE OF THE KINGS--

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.474
A CARD LIKE NONE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN!

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.044
Joey:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.950
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT
BUILDING, MARIK?

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.651
THE STRUCTURE
BEHIND ME IS

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.887
THE ANCIENT
TEMPLE OF THE KINGS.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.690
WITHIN THIS
5,000-YEAR-OLD
SANCTUARY LIE

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.925
THE GREATEST TREASURES
OF THE KINGS OF EGYPT.

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.861
AND WHAT DOES
THAT BIG SHACK DO?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.596
TO PROTECT
THE KINGS' TREASURE,

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:53.500
IT LIMITS THE NUMBER
OF MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS
YOU CAN PLAY IN ONE TURN.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.667
AW, MAN!

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.770
AND IN FRONT
OF THE TEMPLE,

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.673
I'LL LAY TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN AS AN EXTRA
BOUNDARY OF PROTECTION.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:03.877
AND WITH THIS MOVE
I END MY TURN.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.179
SO TRY TO ATTACK ME
IF YOU DARE.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:09.816
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT DANGER LURKS
WITHIN THESE TEMPLE WALLS.

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:12.318
MARIK HASN'T EVEN
SUMMONED ONE MONSTER!

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:13.653
ATTACK HIS
LIFE POINTS!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.821
THAT'S STUPID.

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.356
OH, AND WHY'S THAT?

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:18.391
BECAUSE MARIK
PROBABLY WANTS
HIM TO ATTACK

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.360
SO HE CAN
ACTIVATE HIS
FACEDOWN CARDS

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.128
AND PUT
A SERIOUS
HURTING ON JOEY.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.596
IT'S WAY TOO
RISKY, DUMMY.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:24.731
GOOD POINT.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.733
Thinking: JOEY DOES
NEED TO WATCH OUT

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.134
FOR MARIK'S
FACEDOWN CARDS,

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.637
BUT WHAT WORRIES ME EVEN MORE
IS MARIK'S EGYPTIAN TEMPLE.

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.472
WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S HIDING IN THERE?

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.340
Thinking: THESE FOOLS
HAVE NO IDEA

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.109
OF THE ANCIENT FURY
THAT AWAITS THEM!

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:38.645
I CAN'T LET HIM
SMELL MY FEAR.

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.213
STAY CALM, JOEY.

00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:41.714
Serenity:
EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, JOEY?

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.583
Tristan: YOU LOOK
PRETTY SCARED, DUDE!

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.585
Thinking: THAT'S WHAT I
WAS AFRAID OF.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.587
OK, IF I'M GONNA
BEAT THIS GUY,

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.756
I GOT TO PULL
MYSELF TOGETHER.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.491
WHAT AM I
WORRIED ABOUT?

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:54.260
THAT TWO-BIT TEMPLE'S
GOT NOTHING ON
MY GIANT TRUNADE!

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.963
THIS CARD WILL GET
RID OF ALL HIS MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:59.232
SO I CAN TOTALLY
DISMANTLE HIS
TEMPLE OF THE KINGS.

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:00.967
Marik: WHAT'S THE DELAY?

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.969
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.404
YOU'RE FINISHED,
MR. WHEELER?

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.272
SO MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.675
I GOT MY PLAN
TO WIN THIS DUEL
ALL FIGURED OUT.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.777
FIRST, I'LL SUMMON
A FEW MORE MONSTERS

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.746
TO BUILD UP
MY ATTACK POWER,
BUT I WON'T ATTACK.

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.215
THEN MARIK
WILL PROBABLY PLAY

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:16.883
A COUPLE MORE
FACEDOWN CARDS,

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.451
THINKING HE'S
GOT ME TRAPPED.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.320
AND THAT'S WHEN
I'LL SPRING MY GIANT
TRUNADE ON HIM,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.388
BLASTING AWAY
ALL HIS TRAP CARDS

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:25.024
AND REDUCING
HIS TEMPLE TO
A PILE OF RUBBLE!

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:27.160
AND FINALLY,
MY ARMY OF MONSTERS

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.062
WILL WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:30.830
[YELLING]

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.600
THAT EVIL FREAKSHOW
WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT HIM.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.702
SAY GOOD NIGHT,
MARIK!

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.637
I SUMMON
TINY GUARDIAN

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.139
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.707
[GROWLS]

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:43.576
AND THAT'S ALL
I'M GONNA DO FOR
NOW, CHROME DOME.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.945
JOEY'S GOT TO ATTACK
HIM SOMETIME.

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.748
I'M SURE THAT
MY BIG BROTHER HAS
SOME KIND OF PLAN.

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.517
OBSERVE, YOU FOOL...

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:53.953
I PLACE TWO MORE CARDS
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD,

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:56.389
AND NOW MY MOVE
IS COMPLETE.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.892
NOW MARIK'S GOT
4 CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:00.894
THAT SPINELESS SNAKE
IS JUST GONNA SIT BACK

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:02.929
AND WAIT FOR JOEY
TO ATTACK HIM!

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.732
WHEN HE DOES, MARIK WILL
SPRING ONE OF HIS TRAPS.

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:09.002
IT'S THE OLDEST AND WIMPIEST
TRICK IN THE BOOK.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.538
ALL RIGHT, CUE BALL,
TAKE THIS!

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.973
I SUMMON
HAYABUSA KNIGHT!

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:16.976
[SQUAWKS]

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.912
NOW I HAVE
ENOUGH MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.980
TO WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.416
BUT FIRST I GOT TO
PLAY GIANT TRUNADE

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:26.286
AND CLEAR THE FIELD
OF ALL HIS MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:28.288
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO DEMOLISH

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:29.622
THAT ANCIENT
PALACE OF YOURS...

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:30.623
HMM?

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:32.559
WITH THIS!

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.128
I PLAY
GIANT TRUNADE!

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:39.799
YES!

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.701
MARIK WILL HAVE
NOTHING ON THE FIELD
TO PROTECT HIMSELF!

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.469
IT LOOKS LIKE JOEY'S
THE WINNER!

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:46.506
BEATING THIS GUY
WAS WAY EASIER
THEN I THOUGHT.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:47.807
COME ON, TRUNADE,

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:50.143
BLOW HIS CARDS
OFF THE FIELD!

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:51.277
WHAT?!

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.712
WHY DID IT STOP?

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.514
YOUR CARDS SHOULD
HAVE BEEN HISTORY.

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:56.249
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:59.352
YOUR GIANT TRUNADE
IS NO MORE.

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:02.555
AND YOUR TROUBLES
HAVE ONLY JUST BEGUN.

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.930
I DON'T GET
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
TO MY MAGIC CARD.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.833
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
GET RID OF EVERY CARD
YOU HAD ON THE FIELD.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.468
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:18.471
WHEN YOU MADE
THE VERY FOOLISH
DECISION TO ACTIVATE

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:20.573
YOUR GIANT TRUNADE,
MR. WHEELER,

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.842
YOU IN TURN TRIGGERED
ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS TRAPS

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:25.278
I'VE PLACED ON THE FIELD
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:26.479
IS THAT SO?

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.248
YES.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.283
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO PAY THE PRICE
FOR YOUR MISTAKE.

00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:33.286
YOU SEE, WITH ALL OF
MY TRAP CARDS IN PLAY,

00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:35.421
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
ATTACK ME WITH A MONSTER.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.057
YOU'D TRY TO DESTROY
MY TRAPS WITH A MAGIC CARD.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:41.461
OH. SO YOU PLAYED
A TRAP CARD THAT
DESTROYS MAGIC CARDS?

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:44.063
BUT THAT'S NOT
ALL THAT IT DOES.

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.665
THE TRAP YOU'VE
JUST TRIGGERED

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:47.734
IS ABOUT TO DEVASTATE
ALL OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:50.370
AND AN EXTREMELY
LARGE PORTION OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.838
SO PREPARE TO FEEL

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.306
ITS WRATH RIGHT NOW!

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:56.409
GO, JUDGMENT OF ANUBIS!

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.615
NEVER HAVE YOU
EXPERIENCED

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.952
A TRAP WITH A DESTRUCTIVE
FORCE SUCH AS THIS!

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.354
JUDGMENT OF ANUBIS
WILL NOW ANNIHILATE

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.189
EVERY MONSTER YOU
HAVE ON THE FIELD

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:13.092
AND DEDUCT HALF OF
THEIR ATTACK POINTS
FROM YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.294
WHAT? NO WAY!

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.297
ANUBIS, DESTROY!

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.269
BUILDING UP YOUR ARMY
OF POWERFUL MONSTERS

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.405
WAS A GRAVE MISCALCULATION

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.173
BECAUSE THEY'RE
ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.776
WITH MORE THAN 2,000
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:36.215
HEY! YOU JUST
WASTED MY BEST GUYS.

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.217
WHEN YOU SEE
THE HORRORS
THAT AWAIT YOU,

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:40.320
THOSE MONSTERS
WILL BE THE LAST THING
ON YOUR MIND.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.988
BY THINKING HE
HAD THE DUEL WON,

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.723
JOEY FELL RIGHT INTO
MARIK'S TRAP.

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:45.325
THAT'S
RIGHT, TEA.
JOEY THOUGHT

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.826
BY NOT
ATTACKING
WITH MONSTERS,

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.528
HE WAS
SAFE FROM
MARIK'S TRAPS.

00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:50.563
BUT THE TRICKIEST
AND MOST DANGEROUS
CARDS IN DUEL MONSTERS

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:53.800
ARE TRAP CARDS,
AND NOW MARIK'S FIELD
IS FULL OF THEM!

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.601
LET'S JUST HOPE JOEY
LEARNED HIS LESSON,

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.203
BECAUSE ONE MORE
MISTAKE LIKE THAT,

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.138
AND HE CAN KISS
THE FINALS GOOD-BYE!

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.840
AND HE'S COME TOO FAR

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.975
TO LOSE IT ALL TO A CREEP
WITH A BAD ATTITUDE,

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.345
NOT TO MENTION
A BAD HAIRDO.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.913
IT'S MORE OF
A HAIR-DON'T.

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:08.448
Serenity:
MARIK IS TOUGH,

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:10.650
BUT YOU STILL
THINK JOEY CAN
WIN, RIGHT, GUYS?

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.051
YEAH...SURE.

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:14.887
Tristan: THINK HE CAN WIN?
I KNOW HE CAN, RIGHT, YUGE?

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:16.589
MM-HMM. DON'T
WORRY, SERENITY.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.725
JOEY'S BEEN IN TOUGHER
SITUATIONS THAN THIS.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.460
HE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE SUPPORT FROM US,

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.462
AND HE'LL BE CRUSHING
MARIK IN NO TIME.

00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:24.831
COME ON, JOEY!
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:26.332
Tristan: YEAH.
HANG IN THERE, MAN.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.501
HAVE YOU REALIZED
YOU CAN'T WIN?

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:32.205
OR DO YOU WANT MORE
PUNISHMENT, MR. WHEELER?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.507
I GOT YOU GOOD.

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:36.175
YOU MAY NOT
REALIZE THIS

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.944
BECAUSE YOUR
PONYTAIL'S
TIED TOO TIGHT,

00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:40.513
BUT I FELL INTO
YOUR LITTLE TRAP
ON PURPOSE, MARIK!

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:41.948
YEAH, THAT'S
THE TICKET!

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:43.683
I WAS JUST TESTING
YOU TO SEE

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:45.418
IF YOUR DUELING
SKILLS WERE

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:47.320
ANY BETTER THAN
YOUR SENSE OF STYLE,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.922
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU PASSED MY EXAM.

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.891
NOW I'LL KICK
MY GAME UP A NOTCH

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.161
AND OPEN UP A BIG
TUB OF DUEL WHIP
ALL OVER YOU!

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:57.130
OK, HE HAS GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.831
I KNEW IT!

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.867
JOEY HAD THIS PLANNED
THE WHOLE TIME!

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.002
Thinking: WILL SOMEONE
PLEASE BUY THIS GIRL A CLUE?

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:04.971
I DON'T THINK MARIK'S
BUYING HIS STORY.

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:06.706
BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE
JOEY CREDIT

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:08.474
FOR STAYING STRONG
AND NEVER GIVING UP.

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:11.944
THE ONLY THING I GIVE
WHEELER CREDIT FOR
IS BEING ALL TALK.

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.880
ALL RIGHT, MARIK.
ENOUGH
STANDING AROUND.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.415
LET'S FINISH
THIS DUEL.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.984
YOU'RE IN QUITE
A RUSH TO LOSE.

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:20.520
NOW WATCH AS I PLACE
TWO MORE CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.388
AGAIN?

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:24.023
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:26.459
I'M GETTING REALLY
TIRED OF THIS.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.327
YOU KNOW,
THEY CALL THIS
GAME DUEL MONSTERS

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.163
'CAUSE YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO FIGHT
YOUR OPPONENT

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:32.298
WITH MONSTER CARDS,
NOT SPEND THE WHOLE
GAME HIDING

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.133
BEHIND YOUR
LITTLE TRAP CARDS
LIKE A COWARD.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.902
IF YOU CAN FIND ME

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:38.004
THE RULE THAT FORBIDS
ME FROM PLAYING
TRAP CARDS,

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:39.338
I'LL STOP, MR. WHEELER.

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:40.606
[GROWLS]

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.241
THAT DOES IT, MARIK!

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:44.243
I GUESS IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO SHOW YOU

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.078
HOW THIS GAME
IS SUPPOSED
TO BE PLAYED--

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.513
WITH MONSTERS!

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:48.948
SO NOW I SUMMON

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.150
ALLIGATOR'S
SWORD

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.985
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.722
IF I ATTACK NOW,

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:58.658
MARIK'S DEFINITELY
GONNA COUNTERACT
MY MOVE

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:00.793
WITH ONE OF
HIS FACEDOWN CARDS.

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.895
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE ANY MORE
LIFE POINTS.

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:06.232
I'M WAITING. I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE GOING TO SHOW ME

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.401
HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO PLAY THIS GAME. GO ON.

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:09.635
IF I STRIKE,

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.337
HE'LL KNOCK
ME OUT OF THE FINALS!

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.738
WHAT DO I DO?

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.779
I'M GONNA LET YOU
OFF EASY, MARIK,

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.547
BY HOLDING BACK
MY ATTACK

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.015
AND PLAYING
THIS CARD FACEDOWN.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.484
BACK TO YOU, BALDY.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.486
Thinking: THAT'S A SMART
MOVE FOR NOW,

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.187
BUT HE'LL HAVE TO ATTACK
MARIK EVENTUALLY,

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.456
AND WHEN HE DOES,
HE COULD LOSE EVERYTHING.

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:31.958
JOEY NEEDS A STRATEGY.

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.793
OK. LET'S GO!

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:37.263
ACTUALLY, I CHOOSE
TO END MY TURN WITHOUT
MAKING ANY MOVE.

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:39.365
Thinking: WHAT? HE'S
SKIPPING HIS TURN?

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.434
HE'S TRYING TO FORCE
ME TO ATTACK HIM.

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:44.003
TWO CAN PLAY
AT THAT GAME,
SO I PASS, ALSO.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.906
PERHAPS NOW I'LL DRAW
A CARD WORTH USING.

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.875
NO. THIS ONE
WON'T DO AT ALL.

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.710
I'LL PASS AGAIN.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.813
ALL RIGHT, NOW THIS IS
GETTING OUT OF HAND, SETO.

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:55.815
IF NEITHER ONE OF
THEM PLAYS A CARD,

00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:57.650
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG
DUEL, AND BORING, TOO.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.252
NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.053
HUH?

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.356
KNOWING WHEELER'S
AMATEUR STYLE,

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.157
HE'LL CRACK LONG
BEFORE MARIK DOES.

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:06.859
YOU ASKED FOR IT!

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.227
OH, NO!

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.896
HEY, COME ON, JOEY.
DON'T ATTACK.

00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:11.531
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE
WANTS YOU TO DO.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.266
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:15.134
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
KNOW WHAT HIT YOU!

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:16.669
HERE IT COMES RIGHT NOW!

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:19.405
I SUMMON ROCKET WARRIOR!

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.940
YOU ASKED FOR IT!

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.276
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY TRAP CARDS
YOU GOT ON THE FIELD

00:17:23.276 --> 00:17:25.378
'CAUSE I DIDN'T COME
TO THE FINALS TO WATCH!

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.648
I FOUGHT MY WAY HERE
TO DUEL LIKE A MAN

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:30.449
AND TO WIN THIS, MARIK.

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:34.320
NOW, ROCKET WARRIOR,
ATTACK HIS LIFE
POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.557
SEEK AND DESTROY!

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.458
JOEY, THIS IS
A BIG MISTAKE!

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:42.795
ACTIVATE TRAP CARD!

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:45.164
EYE OF UJAT!

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:52.772
NOW THAT THE EYE OF UJAT
APPEARS ON THE FRONT
OF YOUR ROCKET WARRIOR,

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:54.574
IT IS UNDER MY CONTROL,

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:57.176
AND I SHALL REDIRECT
ITS ATTACK TOWARD
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.311
NO WAY.

00:17:58.311 --> 00:17:59.579
ROCKET WARRIOR,

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.381
ATTACK HIS
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.218
I DON'T
THINK THAT'S
GONNA WORK!

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.220
I GOT A FACEDOWN
CARD, TOO!

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.357
ACTIVATE FAIRY BOX!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.228
Thinking: WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:18.464
HE'S ACTIVATED A TRAP CARD
TO HIDE HIS MONSTER?

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:20.132
THANKS TO FAIRY BOX,

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.401
ROCKET WARRIOR'S PLAN
OF ATTACK HAS BEEN
SHORT-CIRCUITED!

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.370
TIME TO
PLAY PEEK-A-BOO!

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.374
ROCKET WARRIOR,
ATTACK AT ONCE!

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:29.709
SO MUCH FOR THAT.

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.215
I MISSED?

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:38.584
NYAH NYAH! I GUESS YOU
HAVEN'T HUNG OUT

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:40.319
IN THE ARCADE
IN A WHILE, HUH?

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.388
I'M ON TO YOUR
LITTLE GAME, MARIK,

00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:44.991
AND I FOUND OUT
THE WEAKNESS OF
YOUR TRAP STRATEGY.

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:47.927
[ALL GASP]

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:50.830
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
ONE SINGLE MONSTER CARD,

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.599
JUST A DECK OVERLOADED
WITH TRAP CARDS, MARIK.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.668
TALK ABOUT PUTTING
ALL YOUR EGGS
IN ONE BASKET,

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:57.336
YOU EGG-HEAD.

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:00.406
SO ONCE I CLEAR
THE FIELD OF
YOUR TRAP CARDS,

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:02.508
THERE'LL BE NOTHING
PROTECTING
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:04.076
THAT'S WHY
I'M JOEY WHEELER,

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.611
FUTURE BATTLE CITY
CHAMPION,

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.514
AND YOU'RE JUST
SOME UGLY BALD FREAK
WEARING A CAPE, RIGHT?

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.549
YOU CAN INSULT ME
ALL YOU WANT.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:11.984
BUT THE TRUTH IS

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.486
YOU'VE ALREADY FALLEN INTO

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.887
ANOTHER ONE OF MY TRAPS.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:15.888
WHAT?!

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.490
ENOUGH TALK, ODION!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.924
FINISH HIM OFF

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.894
SO WE CAN MOVE
ON TO MORE
IMPORTANT MATTERS!

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.630
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I'VE FALLEN
INTO ANOTHER TRAP?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.898
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:28.367
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
WHAT I MEAN FIRSTHAND.

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.403
YOU SEE, WHILE I MAY
BE SHORT ON MONSTERS,

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:33.706
I POSSESS A TRAP CARD
THAT IS BOTH A TRAP
AND A MONSTER.

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:35.207
I THINK
THE BARBER CLIPPED
SOME OF YOUR BRAIN

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.742
WHEN HE WAS
CUTTING YOUR HAIR.

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.277
PREPARE TO EXPERIENCE

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.780
THE POWER OF AN EXTREMELY
RARE BREED OF CARD

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.782
THAT'S KNOWN
AS A TRAP-MONSTER!

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:44.183
BUT IS
THERE SUCH A CARD?

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.484
WELL, I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:48.654
NOT ONLY DO I POSSESS
A RARE TRAP-MONSTER CARD,

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:51.023
BUT WHEN YOU ATTACKED,
YOU ACTIVATED IT!

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.894
AND NOW FEEL THE RAGE
OF A CARD LIKE NONE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE!

00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:56.429
IT CAN'T BE!

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:57.863
IT IS!

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:02.835
THERE'S NO ESCAPING FROM
EMBODIMENT OF APOPHIS!

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:07.673
MY CARD ACTIVATES
LIKE A TRAP BUT ATTACKS
LIKE A MONSTER!

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:09.675
I'D SAY THIS CARD
DISPROVES

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:11.911
YOUR THEORY
ABOUT MY DECK
AND ITS WEAKNESS,

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:13.145
MR. WHEELER.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:14.814
SO IT'S TRUE?
MARIK HAS A CARD

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:19.118
THAT DOES THE JOB
OF A TRAP AND A MONSTER
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME?

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:20.853
I GUESS SO, MAI,
BUT I'M WORRIED

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:23.089
ABOUT HOW
POWERFUL ITS
ATTACK STRENGTH IS.

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:24.824
IF THIS CARD IS
STRONG ENOUGH,

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:27.526
WELL, THEN
THIS COULD BE
THE END OF JOEY.

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.895
I'M AFRAID IT ONLY GETS
WORSE, MR. WHEELER.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.297
YOU SEE,

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:33.733
YOU'VE TRIGGERED NOT ONE
BUT 3 OF MY APOPHIS CARDS.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.169
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR
YOU TO MEET YOUR DOOM.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.438
COME FORTH, MY BEASTS!

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:50.416
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.451
HE CAN ATTACK ME
WITH 3 MONSTERS.

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.386
THAT'S INSANE.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.021
I MUST SAY
I'M IMPRESSED.

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.390
Thinking: THOSE
MONSTERS CAN WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.193
YOU CAN DO THIS, JOEY!
JUST BE STRONG!

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.829
YOU'RE AT THE END
OF YOUR ROPE,
MR. WHEELER.

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:06.766
NOW, THEN, FOR SOMEONE
WHO WAS SO VOCAL BEFORE,
