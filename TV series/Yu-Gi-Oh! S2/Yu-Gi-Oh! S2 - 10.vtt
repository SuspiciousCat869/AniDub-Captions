THIS IS TEA.

DAYS ARE OVER, WHEELER!

HA HA HA!
THAT'S YOUR <i>BEST</i> MOVE?

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:04.918
THOSE HAIR BALLS
CAN'T SAVE YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:06.987
JINZO WILL TAKE THEM OUT
ONE BY ONE.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.621
THEN HE'LL DESTROY <i>YOU!</i>

I ASKED THE NURSE
TO TELL ME WHAT'S
BEEN GOING ON.

[SIGHS]
SORRY, SERENITY.

THAT'S SO SWEET,

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:11.084
BUT I--I HAVE TO KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT
MY BROTHER.

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:12.485
IF HE'S IN SOME KIND
OF TROUBLE,

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:13.853
I WANT TO BE
TOLD ABOUT IT.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.755
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE
FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED HIM,

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.924
AND NOW I NEED
TO BE THERE FOR HIM.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.527
ON THE DAY
OF MY EYE SURGERY,
I WAS SO SCARED.

UNTIL JOEY GOT THERE
AND STOOD BY ME.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:27.934

NEVER LET ME DOWN.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.302
NOW IT'S MY TURN

BE NEXT TO HIM,

MY NEW MONSTER IS
PRACTICALLY ATTACK-PROOF!

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.983
IT CAN REFLECT ANY
OF YOUR MONSTERS' ATTACKS

RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

SO EVEN IF YOU

IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE.
