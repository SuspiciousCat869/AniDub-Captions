TO END MY TURN

00:13:28.947 --> 00:13:30.315
WITHOUT PLAYING
A CARD.

00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:32.251
HMM.

00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:35.154
SPIRIT OF THE HARP
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:42.828
ALONG WITH A MAGIC CARD,
CHORUS OF SANCTUARY.

00:13:45.064 --> 00:13:46.498
MY LITTLE
CHERUB FRIEND

00:13:46.498 --> 00:13:47.966
INCREASES
THE DEFENSE POWER

00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:50.969
OF MY SPIRIT
OF THE HARP
BY 500 POINTS...

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.039
AND THAT'S MUSIC
TO MY EARS.

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:55.974
Yugi, thinking:
MAYBE JOHNNY'S
A FAR BETTER DUELIST

00:13:55.974 --> 00:13:58.077
THAN I'VE
GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR.

00:13:58.077 --> 00:13:59.511
WITH SPIRIT OF THE HARP
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:02.381
IT'S HARDER TO TAKE DOWN
HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:04.483
HMM.

00:14:04.483 --> 00:14:06.752
Yugi, thinking:
BUT HE STILL
MADE ONE MISTAKE,

00:14:06.752 --> 00:14:07.953
AND IT'S GONNA
COST HIM.

00:14:07.953 --> 00:14:09.488
Spirit:
READY, JOHNNY STEPS?

00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:11.990
BECAUSE IT'S
TIME FOR YOU
TO FACE THE MUSIC.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.094
I SUMMON
CURSE OF DRAGON
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:19.465
INCINERATE
WATER OMOTICS

00:14:19.465 --> 00:14:20.933
WITH YOUR DRAGON FLAME.

00:14:24.002 --> 00:14:25.771
OH! I JUST MESSED UP.

00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:28.373
I FORGOT TO SWITCH HER
INTO DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:28.373 --> 00:14:31.710
MMM. JOHNNY DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHO HE'S
UP AGAINST.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.879
SO FAR,
YOU'RE HITTING
ALL THE WRONG NOTES.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:35.047
DON'T WORRY.

00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:37.116
I'M JUST TUNING UP
FOR THE GRAND FINALE.

00:14:39.751 --> 00:14:41.053
BUT FIRST,

00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:43.021
A SURPRISE GUEST.

00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:45.991
WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:48.861
Yugi, thinking:
WHAT'S JOHNNY
PLANNING TO DO NOW?

00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:50.796
BUT THERE'S MORE
TO COME, DUEL FANS.

00:14:51.964 --> 00:14:54.366
I ACTIVATE
MY POLYMERIZATION CARD,

00:14:54.366 --> 00:14:56.168
FUSING WITCH OF
THE BLACK FOREST

00:14:56.168 --> 00:14:58.103
AND LADY OF FAITH
TOGETHER

00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:01.840
TO CREATE A WHOLE
NEW ROCK-AND-ROLLING ENTITY

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.208
BETTER KNOWN AS...

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:05.410
THE MUSICIAN KING.

00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:08.914
HOW ABOUT PLAYING
A LITTLE LULLABY

00:15:08.914 --> 00:15:10.215
FOR CELTIC GUARDIAN?

00:15:10.215 --> 00:15:11.783
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.727
Spirit: AH! NO!
MY CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:15:21.727 --> 00:15:22.995
Johnny: HA HA HA!

00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:24.163
I GUESS
YOUR CELTIC GUARDIAN

00:15:24.163 --> 00:15:27.032
WASN'T A BIG FAN
OF THE ELECTRIC GUITAR.

00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:29.368
I PROMISE THE MUSIC
WILL BE MUCH MORE ROMANTIC

00:15:29.368 --> 00:15:31.036
ON OUR DATE, TEA.

00:15:31.036 --> 00:15:32.471
HMM.

00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:35.541
I'LL JUST LAY THIS CARD
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD,

00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.010
ENDING MY TURN.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.279
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:42.948
HMM.

00:15:42.948 --> 00:15:44.516
CURSE OF DRAGON,

00:15:44.516 --> 00:15:47.953
FIRE YOUR FLAME
AND SILENCE
THE MUSICIAN KING!

00:15:47.953 --> 00:15:49.121
HA HA HA!

00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:50.322
YOU FELL INTO MY TRAP.

00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:52.024
I TOTALLY PLAYED YOU.

00:15:52.024 --> 00:15:53.125
A TRAP?

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.993
TIME TO CRANK UP
THE VOLUME

00:15:54.993 --> 00:15:56.528
WITH METALMORPH,

00:15:56.528 --> 00:15:58.363
WHICH TRANSFORMS
MUSICIAN KING

00:15:58.363 --> 00:16:00.933
INTO THE PUNK-ROCKING
HEAVY METAL KING.

00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:05.070
HIS ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.372
CLIMB UP TO THE TOP
OF THE CHARTS.

00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:12.878
PLAY THE DRAGON
A COUPLE OF RIFFS.

00:16:20.953 --> 00:16:22.154
HMM.

00:16:22.154 --> 00:16:23.722
HOW PATHETIC.

00:16:23.722 --> 00:16:25.991
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A ONE-HIT WONDER.

00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:28.894
[THINKING]
COULD JOHNNY
ACTUALLY WIN?

00:16:28.894 --> 00:16:30.996
GIANT SOLDIER
OF STONE

00:16:30.996 --> 00:16:32.297
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:34.032 --> 00:16:36.001
YOU CAN'T REALLY
EXPECT THAT BOULDER

00:16:36.001 --> 00:16:38.070
TO STOP
MY HEAVY METAL KING,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.072
ESPECIALLY NOT
WITH METALMORPH.

00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:44.042
IT INCREASES HIS POWER
WITH EVERY ATTACK.

00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:45.944
I THINK THIS NEXT SONG

00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:48.347
IS GOING TO BE JUST
A TREMENDOUS SMASH.

00:16:48.347 --> 00:16:50.349
AND...KICK IT!

00:16:59.124 --> 00:17:01.360
THE SPIRIT'S
IN MAJOR TROUBLE.

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.627
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE UP ALREADY, LOSER?

00:17:07.627 --> 00:17:09.028
NONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:12.599
CAN JAM WITH
MY HEAVY METAL KING.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.568
Spirit:
I CALL FORTH
DARK MAGICIAN.

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:21.941
ATTACK
HEAVY METAL KING!

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:24.477
THE FUN JUST NEVER ENDS.

00:17:24.477 --> 00:17:25.545
WITH METALMORPH'S
EFFECT,

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.447
HEAVY METAL KING'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:29.616
IS GREATER THAN
DARK MAGICIAN'S.

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.317
JOHNNY, YOUR ABILITY
TO MISCALCULATE

00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:32.352
IS UNCANNY.

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:33.553
SAY WHAT?

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.922
YOUR OVERCONFIDENCE
RENDERS YOU BLIND.

00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:38.925
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:43.830
YOUR HEAVY METAL KING
HAS BEEN SHATTERED.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.399
IMPOSSIBLE--BECAUSE
METALMORPH RAISES

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.501
HEAVY METAL KING'S
ATTACK POWER.

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.702
YOU'RE ALMOST
CORRECT, JOHNNY,

00:17:49.702 --> 00:17:51.871
BUT YOU LEFT OUT
ONE RULE.

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.574
IT'S TRUE
METALMORPH INCREASES
YOUR ATTACK POWER,

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:57.577
BUT ONLY WHEN
YOUR MONSTER
ATTACKS.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.279
BUT SINCE
<i>MY</i> MONSTER
ATTACKED,

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:01.881
HEAVY METAL KING
DIDN'T RECEIVE
THE POWER BONUS,

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:03.449
LEAVING HIS ATTACK
STRENGTH

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.352
LESS THAN THAT OF
THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:08.555
METALMORPH IS
A POWERFUL CARD--

00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:10.356
WHEN USED
CORRECTLY--

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:12.025
BUT MAYBE YOU
SHOULD HAVE READ

00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:14.561
THE INSTRUCTION
MANUAL FIRST.

00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:17.597
I'VE PUT AN END TO
YOUR MUSICAL MAYHEM.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.999
BUT...THAT JUST
ISN'T FAIR.

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.768
YOU MUST HAVE CHEATED.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.403
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:24.437
Spirit: UH...

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.239
JUST CALL ME YUGI.

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:28.241
AH. WAIT JUST A SECOND.

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:30.343
THAT NAME SORT OF
RINGS A BELL.

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:32.445
OH! THERE'S NO WAY.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.582
NOT THE SAME YUGI
WHO DEFEATED PEGASUS
IN DUELIST KINGDOM?

00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:36.950
THAT CAN'T BE YOU.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.419
I SEE THAT MY NAME
STRUCK A CHORD.

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:41.588
IT'S TIME TO
FINISH THIS DUEL,

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:43.456
AND IT'S YOUR MOVE,
JOHNNY.

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:46.259
JUST FORGET IT.

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:47.427
I CAN'T HANG WITH YOU.

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:48.528
I'M OUT, MAN.

00:18:48.528 --> 00:18:50.563
I'M A DANCER,
NOT A DUELIST.

00:18:50.563 --> 00:18:51.731
UGH!

00:18:51.731 --> 00:18:53.766
YUGI TAKES A SLIGHT
LEAD IN THE DUEL,

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:55.501
AND YOU GIVE UP?

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.870
THAT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN YOU TRIED TO CHEAT

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.438
AND TRIPPED ME WHEN
I STARTED WINNING

00:18:58.438 --> 00:18:59.739
DURING THE DANCE BATTLE.

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.774
LOOK AT YOU, JOHNNY.
WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE?

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:03.676
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:05.511
WHEN THINGS TURN
A LITTLE BIT HAIRY,

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:07.780
YOU GET SCARED
AND START
RUNNING AWAY.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.350
HA! AND SO WHAT
IF I DO?

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.319
FORFEITING IS MUCH BETTER
THAN FACING DEFEAT.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.687
EVERYBODY LOVES
A WINNER.

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:17.257
I CAN'T LET PEOPLE
SEE ME AS A LOSER.

00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:19.525
TELL ME,
HOW MANY FRIENDS
DO YOU HAVE, JOHNNY?

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:22.528
UH...I'VE GOT TONS
AND TONS OF FRIENDS.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.596
NONE, RIGHT?

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:24.898
ONE--I THINK.

00:19:24.898 --> 00:19:26.266
ONE, HUH?

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:27.333
SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.468
BECAUSE THAT'S
ONE FRIEND MORE

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:30.203
THAN I WOULD HAVE
GUESSED YOU HAD.

00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:31.371
HEY, JUST WATCH
YOUR MOUTH.

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:33.006
I DON'T HAVE TO
STAY HERE AND TAKE THIS.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.274
I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:36.242
WHO DON'T FACE
THEIR PROBLEMS.

00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:37.577
HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:19:37.577 --> 00:19:39.679
EVERYBODY FAILS
SOMETIMES,

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.648
BUT THE IMPORTANT
THING IS HAVING
THE COURAGE

00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:43.750
TO LOOK TROUBLE
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.485
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE A WINNER,

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.487
BE SOMEONE WHO
NEVER GIVES UP.

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:48.655
YOU'VE GOT A POINT.

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.889
GUESS I WAS WRONG.

00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:56.429
HEY.

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:57.597
HUH?

00:19:57.597 --> 00:20:00.934
TEA, THANKS FOR
BEING HONEST WITH ME.

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:02.702
HMM.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.337
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:20:05.838 --> 00:20:06.973
HA HA!

00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:08.541
HOPEFULLY, NOW HE'LL
FACE HIS PROBLEMS

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:09.742
INSTEAD OF
RUNNING AWAY.

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:10.977
YOU'RE RIGHT,

00:20:10.977 --> 00:20:13.479
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:14.881
HUH?

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.449
HMM. HMM.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.651
Tea: WELL,
HERE WE ARE--

00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:20.453
THE DOMINO MUSEUM.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:22.555
I THINK
YOU WERE RIGHT

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:23.790
ABOUT THIS
EGYPTIAN EXHIBIT.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.592
I FEEL
IT MAY HOLD CLUES

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.928
TO THE MYSTERIES
OF MY ANCIENT PAST,

00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:31.564
ANSWERS TO SOME OF
MY QUESTIONS.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.832
THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING ME HERE

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:34.767
AND FOR HELPING ME
TODAY, TEA.

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:36.035
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:38.972
NO MATTER WHAT'S
BEYOND THOSE DOORS,

00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:40.406
