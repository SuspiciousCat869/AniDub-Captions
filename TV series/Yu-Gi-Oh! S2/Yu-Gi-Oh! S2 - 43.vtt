IS LOCKED IN THAT SPHERE!

HOW CAN I USE IT?

PEOPLE ON THIS VESSEL

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:39.408
CAN TRACE THEIR HISTORY
BACK TO ANCIENT EGYPT,

00:04:39.408 --> 00:04:42.978
TO A TIME WHEN SORCERERS
AND KINGS WAGED GREAT WARS!

00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:47.016
BACK THEN, THE POWER OF
THE SHADOWS WAS EVERYWHERE,

BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!

A HISTORY LESSON

00:04:52.888 --> 00:04:53.889
TO LEARN HOW
TO CONTROL

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.958
THE ACTIONS OF
MY DUEL MONSTER!

CERTAINLY DID,

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.196
AND NOT EVEN
HE KNEW HOW TO

00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:03.532
DECIPHER THE ANCIENT TEXT
WHEN HE CREATED THE CARD.

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:05.334
BUT HE KNEW THAT
IN ANCIENT TIMES,

00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:07.603
THE WINGED DRAGON
WOULD ONLY OBEY THOSE

00:05:07.603 --> 00:05:09.071
WHO CHANTED THE WORDS.

00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.707
SO, PEGASUS PRINTED
THE WORDS IN AN INK

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:14.510
THAT CAN ONLY BE SEEN WHEN
THE MONSTER IS SUMMONED.

THAT I'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO USE THAT CARD!

I NEVER SAID THAT
WAS A HOLOGRAM!

00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:24.366
THAT VOICE...
IT SOUNDS...

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:25.834
SO FAMILIAR.

00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:37.179
YOU AND I WILL DUEL

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.883
AND THINGS ARE BEGINNING
TO GET INTERESTING UP HERE.

00:08:40.883 --> 00:08:44.486
FOR IT'S TIME TO AWAKEN
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA

GREAT BEAST OF THE SKY,
PLEASE HEAR MY CRY.

00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:03.205
TRANSFORM MYSELF
FROM ORB OF LIGHT

IN THIS FIGHT.

00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:07.409
HEY! CHECK IT
OUT GUYS!

00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:11.947

[THINKING]
IF MARIK ATTACKS WITH
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.201
MAI WILL LOSE THE REST
OF HER LIFE POINTS,

00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:08.670
AND SHE'LL BE TRAPPED IN
THE SHADOW REALM FOREVER!

[MARIK CHUCKLES]

00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:13.175
SUCH A PITY IT HAS
TO END LIKE THIS, MY DEAR.

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:16.445
YOUR MIND IS A MERE SHADOW
OF ITS FORMER SELF,

00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:18.580
AND IT'S GROWING EVEN DIMMER.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.084
AND CHAINED TO THAT STONE,
YOU CAN'T REACH YOUR DECK.

00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:23.585
NO!

00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:26.155
AS SOON AS MY

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:27.489
YOUR WORLD
WILL CRUMBLE!

HEY, YUG,
WE GOTTA STOP THIS!

00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:30.993
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:10:30.993 --> 00:10:32.661
LEAVE MAI ALONE!

00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:34.863
YOUR GRUDGE IS
AGAINST ME, NOT HER!

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:36.865
THAT'S TRUE, PHARAOH,

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:39.068
BUT I'M JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FUN UP HERE.

00:10:39.068 --> 00:10:41.336
THERE'S NOTHING
I LIKE MORE THAN

00:10:41.336 --> 00:10:42.805

DON'T WORRY, WE'LL
FACE EACH OTHER SOON.

00:10:47.109 --> 00:10:49.278
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR

00:10:49.278 --> 00:10:50.913
SINCE MY FAMILY INSISTED

00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:53.715
I BARE THE ANCIENT
SCRIPTURES ON MY BACK--

OF THE PHARAOH'S POWER

00:10:56.718 --> 00:10:57.920
UNTIL HIS RETURN!

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.855
THE PHARAOH SECRET?

00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:01.957
AND ALTHOUGH THIS DUTY

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:05.060
HAS BROUGHT GREAT HONOR
TO THE ISHTAR NAME,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.864
IT HAS BROUGHT ME NOTHING BUT
GREAT SUFFERING AND DESPAIR.

00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:10.966
FOR GENERATIONS,
MY FAMILY HAS WAITED

00:11:10.966 --> 00:11:13.368

00:14:44.513 --> 00:14:47.549
[THINKING] SO, JOEY DOES THINK
OF ME AS A FRIEND AFTER ALL!

NO WAY, MAI!
NOT WITHOUT YOU!

00:14:56.858 --> 00:14:59.594
NOW, WINGED
DRAGON OF RA,

HANG IN THERE!

00:15:13.942 --> 00:15:15.010
[THINKING] THIS IS
THE NICEST THING

ANYONE'S EVER
DONE FOR ME!

00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:17.946
Joey: YOU'RE
GONNA BE OK, MAI!

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.047
I PROMISE!

00:15:19.047 --> 00:15:21.249
AND I NEVER BREAK
A PROMISE TO A FRIEND!

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.154

WELL, ISN'T THAT SPECIAL!

00:15:33.095 --> 00:15:35.530
IT APPEARS I'LL BE
ABLE TO DESTROY YUGI

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.666
EVEN SOONER THAN I
THOUGHT I WOULD!

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.167
NOT QUITE!

00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:42.637
YOUR DARK SHADOW POWERS
WILL NEVER PENETRATE ME!

00:15:42.637 --> 00:15:45.540

PLEASE GET UP!

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:18.140
Joey:
DON'T WORRY, YUG!

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.608
YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT!

00:16:19.608 --> 00:16:22.144
HA! THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK, FOOL,

00:16:22.144 --> 00:16:24.413
BUT I'M AFRAID
I BEG TO DIFFER.

00:16:24.413 --> 00:16:26.248
LOOKS LIKE I WON THIS DUEL.

00:16:26.248 --> 00:16:27.549
I'M WAITING.

00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:29.284
HER LIFE POINTS
ARE GONE,

00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:31.853
SO ANNOUNCE ME AS
THE WINNER IMMEDIATELY.

00:16:31.853 --> 00:16:33.922
THE WINNER OF
THIS DUEL IS

MR. MARIK ISHTAR!

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:38.493

Marik: WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?

00:16:45.967 --> 00:16:49.070
I SHOULD SEND HIM TO
THE SHADOW REALM RIGHT NOW!

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.572
YOU WISH!

00:16:50.572 --> 00:16:53.175
RELAX,
I STILL NEED HIM,

00:16:53.175 --> 00:16:55.510
BUT YOU'RE NOT
SO FORTUNATE,

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.512
AND YOU NEED TO
BE TAUGHT A LESSON

00:16:57.512 --> 00:17:00.382
ABOUT MEDDLING IN MATTERS
THAT DON'T CONCERN YOU.

00:17:00.382 --> 00:17:02.117

[THINKING] I CAN'T MOVE!

00:17:03.852 --> 00:17:05.921
PERHAPS NEXT TIME
YOU'LL THINK

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:08.290
BEFORE YOU ENTER
A DUEL UNINVITED.

WHAT DID YOU
DO TO HIM, MARIK?

00:17:11.793 --> 00:17:14.496
NOT TO WORRY,
HE'LL BE FINE.

00:17:14.496 --> 00:17:16.598
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
WE NEED TO DISCUSS.

I KNOW YOUR MEMORY
HAS FAILED YOU,

00:17:34.216 --> 00:17:36.284

BUT THEY SEEM TO
BE HAVING FUN...

AND THEY DON'T MISS YOU
AT ALL, MY DEAR.
