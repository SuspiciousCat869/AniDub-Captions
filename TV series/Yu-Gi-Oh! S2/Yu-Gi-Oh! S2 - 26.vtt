HOW WILL I EVER RESCUE
JOEY AND TEA?

[DISTORTED VOICE]
YUGI! YOU'D BETTER DO
EXACTLY AS I SAY!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.380
OH, NO! TEA!

THIS MAY COME AS
AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE,

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.551
BUT LIKE
YOUR FRIEND JOEY,

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:06.886

MY CONTROL.

MARIK, LEAVE HER
ALONE NOW!

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.427
SHE'S DONE
NOTHING TO YOU!

LOOKS LIKE I'VE TURNED
YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:19.332
INTO YOUR
GREATEST ENEMIES.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.301
YOU'RE AT MY MERCY.

SPECIAL DUELING ARENA.

LOOK AROUND YOU.
SHOULD YOU ACCEPT,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.545
YOU'LL BE BATTLING AGAINST
YOUR BEST FRIEND

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.181
IN A DUEL LIKE NONE
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.550
FOR THE HIGHEST STAKES
IMAGINABLE.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.386
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DUEL,

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.488
IF IT MEANS
SAVING
MY FRIENDS.

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:42.756
LET'S BEGIN.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.758
WHY DON'T YOU BOTH
TRY THESE ON FOR SIZE?

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:49.529
NOTICE THAT YOU'RE BOTH
SECURELY FASTENED

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.967
TO A CHAIN THAT LEADS
TO A LARGE ANCHOR
HANGING ABOVE YOU.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.970
30 SECONDS AFTER A PLAYER'S
LIFE POINTS REACH ZERO,

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.507
THE ANCHOR WILL DROP
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.

00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:02.976
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW LOOK DOWN.

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:06.479
THAT SMALL YELLOW BOX IS
YOUR LIFE POINT COUNTER,

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:09.883
BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS
THE KEY TO YOUR SURVIVAL.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.252
WHEN ONE PLAYER'S
LIFE POINTS REACH ZERO,

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:13.887
THE OTHER PLAYER'S
BOX OPENS,

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.489
REVEALING A KEY
THAT UNLOCKS HIS SHACKLES.

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:18.825
REMEMBER, YOU'LL HAVE
30 SECONDS TO FREE YOURSELF

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.427
BEFORE THE ANCHOR DROPS.

00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:22.362
Yami-Yugi:
SO THE LOSER
OF THIS DUEL

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:25.131
WILL BE DRAGGED
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE OCEAN

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.967
WHILE THE WINNER
FREES HIMSELF AT
THE LAST MINUTE?

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:30.470
THAT'S RIGHT. QUITE
INGENIOUS, ISN'T IT?

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.505
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.574
BUT WAIT. IF I
WIN THIS DUEL,

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.777
WILL YOU SET
MY FRIENDS FREE FROM
YOUR CONTROL, MARIK?

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:40.413
YOU'LL HAVE TO FISH JOEY
OUT OF THE SEA FIRST.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.750
AND DON'T THINK I
LEFT LITTLE TEA OUT
OF ALL THE FUN.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.885
BUT I'LL GET
TO HER ROLE SHORTLY.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:49.155
AND JUST IN CASE
YOU HAD ANY PLANS OF
REFUSING TO DUEL,

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.557
THINK AGAIN!

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.559
IF THERE'S NO WINNER
WITHIN 60 MINUTES,

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.494
THE ANCHOR WILL
AUTOMATICALLY DROP,

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:57.230
SENDING BOTH OF YOU
PLUMMETING INTO THE SEA.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.431
[MARIK CHUCKLES]

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.500
BUT YOU WILL LOSE, YUGI,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.068
AND BEFORE
THAT ANCHOR DROPS,

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.536
I'LL TAKE

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.805
YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
AND YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.273
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.143
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET AWAY WITH
ANY OF THIS, MARIK.

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:12.212
HA! AND, SETO KAIBA...

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:15.315
DON'T THINK YOU'RE MERELY
A SPECTATOR IN ALL THIS.

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:17.784
AS SOON AS I'M THROUGH WITH
LITTLE YUGI AND HIS FRIENDS,

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:21.488
I'M SETTING MY SIGHTS
ON YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD--

ALL RIGHT,
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

THIS DUEL
IS GETTING WAY
OUT OF HAND, SETO.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:31.030
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT
A STOP TO IT BEFORE
SOMEONE GETS HURT.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.967
PLUS, MARIK MAY TRY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
ON US NEXT.

AS HEAD OF
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT,

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.671
I DEMAND THAT THIS DUEL
BE STOPPED NOW!

WILL CONTINUE AS PLANNED.

THE FINAL PIECE OF MY PLOT.

THE MEANING
OF THIS, MARIK?

THAT ANCHOR WON'T
BE THE ONLY THING
GETTING DROPPED.

[DISTORTED VOICE]
I'VE TAKEN EXTRA MEASURES TO
MAKE SURE NO ONE INTERFERES.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:10.103
SO DON'T TRY. IF YOU
ATTEMPT TO STOP THIS DUEL,

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:14.207
THE CRATE YOU SEE HANGING
OVER MY HEAD WILL FALL.

IN DANGER, WOULD YOU?

WITH ALL THE RULES,

OH, WAIT. I ALMOST FORGOT.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.030

IT ISN'T MINE
TO TAKE, PAL.

THAT A PART OF ME

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.413
WILL BE A PART
OF YOUR DECK.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:32.318

GONNA COME IN HANDY
FOR YOU SOMEDAY.

THIS RED-EYES MEANT
SO MUCH TO JOEY,

TO ME AS A SIGN OF

WELL, I'M PUTTING IT
IN MY DECK.

THERE SOMEWHERE

HIM FROM MARIK.
