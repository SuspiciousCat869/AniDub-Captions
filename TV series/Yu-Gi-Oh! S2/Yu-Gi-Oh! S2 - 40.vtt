I'M NOT SURE. BUT I HAVE
A BAD FEELING.

IN ORDER TO RELEASE
MY EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTER
FROM THE ARK...

00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:01.891
I MUST SACRIFICE MY MYSTICAL
BEAST SERKET FIRST!

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:05.327
ONCE THIS GIANT GUARDIAN
OF THE TEMPLE IS NO MORE,

00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:07.696
I CAN RELEASE
THE MOST POWERFUL CREATURE

FEEL THE FIRE
OF THE MIGHTY
WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.668

AND YOUR LEGENDARY FISHERMAN!

00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:46.528
THIS INCREASED MY MONSTER'S

TO AN ENORMOUS FIVE THOUSAND
EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE!

COME AND GET ME ALREADY!

00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:30.434
YOU'VE MADE OUR FAMILY
PROUD TODAY, ODION.

YOUR HANDLING OF
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD COPY

00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:35.973
PROVES YOU ARE ONE OF US,
ONCE AND FOR ALL

AND IT HAS CONVINCED
OUR SKEPTICAL FRIENDS

WHAT'S THIS?!

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:07.371
I SENSE
A GREAT DISTURBANCE!

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.340
ODION HAS ANGERED
THE GODS!

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.075
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:13.477
MY DECK IS EMITTING
A POWERFUL AURA!

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.913
ONE OF GREAT RAGE!

00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:19.050
IT'S AS IF THE REAL
WINGED DRAGON OF RA
IN MY DECK

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.886
IS ANGRY
THAT ODION PLAYED
A COUNTERFEIT CARD!

LOOKS LIKE YOUR DRAGON'S
GOT OTHER PLANS!

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:26.824
OBEY ME!

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:28.693
AND ATTACK MY OPPONENT
RIGHT NOW!

00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:32.730
WHY ISN'T IT
ATTACKING JOEY?

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.298
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:36.133
SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG!

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.703
IT'S LIKE HIS CARD HAS
A MIND OF ITS OWN!

00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:40.638
IT'S MORE THAN A CARD!

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.742
NOW WHAT!?

00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:47.611
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
ISN'T WORKING!

00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:49.780
HOW CAN THIS BE?

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.185
MY RARE HUNTERS TESTED
THESE CARD-COPIES
EXTENSIVELY!

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.921
OH!

00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:59.223
I KNOW THERE WERE
DIFFICULTIES AT FIRST

00:06:59.223 --> 00:07:01.258
WITH SOME OF
MY WEAKER SERVANTS.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:04.328
BUT I THOUGHT ODION COULD
CONTROL THIS CARD.

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:07.264

I AM NOT WORTHY ENOUGH
TO CONTROL THIS CARD...

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:39.063
JUST AS I WAS NOT WORTHY ENOUGH
TO BE A PART OF YOUR FAMILY.

00:07:39.063 --> 00:07:40.464

A FREAK ACT OF NATURE

WHO CARES WHAT IT WAS,
JUST END THIS DUEL NOW!

00:09:08.705 --> 00:09:11.942
SHOULD I DECLARE
THE DUEL A DOUBLE
FORFEIT?

DISQUALIFY THEM
BOTH?

THE DAY THAT MARIK RECEIVED
THE TOMB KEEPERS INITIATION.

00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:24.881
IT WAS A DAY THAT WOULD CHANGE
ALL OF US FOREVER.

00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:28.819
FOR DURING THAT RITUAL,
A GREAT EVIL AWOKE WITHIN
MY BROTHER...

00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:31.988
AND NOW THAT ODION IS
UNABLE TO PROTECT HIM,

00:10:31.988 --> 00:10:34.891
THAT EVIL PRESENCE WILL
INCREASE IN POWER!

00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.194
I FEEL SO ALONE.

00:10:37.194 --> 00:10:40.697

MY LIFE TO SOME PHARAOH!?!

OF MARIK EXISTS

TO BRING IT OUT!
