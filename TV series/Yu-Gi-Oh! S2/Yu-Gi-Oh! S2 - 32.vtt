SEEMS EVERYTHING'S GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:09.538
I TOOK CARE
OF BAKURA
LIKE YOU ASKED

00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:11.106
SO YOU COULD
RESCUE HIM, MARIK,

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:13.776
AND GAIN THE TRUST
OF THOSE FOOLS.

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:15.711
WHAT'S THE NEXT PART
OF THE PLAN?

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:16.912
YOU'LL OBTAIN
A DUEL DISK

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.748
AND ENTER THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT FINALS.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:20.849
HA HA HA!

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.085
HERE WE COME,
BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.487
Tea: IT'S PROJECTING
SOMETHING.

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:26.522
Tristan:
WHAT IS IT?

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:27.756
Computer voice:

IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.192
Man: THIS IS COPTER ONE.
WE'VE BEGUN OUR DESCENT
INTO KAIBA CORP STADIUM

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:40.195
FOR THE COMMENCEMENT
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:44.733
[THINKING] MY COMPETITION...
IF YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT,

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.902
WILL BE ARRIVING SOON...

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:50.005
ALONG WITH THE TWO
REMAINING EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.677
LOOK AT THAT FOOL
STANDING THERE.

00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:58.981
SOON HE WILL BECOME
A PAWN IN HIS OWN
PATHETIC GAME.

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.417
Odion: THAT'S RIGHT, MARIK.

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:02.651
LISTEN CLOSELY...

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:03.852
THE TIME HAS COME

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.455
TO PUT THE FINAL PART
OF MY PLAN INTO MOTION

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:07.756
AND I'LL NEED YOUR HELP.

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:09.158
MMM.

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:10.659
THIS IS IT.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.495
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS
ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:16.165
AND EVERYTHING THAT I NEED
TO GAIN INFINITE POWER

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.033
WILL BE IN ONE PLACE...

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.636
ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW
IS WIN!

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:23.205
FOR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS
THE WORLD HAS WAITED

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.741
FOR THE ANCIENT PHARAOH
TO RETURN.

00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:29.078
AS THE SCRIPTURES STATE,
HE WILL USE HIS BOUNDLESS POWER

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:32.648
TO RESCUE THE WORLD FROM EVIL
AS HE DID BEFORE.

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:35.484
WIELDING THE STRENGTH
OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS,

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:39.221
HIS SPIRIT SHALL EMERGE
FROM WITHIN THE CHAMBERS
OF THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:42.958
TO RULE MANKIND ONCE AGAIN.

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.661
WELL I SHALL FULFILL
THAT PROPHECY!

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.995
BY SEIZING
THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:48.931
AND DRAINING
THE PHARAOH'S POWER.

00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:53.469
BUT AS YOU KNOW, ODION,
THE PUZZLE ISN'T ALL I NEED.

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.637
ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT
SCRIPTURES,

00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:57.706
IN ORDER TO POSSESS
THE PHARAOH'S POWER,

00:02:57.706 --> 00:03:01.710
ONE MUST ALSO HOLD
ALL THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.646
ONCE I ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK
<i>I</i> WILL BE PHARAOH...

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:08.750
AND THE FORMER RULER WILL WANDER
THE SHADOW REALM FOR ETERNITY!

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.153
THIS IS WHERE I NEED
<i>YOUR</i> HELP, ODION.

00:03:11.153 --> 00:03:13.922
I MUST HIDE MY IDENTITY.

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:16.859
EVERYONE SHALL THINK
<i>YOU</i> ARE <i>ME.</i>

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.164
AS FOR MYSELF, THOSE FOOLS
ALREADYBELIEVE ME TO BE
A FRIEND NAMED NAMU.

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:24.199
I'LL GAIN THEIR TRUST
THEN CRUSH THEM

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.168
WITH THE WINGED
DRAGON OF RA!

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:27.636
Marik: HA HA HA HA!

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:29.805
GO TURN ON THE LIGHTS!
LIGHTS?

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.974
ILLUMINATE THE STADIUM
RIGHT NOW!

00:03:31.974 --> 00:03:33.442
RIGHT!

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:34.776
TURN THE
LIGHTS ON!

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.845
Mokuba: WHAT IS IT SETO?

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:39.148
Kaiba: I THOUGHT
I HEARD SOMETHING.

00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:42.951
NO ONE SHOULD ENTER THE STADIUM
WITHOUT FIRST REPORTING TO ME!

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.586
Roland: NOT TO WORRY MR. KAIBA.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:46.688
WE'LL LOCATE ANY AND ALL
TRESPASSERS.

00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:49.424
Kaiba: SOMEONE ELSE IS ARRIVING.

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:51.059
HEY LOOK!

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.962
Mokuba: THE FIRST THREE
FINALISTS--JOEY, YUGI AND MAI!

00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:55.764
Yugi: THIS IS IT?

00:03:55.764 --> 00:03:57.933
THIS PLACE'S STILL
UNDER <i>CONSTRUCTION!</i>

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:00.169
WE'RE UNFASHIONABLY EARLY.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.970
WELCOME. PRESENT
YOUR LOCATOR CARDS.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.907
Joey: CHECK IT OUT.
WE ALL GOT SIX.

00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:06.842
Fuguta: THEN HERE ARE
YOUR TOURNAMENT I.D.'s.

00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:10.779
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU THREE ARE
NOW OFFICIALLY BATTLE CITY
FINALISTS.

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.080
WE ALREADY KNEW <i>THAT.</i>

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.216
NOW SECURITY'S TIGHT.

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:16.685
SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
THESE CARDS WITH YOU
AT ALL TIMES.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:18.720
DANKS. NOW WHERE'S
EVERYONE ELSE?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.224
SO FAR IT'S JUST
THE THREE OF YOU
AND OF COURSE MR. KAIBA.

00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:24.726
Fuguta: WE EXPECT
THE OTHER FOUR
FINALISTS SHORTLY.

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:28.897
[THINKING] NOT THAT IT MATTERS.
YOU'LL <i>ALL</i> LOSE SOON ENOUGH.

00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:30.065
HMM?

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.034
Roland: HERE COMES
SOMEONE NOW.

00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:34.636
Yugi: GUYS, I'VE GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:37.439
Joey: HEY YUGE, YOU DINK
IT'S DAT EVIL CREEP, MARIK?

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.775
Yugi: IT COULD BE. HE MUST BE
<i>ONE</i> OF THE EIGHT FINALISTS.

00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:42.644
[THINKING] THIS IS THE END
FOR YOU, PHARAOH!

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:46.582
SOON THE STRONGEST POWER
IN THE WORLD WILL BELONG TO ME!

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:47.749
WHO IS DAT?

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.851
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:55.217
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW <i>YOU.</i>

00:04:55.217 --> 00:04:56.752
YOU'RE NAMU
RIGHT!?

00:04:56.752 --> 00:04:58.354
YOU SAVED
BAKURA'S
LIFE!

00:04:58.354 --> 00:05:01.290
GLAD I COULD HELP...
WHERE'S BAKURA NOW?

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.192
RESTING...
IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:05:03.192 --> 00:05:07.196
Marik: EXCELLENT.
I'LL DO ANYTHING
TO HELP SOMEONE IN NEED.

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.430
Joey, thinking: I DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT IS,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.000
BUT THERE'S SOMETHIN'
I DON'T TRUST ABOUT DIS GUY.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.568
WIT ALL A'DESE RARE HUNTERS
RUNNIN' AROUND

00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:14.737
I DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT <i>ANYONE</i> SAYS!

00:05:14.737 --> 00:05:20.176
SO JOEY IT LOOKS LIKE WE <i>BOTH</i>
MADE IT TO THE BATTLE CITY
FINALS, DIDN'T WE?

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:22.011
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET THIS FAR.

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:23.179
BUT SINCE
THE DAY I MET YOU TWO

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:25.080
I'VE BEEN WINNING EVERY DUEL.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.283
[THINKING] SO YOU'D
BETTER BEWARE!

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:31.220
YUGI! MEET
OUR FRIEND NAMU.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.055
HE'S THE ONE WHO
SAVED BAKURA'S LIFE

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:34.256
AND GET THIS--
HE'S ALSO

00:05:34.256 --> 00:05:36.192
ONE OF THE BATTLE
CITY FINALISTS.

00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:37.226
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
JOEY?

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:39.995
HUH?... I-AHHHH,
YEAH, SURE.

00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:42.665
I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU, YUGI.
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:46.135
NAMU...THANKS A LOT
FOR HELPING OUT
BAKURA.

00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:49.038
ANY FRIEND OF JOEY
AND TEA'S IS A BUDDY
OF MINE.

00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:52.474
Marik: I'M SO HAPPY TO BE
SURROUNDED BY SUCH
A WELCOMING CROWD,

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:56.212
I JUST HOPE EVERYONE I MEET
TONIGHT IS AS FRIENDLY
AS YOU PEOPLE.

00:05:56.212 --> 00:06:00.916
Joey, thinking: AH, MAYBE
HE'S NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL.
WHAT DO I KNOW?!

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:02.351
HUH?

00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:03.619
HEY, THAT'S BAKURA!

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.454
Joey: WHAT'S HE
DOIN' HERE!?

00:06:05.454 --> 00:06:07.623
BAKURA!

00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:10.526
YOU SHOULD GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL!

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:13.262
BAKURA! YOU SHOULD
REALLY BE RESTING!

00:06:13.262 --> 00:06:15.731
YEAH GRANDPA TOLD ME YOU WERE
IN PRETTY BAD CONDITION!

00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:17.433
THEY LET YOU OUT?

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:18.634
I'M FINE.

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:21.203
LOOK BAKURA. I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU FOUND US HERE,

00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:23.405
BUT YOU BETTER GET BACK
TO THAT HOSPITAL!

00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:26.208
Yugi: WAIT! WHAT
ARE YA DOING
WEARING A DUEL DISC?

00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:28.210
HOW ELSE COULD I WIN
SIX LOCATOR CARDS

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.278
AND ENTER
THE FINALS!?

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.247
AAH!
AAH!

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:32.548
JUST LOOK.

00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:36.986
[THINKING] PERFECT. HE'S HOLDING
UP HIS END OF OUR BARGAIN.

00:06:36.986 --> 00:06:39.255
THE FOOL IS DUELING FOR <i>ME!</i>

00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:42.992
[THINKING] NO WAY!
BAKURA COULD BARELY WALK!

00:06:42.992 --> 00:06:45.127
HOW'D HE WIN SIX LOCATOR CARDS!?

00:06:45.127 --> 00:06:48.030
REWIND A SEC! WHEN DID YOU JOIN
THE TOURNAMENT?!

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.400
JOIN? HOW'D YOU MAKE IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE <i>FINALS?!</i>

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.369
Joey: DIS IS FREAKIN' ME OUT!

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:56.272
HEY LOOK! IT'S THE SEVENTH
FINALIST!

00:06:56.272 --> 00:07:00.809
Joey: DIS GUY LOOKS FAMILIAR...
AND DAT'S A MUG YA DON'T FORGET.

00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:05.981
HE MUST HOLD THE THIRD
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.250
Tea: OH!

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.418
Joey: DATS DA GUY!

00:07:09.418 --> 00:07:11.253
Tea: HE'S THE ONE
WHO KIDNAPPED ME!

00:07:11.253 --> 00:07:13.255
Kaiba: STATE YOUR NAME
RIGHT NOW!

00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:15.291
Odion: I AM MARIK.

00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:18.594
AH, I'LL KICK
YOUR BRAIN-WASHIN'
<i>KEISTER!</i>

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:21.330
YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR ME, FOOL.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.301
THE ONLY REASON
I'M NOT TOSSIN' YOU OUT
BY YOUR CAPE RIGHT NOW...

00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:29.204
IS SO I CAN SAVE MY ENERGY
TO TAKE YOU DOWN IN THE FINALS!

00:07:29.204 --> 00:07:30.639
GOT DAT, PAL!?

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.275
I SHOULD DISQUALIFY YOU
RIGHT NOW

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:36.078
FOR CAPTURING MY LITTLE
BROTHER MOKUBA.

00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:38.147
BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I WANT.

00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:39.481
AND BEFORE THE FINALS
ARE OVER

00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:42.084
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD
CARD'LL BE MINE!

00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:45.287
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE
TOO MANY FRIENDS AROUND HERE,
TATTOO FACE!

00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:47.222
HUH!

00:07:47.222 --> 00:07:49.959
Joey: I DINK
I SCARED 'IM, YUGE.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:53.295
Roland: ALRIGHT, CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:55.364
SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT OF YOU
ARE HERE...

00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:57.199
SO NOW IT'S TIME
TO ANNOUNCE...

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.269
THAT ALTHOUGH YOUR
LOCATOR CARDS LED YOU HERE,

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:04.340
THIS IS <i>NOT</i> THE SITE
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.777
THE ACTUAL TOURNAMENT ARENA
SHOULD BE ARRIVING HERE
ANY SECOND NOW FOLKS.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.179
I'M LOST.

00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:11.246
WHERE <i>ARE</i> THE FINALS?

00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:14.350
LOOK! UP THERE!

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.985
IT'S KAIBA'S BLIMP!

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:17.519
DUUUDE!

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.620
IT'S HUGE!

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.989
Roland: STAND BACK.

00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:21.557
WE'LL ALL BE BOARDING SHORTLY.

00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:24.226
Fuguta: KAIBA KRAFT 3,
YOU'RE CLEARED FOR LANDING.

00:08:24.226 --> 00:08:25.394
OH MAN!

00:08:25.394 --> 00:08:27.529
SO WE'RE DUELING IN THE SKY?

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:29.198
Mokuba: YOU GOT IT!

00:08:29.198 --> 00:08:33.135
IN FACT...FOUR THOUSAND <i>FEET</i>
IN THE SKY TO BE EXACT!

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:35.070
Joey: YOU GOT
BARF BAGS
ON BOARD?

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.438
JUST CHECKIN'.

00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:38.207
ALRIGHT LISTEN UP!

00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:40.509
IT'S TIME TO BOARD
KAIBA KRAFT THREE

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:44.580
FOR THE START
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.282
Roland: WE'LL DEPART AS SOON
AS THE EIGHTH DUELIST ARRIVES.

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:49.551
CLIMB ABOARD
AND WATCH YOUR STEP.

00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:54.757
A GIRL COULD DEFINITELY GET USED
TO THIS KIND OF TREATMENT.

00:08:54.757 --> 00:08:57.159
Yugi, thinking: I WONDER WHO
THE EIGHTH FINALIST IS.

00:08:57.159 --> 00:09:00.396
OH YEAH BABY! I'M KICKIN' BUTT
ON A BLIMP!

00:09:00.396 --> 00:09:03.365
HOLD IT! I CAN'T
LET <i>YOU</i> FOUR

00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:05.034
WITHOUT
TOURNAMENT I.D.s.

00:09:05.034 --> 00:09:06.035
Tristan: NO WAY!
Tea: C'MON!

00:09:06.035 --> 00:09:07.503
PLEASE SIR...

00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:10.139
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO ACTUALLY SEEING
MY BIG BROTHER DUEL

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:11.273
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:09:11.273 --> 00:09:12.441
CUT HER SOME SLACK.

00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:14.243
WHAT'S DA BIG DEAL!?

00:09:14.243 --> 00:09:15.244
LET US GO ON!

00:09:15.244 --> 00:09:16.245
WE'LL BE QUIET!

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.279
JUST THIS ONCE?

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.981
IT IS AGAINST THE RULES.

00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:20.249
GIVE IT A REST, ROLAND,

00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:21.984
WE CAN BEND THE RULES
FOR THEM.

00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:23.485
<i>I</i> DON'T HAVE AN I.D. CARD.

00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:25.387
BUT THEY'RE...
MR. KAIBA'S RULES.

00:09:25.387 --> 00:09:26.588
WELL BIG BRO?

00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:28.290
WHATEVER.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.659
Tristan: WELL...
SOUNDS LIKE A YES TO ME.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:31.994
HEY!

00:09:31.994 --> 00:09:33.328
JUST LET THE DWEEBS GO.

00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:35.230

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:40.169
BUT MR. KAIBA...

00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:42.304
THE FINAL DUELIST
HASN'T ARRIVED.

00:09:42.304 --> 00:09:44.039
OH WELL.

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:46.308
[THINKING] THE EGYPTIAN GOD
CARDS ARE <i>ALREADY</i> ON BOARD.

00:09:46.308 --> 00:09:49.111
Mokuba:
YOU SURE YOU WANNA
DO THIS SETO?

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.013
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:09:51.013 --> 00:09:53.082
WE FOLLOW
MR. KAIBA'S ORDERS.

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:54.283
HMM?

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:58.287
SOMEONE'S COMING.
IT MUST BE
THE EIGHTH FINALIST.

00:10:00.722 --> 00:10:03.659
[THINKING] I'M HERE
TO SAVE YOU, MY BROTHER.

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:06.728
I BELIEVE YOU GENTLEMEN
ARE WAITING FOR ME?

00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:08.964
MY LOCATOR CARDS.

00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:11.567
WELCOME. FOLLOW US.

00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:13.569
[THINKING] IT HAS BEGUN...

00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:16.205
THE FINAL CONFRONTATION
IS UPON US

00:10:16.205 --> 00:10:19.308
AND THE FATE OF THE WORLD
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

00:10:25.063 --> 00:10:28.099
Man: KAIBA KRAFT THREE
PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF.

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:31.970
ALL THRUSTERS ARE ENGAGED.
WE HAVE LIFTOFF.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.273
ROTATE ENGINES
FOR FORWARD PROPULSION.

00:10:35.273 --> 00:10:39.144
WE HAVE REACHED THE OFFICIAL
DUELING ALTITUDE.

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:40.678
Tea: THIS IS AWESOME.

00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:42.881
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE CITY
FROM THIS HIGH UP.

00:10:42.881 --> 00:10:46.551
THE LIGHTS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.
THANKS FOR BRINGING ME, JOEY.

00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:49.020
JUUUST ONE OF
THE MANY PERKS

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.288
OF BEING RELATED
TO A CHAMPION.

00:10:50.288 --> 00:10:51.589
HA HA HA!

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:54.559
YOU CALL YOURSELF
A CHAMPION WHEELER?

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:56.461
YOU'RE HERE BY A FLUKE.

00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:58.363
KEEP WALKIN' KAIBA!

00:10:58.363 --> 00:11:00.565
ENJOY THIS
WHILE YOU CAN.

00:11:00.565 --> 00:11:03.902
AND LISTEN. I WOULDN'T GET
YOUR HOPES UP TOO HIGH,

00:11:03.902 --> 00:11:06.137
BECAUSE IT'S A LONG WAY DOWN
FROM UP HERE.

00:11:06.137 --> 00:11:09.274
OH AND THE...THE LAST
TIME I CHECKED,

00:11:09.274 --> 00:11:10.975
MONKEYS CAN'T FLY.

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:15.246
[THINKING] <i>MONKEY?!?</i>
WHO'S HE CALLIN' A <i>MONKEY!!</i>

00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:20.351
YUGI, I HAVE SOME WORDS
OF ADVICE FOR YOU TOO.

00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:23.621
I'M AWARE THAT YOU HAVEN'T
PLAYED YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:27.959
SINCE YOU WON IT,
BUT IT'S TIME FOR THAT
TO END RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.228
SO IT HAD BETTER BE IN YOUR DECK
DURING THE FINALS

00:11:30.228 --> 00:11:32.263
BECAUSE I INTEND TO WIN IT!

00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:35.166

<i>I'LL</i> BE THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DUELIST.

00:11:42.207 --> 00:11:47.112
AND THE OWNER OF ALL THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:11:47.112 --> 00:11:48.613

00:11:48.613 --> 00:11:52.217

00:15:21.359 --> 00:15:23.695
WITH THIS ONE CARD,
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,

00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:26.464
I WILL DESTROY
BOTH YUGI AND MARIK

00:15:26.464 --> 00:15:29.167
AND GAIN THEIR EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS.

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:33.004
ONCE I WIELD ALL THREE,
I'LL BE UNBEATABLE!

00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:34.972
HA HA HA!

00:15:42.974 --> 00:15:47.078
I MAY HAVE MISSED OUT ON WINNING
THE <i>DUELIST KINGDOM</i> FINALS.

00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:49.046
BUT THIS TIME I KNOW
THAT I'LL BE VICTORIOUS.

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:56.287
IT IS MY SWORN DUTY TO WIN.
FOR MASTER MARIK.

00:15:56.287 --> 00:16:00.024
I PROMISE THAT I WILL
NOT FAIL HIM.

00:16:05.596 --> 00:16:07.999
[THINKING] MY VICTORY
IN THE BATTLE CITY FINALS
IS INEVITABLE.

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:11.869
SINCE I'VE MANIPULATED
SO MANY PEOPLE, I CAN'T LOSE!

00:16:11.869 --> 00:16:14.505
YUGI BELIEVES ME
TO BE ON <i>HIS</i> SIDE.

00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:17.775
WHILE I SECRETLY CONTROL
THE MINDS OF HIS FRIENDS!

00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:21.779
AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
I WILL SEIZE THAT CONTROL.

00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:23.748
THEN THERE'S BAKURA.

00:16:23.748 --> 00:16:26.784
RATHER THAN WASTE MY ENERGY
CONTROLLING <i>HIS</i> MIND,

00:16:26.784 --> 00:16:29.086
I'VE FOOLED THE SPIRIT
OF THE MILLENNIUM RING

00:16:29.086 --> 00:16:32.523
INTO USING BAKURA
TO DUEL FOR <i>ME.</i>

00:16:32.523 --> 00:16:34.959
SO BEFORE LONG THE THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:38.095
AS WELL AS THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE WILL BE MINE.

00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:42.233
ONLY THEN CAN I OBTAIN
THE BOUNDLESS POWER
OF THE PHARAOH HIMSELF!

00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:43.768
HA HA HA!

00:16:43.768 --> 00:16:46.737
AND THE BEST PART IS...
I CAN'T LOSE!

00:16:46.737 --> 00:16:48.939
WITH ODION AND BAKURA
DUELING FOR ME

00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:52.543
AND YUGI BELIEVING ME TO BE
HIS KINDHEARTED FRIEND NAMU...

00:16:52.543 --> 00:16:54.779
VICTORY WILL SURELY BE MINE!

00:16:59.617 --> 00:17:03.087
IF I HONESTLY EXPECT TO
STOP MARIK FROM GETTING
WHAT HE WANTS,

00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:06.290
I HAVE TO DO WHAT KAIBA SAID
AND PUT SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.525
IN MY DECK.

00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:08.926
BUT IT'S A REALLY POWERFUL CARD

00:17:08.926 --> 00:17:10.628
AND USING IT

00:17:10.628 --> 00:17:14.165
COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS
SO I'M GOING TO HAFTA
BE CAREFUL!

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:20.638
ALRIGHT. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE IN <i>MY</i> DECK
AND IN <i>MYSELF.</i>

00:17:20.638 --> 00:17:23.574
Yami-Yugi: YOU MADE
THE CORRECT DECISION, YUGI.

00:17:23.574 --> 00:17:25.609
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLD
FROM DESTRUCTION

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.645
WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT CARD.

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:28.679
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:30.681
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
WILL HELP US DEFEAT

00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:33.050
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
HELD BY MARIK

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.220
AS WELL AS PREVENT HIM
FROM WINNING THE ONE
HELD BY KAIBA,

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.190
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.759
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS
WILL BE AN EPIC CLASH

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:45.129
BETWEEN THESE THREE
EGYPTIAN GODS!

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:46.263
BUT <i>WE</i> MUST TRIUMPH.

00:17:46.263 --> 00:17:48.966
WELL THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:52.670
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT BAKURA.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.838
GO ON.

00:17:53.838 --> 00:17:55.272
HOW DID HE RECOVER
SO QUICKLY

00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:57.308
AND BECOME
A BATTLE CITY FINALIST?

00:17:57.308 --> 00:18:01.579
UNLESS THE PERSON
ON BOARD <i>ISN'T</i> BAKURA!

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:05.049
BAKURA, WHY
HAVE YOU TAKEN US
TO THE SHADOW REALM?

00:18:05.049 --> 00:18:09.220
BAKURA? BAKURA
IS NO LONGER HERE.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.522
IF YOU'RE NOT BAKURA,
THEN WHO ARE YOU?

00:18:11.522 --> 00:18:15.526
I AM A THIEF
AND A STEALER
OF SOULS.

00:18:15.526 --> 00:18:18.229
[THINKING] WHOSOEVER WIELDS
ALL SEVEN MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:18:18.229 --> 00:18:20.164
WILL POSSESS
POWER UNIMAGINABLE!

00:18:20.164 --> 00:18:23.868
AAH!

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:26.303
Tristan: SORRY BAKURA!
BUT THAT RING'S GOTTA GO!

00:18:29.106 --> 00:18:32.877
UH!

00:18:32.877 --> 00:18:36.280
BUT...TRISTAN GOT RID
OF THE MILLENNIUM RING
IN DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.083
SO HOW COULD
THE EVIL SPIRIT THAT
ONCE CONTROLLED BAKURA

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:40.618
BE BACK AGAIN?

00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:43.754
YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE PATH
OF A MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:18:43.754 --> 00:18:46.323
THE RING MUST HAVE FOUND
ITS WAY BACK TO BAKURA.

00:18:46.323 --> 00:18:47.625
OH NO!

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:50.194
NOW WINNING
WILL BE EVEN HARDER.

00:18:50.194 --> 00:18:52.997
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE'VE GOT TO WIN!

00:18:52.997 --> 00:18:55.666
THE FATE OF
THE WHOLE WORLD
DEPENDS ON IT!

00:18:55.666 --> 00:18:57.801
YES BUT MANY DANGERS
LIE AHEAD.

00:18:57.801 --> 00:19:00.638
SO WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR ANYTHING.

00:19:00.638 --> 00:19:05.576
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.
IT'S UP TO FATE NOW.

00:19:05.576 --> 00:19:09.813
Roland: ATTENTION DUELISTS.
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS
ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:19:09.813 --> 00:19:12.850
MR. KAIBA REQUESTS

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:13.984
IN THE MAIN HALL.

00:19:13.984 --> 00:19:15.819

00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:53.824
Yugi, thinking: THIS IS IT.

00:19:53.824 --> 00:19:55.893
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
DEPENDS ON ME

00:19:55.893 --> 00:19:57.828
AND THE HEART OF THE CARDS!
