PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH!</i>

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:04.233
Yami-Bakura: HA HA HA!

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.801
YUGI, YOU FOOL!

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.271
YOU HELPED ME RELEASE THE POWER
OF DARK SANCTUARY,

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.174
AND NOW THE FIELD IS COVERED
WITH A MAGIC SO TERRIFYING,

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:14.576
IT WILL KEEP YOU
IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FEAR.

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:16.178
I PLAY DESTINY BOARD.

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:18.280
DESTINY BOARD?
WHAT DOES IT DO?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.982
USING THE <i>LETTERS</i>
ON THIS BOARD,

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:21.717
THEY SHALL SPELL OUT
A <i>MESSAGE</i> FOR YOU.

00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:23.118
AFTER FIVE TURNS PASS

00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:25.053
AND ALL FIVE LETTERS
ARE REVEALED,

00:00:25.053 --> 00:00:26.521
THIS DUEL WILL END,

00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.190
AND YOU'LL LOSE
<i>EVERYTHING,</i> YUGI!!

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.325
I PLAY
MONSTER REBORN!

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:32.294
DARK NECROFEAR,
RETURN!

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:35.330
SO SAY GOODBYE TO
YOUR DARK SANCTUARY!

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.733
SINCE DESTROYING DARK
NECROFEAR RELEASED IT,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.369
I KNEW BRINGING IT BACK
WOULD DEFEAT IT.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.373
UGH! NOW I ADD
THE FOURTH LETTER
TO THE DESTINY BOARD!

00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:46.541
IT'S TOO BAD
YOU'LL NEVER PLAY
THE LAST LETTER.

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.610
NOW PREPARE
YOURSELF, YUGI!

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.346
IT'S MY MOVE,
AND THIS DUEL
IS <i>FAR</i> FROM OVER.

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:57.619
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
DEPENDS ON MY VICTORY.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:02.024
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:03.458

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:11.833
♪ YU-GI-OH
IS IN THE GAME ♪

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.625
IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:58.213
Yami-Bakura:
IT'S OVER YUGI!

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:01.016
THE CARD I'VE JUST DRAWN
WILL DESTROY YOU!

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.984
Yami-Yugi:
ENOUGH TALK!
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:05.520
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LOSE IT ALL.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.057
YOU MAY HAVE <i>DESTROYED</i>
MY DARK SANCTUARY
AND STOPPED ITS MAGIC...

00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:11.526
BUT THAT
WAS ONLY TEMPORARY.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:14.496
A MAGIC <i>THAT</i> POWERFUL
DOES NOT FADE SO EASILY.

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:17.366
SO I SUMMON <i>JOWGEN</i>
<i>THE SPIRITUALIST!</i>

00:02:21.503 --> 00:02:23.905
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
TELL ME!

00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:25.741
I'M STUMPED.
WHAT'S <i>DAT</i> DO?

00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:28.043
HEY, YOU TELL US,
MISTER EXPERT!

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:29.611
I'VE NEVER SEEN
IT, A'RIGHT!?

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.046
WELL, <i>EXCUSE ME!</i>

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:32.814
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
THIS STUFF!

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:33.849
Yami-Bakura:
HA HA HA!

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.351
BY SACRIFICING
ONE CARD IN MY HAND,

00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.520
I CAN USE JOWGEN
THE SPIRITUALIST

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.790
TO DESTROY ALL SPECIALLY
SUMMONED MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.924
NO WAY!

00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:45.293
WAY. SINCE YUGI
SUMMONED DARK NECROFEAR

00:02:45.293 --> 00:02:47.996
WITH A MAGIC CARD,
BAKURA CAN DESTROY IT!

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.798
BUT WON'T THAT RELEASE
THE DARK MAGIC THING

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:51.666
WITH ALL THE EYEBALLS
LIKE LAST TIME!?

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:52.667
MM-HMM.

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:55.904
SO I SACRIFICE
THIS CARD...

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:57.472
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:57.472 --> 00:02:59.674

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:05.247
DESTROY <i>DARK NECROFEAR!</i>

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.852
UH! YOU'VE SENT
<i>DARK NECROFEAR</i>

00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:12.621
BACK TO
THE CARD GRAVEYARD.

00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:13.989
THAT MEANS
ONE THING!

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.724
YES!

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.093
DARK SANCTUARY
IS RETURNING

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.596
AND COVERING THE FIELD
ONCE AGAIN IN ITS
POWERFUL MAGIC!

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:23.465
THIS WILL ALLOW ME
TO PLAY THE FIFTH

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.434
AND <i>LAST</i> LETTER
OF THE DESTINY BOARD,

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:27.335

A MESSAGE THAT
WILL END THIS DUEL
IN YOUR DEFEAT, YUGI!

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:32.374
IT ALL HAPPENS
IN ONE MORE TURN,

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:35.811
SO PREPARE TO SAY GOODBYE

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:39.214
AND SO MUCH MORE!
HA HA HA!

00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:40.315
YEEGH!

WIT DIS DARK MAGIC BACK,
I'M FREAKED OUT!

00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:45.754
UGH. ALL RIGHT.
SNAP OUT OF IT,
CHICKEN-BOY!

00:03:45.754 --> 00:03:47.289
ARE YOU JUST GONNA
CURL UP IN A BALL,

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:49.291
OR ARE YOU GONNA
CHEER FOR YOUR FRIEND!?

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:50.492
GO, YUGI!

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:51.893

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:54.830
YEAH! I KNOW YOU

NO MATTA
HOW TOUGH DA FIGHT,

I'M NOT SAYIN'
IT'S GONNA BE EASY,
BUT YUGI CAN DO IT!

00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:06.274
Yami-Bakura: I'D SUGGEST
GIVING UP NOW, YUGI!

00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:08.009
NOTHING YOU DO
CAN STOP ME

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.612
FROM COMPLETING
THE DESTINY BOARD!

00:04:10.612 --> 00:04:14.749
I SHALL REVEAL
THE LAST LETTER NEXT TURN,

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.519
AND YOU WILL
AUTOMATICALLY LOSE
EVERYTHING!

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.620
[GASP]

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.489
AND SINCE I MUST
SACRIFICE A MONSTER

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.390
TO MAINTAIN
DARK SANCTUARY,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.092
FAREWELL, <i>JOWGEN.</i>

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:26.528
I'LL SET ONE CARD
FACEDOWN

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.363
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:30.131
YAAGH!

00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.935
REMEMBER, MY GHOST
IS BACK TO POSSESS
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:35.036
Yami-Yugi:
I'M WELL AWARE.

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:37.072
BUT WHICH ONE
WILL I CHOOSE?

00:04:37.072 --> 00:04:39.441
YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO GUESS, EH, YUGI?

00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:41.877
BUT ATTACKING ME WITH
A POSSESSED MONSTER

00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:43.712
COULD COST YOU
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:45.380
SO CHOOSE WISELY!

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.448
FINE.

00:04:46.448 --> 00:04:48.817
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LOSING!

00:04:48.817 --> 00:04:51.253
I OUTSMARTED YOUR
SPIRIT ONCE BEFORE,

00:04:51.253 --> 00:04:53.088
AND I PLAN
TO DO IT AGAIN.

00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:54.556
THE FIRST THING
I NEED TO DO

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:56.091
IS FIGURE OUT WHICH
OF MY THREE MONSTERS

00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:58.026
YOUR EVIL SPIRIT
POSSESSED.

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:00.929
THAT WON'T HELP YOU...

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:04.666
THANKS TO MY FACEDOWN CARD,
<i>DARK SPIRIT OF THE SILENT.</i>

00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:08.803
SO NO MATTER
WHICH MONSTER YOU CHOOSE
TO ATTACK WITH...

00:05:08.803 --> 00:05:10.739
MY DARK SPIRIT
OF THE SILENT

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:13.542
WILL SHIFT THAT ATTACK
TO THE MONSTER
THAT IS POSSESSED,

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:15.176
WHICH WILL THEN
CAUSE YOU TO LOSE

00:05:15.176 --> 00:05:18.847
A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUR
REMAINING LIFE POINTS.

00:05:18.847 --> 00:05:20.348
Yugi:
IF I ATTACK,

00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:22.417
HIS GHOST WILL
DRAIN THE REST
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:23.685
BUT IF
I DON'T ATTACK,

00:05:23.685 --> 00:05:25.720
HE'LL PLAY
THE LAST LETTER OF
THE DESTINY BOARD,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.188
AND I'LL
AUTOMATICALLY LOSE!

00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:29.891
AND NONE OF MY
MAGIC CARDS CAN
STOP HIM, EITHER!

00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.793
BUT I CAN'T LOSE!

00:05:31.793 --> 00:05:33.795
IT'S YOUR
LAST TURN, YUGI.

00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:36.431
JUST ONE MOVE MORE,
AND I SHALL WIN.

00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:39.034
<i>YOU'RE DONE!</i>
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:44.331
YOU CAN'T WIN, YUGI!

00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:45.398
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

00:05:45.398 --> 00:05:46.733
YUGI HAS
NO OPTIONS LEFT!

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:48.969
COME ON, SHOW
A LITTLE FAITH, WILL YA!?

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.870
TRISTAN, I REALLY
HATE TO SAY IT,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.707
BUT I THINK DUKE
MIGHT BE RIGHT
ABOUT THIS.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:56.042
YUGI CAN ONLY
ATTACK ONCE,

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:58.578
AND WHEN HE DOES,
THAT GHOST IS GONNA
ATTACK <i>HIM.</i>

00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:00.914
JOEY, IS SHE RIGHT?

00:06:00.914 --> 00:06:02.983
NO WAY. YUGI'S
GONNA WIN DIS!

00:06:02.983 --> 00:06:04.184
BUT, JOEY...

00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:06.253
BUT NOTHIN'!
HE CAN DO IT!

00:06:06.253 --> 00:06:08.355
WE BELIEVE
IN YA, YUGI!

00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:09.456
I'VE SEEN
YOU GET OUT

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:11.491
OF WAY TOUGHER SPOTS
DEN DIS BEFORE.

00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:12.759
SO WIN DIS!

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.528
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOEY.
YOU CAN DO IT, YUGI!

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:17.564
PULL THE SHEET
OFF HIS GHOST!

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:19.499
YUGI! HANG IN THERE!

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.068
YOU CAN BEAT 'IM, YUGI!
COME ON!

00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:23.670
Marik:
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.038
CAN'T YOU SEE?

00:06:25.038 --> 00:06:27.140
I HAVE ALREADY
DEFEATED YOU.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.677
JUST MAKE YOUR MOVE
SO I CAN END
THIS DUEL, YUGI!

00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:32.846
Yugi: THERE IS <i>ONE</i>
CARD IN MY DECK

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:34.281
THAT CAN SAVE ME,

00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.949
BUT EVEN IF
I AM LUCKY ENOUGH
TO DRAW IT,

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.984
IT MAY BE TOO
DANGEROUS TO PLAY.

00:06:37.984 --> 00:06:40.253
THEN AGAIN, WHAT
CHOICE DO I HAVE!?

00:06:40.253 --> 00:06:42.589
I GUESS WE ONLY HAVE
ONE HOPE TO WIN THIS.

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:43.957
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:06:43.957 --> 00:06:46.326
IF WE DON'T PLAY
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
THIS TURN,

00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:48.361
WE'RE GONNA
LOSE THE DUEL,

00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:50.563
AND WE'VE GOTTA <i>WIN</i>
TO SAVE THE WORLD!

00:06:50.563 --> 00:06:52.499
WE HAVE TO DRAW IT NOW.

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.401
HMM. YES, WE MUST.

00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.703
THE HEART
OF THE CARDS
WILL GUIDE US.

00:06:56.703 --> 00:06:58.038
NOW LET'S DO THIS!

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:03.143

00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:54.828
THAT IS THE ONE
MARIK DESIRES.

00:07:54.828 --> 00:07:57.630
BUT HOW CAN I DEFEAT
THIS ALL-POWERFUL BEAST?

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.299
I WAS SO CLOSE!

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:00.700
WHAT'S THAT?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.402
AHHH...JOEY?

00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:04.971
THE HUGEST DUEL MONSTA
I'VE EVA SEEN!

00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.840
[THINKING]
IT'S ABOUT TIME
HE PLAYED IT!

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.275
BUT YUGI BETTER
ENJOY SLIFER <i>NOW,</i>

00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:11.244
BECAUSE BEFORE
THE FINALS ARE OVER,

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:13.279
THAT CARD WILL BE
IN <i>MY</i> DECK!

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.986
[THINKING] SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
HAS BEEN PLAYED BY THE PHARAOH,

00:08:19.986 --> 00:08:23.056
JUST AS MY MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
TOLD ME IT WOULD.

00:08:23.056 --> 00:08:27.127
ALL <i>THREE</i> EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
ARE PRESENT ON THIS AIRCRAFT,

00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:30.697
AND MY BROTHER MARIK
MUST NOT OBTAIN THEM.

00:08:30.697 --> 00:08:33.166
THE ONLY ONE CAPABLE
OF PREVENTING MARIK

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:35.368
FROM SEIZING
THE POWER HE DESIRES

00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:37.904
IS THE PHARAOH HIMSELF.

00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:39.639
YUGI!

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.409
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS POWERFUL,

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.411
BUT IT DOES NOT
GUARANTEE YOUR VICTORY.

00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:46.846
I'VE COME MUCH TOO FAR
TO LOSE NOW!

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:48.548
I'M AFRAID
IT'S OVER!

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:49.616
UHH!

00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:51.751
I KNEW THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:53.953
IN ORDER FOR YOU
TO DEFEAT THAT CREATURE...

00:08:53.953 --> 00:08:56.089
YOU'LL NEED ME!
GO ON!

00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:57.924
THE NUMBER OF CARDS
IN HIS HAND

00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.627
DETERMINES HOW MANY
ATTACK POINTS <i>SLIFER</i> HAS.

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:02.395
LISTEN CAREFULLY...

00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:04.998
HE NOW HOLDS THREE CARDS.

00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:08.334
THAT GIVES THE ALL-POWERFUL
<i>SLIFER</i> THE <i>SKY DRAGON</i>

00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:10.637
<i>3,000</i> ATTACK POINTS,

00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:14.174
AND YOU ONLY HAVE
<i>1,200 LIFE POINTS</i>
REMAINING.

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:16.676
WHICH MEANS THAT
AS SOON AS <i>SLIFER</i>
LAUNCHES AN ATTACK,

00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:18.077
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:19.245
NEVER!

00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:21.214
THE GHOST
OF <i>DARK SANCTUARY</i>

00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:24.150
IS STILL WANDERING
THE FIELD, YUGI.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.454
AND NOW, MY EVIL GHOST,
IT'S TIME TO ATTACK!

00:09:27.454 --> 00:09:30.457
POSSESS <i>SLIFER</i>
THE SKY DRAGON!

00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:35.295
WHAT HAPPENED!?
MY DARK GHOST
HAD NO EFFECT!

00:09:35.295 --> 00:09:37.130
LISTEN.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:41.167
YOU HAVE MUCH TO LEARN
ABOUT THE POWER OF
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:43.236
[THINKING]
UH! THIS CAN'T BE.

00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:45.872
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
IS MUCH TOO POWERFUL.

00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:48.208
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE
CARDS IN MY HAND,

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:51.411
NOR DO I HAVE ANY MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD TO PROTECT ME.

00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:53.580
DARK SANCTUARY
WAS MY ONLY HOPE,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.682
BUT SLIFER
HAS RENDERED IT USELESS.

00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:57.851
WHAT CAN I DO
AGAINST THE OVERWHELMING POWER

00:09:57.851 --> 00:10:00.153
OF AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!?

00:10:00.153 --> 00:10:02.188
ALL I <i>HAVE</i> IS MY
FACEDOWN TRAP CARD,

00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.357
AND IT'S OF NO USE TO ME!

00:10:04.357 --> 00:10:05.758
I CAN'T LOSE.

00:10:05.758 --> 00:10:07.427
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE FOR ME.

00:10:07.427 --> 00:10:08.828
I MUST WIN!

00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:11.664
YOU <i>WON'T</i> WIN!
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:15.134
MMM. ALL RIGHT!
NICE GOIN', YUGE!

00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:16.536
PREPARE TO LOSE!

00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:17.804
THIS CAN'T BE.

00:10:17.804 --> 00:10:19.873
IT'S NOT OVER YET,
YOU FOOL!

00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:21.474
I HAVE A PLAN
FOR US!

00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:22.675
WHAT?

00:10:22.675 --> 00:10:24.844
<i>SLIFER</i>
<i>THE SKY DRAGON,</i>

00:10:24.844 --> 00:10:26.980
ATTACK HIS
LIFE POINTS WITH--

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.214
Yugi: I SENSE SOMETHING.

00:10:31.117 --> 00:10:33.453
Yami-Yugi: MARIK!!

00:10:33.453 --> 00:10:35.688
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.460
Marik: WHY DIDN'T
HE ATTACK ME?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.061
Odion:
PERHAPS YOU WANT TO WAIT

00:10:49.061 --> 00:10:52.265
BEFORE YOU ATTACK
WITH SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:54.433
Yami-Yugi: WHAT DO
YOU WANT, MARIK!?

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:56.702
'EY, COME UP HERE
AND GET A PIECE A DIS!

00:10:56.702 --> 00:10:58.204
JOEY!

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:01.541
I DON'T THINK YOU WANNA
MESS WITH THIS GUY, MAN!

00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:03.309
THEY THINK HE'S <i>ME.</i>

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.377
HEY YOU...

00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:06.179
JUST WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE ANYWAY?

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:09.782
YOU CAN'T JUST BUST
IN HERE AND INTERRUPT
SOMEONE ELSE'S DUEL.

00:11:09.782 --> 00:11:10.950
WHAT IS IT!?

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.952
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:15.821
BAKURA IS NOW
UNDER THE CONTROL OF
THE MILLENNIUM ROD,

00:11:15.821 --> 00:11:18.791
AND HE WILL DO
ONLY WHAT I
COMMAND HIM TO DO.

00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:20.893
WHAT? HOW CAN THAT BE?

00:11:20.893 --> 00:11:24.564
I THOUGHT THE SPIRIT
OF THE MILLENNIUM RING
WAS IN CONTROL OF BAKURA?

00:11:24.564 --> 00:11:26.666
TRUE,

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:29.135
BUT NOW I AM IN CONTROL
OF BOTH BAKURA
<i>AND</i> THE SPIRIT,

00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:31.304
AND NOW
I SHALL PROVE IT

00:11:31.304 --> 00:11:34.207
BY FREEING
YOUR FRIEND'S MIND!

00:11:34.207 --> 00:11:35.308
WHAT?

00:11:35.308 --> 00:11:38.311
JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, MARIK?

00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.146
THE ONLY WAY
TO WIN THIS DUEL

00:11:40.146 --> 00:11:43.216
IS FOR YOU TO RELEASE
THE MIND OF THE BOY
YOU CONTROL.

00:11:43.216 --> 00:11:44.517
WHY SHOULD I?

00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:47.019
YOUR OPPONENT
WON'T DESTROY HIS <i>FRIEND.</i>

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.955
FINE.

00:11:48.955 --> 00:11:50.790
UHH...UHH...

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.325
AHH...

00:11:52.325 --> 00:11:54.026
OH, MY ARM...

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:55.261
IT HURTS...

00:11:55.261 --> 00:11:56.362
BAKURA!

00:11:56.362 --> 00:11:57.597
BAKURA!

00:11:57.597 --> 00:11:58.631
ARE YOU OK?

00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:00.600
YUGI, HELP ME?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.501
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM?

00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:05.471
WHAT AM I DOING HERE
IN THIS DUEL?

00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:07.573
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY ARM?

00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:08.908
IT <i>IS</i> HIM.

00:12:08.908 --> 00:12:10.209
HE'S IN PAIN.

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.012
WITHOUT THE SPIRIT OF THE RING,
HE IS WEAK.

00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:14.213
THEREFORE...

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:16.515
YOU MAY WISH TO RECONSIDER
YOUR ATTACK.

00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:19.118
THE DEVASTATION CAUSED
BY SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON

00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:21.454
COULD MAKE YOUR FRIEND'S
CONDITION EVEN WORSE.

00:12:21.454 --> 00:12:22.688
WHAT?

00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:24.957
WOULD YOU RISK THE HEALTH
OF YOUR FRIEND?

00:12:24.957 --> 00:12:28.594
ONLY A COWARD WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
TO WIN A DUEL!

00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:30.363
DAT'S A CHEAP TRICK,
MARIK!

00:12:30.363 --> 00:12:32.031
BAKURA!
HANG IN THERE!

00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:33.266
YUGI!

00:12:33.266 --> 00:12:34.433
Marik: HMM...

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:36.135
WELL DONE, ODION.

00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:40.139
HE'LL NEVER
ATTACK HIS PATHETIC,
DEFENSELESS FRIEND NOW.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:42.942
MASTER MARIK ALWAYS
KNOWS WHAT'S BEST.

00:12:42.942 --> 00:12:45.778
I MUST OBEY
HIS COMMANDS.

00:12:45.778 --> 00:12:48.047
I DON'T FEEL
VERY WELL, YUGI...

00:12:48.047 --> 00:12:49.248
BAKURA!!

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:50.983
STOP RIGHT THERE!

00:12:50.983 --> 00:12:54.654
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE
CONTACT WITH YOUR OPPONENT
DURING A DUEL.

00:12:54.654 --> 00:12:57.023
TAKE ONE MORE STEP,
AND YOU'LL BE
DISQUALIFIED.

00:12:57.023 --> 00:12:58.024
[GROWLS]

00:12:58.024 --> 00:12:59.292
Yugi: I'VE GOT TO HELP BAKURA,

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:00.960
BUT IF I DO, I'LL BE KICKED OUT
OF THE FINALS,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.129
AND THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE IN DANGER.

00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:05.097
Tea: STOP THE DUEL
RIGHT NOW!

00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:06.766
Tristan:
BAKURA NEEDS
TO SEE A DOCTOR.

00:13:06.766 --> 00:13:09.235
WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL <i>NOW!</i>

00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:10.970
Marik:
IT'S THE PERFECT PLAN.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.205
WITH BAKURA IN NEED
OF MEDICAL ATTENTION,

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:14.874
YAMI WILL LOSE THE DUEL,

00:13:14.874 --> 00:13:17.710
AND HIS EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD WILL BE MINE!

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.880
IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO DUEL,
YOU WILL FORFEIT THE MATCH!

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.114
[GROWLS]

00:13:22.114 --> 00:13:24.317
UHH...YUGI...HELP...

00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:26.018
Yugi: IF I ATTACK BAKURA
TO WIN THIS,

00:13:26.018 --> 00:13:27.820
I MAY HURT HIM EVEN MORE,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.889
BUT IF I DON'T,
I'LL BE DISQUALIFIED!

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:32.992
YUGI, I'LL MAKE
THIS DECISION
VERY EASY FOR YOU.

00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:34.560
FINISH HIM OFF!

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.996
I OFFER YOU
A SECOND WARNING.

00:13:36.996 --> 00:13:39.465
MAKE YOUR MOVE
OR LOSE YOUR SPOT
IN THE FINALS.

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:40.466
NOW GO.

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:41.634
CHILL OUT, BUDDY.

00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:42.968
CAN'T YOU SEE
THE POOR GUY'S
INJURED?

00:13:42.968 --> 00:13:44.036
COME ON!

00:13:44.036 --> 00:13:46.439
WHAT KINDA SHOW
YOU GUYS RUNNIN' HERE!?

00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:49.809
GET DOWN, OR YOU
WILL BE DISQUALIFIED
FROM THE FINALS, AS WELL!

00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:51.944
WHAT? ARE YOU
KIDDIN' ME!?

00:13:51.944 --> 00:13:54.046
OHH, IF I COME
DOWN THERE...

00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:56.515
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S GONNA NEED
MEDICAL ATTENTION...

00:13:56.515 --> 00:13:57.516
YOU ARE--

00:13:57.516 --> 00:13:58.718
YAAAH!

00:13:58.718 --> 00:13:59.719
UH!
UH!
UH!

00:13:59.719 --> 00:14:02.154
CONTINUE THE DUEL NOW!

00:14:02.154 --> 00:14:03.689
YUGI, DO IT!

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:06.025
Yugi: I'VE GOT
TO MAKE A DECISION!

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:09.562
DO I RISK BAKURA'S HEALTH
TO SAVE THE WORLD!?

00:14:09.562 --> 00:14:11.564
WE'RE ABOUT
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:13.999
YUGI WOULD NEVER ATTACK
HIS FRIEND BAKURA.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:17.703
UNLESS HE DOESN'T
WANT TO LOSE THE FINALS.

00:14:17.703 --> 00:14:19.739
UHH...

00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:21.941
PLEASE, SOMEONE HELP ME.

00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:24.043
I DON'T FEEL WELL AT ALL.

00:14:24.043 --> 00:14:26.479
I MUST LIE DOWN
AND GET SOME REST.

00:14:26.479 --> 00:14:27.480
PLEASE.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.714
AH!

00:14:28.714 --> 00:14:31.016
MARIK. I MUST STEP IN.

00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:32.651
I STILL NEED BAKURA...

00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:34.420
AND I CAN'T RISK HIS HEALTH!

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.423
HE HOLDS THE MILLENNIUM RING
AND MY SPIRIT.

00:14:37.423 --> 00:14:39.692
I MUST PROTECT HIM
FOR THE MOMENT.

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:41.193
HA HA HA!

00:14:42.862 --> 00:14:44.029
WHAT!?

00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:46.365
Yami-Bakura:
I'M BACK, YUGI!
HA HA HA!

00:14:50.363 --> 00:14:52.065
IT'S <i>YOU!</i>

00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:53.333
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:55.969
I'M BACK IN CONTROL
OF YOUR FRIEND, BAKURA!

00:14:55.969 --> 00:14:57.637
I STILL NEED HIM.

00:14:57.637 --> 00:14:59.472
WHAT?

00:14:59.472 --> 00:15:03.209
SO IF YOU PLAN ON USING
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD, YUGI,

00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:05.945
WHY DON'T YOU USE IT
ON ME RIGHT NOW!?

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:08.014
COME ON, YUGI!!

00:15:08.014 --> 00:15:11.084
ALL RIGHT!
IT'S TIME! NOW!

00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:13.519
GO, <i>SLIFER</i>
<i>THE SKY DRAGON!</i>

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.221
ATTACK!

00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:16.723
Marik:
YUGI'S WON <i>THIS</i> DUEL,

00:15:16.723 --> 00:15:18.758
BUT I'LL BE BACK
TO TAKE WHAT'S MINE!

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.129
HA HA HA!

00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:26.232
SOON I SHALL CONTROL
THE WORLD'S GREATEST POWER!

00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:37.210
UHH...

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.212
AND...THE WINNER IS...

00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:41.347
DUELIST NUMBER THREE, YUGI MOTO.

00:15:41.347 --> 00:15:42.882
BAKURA!

00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:45.985
Joey:
NOW LOWER DAT ARENA
AND GET DEM DOWN HERE!

00:15:49.756 --> 00:15:50.823
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT!?

00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:51.824
Duke:
HANG IN THERE, MAN.

00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:52.825
Joey:
WE GOTCHA, BUDDY.

00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:54.027
Tristan: BAKURA!

00:15:54.027 --> 00:15:56.129
HEY...SO WHERE AM I?

00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:58.164
YOU'RE WITH YOUR
FRIENDS NOW, BAKURA.

00:15:58.164 --> 00:15:59.732
HE DOESN'T
LOOK VERY GOOD.

00:15:59.732 --> 00:16:01.934
I THINK WE NEED TO
GET HIM TO A DOCTOR.

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:03.770
SO WHY DON'T
WE GET KAIBA TA
LAND DIS DING!?

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.938
YEAH! BUT FIRST...

00:16:05.938 --> 00:16:08.608
HELP HIM ONTO MY
BACK SO THAT WE CAN
GET HIM TO HIS ROOM.

00:16:08.608 --> 00:16:09.842
UH!

00:16:09.842 --> 00:16:11.778
THERE YA GO.

00:16:15.048 --> 00:16:17.483
Yugi: I'M GLAD BAKURA'S OK.

00:16:17.483 --> 00:16:20.653
THAT WAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST
CHOICES I EVER HAD TO MAKE.

00:16:20.653 --> 00:16:22.722
IF THE EVIL SPIRIT
DIDN'T COME BACK TO DUEL,

00:16:22.722 --> 00:16:23.856
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD HAVE DONE.

00:16:23.856 --> 00:16:26.659
THE MILLENNIUM RING
IS A LOT LIKE MY PUZZLE.

00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:28.227
IT HOLDS AN ANCIENT SPIRIT

00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:30.663
THAT DEPENDS ON SOMEONE ELSE
SO IT CAN EXIST,

00:16:30.663 --> 00:16:32.865
AND EVEN THOUGH THE SPIRIT
OF THE RING IS EVIL

00:16:32.865 --> 00:16:35.401
AND CONTROLS BAKURA
AGAINST HIS WILL,

00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:39.806
IT SEEMS TO STILL NEED BAKURA
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:41.674
BUT THERE IS ONE
MAJOR DIFFERENCE

00:16:41.674 --> 00:16:43.242
BETWEEN BAKURA
AND I, YAMI.

00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:45.078
WHAT'S THAT?

00:16:45.078 --> 00:16:47.313
THE SPIRIT
INSIDE <i>MY</i> ITEM
IS MY <i>FRIEND,</i>

00:16:47.313 --> 00:16:49.749
AND YOU AND I
ARE ALWAYS THERE TO
SUPPORT EACH OTHER,

00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:51.717
NO MATTER WHAT
COMES OUR WAY.

00:16:51.717 --> 00:16:54.520
YOU WERE THERE TO HELP
ME WHEN MY GRANDFATHER
WAS IN TROUBLE,

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.257
AND NOW I'M HERE
TO HELP YOU RESCUE
THE WORLD FROM EVIL!

00:16:58.257 --> 00:16:59.358
I PROMISE.

00:16:59.358 --> 00:17:00.593
TOGETHER,
WE'LL FIGURE OUT

00:17:00.593 --> 00:17:02.562
THE SECRETS
OF YOUR ANCIENT PAST

00:17:02.562 --> 00:17:05.965
AND HOW TO UNLOCK YOUR
HIDDEN POWERS BEFORE
MARIK CAN TAKE THEM,

00:17:05.965 --> 00:17:08.434
BECAUSE YOUR DESTINY
IS MINE, TOO!

00:17:08.434 --> 00:17:09.669
AND WE'RE GONNA WIN!

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:10.903
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:10.903 --> 00:17:12.438
THIS WAS
A TOUGH DUEL,

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:14.240
BUT THANKS
TO OUR TEAMWORK AND
THE HEART OF THE CARDS,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.942
WE CAME OUT ON TOP!

00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:17.443
NOW WE'RE HEADED
FOR ROUND TWO,

00:17:17.443 --> 00:17:19.378
AND WE'RE
GONNA TAKE IT
ALL THE WAY!

00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:21.347
AS LONG AS WE
STICK TOGETHER!

00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:22.415
RIGHT.

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:24.417
NOTHING WILL KEEP US
FROM OUR DESTINY.

00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:25.918
AWESOME!

00:17:29.522 --> 00:17:31.023
Roland: HOLD ON.
HUH?

00:17:31.023 --> 00:17:32.658
ACCORDING TO
BATTLE CITY RULES,

00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:34.627
AS THE WINNER OF THE DUEL,
YOU ARE ENTITLED

00:17:34.627 --> 00:17:37.330
TO TAKE THE RAREST CARD
FROM YOUR OPPONENT'S DECK.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.699
SO IT'S TIME TO CLAIM
YOUR PRIZE, YUGI.

00:17:39.699 --> 00:17:40.900
HUH, NO WAY!

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.537
I THINK BAKURA HAS BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY!

00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:47.640
SO YUGI WON THE FIRST DUEL
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.375
I KNEW HE WOULD!

00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:51.244
NO SURPRISE.

00:17:51.244 --> 00:17:53.679
WITH A CARD AS POWERFUL
AS <i>SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON</i>
IN HIS DECK,

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:56.149
YUGI IS DIFFICULT
TO DEFEAT...

00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:57.250
[THINKING] HMM...

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.584
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
HIS OPPONENT

00:17:58.584 --> 00:18:01.454
ALSO HAS
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:04.924
BAKURA'S BEEN
THROUGH A LOT,

00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:06.826
AND HE DEFINITELY
NEEDS REST,

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:09.562
BUT WE GOTTA LAND
THIS BLIMP AND GET
HIM TO A HOSPITAL.

00:18:09.562 --> 00:18:10.630
YEAH.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.199
SOME CRAZY STUFF WENT DOWN
IN DAT DUEL,

00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:15.134
ESPECIALLY WHEN
MARIK SHOWED UP.

00:18:15.134 --> 00:18:18.704
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
BACK THERE?

00:18:18.704 --> 00:18:22.141
Yugi: FOR SOME REASON,
MARIK DIDN'T WANT THE SPIRIT
OF THE RING TO LOSE.

00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:25.878
SO WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO PLAY
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
AND WIN THE DUEL,

00:18:25.878 --> 00:18:28.381
MARIK USED HIS MILLENNIUM ROD
TO FREE THE REAL BAKURA.

00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:29.815
SINCE HE WAS INJURED,

00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:31.184
MARIK KNEW I WOULD
FORFEIT THE DUEL

00:18:31.184 --> 00:18:33.052
INSTEAD OF ATTACKING HIM,

00:18:33.052 --> 00:18:36.122
BUT THE SPIRIT MUST HAVE BEEN
AFRAID I WOULD ATTACK BAKURA,

00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:38.491
BECAUSE HE TOOK CONTROL
AGAIN AT THE END.

00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:40.059
SO WAIT. DO YOU
MEAN TA TELL ME

00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:43.062
DAT DA DARK SPIRIT
'A DA MILLENNIUM
RING LET YOU WIN?

00:18:43.062 --> 00:18:45.698
YUP, BECAUSE HE <i>DEPENDS</i>
ON BAKURA TO SURVIVE,

00:18:45.698 --> 00:18:47.733
AND IF I <i>ATTACKED</i>
BAKURA WITH SLIFER,

00:18:47.733 --> 00:18:49.902
THE SPIRIT MIGHT'VE BEEN
IN DANGER, <i>TOO.</i>

00:18:49.902 --> 00:18:51.337
I'M CONFUSED.

00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:53.072
EVEN THOUGH
THE EVIL SPIRIT
WAS IN CONTROL,

00:18:53.072 --> 00:18:55.141
YA STILL ENDED UP
ATTACKING BAKURA.

00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:56.909
NO. SINCE
THE EVIL SPIRIT

00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:59.545
WAS IN CONTROL OF BAKURA
WHEN I ATTACKED HIM,

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:01.380
THE REAL BAKURA
WAS SPARED.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.182
Tea: THIS IS ALL
SO CONFUSING,

00:19:03.182 --> 00:19:07.286
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE MARIK
AND THE EVIL SPIRIT
WERE IN THIS TOGETHER.

00:19:07.286 --> 00:19:10.122
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT SURE
HOW OR WHY.

00:19:10.122 --> 00:19:13.259
I JUST KNOW WE
CAN'T LET MARIK
WIN THIS TOURNAMENT,

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:17.496
AND HOPEFULLY THAT
EVIL SPIRIT WON'T
BE COMING BACK AGAIN.

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:20.600
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF EVIL SPIRITS...

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.501
<i>AND</i> MIND-CONTROLLING
FOR ONE DAY.

00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:26.239
I'M SICK A DAT MARIK!
COME ON! LEMME AT 'IM!

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:28.674
HEY, DON'T GET YOURSELF
IN TROUBLE AGAIN!

00:19:28.674 --> 00:19:29.709
ALL RIGHT.

00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:31.244
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TALK TO KAIBA

00:19:31.244 --> 00:19:33.045
ABOUT GETTING BAKURA
BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL

00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:34.780
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.482
YEAH.
TRISTAN'S RIGHT.

00:19:36.482 --> 00:19:38.384
LET'S GET SOME HELP
FOR BAKURA!

00:19:38.384 --> 00:19:40.686
THEN LET'S STOP
TALKIN' ABOUT IT
ALREADY AND GO!

00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:41.721
GO AHEAD.

00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:43.656
I'LL STAY HERE AND KEEP
AN EYE ON BAKURA.

00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:45.291
OK. HANG IN
THERE, BAKURA.

00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:47.760
HELP
IS ON DA WAY!

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.761
OH!
HUH?

00:19:48.761 --> 00:19:50.129
Yugi: HOLD ON, GUYS!

00:19:50.129 --> 00:19:51.564
WHAT'S WRONG, YUGI?

00:19:51.564 --> 00:19:53.199
EVERYTHING A'RIGHT?

00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:54.934
IT'S GONE.

00:19:54.934 --> 00:19:56.369
HUH? WHAT'S GONE?

00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.104
BAKURA'S
MILLENNIUM RING!

00:19:58.104 --> 00:19:59.872
I DON'T
GET IT, GUYS.

00:19:59.872 --> 00:20:02.508
HE HAD IT AROUND HIS
NECK UNTIL THE END
OF THE DUEL...

00:20:02.508 --> 00:20:04.810
AND NOW IT'S
DISAPPEARED.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.646
THAT THING SEEMS
TO COME AND GO
<i>ALL THE TIME</i>

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:08.347
WITHOUT
ANY EXPLANATION.

00:20:08.347 --> 00:20:10.316
YEAH, AND YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:20:10.316 --> 00:20:12.285
PRA'BLY BLASTED IT
SKY HIGH!

00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:13.853
NOW LET'S
GET GOIN', HAH!?

00:20:13.853 --> 00:20:15.988
WELL...ALL RIGHT.

00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:18.357
SEE YA, TEA.

00:20:18.357 --> 00:20:19.625
LATER, GUYS.

00:20:25.631 --> 00:20:28.701
Marik: HA HA HA!

00:20:28.701 --> 00:20:30.903
Tea: HA HA HA!
