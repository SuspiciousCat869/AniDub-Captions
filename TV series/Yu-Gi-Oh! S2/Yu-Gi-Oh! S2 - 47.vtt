WEBVTT

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.496
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:04.097
ODION...

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:06.533
IT'S TIME TO DO WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE DONE AGES AGO.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.602
I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE
TO STEP IN NOW!

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:10.671
HUH? THE SPIRIT
OF THE MILLENNIUM RING!

00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:13.073
BUT I'VE GOT COMPANY
WITH ME THIS TIME.

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:15.576
IT APPEARS THE ESSENCE
OF MY WEAKER SELF

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:18.679
HAS TAKEN REFUGE WITHIN
THE BODY OF BAKURA!

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.781
I WANT MY BODY BACK!

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:23.050
HE PROMISED ME
THE MILLENNIUM ROD...

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.719
IF I CAN SUCCESSFULLY
DO AWAY WITH YOU.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.256
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO DUEL ME FOR THE RIGHTS
TO THE MILLENNIUM ROD?

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:31.658
WHY DON'T WE RAISE THE STAKES?

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:34.194
Yami-Marik:
THE WINNING DUELIST WILL
KEEP THE MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:37.531
THE LOSER WILL BE BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:39.066
DRAW YOUR CARDS!

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:45.105
AND LET
THE SHADOW GAME BEGIN!

00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:49.309
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.745
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:00:57.718 --> 00:00:59.219
♪ YU-GI-OH
IS IN THE GAME ♪

00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:24.111
IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:54.641
Joey: WHO YOU CALLIN'
MONKEY-BOY, KAIBA?

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.511
NO ONE TAWKS LIKE DAT
TA JOEY WHEELER.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.149
DAT'S RIGHT...

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:05.786
HUH? HEY, MAI!

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.088
HELLO JOEY.

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:10.190
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK
ON YOUR FEET!

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.359
I WAS FREAKIN' OUT
'BOUT YA! NO JOKE!

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.161
THANKS JOEY.

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.297
BUT YOU'VE GOT BIGGER THINGS TO
WORRY ABOUT THAN L'IL OL' MAI.

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:19.633
DON'T FORGET ME,
HANDSOME. OK?

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:22.069
SEE YA LATER.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.136
MAI!

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:24.604
MAI!

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:26.606
COME BAAAACK!

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:29.009
DON'T GO. I NEED YOU.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.645
MAI, I'LL GETCHA BACK...

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:33.013
FROM DA SHADOW REALM.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.865
Kaiba: IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE!

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:56.536
SOMEHOW I CAN UNDERSTAND
THE EGYPTIAN TEXT ON
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA.

00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:59.373
MY COMPUTER NETWORK COULDN'T
EVEN TRANSLATE IT!

00:02:59.373 --> 00:03:02.876
NOW I JUST NEED
TO WIN IT FROM MARIK.

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:05.412
Yami-Marik: ARE YOU READY?

00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:07.147
IN THIS SHADOW DUEL,

00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:10.484
THE LOSER WILL HAVE TO PAY
THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:11.551
[CHUCKLES]

00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:13.153
THERE WILL BE NO LAUGHTER

00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:15.922
ONCE I'VE BANISHED YOU
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:18.859
YOU WILL BE
THE ONE WHO'S LIVING
IN ETERNAL DARKNESS.

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.128
WAIT AND SEE.
HA HA!

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:24.765
THIS FOOL HAS ALREADY
FELT THE WRATH OF
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:26.333
GO SLIFER!

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.502
THE ATTACK DEVASTATED HIM

00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:31.171
SO HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN I PLAYED MINE.

00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:34.007
WINGED DRAGON OF RA,
ATTACK NOW!

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.678
Yami-Marik:
HE COMPLETELY MISSED
MY DEMONSTRATION

00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:41.448
OF THE UNSTOPPABLE POWERS
OF THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:43.250
IN MY LAST DUEL!

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.888
SO MY OPPONENT HAS NO IDEA
HOW MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD WORKS.

00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:51.958
HE WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WHEN RA UNLEASHES ITS RAGE!

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.460
OR WILL HE...?

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.462
I ALMOST FORGOT

00:03:55.462 --> 00:04:00.100
YOU HAVE THE DUELING EXPERIENCE
OF MY WEAKER SELF TO CALL UPON.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.835
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:06.540
AND, SINCE YOU'VE LEARNED
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT DUELING FROM HIM

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.644
THAT MEANS I KNOW YOUR
STRATEGY AND YOUR DECK
INSIDE AND OUT!

00:04:10.644 --> 00:04:13.180
THOSE TWO ARE IN
FOR QUITE A SURPRISE

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.349
ONCE THEY DISCOVER
I'VE CHANGED MOST OF THE CARDS

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.618
IN MY DUELING DECK!

00:04:18.618 --> 00:04:23.089
AND DON'T THINK I'M UNAWARE
OF THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
YOU NOW HOLD.

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:26.927
JUST BECAUSE THAT FOOL MARIK
IS DUELING ON YOUR SIDE,

00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:29.629
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SAFE
FROM THE FURY OF RA!

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.898
FOR WHEN I'M THROUGH
WITH YOU TWO...

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:34.267
YOU'RE BOTH CERTAIN
TO END UP IN THE DARK!

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:36.770
BEFORE WE START,
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.473
WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A FEW WORDS WITH YOU
FACE TO FACE.

00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:41.241
MAKE IT FAST.

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:43.710
I WILL WIN MY BODY
BACK FROM YOU

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.812
BECAUSE DESTINY
IS ON MY SIDE.

00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:46.980
SORRY.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.616
I'VE TAKEN OVER
YOUR DESTINY NOW.

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:54.454
AND WITH IT, I PLAN
TO CLAIM THE GREAT POWER
OF THE PHARAOH FOR MYSELF,

00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:57.023
WHILE YOU TWO FOOLS WALLOW
IN THE SHADOWS!

00:04:57.023 --> 00:05:00.827
I WON'T LET YOU CLAIM
MY FATE AS YOUR OWN,
BODY SNATCHER.

00:05:00.827 --> 00:05:02.195
HA HA HA HA!

00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:04.231
I'M AFRAID IT'S
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:06.766
I AM THE REAL YOU
AND SOON YOU'LL BE NOTHING

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:09.870
BUT A FORGOTTEN MEMORY
IN THE SANDS OF TIME!

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.238
HA HA HA HA!

00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:13.640
WHILE I WAS OCCUPYING
TEA'S MIND

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.609
I HEARD ISHIZU TELL
THE STORY

00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:17.777
OF THE FIRST DAY
YOU WERE BORN.

00:05:17.777 --> 00:05:20.614
MY BROTHER MARIK
WASN'T ALWAYS EVIL.

00:05:20.614 --> 00:05:25.051
Marik: SHE EXPLAINED
THAT AFTER I RECEIVED
THE TOMB KEEPERS INITIATION,

00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:28.054
THE SEEDS OF YOUR
EXISTENCE WERE PLANTED.

00:05:28.054 --> 00:05:31.157
AND IT WAS YOU WHO BEGAN
MY PATH TOWARDS DARKNESS

00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:35.195
WHEN YOU SENT MY FATHER
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:38.331
SOON YOU'LL PAY FOR WHAT
YOU DID TO ME AND TO HIM!

00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:39.866
WHAT I DID?

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:41.935
I WAS BORN
OUT OF YOUR HATE,

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:44.571
YOUR JEALOUSY AND YOUR ANGER
TOWARDS YOUR FATHER,

00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:46.806
WHICH MAKES YOU
JUST AS GUILTY AS ME!

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:48.208
THAT MAY BE.

00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:51.978
BUT FROM NOW ON I'LL MAKE UP
FOR EVERYTHING I'VE DONE.

00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:54.714
FATHER PLEASE FORGIVE ME...

00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:56.550
VERY TOUCHING.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.386
NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH.

00:05:59.386 --> 00:06:02.589
YOU HAVE TAKEN
YOUR FIRST STEP, MARIK

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.992
ON A DANGEROUS PATH
OF ULTIMATE DARKNESS.

00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:08.962
NOW YOU MUST TURN BACK
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:13.099
SOON THE PHARAOH WILL RETURN.
TURN BACK.

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.269
Marik: ODION SHIELDED ME
FROM THE TRUTH AND FOR YEARS

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:19.906
I BELIEVED
IT WAS THAT STRANGER
WHO DESTROYED MY FATHER.

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:22.309
BUT NOW I KNOW BETTER.

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:24.210
I KNOW IT WAS YOU.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.380
I'D SAY YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.615
NOT REALLY.

00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:30.750
ONCE THIS DUEL'S OVER
AND YOU'RE GONE

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.752
REVENGE WILL BE MINE!

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.988
WITHOUT ME
YOU WON'T EXIST!

00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:39.125
IT APPEARS THERE ARE
SOME SECRETS THAT MARIK
HAS KEPT FROM ME.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:43.229
NOW IF HE WANTS MY HELP
IT WILL COST HIM DEARLY!

00:06:48.162 --> 00:06:50.464
JUST STAND BACK
AND DO AS I SAY!

00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:51.732
SILENCE!

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:53.567
THERE'S BUSINESS
TO DISCUSS FIRST.

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:56.670
I'LL HELP YOU
TO RECLAIM YOUR BODY
BUT I HAVE A PRICE!

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.239
VERY WELL THEN.

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:01.108
IF WE WIN THE DUEL
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:02.510
SORRY, MARIK.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.946
THAT'S OUR OLD DEAL.
NOW I NEED MORE!

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:07.848
WHAT'S THAT I HEARD
ABOUT YOU SEEKING

00:07:07.848 --> 00:07:09.917
THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH?

00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:11.685
IS THERE A MAGIC
STRONGER THAN THAT

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:13.320
OF THE SEVEN
MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.389
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD ME ABOUT?

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.059
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT SECRETS YOU'RE
KEEPING FROM ME MARIK!!

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:21.495
TELL ME EVERYTHING
AND WE HAVE A DEAL.

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:23.864
IF WE WIN,
I'LL TELL YOU ALL.

00:07:23.864 --> 00:07:25.766
THEN LET'S BEGIN.

00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:29.236
I DON'T TRUST YOU
AT ALL BUT THIS TIME
I KNOW YOU NEED ME.

00:07:29.236 --> 00:07:30.671
THEN LET'S DUEL!

00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:32.873
YOU HEARD
YOUR BETTER HALF,
YOU FIEND.

00:07:32.873 --> 00:07:35.809
NOW PREPARE
FOR A ONE-WAY TRIP
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:37.144
HA HA HA HA!

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:39.213
SEEMS YOU'RE
A BIT CONFUSED.

00:07:39.213 --> 00:07:42.883
I'M GOING TO BRING THE DARKNESS
OF THE SHADOW REALM RIGHT HERE

00:07:42.883 --> 00:07:45.586
SO IT CAN CONSUME YOU
PIECE BY PIECE.

00:07:45.586 --> 00:07:47.454
HA HA HA HA!

00:07:47.454 --> 00:07:49.590
BLACKNESS SURROUND US!

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.793
PREPARE FOR A BATTLE
LIKE NO OTHER!

00:07:52.793 --> 00:07:56.497
FOR IN THIS DUEL THE ETERNAL
DARKNESS OF THE SHADOW REALM

00:07:56.497 --> 00:07:59.967
WILL SLOWLY DEVOUR THE LOSER
AS HIS LIFE POINTS DIMINISH.

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.769
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:03.304
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

00:08:03.304 --> 00:08:04.305
VERY WELL.

00:08:04.305 --> 00:08:05.906
LET'S DUEL!

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:13.747
AND NOW...LET
THE DESTRUCTION
COMMENCE!

00:08:13.747 --> 00:08:17.851
I SEE THE CARDS
IN MY DECK ARE ALREADY
SHOWING YOU NO MERCY.

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:21.855
MERCY IS FOR THE WEAK
LIKE YOU, MY FRIEND!

00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:25.159
FIRST OFF, I'LL PLACE
THIS FACEDOWN.

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:29.964
THEN I SHALL SUMMON THE
TERRIFYING GOBLIN ZOMBIE
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:08:29.964 --> 00:08:31.432
ARE YOU SCARED YET?

00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:33.467
HA! SCARED OF THAT!?

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:34.735
NO.

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:38.038
I'LL PLACE A CARD FACEDOWN

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:40.107
AND SUMMON DRILLAGO!

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.110
ATTACK HIM NOW!

00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:46.113
FOOL!

00:08:46.113 --> 00:08:49.917
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
MY TRAP CARD
FEARFUL EARTHBOUND!

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:51.051
NO!

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.520
HMM! YES,
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE!

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.655
RRR!

00:08:54.655 --> 00:08:56.323
YOUR FIRST OF MANY!

00:08:56.323 --> 00:08:58.459
WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS?

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:01.729
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO RESIST
ATTACKING MY ZOMBIE,

00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:04.398
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO PUNISH YOU FOR
YOUR FATAL ERROR

00:09:04.398 --> 00:09:06.533
BY WEAKENING
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:08.602
WHEN THIS TRAP CARD'S
ACTIVATED,

00:09:08.602 --> 00:09:12.072
THE OPPOSING DUELIST
AUTOMATICALLY LOSES
500 LIFE POINTS

00:09:12.072 --> 00:09:14.275
EACH TIME
HIS MONSTER ATTACKS.

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:15.909
LIKE NOW!

00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:19.280
RRR! I'M STILL
SENDING YOUR MONSTER
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.950
FEEL FREE TO DESTROY
MY WEAK MONSTERS,
WHENEVER YOU WANT!

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.185
NOT ONLY WILL YOU
LOSE LIFE POINTS,

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:27.621
BUT WITH EACH
MONSTER YOU SEND
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:29.456
I GROW STRONGER!

00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:37.965
AND NOW YOU WILL FEEL
THE EFFECT OF MY
FEARFUL EARTHBOUND

00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:40.701
AS IT LOWERS
YOUR LIFE POINTS
BY 500!

00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:44.672
HUH! REALLY? GUESS AGAIN!

00:09:44.672 --> 00:09:45.673
WHAT!?

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:47.808
I ACTIVATE REMOVE TRAP!

00:09:52.846 --> 00:09:55.249
HA HA HA HA!

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:58.752
MY MAGIC CARD HAS ELIMINATED
YOUR PATHETIC TRAP!

00:09:58.752 --> 00:10:02.323
IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN A MAGIC CARD
TO BEAT ME.

00:10:02.323 --> 00:10:06.093
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT FROM THE LOOKS
OF YOUR ARM IT'S A START.

00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:07.561
MY ARM?

00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:08.796
[GASPS]

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.631
HA HA HA HA!

00:10:10.631 --> 00:10:13.901
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR.

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:16.537
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO MY BODY?

00:10:16.537 --> 00:10:18.005
IT'S VANISHING!

00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:21.375
OBVIOUSLY
YOU WEREN'T LISTENING
TO WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.877
REMEMBER, YOU JUST LOST
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:25.846
AND AS THEY FADE AWAY,

00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:27.948
SO WILL SMALL PORTIONS
OF YOUR BODY

00:10:27.948 --> 00:10:30.751
UNTIL THE SHADOW REALM
CLAIMS ALL OF YOU!

00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:32.686
YOU FIEND.

00:10:32.686 --> 00:10:36.724
SOON THE DARKNESS
WILL FEED ON YOUR SOUL
FOR ALL ETERNITY!

00:10:39.593 --> 00:10:43.464
I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH HOW
THE SHADOW REALM OPERATES.

00:10:43.464 --> 00:10:46.834
BESIDES, IT IS YOU WHO SHALL
DISAPPEAR INTO THE DARKNESS!

00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:48.302
DON'T BE A FOOL!

00:10:48.302 --> 00:10:50.003
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN WIN

00:10:50.003 --> 00:10:52.606
AS LONG AS I CONTROL
THE ULTIMATE WEAPON

00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:54.775
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:10:54.775 --> 00:10:56.110
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.845
FOR WITH THE HELP
OF YOUR OTHER HALF,

00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:59.880
I WILL CERTAINLY
PREVAIL.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.916
ONLY FOOLS RELY ON THE HELP
OF THE DESPERATE!

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.084
HA HA!

00:11:04.084 --> 00:11:06.587
JUST WAIT, YOU'LL SEE!

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:26.736
WHERE AM I?

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:28.771
THIS STUFF LOOKS FAMILIAR.

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.107
BUT WHERE HAVE I
SEEN IT BEFORE?

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:35.878
WAIT A SEC!

00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:38.247
THIS IS THE INSIDE
OF MY MIND!

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:40.816
AND THAT'S THE DOOR
TO YAMI'S SIDE.

00:11:42.518 --> 00:11:44.086
I'VE BEEN IN THERE
ONCE BEFORE

00:11:44.086 --> 00:11:46.021
AND IT WAS REALLY DANGEROUS.

00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:50.059
BUT MAYBE I CAN FIND SOME CLUES
TO THE ANCIENT PAST.

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:52.495
WHOA! TALK ABOUT
A COMPLEX MIND!

00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:55.064
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING
THIS MANY LEVELS BEFORE!

00:11:55.064 --> 00:11:58.033
THERE ARE FALSE STARTS
AND DEAD ENDS EVERYWHERE!

00:11:58.033 --> 00:11:59.502
SOMETHING WRONG,
YUGI?

00:11:59.502 --> 00:12:01.604
SORRY IF I DISTURBED YOU.

00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:04.573
YOUR MIND MUST'VE
BEEN RESTLESS TO HAVE
BROUGHT YOU HERE.

00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:06.709
I GUESS I AM
A LITTLE WORRIED.

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:08.811
HEH HEH HEH.
YES, OF COURSE.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.246
TELL ME WHAT'S ON
YOUR MIND.

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:13.415
HMM. IT SEEMS
LIKE THINGS ARE GETTING
OUT OF HAND LATELY.

00:12:13.415 --> 00:12:15.184
AND THE DANGER'S GROWING.

00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:18.053
THAT'S TRUE. IT GROWS
AS WE NEAR OUR DESTINY.

00:12:18.053 --> 00:12:19.555
SO THAT'S WHY.

00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:21.824
I'M STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND THIS PLACE.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:25.127
I THINK I KNOW WHY
IT'S SO COMPLEX.

00:12:25.127 --> 00:12:27.730
ALL THESE
CONFUSING PATHS...

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.633
THEY REPRESENT ALL
THE MYSTERIES OF YOUR PAST

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.636
AND ALL THE QUESTIONS
YOU HAVE ABOUT THE FUTURE.

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:35.204
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:39.441
YAMI, I KNOW WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE ALL OF THIS OUT SOON!

00:12:39.441 --> 00:12:42.378
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYONE STAND IN OUR WAY!

00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:47.983
YOU MAY HAVE
STRUCK FIRST,

00:12:47.983 --> 00:12:50.085
BUT I'LL HAVE
THE LAST LAUGH.

00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:53.222
AND THE JOKE
WILL BE ON YOU!

00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:54.790
NOW THEN...

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.860
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHICH CARD YOU PLAY NEXT!

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.962
I KNOW YOUR DECK
VERY WELL

00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:02.998
AND NONE OF YOUR MOVES
WILL SURPRISE ME.

00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:07.002
REMEMBER, I WITNESSED
YOUR LAST DUEL!

00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:09.271
IF HE'S FAMILIAR
WITH MY CARDS,

00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:13.075
HE'LL BE EXPECTING ME
TO USE MY DESTINY BOARD
AS I DID LAST TIME.

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:15.945
BUT I'M AFRAID HE'S IN
FOR A SURPRISE!

00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:17.880
STALLING WON'T HELP HIM.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.350
IT WILL JUST DELAY
THE APPEARANCE OF
MY WINGED DRAGON OF RA

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.652
AND HIS ASSURED DESTRUCTION.

00:13:23.652 --> 00:13:24.620
HA!

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.088
I'M WAITING!

00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:28.390
HEH! ANXIOUS
TO LOSE ARE WE?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.993
HE HAS ONLY ONE MONSTER
ON THE FIELD.

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:33.629
SO EVEN IF THE WINGED
DRAGON OF RA IS ALREADY
IN HIS HAND,

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:35.331
I STILL HAVE TIME,

00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:37.333
FOR HE MUST SACRIFICE
THREE MONSTERS

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:40.135
BEFORE HE CAN SUMMON
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:13:40.135 --> 00:13:42.304
RA IS NO THREAT,
TRUST ME.

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:44.240
KEEP QUIET!
I HAVE A PLAN!

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.908
DON'T BE A FOOL!

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.777
IN MY MIND, LIES
THE SECRET OF RA!

00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:49.979
GIVE IT TO ME!

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:51.313
LET'S GO!

00:13:51.313 --> 00:13:54.183
YOU CAN ARGUE WHEN YOU'RE
BOTH IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:57.052
BELIEVE ME,
WHATEVER YOU'RE PLANNING
WON'T WORK ANYWAY!

00:13:57.052 --> 00:13:59.655
THANKS FOR THE TIP...
THAT JUST MIGHT WORK.

00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:01.190
HMM.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.326
YOU DO REALIZE
IF THE SCHEME YOU'VE
JUST TOLD ME WORKS,

00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:08.030
AND WE DEFEAT THIS DEMON,
YOU MAY LOSE YOUR BODY
IN THE PROCESS!?

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.065
I'LL RISK IT!
NOW GO!

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:12.101
LET THEM CONSPIRE.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.203
IT WON'T DO THEM ANY GOOD!

00:14:14.203 --> 00:14:17.273
I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN...

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.808
AND I'LL SUMMON GERNIA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:22.811
JUST TRY
TO TEAR HIM DOWN!

00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:25.581
WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO NOW?

00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:27.082
NOT THAT IT MATTERS.

00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:30.386
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL DEFEAT HIM REGARDLESS.

00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:34.723
THAT IS, ONCE I DRAW
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
INTO MY HAND.

00:14:34.723 --> 00:14:36.825
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:38.093
EXCELLENT.

00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:40.829
THIS CARD WILL HELP ME
GET WHAT I NEED!

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:44.533
I ACTIVATE
THE CARD OF SANCTITY!

00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:46.568
WHAT DOES
YOUR MAGIC CARD DO?

00:14:46.568 --> 00:14:47.770
SIMPLE.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.407
WE MUST KEEP DRAWING
UNTIL WE BOTH HOLD SIX CARDS.

00:14:51.407 --> 00:14:53.742
THIS SHOULD HELP ME
IMMENSELY.

00:14:53.742 --> 00:14:54.743
RRR!

00:14:54.743 --> 00:14:56.245
NO!

00:14:56.245 --> 00:14:59.348
SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU DIDN'T DRAW
WHAT YOU NEEDED.

00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:02.451
FORTUNATELY
I CAN GIVE YOU
ONE MORE CHANCE AT IT.

00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:05.120
THAT IS, IF YOU
DON'T MIND MY HELP.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.989
OPEN FACEDOWN CARD!

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.857
MULTIPLE DESTRUCTION!

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:12.127
WHAT DOES THAT DO?!

00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:14.330
MY TRAP CARD FORCES
BOTH PLAYERS

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.732
TO DISCARD THEIR HANDS
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:15:16.732 --> 00:15:20.069
THEN LETS US DRAW
FIVE NEW CARDS
FROM OUR DECKS.

00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:23.305
OF COURSE
THERE IS A DOWNSIDE
TO PLAYING THIS CARD.

00:15:23.305 --> 00:15:26.542
THE DUELIST WHO USES IT
LOSES 100 LIFE POINTS

00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:28.978
FOR EACH CARD
HE THROWS AWAY.

00:15:28.978 --> 00:15:30.980
HEH HEH HEH!

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.748
IS THIS A TRICK!?

00:15:32.748 --> 00:15:35.284
WHY IS HE DESTROYING
HIMSELF!?

00:15:35.284 --> 00:15:37.920
WHO'S STALLING NOW?!
IT'S YOUR MOVE!

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.188
RRR!

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.993
STILL NO WINGED DRAGON!
I FAILED AGAIN.

00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:46.762
I SEE YOU STILL
HAVEN'T DRAWN
THE CARD YOU NEED YET?

00:15:46.762 --> 00:15:47.930
HOW PATHETIC!

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.632
RRR! YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT MY FACEDOWN CARD.

00:15:50.632 --> 00:15:52.568
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST!

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:54.303
THE END IS NEAR!

00:15:58.532 --> 00:16:00.500
Yami-Yugi:
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.135
LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE YUGI?

00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:03.270
A STRANGER
APPEARED TO US.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.971
SHADI!

00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:06.540
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.642
HE USED THE POWER
OF HIS MILLENNIUM KEY

00:16:08.642 --> 00:16:11.111
TO SEE INTO THE MAZE
OF MY INNER MIND.

00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:13.647
HE WAS SEARCHING
FOR THE TRUTH.

00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:15.949
YES. YOU MAY ENTER.

00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:19.453
BUT I WARN YOU
TO TREAD CAUTIOUSLY.

00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:22.722
EVEN HE COULDN'T FIND
ANY ANSWERS IN HERE.

00:16:22.722 --> 00:16:25.859
FOR BEHIND EVERY DOOR
WAS ANOTHER MENTAL TRAP

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.962
HIDING THE TRUTH.

00:16:28.962 --> 00:16:31.865
SO...SHADI HAD
NO BETTER LUCK
THAN I'VE HAD

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:34.401
TRYING TO SOLVE
THE MYSTERIES
IN MY MIND.

00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:37.404
I CLIMBED THESE STAIRCASES
AND ENTERED THESE DOORS

00:16:37.404 --> 00:16:40.373
JUST AS SHADI HAS
BUT TO NO AVAIL.

00:16:40.373 --> 00:16:42.008
BUT HE HASN'T
GIVEN UP YET.

00:16:42.008 --> 00:16:44.311
THAT'S WHY HE APPEARED
TO US ON THE BLIMP.

00:16:44.311 --> 00:16:48.281
YOU'VE LEARNED MUCH
SINCE WE FIRST MET
IN DUELIST KINGDOM, YUGI.

00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:50.550
YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND YOUR FATE

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.619
AND ITS RELATION
TO THE PAST.

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:54.654
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT MARIK SAID?

00:16:54.654 --> 00:16:57.257
HE TOLD US
THE SECRET TO UNLOCKING
THE PHARAOH'S POWER

00:16:57.257 --> 00:17:00.293
WAS IMPRINTED
ON HIS BACK DURING
THE CEREMONY.

00:17:00.293 --> 00:17:05.031
YES, PERHAPS HE HOLDS
THE ANSWERS WE HAVE BEEN
LOOKING FOR.

00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:07.968
YOU AND I MAKE
A GREAT TEAM YUGI.

00:17:07.968 --> 00:17:10.537
AND TOGETHER WE HAVE
TO DEFEAT MARIK

00:17:10.537 --> 00:17:12.772
AND UNLOCK THAT POWER
BEFORE HE DOES!

00:17:12.772 --> 00:17:15.542
AND I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU!

00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.511
I'LL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR YOU.

00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:18.845
THANKS.

00:17:18.845 --> 00:17:21.248
Yami-Marik:
YOU'RE WASTING AWAY
TO NOTHING!

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.783
THAT WILL SOON CHANGE!
I DRAW!

00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:28.221
PERFECT! JUST THE CARD
I WAS WAITING FOR.

00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:30.957
AND NOW I SHALL
SACRIFICE GERNIA

00:17:30.957 --> 00:17:34.027
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY DREADED
PUPPET MASTER!

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:41.301
DID I MENTION
MY NEW MONSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:43.970
FOR THE BARGAIN PRICE OF
A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.006
MY PUPPET MASTER
ALLOWS ME TO BRING

00:17:46.006 --> 00:17:48.308
THREE MONSTERS BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.384
AH! YOU FORGOT TO MENTION
ONE IMPORTANT FACT, YOU FOOL.

00:17:57.384 --> 00:17:59.819
YOUR MONSTERS
CAN'T ATTACK THIS TURN.

00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:02.656
WHO SAID I WAS GOING
TO ATTACK WITH THEM?

00:18:02.656 --> 00:18:05.091
I HAVE SOMETHING
FAR MORE INGENIOUS
IN MIND

00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:07.561
WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM THIS CARD!

00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:09.062
WHAT?!

00:18:09.062 --> 00:18:12.299
ACTIVATE THE MAGIC CARD,
DARK DESIGNATOR!

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.434
WHY SHOULD I CARE
ABOUT A MAGIC CARD

00:18:14.434 --> 00:18:16.703
THAT LETS YOU CHOOSE
ONE MONSTER FROM MY DECK

00:18:16.703 --> 00:18:19.239
AND PLACE IT
IN MY HAND UNLESS--

00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:20.840
YES!

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.344
I AM FORCING YOU TO DRAW
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
INTO YOUR HAND!

00:18:24.344 --> 00:18:27.280
SO I CAN THEN CLAIM IT
FOR MYSELF!

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.583
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:31.451
NOW ENJOY IT
WHILE YOU CAN

00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:33.019
FOR SOON
IT WILL BE MINE!

00:18:33.019 --> 00:18:35.121
DON'T BE SO SURE.

00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:38.658
I'M ONTO YOUR PLAN
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU,
YOU'LL FAIL.

00:18:38.658 --> 00:18:41.494
YOUR SAD ATTEMPT
TO STEAL RA WAS OBVIOUS.

00:18:41.494 --> 00:18:45.665
YOU LAID IT ALL OUT FOR ME
ON THE FIELD, YOU FOOL!

00:18:45.665 --> 00:18:46.666
HEH!

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.435
IT'S ALL THERE:

00:18:48.435 --> 00:18:50.704
THE THREE USELESS
MONSTERS YOU SUMMONED

00:18:50.704 --> 00:18:52.872
FOR 1000 LIFE POINTS,

00:18:52.872 --> 00:18:55.842
THE FACEDOWN CARD YOU'RE
WAITING TO ACTIVATE...

00:18:55.842 --> 00:18:57.911
HA HA! TOO BAD.

00:18:57.911 --> 00:19:00.046
THAT CARD WILL NEVER
LEAVE MY HANDS!

00:19:00.046 --> 00:19:02.515
DON'T BE TOO SURE
YOU DEMON.

00:19:02.515 --> 00:19:06.386
I ACTIVATE
MY FACEDOWN CARD,
EXCHANGE!

00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:07.721
I WAS RIGHT.

00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:09.789
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
ITS EFFECT:

00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:11.958
WHEN EXCHANGE IS
PLAYED EACH DUELIST

00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.893
TAKES A CARD
FROM THE OTHER'S HAND.

00:19:13.893 --> 00:19:16.863
SO PLEASE,
HAND OVER YOUR
WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:18.431
HEH!

00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:20.233
AS YOU WISH, FOOL.

00:19:20.233 --> 00:19:22.268
THANK YOU.

00:19:22.268 --> 00:19:24.270
GOOD LUCK.
HMM.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.774
NOW YOU PICK
A CARD, ANY CARD.

00:19:27.774 --> 00:19:31.177
MONSTER REBORN
SHOULD DO.

00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:34.514
IT MUST BE QUITE HARD
TO PART WITH YOUR MOST
POWERFUL CARD

00:19:34.514 --> 00:19:36.383
BUT DON'T FEEL BAD.

00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:39.786
IT MAY SEEM LIKE
YOU'VE JUST LOST YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:43.089
BUT I CAN PROMISE
THAT YOU WILL BE SEEING
IT AGAIN VERY SOON.

00:19:43.089 --> 00:19:45.392
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:47.627
DON'T GET EXCITED
JUST YET.

00:19:47.627 --> 00:19:50.463
HEH! I THINK YOU'RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING.

00:19:50.463 --> 00:19:53.400
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
THE POWER OF RA!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.037
WHICH MEANS THE CARD IS
ABSOLUTELY USELESS TO YOU!

00:19:57.037 --> 00:19:58.371
BUT NOT TO ME.

00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:01.307
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
MAY BE CONTROLLED BY ANYONE

00:20:01.307 --> 00:20:03.777
WHO CAN DECIPHER
AND RECITE THE ANCIENT TEXT

00:20:03.777 --> 00:20:05.412
THAT'S INSCRIBED
ON THE CARD.

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:07.013
WELL LOOK WHO'S BACK.

00:20:07.013 --> 00:20:09.049
LOOKS LIKE THE SPIRIT
OF THE RING

00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:11.084
ISN'T DUELIST ENOUGH
TO HANDLE ME

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:12.886
WITHOUT RUNNING
TO HIS LITTLE FRIEND
FOR HELP.

00:20:12.886 --> 00:20:14.387
DON'T PUSH ME!

00:20:14.387 --> 00:20:18.992
YOU'LL NEED MORE THAN
THAT WEAKLING'S HELP
TO DEFEAT ME.

00:20:18.992 --> 00:20:20.760
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.830
REMEMBER, MY PARTNER
KNOWS EVERYTHING YOU DO.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.266
AFTER ALL,
HE IS YOUR OTHER HALF!

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:29.169
WRONG! I AM COMPLETE
WITHOUT HIM!

00:20:29.169 --> 00:20:32.539
Marik:
YOU ARE NOTHING AND SOON
YOU WON'T EXIST AT ALL!

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:34.674
ONE MORE TURN TO GO!

00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:41.088
AND THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
WILL CAST YOU TO
THE SHADOWS!
