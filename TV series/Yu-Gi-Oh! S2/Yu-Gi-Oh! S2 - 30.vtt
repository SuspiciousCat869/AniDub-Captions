Narrator: PREVIOUSLY
ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.777
YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.247
YOU HAVE
SOMETHING I SEEK.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:14.615
GIVE ME YOUR
MILLENNIUM ITEM,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.949
AND YOU MAY PASS BY.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.051
YOU CAN HAVE
MY MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.920
BUT BEFORE I
HAND IT OVER,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.722
YOU HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.124
PERHAPS THERE IS A WAY
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.693
YOU'VE MADE
A WISE CHOICE.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.629
WITH OUR COMBINED POWER,

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.133
NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE ABLE TO STOP US!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.002
IT'S BAKURA,
AND HE'S HURT!

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.437
I JUST FOUND HIM
LYING ON THE GROUND.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.939
HE DOESN'T
LOOK SO GOOD.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.008
HE NEEDS TO GO TO
A HOSPITAL QUICKLY.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.142
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.811
I'LL TAKE HIM TO SEE
A DOCTOR RIGHT NOW.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.913
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.214
BEST OF LUCK!

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.715
HEY,
THANKS A LOT!

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.184
I'M NUM,
AND YOU ARE?

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.086
THE NAME'S JOEY.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.154
I'M TEA.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.222
THANKS FOR
ALL YOUR HELP.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.724
[THINKING] THOSE
FOOLS HAVE NO IDEA

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.226
WHO I REALLY AM,

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.663

IN STORE FOR THEM.

NOW WE CAN FOCUS ON
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.832
[THINKING] WE MAY HAVE
BEATEN MARIK THIS TIME,

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.867
BUT HE WILL
DEFINITELY BE BACK.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.069
MAYBE NEXT TIME, HE'LL
ACTUALLY SHOW HIS FACE,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.171
NOW THAT HE KNOWS MY
FRIENDS CAN'T BE CONTROLLED!

SERENITY,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.743
I WON'T FORGET HOW YOU
SAVED MY LIFE BACK THERE.

ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:28.849

MM-HMM.

LOOK, SERENITY, I KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.655
TO SEE YOUR BIG BROTHER
DUEL IN THE FINALS...

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:35.722
BUT I'LL TELL YA...

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.857
BETWEEN US,
GIRLFRIEND...

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.859
JOEY'S NOT GONNA
LAST TOO MUCH LONGER

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.160
IN THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.730
ESPECIALLY ONCE HE HAS
TO FACE ME IN A DUEL.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.998
OH, YEAH?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.199
WHO BEAT WHO
LAST TIME?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.035
PURE LUCK!

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.803
BESIDES DUELIST
KINGDOM'S ANCIENT HISTORY,

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:52.973
AND THIS TIME, I PLAN TO
WIPE OUT BOTH OF YOU BOYS!

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.108
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
TOUGH TO BEAT, MAI.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.677
FORGET
ABOUT IT, YUGI.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:58.245
AFTER WHAT YOU
AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.614
THE REST OF THIS TOURNAMENT'S
GONNA BE A BREEZE!

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:01.815
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.483
IT'S TIME TO USE
OUR LOCATOR CARDS

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.118
AND FIND OUT WHERE
THE FINALS ARE BEING HELD!

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.520
SO, LET'S DO THIS!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.355
ALL RIGHT!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.891
HERE WE COME,
BATTLE CITY FINALS.

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:11.925
WORD ON
THE STREET IS

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.293
WE PUT 'EM ON
OUR DUEL DISKS,

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.328
AND THE SECRET SITE
IS REVEALED.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.930
Mai: THAT MAKES
SENSE TO ME.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.598
Yugi: CHECK IT OUT!

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.400
Tea: IT'S PROJECTING
SOMETHING!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.435
Tristan: WHAT IS IT?

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.603
Tea: THIS
IS SO COOL!

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.939
Yugi: IT KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE A STADIUM.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.240
BUT HOW DO WE
GET THERE?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.809
Female voice:
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.610
OUR SATELLITE NETWORK
HAS CONFIRMED

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.713
THAT YOU ARE
A BATTLE CITY FINALIST.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.981
STAND BY FOR DIRECTIONS
TO KAIBA CORP STADIUM...

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:51.732
SEEMS EVERYTHING'S
GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.735
YES, AND I'VE
ALREADY DONE MORE
THAN I AGREED TO DO.

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:57.804
I "TOOK CARE" OF
BAKURA LIKE YOU ASKED

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.272
SO YOU COULD
RESCUE HIM, MARIK,

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.042
AND GAIN THE TRUST
OF THOSE FOOLS.

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.243
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.413
YOU'LL GET MY MILLENNIUM ROD
AND THE OTHER ITEMS

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.482
WHEN YOU COMPLETE
YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN.

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:11.785
LOOK, MY PATIENCE IS
GROWING THIN, MARIK!

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.553
WHAT'S THE NEXT
PART OF THE PLAN?

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.655
YOU'LL OBTAIN A DUEL DISK

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.391
AND ENTER THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT FINALS.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.727
I'LL HAND OVER
THE OBJECTS YOU SEEK

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.430
IF YOU CAN WIN ME
THE CARDS THAT I DESIRE.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.972
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
DUELIST ENOUGH TO
WIN THEM YOURSELF,

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.006
OR IS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.007
YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.309
ABOUT THIS SCHEME
OF YOURS, MARIK?

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.346
DO YOU WANT THE MILLENNIUM
ITEMS, OR DON'T YOU?

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.948
IF SO, I SUGGEST
YOU DO AS I SAY.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.351
TIME TO ENTER THE FINALS
IS RUNNING OUT.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.888
YOU'LL NEED TO OBTAIN
6 LOCATOR CARDS

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.356
IN ORDER TO QUALIFY!

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.525

WAKE UP!

ARE YOU OK?

HUH?

OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.942
YOU WERE SHOUTING
AND TOSSING AROUND!

A NIGHTMARE.

CAN MAKE IT

I'VE TRAINED TWO
OF 'EM MYSELF!

6 LOCATOR CARDS

TO QUALIFY FOR
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.079

MY WINNINGS TO MARIK,

IN THE WORLD WILL BE MINE!

YOURSELF A DUELIST?

HEY, MAN!

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:24.878
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:28.348
WELL, THEN?

00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:29.683
I MUST DUEL NOW!

OK, OK.

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.319
THERE'S A RUMOR
THAT SOME DUELS

ARE GOING ON
IN THE CEMETERY TONIGHT.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.856

THERE'S
NO DUELISTS HERE.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:42.295
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME KIND OF TRICK.

WHOA! WHOA!

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:46.933

IT'S NOT
A VERY NICE PLACE.

A BLOOMING NIGHTMARE!

OUR FIFTH LOCATOR CARD!

HA! BRILLIANT, MATES!

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.188
ONE MORE CARD,

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.623
RIGHT INTO THE FINALS.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.661
SPECIALLY AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED
TO US LAST TIME.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.930
IF THAT CREEP BANDIT

A DUELIST IN SIGHT.

WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.093
I'LL SHOW YOU!

YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR MY STRENGTH,

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.849
SO WE'LL DO
THINGS MY WAY.

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:44.784
I POSSESS ONE LOCATOR CARD,

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.227
BEHOLD!

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:23.062
THE GREAT MAMMOTH
OF GOLDFINE!

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.098
YOU ARE FINISHED!

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:29.969
SINCE FUSION
MONSTERS HAVE TO

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.738
WAIT ONE TURN
BEFORE ATTACKING,

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:33.906
I'LL LAY ONE CARD
FACEDOWN...

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.609
AND THEN I'LL WAIT
FOR YOU TO MAKE
YOUR NEXT MOVE.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.211
[THINKING] NOT ONLY
WILL MY MAMMOTH

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.413
TRAMPLE HIS MONSTER
IN MY NEXT TURN,

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:42.148
BUT WHEN I SPRING
MY TRAP CARD ON HIM,

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:45.184
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
HIS LOCATOR CARD IS MINE!

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.553
HEY, ARE YOU GONNA
DRAW OR WHAT?

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.523
WITH PLEASURE.

00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:51.724
BOO!

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.159
I'M PLAYING
A TRAP CARD!

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:55.595
SKULL INVITATION!

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:58.865
NOW EVERY TIME
A CARD IS SENT
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:00.833
MY SKULL INVITATION CARD

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.002
WILL SEVERELY DAMAGE
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:04.070
[LAUGHS]

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.472
SO, WHEN MY GREAT
MAMMOTH OF GOLDFINE

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:09.275
DESTROYS YOUR EARL OF
DEMISE IN MY NEXT TURN

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:13.012
YOU WILL LOSE 300
EXTRA LIFE POINTS
AUTOMATICALLY!

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.080
HA!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.048
TALK ABOUT HAVING ONE
FOOT IN THE GRAVE!

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.250
YOU ARE FINISHED, BUD!

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.252
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.253
[LAUGHS]

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.821
HUH?

00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:24.490
YOUR TRAP CARD IS
MEANINGLESS TO ME,

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.825
AND TO PROVE IT, I'LL SEND

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:29.962
EVERY CARD IN MY HAND
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:31.264
WHAT?

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.167
HE MUST BE MAD
AS A HATTER TO
MAKE THAT MOVE.

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:35.935
YOU CAN'T LOSE,
BONZIE!

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.336
YEAH!

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:40.106
SKULL INVITATION,
DO YOUR DIRTY WORK!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.611
[GRUNTS]

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:46.746
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:48.548
SQUEEZE THE LIFE POINTS
RIGHT OUT OF HIM!

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:50.450
[LAUGHS]

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:53.052
NOW WHAT'S
SO FUNNY?

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.954
YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.623
NOT ONLY ARE YOU ABOUT
TO LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.258
BUT WHEN I'M DONE
WITH YOU

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:01.894
YOU'LL LOSE
SO MUCH MORE!

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.700
YOU WERE SO DISTRACTED
BY THE HOPELESS THOUGHT

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.168
OF WINNING MY LOCATOR CARD

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.503
AND ADVANCING TO THE FINALS,

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:13.005
YOU FAILED TO NOTICE
I'VE PLAYED A MAGIC CARD.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.977
OH, NO!

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.346
IT'S CALLED
SPIRITUALISTIC MEDIUM,

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.148
AND IT PROVIDES
MY EARL OF DEMISE

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.350
WITH AN ADDITIONAL
500 ATTACK POINTS

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.119
FOR EVERY CARD DESTROYED
DURING MY TURN.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:28.120
IT CAN'T!

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.455
OH, IT CAN,

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:31.290
AND IF YOU
REMEMBER CORRECTLY...

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.559
I DESTROYED 4
OF MY OWN CARDS

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:36.629
GIVING MY MONSTER 2,000
MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:38.431
GO, MY SPIRITS,

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:41.634
AND ADD YOUR POWER
TO THE EARL OF DEMISE!

00:16:41.634 --> 00:16:44.170
[ROARING]

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.806
AAH! IT'S GROWN
TOO POWERFUL!

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:48.741
YES!

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.744
EARL OF DEMISE,
DESTROY HIS MAMMOTH!

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.819
I LOSE 1,800
LIFE POINTS.

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:02.655
AND BECAUSE OF
YOUR OWN TRAP CARD,

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:05.324
YOU LOSE 300

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.398
AND WHEN I WIN,

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:14.400
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
WILL BE TRAPPED HERE.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.435
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:17.637
[LAUGHS]

00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:19.639
JUST LOOK AROUND YOU,

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.416
All: WHAT ARE
THOSE THINGS?!

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.218
THOSE ARE LOST SOULS,

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.886

LET THAT BE A LESSON.

00:17:56.876 --> 00:18:00.279
YOU CANNOT RUN
FROM THE SHADOW REALM.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.748
ONLY BY DEFEATING ME
IN THIS DUEL
