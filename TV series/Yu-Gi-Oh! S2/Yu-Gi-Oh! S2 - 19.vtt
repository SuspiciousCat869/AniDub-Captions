YOU ARE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR
WITH THE ANCIENT WAYS.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.251
IF YOU MUST KNOW...

00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:46.220
I'M A COLLECTOR OF SORTS.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.789
AND ONCE I POSSESS ALL SEVEN
MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:15:48.789 --> 00:15:53.994
I'LL CONTROL ANCIENT POWERS
STRONG ENOUGH TO RULE
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

FORTUNATELY FOR ME,
THIS STRANGER DOESN'T
KNOW EVERYTHING...

00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:11.612
FOR HE WHO POSSESSES
THE BOUNDLESS POWER OF
THE PHARAOH HIMSELF

00:16:11.612 --> 00:16:16.817
CONTROLS A MAGIC
FAR STRONGER THAN THE

YOU CAN HAVE MY MILLENNIUM
ROD IF YOU WANT.

BUT BEFORE I HAND IT
OVER TO YOU,

00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:32.733
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ME IN EXCHANGE.

00:16:32.733 --> 00:16:35.903
FOR I AM SOMEWHAT
OF A COLLECTOR MYSELF.

00:16:35.903 --> 00:16:38.772
AND ONCE I POSSESS
WHAT I DESIRE...

00:16:38.772 --> 00:16:42.843
THE MILLENNIUM ROD WILL MEAN
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME.

00:16:42.843 --> 00:16:44.545
WHY SHOULD I HELP?

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:48.716
I CAN TAKE YOUR MILLENNIUM
ITEM BY FORCE AS I'VE DONE
TO OTHERS IN THE PAST.

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:53.554
BECAUSE I KNOW THE
WHEREABOUTS OF SEVERAL
OF THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.891
INCLUDING THE MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE WORN BY MY SISTER!

00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:00.060
PERHAPS THERE IS A WAY
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.529
AND HELP EACH OTHER
TO GET WHAT WE WANT.

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:04.531
YOU'VE MADE A WISE CHOICE.

00:17:04.531 --> 00:17:10.704
WITH OUR COMBINED POWER,
NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE ABLE TO STOP US!

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:15.676
THIS DUEL ROCKS!

00:17:15.676 --> 00:17:17.378
MAKO'S FISH DECK IS
DESTROYING WHEELER!

00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:21.348
FLYING FISH ATTACK MY OPPONENT'S
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:26.353
AAH!

00:17:26.353 --> 00:17:28.222
GO, JOEY!

00:17:28.222 --> 00:17:32.393
AND NOW I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND COMPLETE MY TURN.

00:17:32.393 --> 00:17:34.161
FEEL THE POWER OF MY SEA DECK.

00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:37.197
MAKO TSUNAMI WILL SHOW NO MERCY!

00:17:37.197 --> 00:17:39.199
FINE.
WHO'S ASKIN' YA TO?

00:17:39.199 --> 00:17:43.170
FOR YEARS I HAVE SEARCHED FOR MY
LOST FATHER ON THE OPEN SEAS...

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.674
AND I'VE USED NOTHING BUT
A SMALL WOODEN FISHING BOAT.

00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:51.278
EVERY TIME I BATTLE THE MIGHTY
OCEAN WATERS I BECOME STRONGER.

00:17:51.278 --> 00:17:53.314
AND NO MATTER HOW
DIFFICULT THE STRUGGLE,

00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:57.117
I HAVE VOWED NEVER TO STOP
SEARCHING UNTIL I FIND HIM!

00:17:57.117 --> 00:18:00.154
I FACE MY DUELING OPPONENTS
WITH THE SAME DETERMINATION

00:18:00.154 --> 00:18:03.123
AND I FIGHT EVERY DUEL
IN HONOR OF MY FATHER.

00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:08.228
I KNOW IN MY HEART WE'LL BE
REUNITED SOMEDAY BUT
UNTIL THAT TIME...

00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:10.197
EVEN THOUGH
HE'S NOT RIGHT HERE,

00:18:10.197 --> 00:18:13.434
HE CONTINUES TO INSPIRE ME
AND GIVE ME STRENGTH.

00:18:13.434 --> 00:18:14.668
GUESS WHAT?

00:18:14.668 --> 00:18:17.638
I GOT SOMEONE WHO INSPIRES
ME LIKE DAT ALSO.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.673
MY LITTLE SISTA SERENITY.

00:18:19.673 --> 00:18:21.241
N' GUESS WHAT ELSE!?

00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:23.143
I DON'T SHOW ANY
MERCY EITHER, PAL.

00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:25.379
THEN ON WITH THE DUEL,
MY FRIEND!

00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:27.414
YEAH, BABY!

00:18:27.414 --> 00:18:29.383
THIS IS AWESOME!

00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:31.151
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:32.853
JUST STAY CALM, JOEY.

00:18:32.853 --> 00:18:34.254
A'RIGHT, LET'S GO!

00:18:34.254 --> 00:18:35.622
I PLAY...

00:18:35.622 --> 00:18:36.790
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD!

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.093
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:39.093 --> 00:18:42.496
AND I PLACE TWO MORE CARDS
FACEDOWN.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.832
YOUR TURN, FLIPPER.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:47.568
PERHAPS I UNDERESTIMATED HIM.

00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:49.536
HE IS MORE DETERMINED
THAN I THOUGHT...

00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:51.105
VERY WELL...

00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:52.840
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
TEACH HIM A LESSON.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.375
PREPARE TO LOSE!

00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:56.543
THE ONLY DING I'M GONNA
LOSE IS MY LUNCH

00:18:56.543 --> 00:18:59.079
FROM DA SMELL OF ALL
DIS ROTTEN FISH.

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:03.083
I SACRIFICE THE WEAKER FLYING
FISH IN ORDER TO SUMMON

00:19:03.083 --> 00:19:05.953
THE STRONGER AMPHIBIAN BEAST!

00:19:05.953 --> 00:19:08.222
I'M NOT FRIGHTENED
A DAT TAD POLE!

00:19:08.222 --> 00:19:11.992
YOU WILL BE WHEN
AMPHIBIAN BEAST ATTACKS
WITH SEA CLAW!

00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:15.729
HOLD ON!

00:19:15.729 --> 00:19:18.499
ACTIVATE FAIRY BOX!

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.936
WHERE DID YOUR GATOR
DISAPPEAR TO?

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:26.140
WELL, WHAT'S A MATTA?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.474
YOU NEVER PLAYED
WHACK-A-CROCK?

00:19:27.474 --> 00:19:29.643
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.
BUT WATCH THIS.

00:19:29.643 --> 00:19:32.579
EVEN THE MIGHTY ALLIGATOR SWORD
CAN'T BREATHE UNDERWATER.

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:34.515
SO I PLAY UMI!

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:39.820
RAISE THE WATER LEVEL
OF THIS FIELD BY COVERING
IT WITH OCEAN WATER!

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.257
MY ALLIGATOR'S COMPLETELY
SUBMERGED IN WATER!

00:19:43.257 --> 00:19:48.028
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE IT HAS TO
COME UP FOR AIR.

00:19:48.028 --> 00:19:50.531
AND THAT TIME IS NOW--
ATTACK!

00:19:50.531 --> 00:19:52.599
HOLD ON, FROG FACE!

00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:55.035
ACTIVATE SKULL DICE!

00:19:56.403 --> 00:19:57.871
THE NUMBER THAT I ROLL

00:19:57.871 --> 00:20:00.941
WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH
YOUR TOAD'S ATTACK
POINTS GET DECREASED!

00:20:00.941 --> 00:20:02.443
YES!

00:20:02.443 --> 00:20:04.645
THEY GET DIVIDED
BY FOUR!

00:20:04.645 --> 00:20:07.581
FROG LEGS, ANYONE!?

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:08.649
ALL RIGHT!

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:11.085
THAT JUST ABOUT
EVENS THE SCORE!

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:14.021
YOU'RE A WORTHY OPPONENT,
JOEY-- WELL DONE.

00:20:14.021 --> 00:20:16.990
YOU'RE PRETTY WORTHY
YOURSELF THERE, MAKO.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.595
BUT THIS DUEL HAS JUST
BEGUN AND THE SEA HIDES
MANY GREAT MYSTERIES...

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.230
AND GREAT TERRORS.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.100
THE MOST POWERFUL
AND DANGEROUS CREATURES
OF ALL LIE HIDDEN

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.435
DEEP BENEATH ITS WATERS.

00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:31.872
I WILL PREVAIL AND OBTAIN
MY PLACE IN THE
BATTLE CITY FINALS...

00:20:31.872 --> 00:20:35.742
FOR I HAVE A SECRET WEAPON
GUARANTEED TO DESTROY HIM.

00:20:35.742 --> 00:20:38.612
AND IT WAITS IN THE DEPTHS
OF MY OCEAN DECK.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:42.282
