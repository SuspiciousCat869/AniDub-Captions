00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:52.458
IT'S LIKE HIS HEART'S
IN OUR DECK.

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:55.194
NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE,
JOEY WILL BE WITH US.

00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:56.663
AND IF WE HAVE
TO FACE MARIK

00:07:56.663 --> 00:07:58.031
AND HIS ARMY
OF RARE HUNTERS,

00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:00.466
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
ALL THE SUPPORT WE CAN GET.

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:03.102
I JUST HOPE THAT JOEY
CAN SURVIVE THE TOURNAMENT

00:08:03.102 --> 00:08:04.404
WITHOUT HIS RED EYES.

00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:05.505
HE CAN.

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:06.839
JOEY IS A GREAT DUELIST,

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.942
AND HE SEEMS TO GET BETTER
WITH EVERY DUEL HE FIGHTS.

00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:11.944
HE JUST HAS TO KEEP
BELIEVING IN HIMSELF.

00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:14.013
YEAH, JOEY HAS COME
A REALLY LONG WAY

00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:15.248
SINCE HIS FIRST DUEL.

00:08:15.248 --> 00:08:17.116
AND HE JUST
DEFEATED ESPA ROBA

00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:19.152
WITHOUT NEEDING
HIS RED EYES.

00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:21.054
MAYBE <i>WE</i> NEED
JOEY'S CARD

00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:23.556
TO HELP SAVE
THE WORLD FROM EVIL.

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:24.957
OH!

00:08:24.957 --> 00:08:26.426
[THINKING]
SPEAKING OF EVIL,

00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:28.461
HOW WILL WE KNOW WHERE
MARIK WILL STRIKE NEXT?

00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:30.630
WE STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE!

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.098
[LAUGHTER]
HMM?

00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:33.533
WHO ARE YOU?

00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:36.135
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:39.138
HELLO, YUGI. WE'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:40.673
HMM? WHO'S "WE"?

00:08:40.673 --> 00:08:43.076
YOU'LL FIND OUT
IF YOU WALK THAT WAY.

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:46.179
53 STEPS FORWARD
AND INTO THAT TENT.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:49.982
MY MASTER IS WAITING
FOR YOU INSIDE.

00:08:49.982 --> 00:08:52.719
IT'S IN YOUR BEST
INTEREST TO GO.

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:54.520
[LAUGHS]

00:08:55.988 --> 00:08:58.424
STILL NO SIGN
OF YUGI.

00:08:58.424 --> 00:08:59.959
HEY!

00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:01.060
THERE HE IS,
RIGHT THERE!

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.061
WHERE?

00:09:04.097 --> 00:09:05.465
YUGI!

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:08.968
I'M GETTING
TOO OLD FOR THIS!

00:09:08.968 --> 00:09:10.937
HMM...

00:09:10.937 --> 00:09:13.272
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

00:09:13.272 --> 00:09:14.741
MAGIC SHOW?

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:16.442
[LAUGHING]

00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:17.844
ENTER HERE, YUGI.

00:09:17.844 --> 00:09:20.346
MY MASTER'S WAITING.

00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:25.651
WHERE'D HE GO?

00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:26.686
OH!

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:27.687
THERE HE IS!

00:09:27.687 --> 00:09:28.788
YUGI?

00:09:28.788 --> 00:09:30.757
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
HE'S IN A TRANCE!

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:34.060
Both: YUGI!

00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:37.764
AAH!
AAH!

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:39.399
HE'S TRAPPED
IN THERE!

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:42.635
OH, YUGI!

00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:45.138
YUGI!
YUGI, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:46.439
OH, NO,
HE'S GONE!

00:09:47.974 --> 00:09:49.075
Mokuba:
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:09:49.075 --> 00:09:50.309
SETO!

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:51.377
HMM?

00:09:51.377 --> 00:09:52.812
THE TOURNAMENT
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

00:09:52.812 --> 00:09:54.580
JUST LOST TRACK
OF YUGI MOTO!

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.748
HE'S DISAPPEARED!

00:09:55.748 --> 00:09:56.816
HE'S DISAPPEARED?

00:09:56.816 --> 00:09:58.985
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:01.988
MAKE SURE
THE SATELLITE LINK
IS WORKING, NOW.

00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:02.989
MMM.

00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:08.861
[THINKING]
YUGI'S DUEL DISC SENDS OUT
A CONSTANT I.D. SIGNAL,

00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:10.396
SO WHEREVER HE IS,

00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:12.498
HIS SIGNAL'S BEING
BLOCKED SOMEHOW.

00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:14.033
BUT I'LL FIND HIM.

00:10:25.244 --> 00:10:26.913
WHERE AM I?

00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:28.381
HUH?

00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:30.883
Computer: HACKING
INTO BATTLE CITY DATABASE.

00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:34.720
DUELIST PROFILE
FOR YUGI MOTO.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.956
DUELING LEVEL:
5 STARS.

00:10:36.956 --> 00:10:39.759
RAREST CARD:
DARK MAGICIAN.

00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:43.362
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:48.501
[LAUGHING]

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:50.069
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU.

00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:52.705
YOU ARE NOT WORTHY
OF HAVING ME
IN YOUR DECK,

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:56.909
SO PREPARE TO LOSE ME
FOREVER.

00:10:56.909 --> 00:10:58.511
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
DUELIST WITH MY POWER

00:10:58.511 --> 00:10:59.912
IN THEIR DECK, YUGI,

00:10:59.912 --> 00:11:01.747
AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY
NOT THE BEST.

00:11:01.747 --> 00:11:03.416
IT'S TIME THAT YOU MET

00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:05.885
THE TRUE MASTER
OF THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:11:05.885 --> 00:11:07.086
HMM.

00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:10.223
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH
OF THESE TRICKS.

00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:12.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.859 --> 00:11:14.794
WELCOME, YUGI MOTO.

00:11:14.794 --> 00:11:17.730
I AM THE ILLUSIONIST
KNOWN AS ARKANA,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.298
AND SOON
YOUR FAVORITE CARD

00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:21.434
WILL BE DUELING FOR ME!

00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:27.301
[LAUGHING]

00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:29.336
ONLY A TRUE MASTER
OF ILLUSION

00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:31.372
DESERVES TO HOLD
A DARK MAGICIAN.

00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:35.609
YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND
ITS FULL POTENTIAL.

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:38.045
THAT IS ENOUGH,
ARKANA!

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:39.580
SORRY, YUGI.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.181
I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD

00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:42.483
TO THINK
OF YOUR FAVORITE CARD

00:11:42.483 --> 00:11:44.084
IN ANOTHER
DUELIST'S DECK.

00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:47.221
WELL, I CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL!

00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:50.491
THE WINNER WILL
TAKE THE LOSER'S
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:52.359
AND I ACCEPT.

00:11:52.359 --> 00:11:54.828
YOU MUST KNOW
THAT WHEN A DUELIST
BUILDS HIS DECK,

00:11:54.828 --> 00:11:56.163
HE CHOOSES
HIS FAVORITES

00:11:56.163 --> 00:11:58.332
FROM MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF CARDS.

00:11:58.332 --> 00:12:01.402
BUT SOMETIMES A CARD
CAN CHOOSE A DUELIST.

00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:03.170
THE TWO ARE CONNECTED,

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.407
AND THE DUELIST CAN TAP
INTO THE CARD'S TRUE POWER

00:12:06.407 --> 00:12:09.176
BECAUSE EACH IS BOUND
BY THE HEART OF THE CARDS!

00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:11.945
AND THE DARK MAGICIAN
HAS CHOSEN ME.

00:12:13.914 --> 00:12:15.983
HE HAS NEVER
LET ME DOWN,

00:12:15.983 --> 00:12:18.786
AND I PLACE
MY COMPLETE TRUST
IN MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:12:22.022 --> 00:12:23.657
SO IT'S TRUE.

00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:26.527
THE GREAT YUGI MOTO
NEVER BACKS DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE.

00:12:26.527 --> 00:12:28.062
VERY IMPRESSIVE,

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.530
BUT THIS ROOM'S
A LITTLE CRAMPED,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.998
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:33.200
FORTUNATELY,
I KNOW OF A SPECIAL
DUEL RING CLOSE BY.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.435
FOLLOW ME.

00:12:38.405 --> 00:12:39.540
Arkana: HURRY.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.776
IT'S ALMOST
CURTAIN TIME.

00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:45.212
I HAVE SPECIAL ORDERS
FROM MY SUPERIORS

00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:47.214
TO MAKE THIS
A REAL SPECTACLE.

00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:48.649
HUH?

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:49.716
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:51.652
YOU HAVE ORDERS
FROM YOUR SUPERIORS?

00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:55.155
JUST WHO IS IT THAT YOU'RE
WORKING FOR, ARKANA?

00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:57.891
RELAX AND ENJOY
THE SHOW.

00:12:57.891 --> 00:12:59.960
FORGET WHO'S BACKSTAGE.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.129
JUST WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:03.831
[LAUGHS]

00:13:03.831 --> 00:13:07.434
Yugi, thinking:
COULD THIS DERANGED SHOWMAN
BE WORKING FOR MARIK?

00:13:07.434 --> 00:13:09.603
IF HE IS, THEN THERE
COULD BE MUCH MORE

00:13:09.603 --> 00:13:11.672
AT STAKE HERE THAN
JUST MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:13:11.672 --> 00:13:12.973
Arkana: TA-DA!

00:13:12.973 --> 00:13:15.242
BEYOND THAT DOOR
LIES MY DUELING RING!

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:22.349
I HAD IT SPECIALLY MADE
FOR THIS MATCH.

00:13:22.349 --> 00:13:24.184
HA HA HA!

00:13:24.184 --> 00:13:26.053
IT'S ALMOST TIME
TO RAISE THE CURTAIN

00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:27.421
AND START THE SHOW.

00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:30.023
I HOPE YOU ENJOY
A GOOD MATINEE, YUGI.

00:13:30.023 --> 00:13:32.226
YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE
COMPLETELY ALONE.

00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:34.661
THERE ARE NO SCREAMING FANS
AND NO CAMERAS.

00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:36.697
YES, IT'S
THE PERFECT SETTING

00:13:36.697 --> 00:13:39.666
FOR A PRIVATE PERFORMANCE
WITH SO MUCH ON THE LINE.

00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:43.203
WE'LL DUEL ACCORDING
TO BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT RULES,

00:13:43.203 --> 00:13:44.838
BUT THANKS
TO OUR LOCATION,

00:13:44.838 --> 00:13:47.841
NOT EVEN KAIBA
KNOWS WE'RE HERE.

00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:48.842
NOW...

00:13:48.842 --> 00:13:50.511
LET'S SHUFFLE OUR DECKS

00:13:50.511 --> 00:13:53.814
AND LET THE SHOW
BEGIN, SHALL WE?

00:13:53.814 --> 00:13:55.482
I'M WATCHING YOU.

00:13:55.482 --> 00:13:58.118
DON'T TRY ANY
SLEIGHT OF HAND,
ARKANA.

00:13:58.118 --> 00:14:01.421
CARD TRICKS ARE STRICTLY
FOR AMATEURS, YUGI MOTO.

00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:04.758
JUST TO BE SURE,
I'LL CUT YOUR DECK.

00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:06.560
OF COURSE.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.462
YOU KNOW, THERE
IS AN OLD SAYING

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:10.898
AMONG HIGH-ROLLERS
AND CARD SHARKS:

00:14:10.898 --> 00:14:12.966
"ALWAYS TRUST
YOUR OPPONENTS,

00:14:12.966 --> 00:14:15.102
BUT ONLY AFTER YOU'VE
CUT THEIR DECK."

00:14:15.102 --> 00:14:16.670
HEH!

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.839
HERE'S ANOTHER:

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.108
"NEVER TRUST
A MASKED MAN."

00:14:21.108 --> 00:14:23.677
HA! I'M OFFENDED.

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:26.346
BESIDES, YOU AND I
ARE A LOT ALIKE.

00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:28.015
WE BOTH PLAY TO WIN.

00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.583
OF COURSE, IN THIS
DUEL PERFORMANCE,

00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:32.085
YOU'LL FIND THERE'S
AN EXTRA DOWN SIDE
TO LOSING.

00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:34.087
HUH?

00:14:34.087 --> 00:14:35.289
GET READY!

00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:36.823
THE SHOW--
I MEAN, DUEL--

00:14:36.823 --> 00:14:39.326
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:40.427
NO!

00:14:42.062 --> 00:14:43.530
RELAX.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.098
WE'RE BOTH LOCKED IN,

00:14:45.098 --> 00:14:47.167
WHICH MEANS NEITHER
OF US CAN ESCAPE.

00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:50.270
SEE, THERE'S
AN EXTRA TWIST.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.606
WE'RE NOT JUST
PLAYING FOR WHAT'S
INSIDE YOUR DECK,

00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:54.675
WE'RE PLAYING FOR
WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR MIND!

00:14:57.377 --> 00:14:59.546
WHAT'S THAT?

00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:02.749
[LAUGHS]

00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:05.118
IT'S A DARK ENERGY
DISC, YUGI,

00:15:05.118 --> 00:15:07.354
AND I WOULDN'T GET
TOO CLOSE.

00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:10.891
ONE TOUCH,
AND YOUR MIND'S BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:15:16.423 --> 00:15:17.924
DON'T WORRY, YUGI.

00:15:17.924 --> 00:15:22.362
I'LL EXPLAIN THE RULES
TO YOU BEFORE YOU LOSE.

00:15:22.362 --> 00:15:26.299
SEE THE NUMBERS WRITTEN
ABOVE THE ENERGY DISCS?

00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:27.867
THOSE ARE LIFE POINTS.

00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:29.869
THE CLOSER THE NUMBER
GETS TO ZERO,

00:15:29.869 --> 00:15:31.805
THE CLOSER THE DISC
GETS TO US!

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.006
PRECISELY!

00:15:33.006 --> 00:15:35.508
AND THEN YOU CAN SAY HELLO
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:15:35.508 --> 00:15:38.344
ALL RIGHT. NOW LOOK
DOWN BETWEEN YOU FEET.

00:15:38.344 --> 00:15:42.282
YOU'LL SEE EACH OF US
HAS A KEY BOX.

00:15:42.282 --> 00:15:44.084
A KEY BOX?

00:15:44.084 --> 00:15:46.419
YES, AND INSIDE
IS A KEY

00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:49.589
TO UNLOCK THE SHACKLES
AROUND YOUR LEGS.

00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:52.759
YOUR BOX DISPLAYS
YOUR OPPONENT'S LIFE POINTS

00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:55.695
AND WILL ONLY OPEN
IF YOU WIN THE DUEL!

00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:57.497
[LAUGHS]

00:15:57.497 --> 00:16:00.767
ONLY THEN CAN YOU
SAVE YOURSELF!

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:02.402
YOU'RE INSANE!

00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:04.404
THINK OF IT
AS A HOPE CHEST, REALLY,

00:16:04.404 --> 00:16:07.841
BECAUSE THAT KEY
IS YOUR ONLY HOPE.

00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:11.411
[LAUGHS]

00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:14.547
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WOULD TOY WITH
SOMEONE'S MIND?

00:16:14.547 --> 00:16:17.383
ARE YOU SOME KIND
OF DEMENTED MADMAN?

00:16:17.383 --> 00:16:20.386
NO. I'M A MAN
WHO'S UNDEFEATED.

00:16:20.386 --> 00:16:21.855
NOT FOR LONG,
ARKANA!

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.123
HA!

00:16:23.123 --> 00:16:24.724
YOU'VE MET
YOUR MATCH,

00:16:24.724 --> 00:16:26.426
SO GET READY!

00:16:26.426 --> 00:16:29.429
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO DUEL, ARKANA!

00:16:39.038 --> 00:16:40.907
THE SPOTLIGHT'S ON US.

00:16:40.907 --> 00:16:42.542
IT'S SHOWTIME!

00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:45.512
THEN DRAW YOUR CARDS!

00:16:45.512 --> 00:16:47.447
AS YOU WISH, YUGI.

00:16:50.483 --> 00:16:52.552
[THINKING]
THERE IT IS,
AS EXPECTED--

00:16:52.552 --> 00:16:54.053
MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:16:54.053 --> 00:16:55.555
WON'T YUGI BE SURPRISED

00:16:55.555 --> 00:16:57.590
WHEN HE SEES
HOW EASILY I DREW IT?

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.394
SURE, CARD TRICKS
MAY BE FOR AMATEURS,

00:17:01.394 --> 00:17:02.662
BUT AS A DUELIST,

00:17:02.662 --> 00:17:04.831
LEARNING HOW TO DRAW
ANY CARD ANYTIME

00:17:04.831 --> 00:17:07.233
COMES IN VERY HANDY.

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:11.237
YUGI WILL NEVER GUESS
THAT I'VE MANIPULATED
MY DECK.

00:17:11.237 --> 00:17:12.906
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:15.675
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS TRIM
THE EDGE OF CERTAIN CARDS

00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:19.245
TO MAKE THEM SLIGHTLY
SMALLER THAN THE REST.

00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:22.315
AND SINCE I TRIMMED
MY DARK MAGICIAN,

00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:23.983
IT SHOWED UP
RIGHT ON TOP

00:17:23.983 --> 00:17:25.652
WHEN YUGI CUT MY DECK,

00:17:25.652 --> 00:17:29.155
EXACTLY AS I PLANNED
IT WOULD.

00:17:29.155 --> 00:17:31.324
NOW YUGI WILL LEARN
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS

00:17:31.324 --> 00:17:33.793
TO PLAY GAMES
WITH A MAGICIAN,

00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:36.896
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH.

00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:38.631
[LAUGHS]

00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:40.700
AND NOW
I'LL START THIS DUEL

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.936
BY PLACING ONE CARD
FACEDOWN...

00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:45.638
AND THEN...

00:17:45.638 --> 00:17:48.274
I'LL SUMMON
ALPA THE MAGNET WARRIOR

00:17:48.274 --> 00:17:49.475
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:53.613
[ALOUD]
BRACE YOURSELF.

00:17:53.613 --> 00:17:56.216
I'LL SUMMON MY LEGION
THE FIEND JESTER,

00:17:56.216 --> 00:17:59.185
ALSO IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:59.185 --> 00:18:01.554
[THINKING]
ONCE I HAVE ANOTHER
MONSTER ON THE FIELD,

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:03.623
I'LL SACRIFICE
THEM BOTH TO SUMMON

00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:05.725
MY ALL-POWERFUL
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:08.228
YOU WON'T BE SMILING
FOR LONG!

00:18:09.829 --> 00:18:11.431
Yugi, thinking: TO
DEFEAT THIS TRICKSTER,

00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:13.366
I'LL HAVE TO THINK
LIKE A TRICKSTER.

00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:15.101
HERE GOES.

00:18:15.101 --> 00:18:16.936
[ALOUD]
SINCE I DON'T TRUST
YOUR HAND,

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:18.371
I'LL PLAY
THIS MAGIC CARD.

00:18:18.371 --> 00:18:19.372
DON'T TRUST
MY HAND?

00:18:19.372 --> 00:18:20.773
TAKE THIS!

00:18:23.009 --> 00:18:24.577
CARD DESTRUCTION!

00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:25.812
NOT THAT!

00:18:25.812 --> 00:18:27.146
MY PRECIOUS HAND!

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:29.749
BOTH PLAYERS MUST
DISCARD THEIR HANDS NOW.

00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:31.384
THAT MEANS YOU, ARKANA!

00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:33.586
[THINKING]
MY PLAN IS RUINED!

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:37.624
I WAS READY TO SUMMON
MY DARK MAGICIAN
AND DESTROY HIM!

00:18:37.624 --> 00:18:38.791
HEH!

00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.393
YOU'VE BEEN
DECEIVING ME
FROM THE START.

00:18:40.393 --> 00:18:41.861
I <i>THOUGHT</i> YOU FIXED
YOUR FIRST HAND,

00:18:41.861 --> 00:18:43.630
SO RATHER THAN
TAKE MY CHANCES

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.165
AT FALLING VICTIM
TO ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR TRICKS,

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:48.701
I DESTROYED
BOTH OF OUR HANDS
SO WE CAN DISCARD

00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:51.671
OUR OLD CARDS
AND START OVER
WITH A CLEAN SLATE.

00:18:51.671 --> 00:18:56.309
SAY FAREWELL
TO THE CARDS IN
YOUR HAND, ARKANA!

00:18:56.309 --> 00:18:57.477
[ALOUD]
YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT

00:18:57.477 --> 00:18:59.212
WHEN I CLAIM
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN

00:18:59.212 --> 00:19:02.382
AND SEND YOU
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:19:02.382 --> 00:19:05.084
I WOULDN'T COUNT
ON THAT YET, ARKANA.

00:19:05.084 --> 00:19:07.687
REVEAL
THE FACEDOWN CARD!

00:19:07.687 --> 00:19:09.789
BRAIN CONTROL!

00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:12.325
AAH!

00:19:12.325 --> 00:19:14.661
THIS CARD LETS
ME CONTROL ANY
OF YOUR MONSTERS,

00:19:14.661 --> 00:19:15.929
LIKE FIEND JESTER!

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.869
MY MONSTER!

00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:25.705
NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
YOUR FIEND JESTER

00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:27.974
AND MY
MAGNET WARRIOR,

00:19:27.974 --> 00:19:31.110
WHICH ALLOWS
ME TO SUMMON
MY ULTIMATE MONSTER.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.547
FEAR THE POWER
OF MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:41.254
WHEN YOU BELIEVE
IN THE HEART OF
THE CARDS, ARKANA,

00:19:41.254 --> 00:19:42.889
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CHEAT.

00:19:42.889 --> 00:19:47.060
[THINKING]
I'M WIDE OPEN TO AN ATTACK
BY HIS DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.528
YOU BELIEVE
IN NOTHING

00:19:48.528 --> 00:19:50.830
EXCEPT TRICKERY
AND WINNING
AT ALL COSTS.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.732
BUT NOW YOU'LL
SEE WHAT HAPPENS

00:19:52.732 --> 00:19:54.767
WHEN YOU HAVE FAITH
IN YOUR CARDS,
ARKANA!

00:19:54.767 --> 00:19:56.602
DARK MAGICIAN...

00:19:56.602 --> 00:19:58.504
SHOW HIM
SOME REAL MAGIC...

00:19:58.504 --> 00:20:00.073
AAH!

00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:05.278
WITH A DIRECT ATTACK
ON HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:20:15.989 --> 00:20:17.557
YOU'VE ALREADY LOST

00:20:17.557 --> 00:20:20.193
MORE THAN HALF YOUR
LIFE POINTS, ARKANA.

00:20:20.193 --> 00:20:21.627
NOW,
I'M STILL WAITING

00:20:21.627 --> 00:20:24.430
FOR THIS
GRAND MAGIC SHOW
YOU PROMISED ME.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.999
[GRUNTS]

00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:29.802
THE DARK ENERGY DISC
IS GETTING CLOSER!

00:20:31.671 --> 00:20:34.207
[THINKING]
HE MAY BE ON TOP NOW,

00:20:34.207 --> 00:20:35.575
BUT HE HAS NO IDEA
OF THE TRICKS

00:20:35.575 --> 00:20:36.976
THAT ARE UP MY SLEEVE!

00:20:36.976 --> 00:20:39.412
THAT WAS JUST
THE OPENING ACT, YUGI!

00:20:39.412 --> 00:20:41.114
BEFORE THIS SHOW'S OVER,

00:20:41.114 --> 00:20:44.917
YOUR MIND WILL BE TRAPPED
IN THE SHADOW REALM FOREVER!

00:20:44.917 --> 00:20:46.387
[LAUGHING]
