YOUR EXODIA HEAD
ON THE FIELD,

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.541
IT CAN DESTROY
THE ONES

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.910
IN YOUR HAND
AND YOUR DECK!

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.078
UHH! OH, NO!

00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:00.046
MY EXODIA HEADS...

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.414
ARE GONE!

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:04.084
Rare Hunter, voice-over:
NO! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:08.121
HE FOUND A WAY TO STOP
THE UNSTOPPABLE EXODIA!

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.156
AND I'M NOT THROUGH,
RARE HUNTER!

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.358
YOU FORGET.

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:12.492
YOUR MONSTERS
ARE TRAPPED

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.661
IN MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.230
ACTIVATE DUST TORNADO!

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.003
THIS TRAP DESTROYS
ONE MAGIC CARD,

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.705
SHATTERING YOUR SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT,

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:28.575
WHICH ALLOWS
MY MONSTERS TO ATTACK!

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:30.210
AAH!

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.644
NOW, MY MONSTERS,

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.647
ATTACK THE RARE HUNTER'S
LIFE POINT!

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.316
AAH!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.420
AAH! UHH!

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.657
YEAH, YUGE! YOU WON!

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.027
Crowd: YAY! WAY TO GO...

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.666
NO! PLEASE
DON'T BE ANGRY!

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:56.302
AAH!

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.737
[GASPS]

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.272
NO, MASTER! DON'T!

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.741
PLEASE! SPARE ME!

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.944
WE MEET AGAIN, PHARAOH!

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:06.046
UHH!

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.848
ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:12.052
REMEMBER MY NAME...

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.219
MARIK!

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.522
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
FROM ME, MARIK?

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:18.058
I WANT WHAT BELONGS TO ME,

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.859
AND I'LL TAKE IT
USING THE STRENGTH

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.661
OF THE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS!

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.329
EGYPTIAN WHAT?

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.531
MILLENNIA AGO,

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.433
A TRIO OF POWERFUL BEHEMOTHS

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:29.402
RAMPAGED THROUGHOUT
ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.770
THESE EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTERS

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.473
SPREAD DESTRUCTION
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:35.742
BUT WHEN PEGASUS
CREATED DUEL MONSTERS,

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.111
HE RESURRECTED THESE
MIGHTY BEASTS AS CARDS.

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.513
WITH THESE EGYPTIAN GODS,
I CAN DESTROY YOU

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.982
AND CLAIM THE POWER
I DESERVE.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.954
YOU'LL NEVER CLAIM
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:50.056
HMM, YOU MISUNDERSTAND.

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:53.426
I WANT MORE THAN THE POWER
OF THE PUZZLE.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.295
I WANT THE PHARAOH'S POWER,

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.663
THE BOUNDLESS ENERGY

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:59.399
OF THE ANCIENT RULER
HIMSELF!

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.902
WITH IT, NO ONE
WILL STAND IN MY WAY!

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.238
I'LL USE
THE ALMIGHTY MAGIC I GAIN

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:08.308
TO CONQUER
AND LEAD THE WORLD!

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:11.177
I WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE!

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:13.046
THE END IS NEAR, PHARAOH!

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.981
IT'S MY WORLD NOW.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.957
Mokuba: SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.626
MARIK WANTS
TO RULE THE WORLD?!

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.195
AND HE THINKS GETTING
ALL 3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.865
WILL GIVE HIM THE POWER
HE NEEDS TO DO IT?

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.066
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.534
WHY HE'S GOING THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.402
JUST TO GET
HIS HANDS ON THEM.

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.538
Kaiba: THAT'S
RIDICULOUS, MOKUBA!

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:40.206
YUGI, DO ME A FAVOR

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:42.108
AND STOP CORRUPTING
MY BROTHER'S MIND

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:43.776
WITH YOUR LIES!

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:45.378
THEY'RE NOT LIES,

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:47.147
AND YOU'VE HEARD
MARIK'S PLAN...

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.481
FIRST HAND!

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.549
REMEMBER?

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:52.886
Marik:
MEET YOUR MAKER, PHARAOH!

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.889
THE LAST MONSTER
YOU'LL EVER SEE!

THE EGYPTIAN GOD,
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:10.537
PREPARE TO FEEL
HIS WRATH!

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.071
HOW CAN I STOP IT?!

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.773
AAH!

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:18.011
BEHOLD, THE ULTIMATE
5 CARD COMBINATION

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.713
THAT MAKES ME
COMPLETELY INDESTRUCTIBLE!

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.782
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.684
WILL CONTINUE
TO GROW STRONGER,

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.954
AND YOUR ATTACKS
ARE COMPLETELY USELESS!

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.556
OH, NO.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:31.024
[SHUDDERS]

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.493
I CAN'T LET MARIK
WIN MY PUZZLE.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:35.094
[GRUNTS]

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.763
Kaiba: GET
ON YOUR FEET, YUGI!

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.298
HUH? KAIBA!

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.869
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
BOW TO YOUR RIVALS?

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.404
NEVER!

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.973
IF YOU STILL
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES,

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:49.409
THEN GET UP
AND PROVE IT TO ME NOW!

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.811
I WILL DEFEAT HIM,
KAIBA.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.112
I ASSURE YOU.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.814
MARIK, IT'S OVER!

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:57.984
Marik: HA! MY EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD IS UNSTOPPABLE!

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:00.086
NOW WATCH
AS MY PLAN TO SLAY

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:03.489
YOUR SO-CALLED
INDESTRUCTIBLE
DRAGON BEGINS!

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:05.858
I'M READY FOR YOUR
PATHETIC ATTACK!

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:08.828
OBSERVE! THE MAGIC CARD
BRAIN CONTROL!

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:11.231
NOW I'LL CONTROL
YOUR MONSTER!

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.799
MY BRAIN CONTROL CARD

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.702
WILL SEIZE
YOUR REVIVAL JAM!

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:17.837
Marik, voice-over:
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.273
WHENEVER REVIVAL JAM
REAPPEARS ON THE FIELD,

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:22.442
MY DRAGON
AUTOMATICALLY ATTACKS IT.

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.744
AND SINCE YAMI
CONTROLS REVIVAL JAM,

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.580
IT WILL REVIVE ITSELF
ON HIS SIDE OF THE FIELD,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.949
WHICH MAKES ME DRAW
3 NEW CARDS.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.552
THEN MY DRAGON
WILL ATTACK AGAIN.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:33.853
EACH EVENT
TRIGGERS THE NEXT

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:35.989
IN A NEVER-ENDING CYCLE!

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.423
ONCE YOU RUN OUT
OF CARDS TO DRAW,

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.559
YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY
LOSE THIS DUEL!

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.427

SOONER THAN YOU THINK.

I'M ON MY WAY
TO BATTLE CITY AS WE SPEAK.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:59.112
ONCE I'M THERE,

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.247
THE NEXT PHASE
OF MY PLAN BEGINS.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:04.717
I ASSURE YOU THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH WILL BE MINE!

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:07.920
I HAVE RARE HUNTERS
EVERYWHERE IN BATTLE CITY,

AND I CAN SEE ALL!

I SEE THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
THAT WILL BE MINE,

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:14.027
I SEE A DEFENSELESS CITY

00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:15.528
WAITING TO BE CONQUERED,

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.830
AND I SEE
POTENTIAL MIND-SLAVES

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.299
IN EVERY CROWD.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.467
I'M ALWAYS SEARCHING
FOR NEW SERVANTS

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.370
TO ADD TO MY ARMY
OF RARE HUNTERS.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.239
I WONDER WHO WILL BE NEXT.

00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:28.041
PERHAPS I CAN USE
YOUR FRIENDS

00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.809
TO GET WHAT I WANT
FROM YOU.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.311
YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE!

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.012
IF ANY HARM
BEFALLS MY FRIENDS,

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:35.014
YOU WILL
REGRET IT, MARIK.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:37.850
JUST AS MY DRAGON'S
ONE WEAKNESS DESTROYED IT,

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.485
YOUR LOYALTY TO YOUR FRIENDS

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.754
WILL SOON DESTROY YOU.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.992
HMM. USING MAGIC POWERS

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.960
TO CONTROL
PEOPLES' MINDS.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.763
I BET YOU STILL BELIEVE
IN THE TOOTH FAIRY AS WELL.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.633
MARIK'S POWERS
ARE VERY REAL

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.501
AND VERY DANGEROUS.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.470
AND NOW THAT HE'S
CAPTURED MY FRIENDS,

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.005
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT HE PLANS

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.740
TO DO WITH THEM.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.208
EH?

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.743
HERE YOU GO, JOEY.

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:05.411
TAKE YOUR
RED-EYES BACK.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.015
NAH, YUGE.

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:10.350
YOU HOLD ON TO IT.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.518
IT ISN'T MINE
TO TAKE, PAL.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.921
YOU WON IT
FAIR AND SQUARE.

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:16.756
BESIDES,
THE RARE HUNTERS

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:18.958
HAVE COLLECTED TONS
OF RARE CARDS.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.693
THEIR DECKS
ARE TOTALLY SOUPED-UP,

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.662
SO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE
GONNA BE TOUGH TO BEAT,

00:14:22.662 --> 00:14:24.163
EVEN FOR YOU!

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:26.065
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
JOEY?

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:27.767
I'M SAYING ONE DAY
YOU'LL NEED

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:29.335
ALL THE POWERFUL MONSTERS
YOU CAN GET.

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.771
PLUS, YOU CAN THINK OF ME
WHENEVER YOU PLAY MY RED-EYES!

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:33.373
IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO TO REPAY YOU.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.674
YOU ALWAYS HAVE MY BACK,

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:37.210
SO IT'S TIME
I HELPED YOU FOR A CHANGE!

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.747
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO KEEP
MY RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:43.583
I KNOW IT'S GONNA
COME IN HANDY
FOR YOU SOMETIME.

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:45.418
BESIDES, THIS MEANS
THAT A PART OF ME

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:47.453
WILL BE A PART
OF YOUR DECK.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:48.855
IT'S KIND OF COOL KNOWING

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:50.790
THAT I'M HELPING YOU
SAVE THE WORLD.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.693
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOUR RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:54.894
DON'T SWEAT IT!

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.029
IT'S YOURS!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.967
YOU ARE
A TRUE FRIEND, JOEY,

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.002
AND TOGETHER, WE CAN
TAKE ON ANY EVIL

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:06.005
THAT COMES OUR WAY.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.274
WE HAVE TO
LOCATE MY FRIENDS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.910
AND GET THEM AWAY
FROM THAT MADMAN

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.246
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.820
Mokuba: WE'RE ONLY 2 MILES
FROM OUR TARGET, GUYS.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.088
Yami-Yugi: GOOD.
THEN IT WON'T BE LONG

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.157
BEFORE WE FIND
TEA AND JOEY.

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:26.926
I'M TIRED OF HEARING
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS, YUGI,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.128
ESPECIALLY
THAT HACK WHEELER.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:32.432
JOEY HAS BECOME
AN EXTREMELY SKILLED
DUELIST, KAIBA!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.000
IN FACT, I WOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.535
IF HE HAD
ALREADY QUALIFIED

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:37.637
FOR THE BATTLE CITY
FINALS!

00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:41.140
ROBA, CHECK THIS OUT!

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.342
Joey, voice-over:
YES! THE MAGIC CARD,

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.411
ROULETTE SPIDER!

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:50.349
ROULETTE SPIDER,
ATTACH TO JINZO!

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.384
[GROANS]

00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:52.652
AHH! WHAT'S THAT?

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:54.654
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ALL THIS?

00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:56.789
MY SPIDER WILL SPIN
JINZO ROUND AND ROUND

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.824
LIKE A GIANT WHEEL.

00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:59.025
WHEN YOU
TELL IT TO STOP,

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.860
IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY
ATTACK WHICHEVER TARGET

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.228
THE ARROW'S
POINTING TO.

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:03.529
GO, ROULETTE SPIDER!

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.730
SPIN NOW!

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:11.671
WHAT YOU WAITING FOR?!

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:13.473
UGH!

00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.078
UGH... JINZO!

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.880
STOP!

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.520
JINZO'S POINTING
TO MY REFLECT BOUNDER,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.121
AND IF IT ATTACKS,

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.556
THEY'RE BOTH DOOMED!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.674
YOU'RE FINISHED,

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.276
AND THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:51.344
[CROWD GROANS]

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.613
UGH! HE BEAT ME!

00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.181
IT WAS A TOUGH DUEL.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.384
BUT SINCE I WON,
TIME TO HAND OVER
YOUR RAREST CARD.

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:01.120
HERE. MY JINZO
AND MY LOCATOR CARD.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.189
YOU DESERVE THEM.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.825
JUST GIVE UP, WHEELER!
IT'S OVER!

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.760
JOEY WHEELER
DOESN'T QUIT.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.730
MAYBE YOU'D UNDERSTAND
IF YOU HAD FRIENDS.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.298
COME ON!

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:14.667
Joey, voice-over:
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT!

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:16.636
Joey, aloud: I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN,

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:19.105
THEN SUMMON GEARFRIED
THE IRON KNIGHT!

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.544
YOU FOOL!
ONCE YOUR KNIGHT

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.913
HAS BEEN INFECTED
BY MY PARASITE CARD,

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:28.080
HE'LL JUST BE
ANOTHER SNACK

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.049
FOR MY RAVENOUS QUEEN.

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.452
Joey: DON'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT THAT, WEEVIL.

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:35.421
SOME CARDS
ARE BUG-PROOF!

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.989
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:40.026
WHY CAN'T THE PARASITE
FEED ON IT?

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:42.261
HE'S GEARFRIED
THE <i>IRON</i> KNIGHT,

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.463
AND THAT SLIMY
PARASITE'S HELPLESS

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.232
AGAINST
HIS METAL ARMOR!

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.067
GEARFRIED
THE IRON KNIGHT,

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.769
ATTACK
HIS QUEEN'S EGGS

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:52.939
AND LOWER
HER ATTACK POWER!

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.509
[GROANS]

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.778
THAT'S IT! NEXT TURN,
YOU'RE BUG FOOD!

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.847
GOOD-BYE, WHEELER.

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.749
AND NOW, MY LOVELY QUEEN,

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.785
DESTROY HIS SCRAP HEAP
OF A KNIGHT

00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:09.255
AND WHAT'S LEFT
OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.024
YOU GRUB! I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD ATTACK ME.

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:14.794
YOU WERE?!
ALL PART OF MY PLAN.

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:16.762
ACTIVATE THE TRAP CARD!

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.764
GRAVEROBBER!

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.169
NOT GRAVEROBBER!

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:25.571
YEP. IT CAN TAKE A CARD
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.073
AND USE IT AGAINST YOU.

00:18:27.073 --> 00:18:30.776
AND HE JUST NABBED
YOUR CAN OF AEROSOL!

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.778
TIME TO EXTERMINATE
YOUR QUEEN!

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.647
[SHRIEKING]

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.253
YEAH!

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.189
THERE GOES
MY PEST PROBLEM!

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:45.558
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO MY QUEEN!

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:46.692
BUT WAIT!

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:47.994
I'M NOT THROUGH
WITH YOU YET,

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:49.862
WEEVIL UNDERPANTS!

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.964
GEARFRIED,
DESTROY HIS LAST EGG

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.233
AND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.035
AAH!

00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:57.570
WELCOME TO
LOSERVILLE, WEEVIL.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.739
POPULATION--YOU!

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.273
I--I--I LOST?

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:02.942
I--I DON'T
BELIEVE IT!

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:04.210
AAAH!

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.345
ALL RIGHT, WEEVIL,
COUGH THEM UP!

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:09.482
YOUR INSECT QUEEN
AND 2 LOCATOR CARDS!

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.283
ANY LAST WORDS?

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.852
YES, 6--

00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:15.488
THIS DUEL
IS NOT OVER YET!

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.189
SO I'LL PLAY THIS--

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:18.724
RETURN OF THE DOOMED!

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.559
IT BRINGS BACK
ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.094
AND HIDES IT UNDERWATER!

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:23.829
ALL RIGHT, MAKO.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.831
HERE GOES.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.800
Joey, voice-over:
GIANT TRUNADE.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.835
THIS CARD SENDS ALL
MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.671
BACK TO THE PLAYERS'
HANDS AND OFF THE FIELD.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:34.140
SO I COULD USE IT
TO DRY UP MAKO'S OCEAN

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.975
AND EXPOSE
WHATEVER MONSTER
HE BROUGHT BACK

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:37.109
FROM HIS GRAVEYARD.

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.712
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:41.614
ACTIVATE GIANT TRUNADE!

00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:43.849
DRAIN THE SEA!

[SCREAMS]

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:51.691
IT WORKED!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.527
NOW I PLAY SCAPEGOAT.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.095
AND I SACRIFICE
ONE OF THEM,

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:58.130
SO MY PANTHER WARRIOR
CAN ATTACK!

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.333
[SCREAMS]

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.505
HE DID IT!
JOEY!

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.607
YES. THAT WAS
AN EXCELLENT DUEL.

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:10.042
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.143

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.912
HERE ARE
MY 2 RAREST CARDS

THAT'S RIGHT.

THANK YOU.

00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:20.820
AND DON'T WORRY.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.688
I'LL TREAT IT
WITH RESPECT.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.290
YOU'D BETTER.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.859
AND BEST OF LUCK
IN THE FINALS.

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:28.894
NOT TO WORRY, MY FRIENDS.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:32.498
I PROMISE I'LL SET YOU FREE!

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.667
LOOK. THE RARE
HUNTERS' HIDEOUT!

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:35.868
IT'S JUST UP AHEAD.

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:38.571
Kaiba: BEGIN OUR DESCENT
IMMEDIATELY.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.638
Pilot:
YES, MR. KAIBA.

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:41.273
Yugi, voice-over:
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS IT!

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:43.175
NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THERE,

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.644
I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT MY FRIENDS.

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.581
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS, MARIK!
