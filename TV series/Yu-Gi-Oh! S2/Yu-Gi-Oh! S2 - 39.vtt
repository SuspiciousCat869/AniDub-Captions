ALL YOUR MONSTERS,

AND NOW YOU'RE DOWN
TO 200 LIFE POINTS.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.710
ONE MORE ATTACK,
AND IT'S OVER.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.478
YOUR SCHEME
ENDS HERE!

YEAH!
WAY TO GO!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.223
I PLAY MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.359
I SACRIFICE
MY BATTLE WARRIOR

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.828
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
THE LEGENDARY FISHERMAN!

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.265
[THINKING]
PLAY THE CARD I ADDED
TO YOUR DECK RIGHT NOW!

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.734
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE JUST DONE

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.702
BY SECURING THIS
ALL-POWERFUL CARD

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.704
WITHIN MY ANCIENT
SANCTUARY!

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.673
Joey: NOW...
MY INSECT QUEEN!

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.242
JOEY WAS ABLE TO SUMMON
EVERY RARE MONSTER

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.444
HE WON IN THE TOURNAMENT
ALL AT <i>ONCE!</i>

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.314
YOU CAN'T WIN...
ONCE I PLAY THIS!

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.116
CUP OF SEALED SOUL!!

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.518
THEN I REVEAL

<i>SEAL OF SERKET!</i>

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.924
WHEN THESE TWO MAGIC CARDS
ARE PLAYED ALONG WITH
TEMPLE OF THE KINGS...

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.894
THEY ARE ABLE TO AWAKEN
A GREAT CREATURE
FROM ITS ANCIENT SLUMBER,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.398
A BEING LIKE NONE

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:47.341
IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.429
Joey: YOU DON'T
SCARE ME!!

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.530
I'LL FIND A WAY

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.233
TO CRUSH YOUR OVERSIZED
SCORPION, MARIK!

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.735
Odion: THAT WOULD BE
QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT,

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.204
CONSIDERING
MY <i>MYSTICAL BEAST SERKET</i>

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:20.007
IS MORE POWERFUL THAN
ALL 3 OF YOUR MONSTERS,
MR. WHEELER.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:21.408
THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.311
"WHICH IS THE FIRST ONE
IT SHOULD DEVOUR?"

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.881
AND IT'S POINTLESS
FOR YOU TO TRY AND STOP
MY ANCIENT CREATURE

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.816
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT
A CARD IN YOUR DECK

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.319
POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO DO IT.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.454
THERE MUST BE <i>SOME</i> WAY
HE CAN FIGHT BACK.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.555
DON'T ASK ME.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.157
HEY, YUGI...

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.593
MY BROTHER CAN STILL
WIN THIS, <i>RIGHT?</i>

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:42.129
YES. EVEN THOUGH MARIK
HAS THE UPPER HAND,

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.064
JOEY CAN STILL
BEAT HIM.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:47.801
HE JUST NEEDS TO FIND
THE WEAKNESS OF MARIK'S
<i>MYSTICAL BEAST</i>

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.303
BEFORE IT WIPES OUT
THE REST OF HIS
LIFE POINTS.

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.106
WHAT ABOUT THE CARD
LOCKED INSIDE THE ARK,

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.542
<i>THE WINGED DRAGON</i>
<i>OF RA?</i>

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:59.346
Yami-Yugi: YES, THAT'S MARIK'S
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.081
Yugi: JOEY NEEDS TO GET
MARIK'S LIFE POINTS

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.717
DOWN TO ZERO BEFORE
MARIK PLAYS <i>THAT</i> CARD!

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:06.119
OTHERWISE, JOEY WON'T
STAND A CHANCE!

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.288
Odion, thinking:
MASTER MARIK,

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.124
WHY DID YOU PLACE
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IN <i>MY</i> DECK?

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.293
Marik, thinking:
IF WE'RE GOING TO
DECEIVE THESE FOOLS

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.062
INTO BELIEVING
<i>YOU</i> ARE <i>ME,</i>

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.631
YOU MUST DUEL
AS I WOULD, ODION.

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:21.435
OF COURSE...
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
IN <i>YOUR</i> DECK

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.336
IS ONLY A <i>COPY</i>
OF THE ORIGINAL.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.505
I COULDN'T RISK LOSING
THE MOST POWERFUL

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:28.709
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IN CREATION,

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.013
SO I HAD THE RARE
HUNTERS REPRODUCE
COUNTERFEIT CARDS.

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:35.048
THESE FORGERIES
ARE EXACT DUPLICATES

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.150
OF THE ORIGINAL
WINGED DRAGON OF RA

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.752
AND EQUALLY
AS POWERFUL.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.555
THE RARE HUNTERS
TESTED EACH SAMPLE

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.824
UNTIL WE GOT IT
JUST RIGHT.

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:46.927
OF COURSE, WHEN YOU'RE
DEALING WITH A CREATURE
OF SUCH POWER,

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:50.397
THINGS CAN GET
QUITE...DANGEROUS.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.037
AAH!

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:58.105
GRR.

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.539
Marik, thinking:
NEEDLESS TO SAY,

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.677
MANY OF MY OBEDIENT SERVANTS HAD
"DIFFICULTIES" WITH THESE CARDS,

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.946
FOR NOT EVERYONE CAN CONTROL

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:09.082
THE INCREDIBLE POWER
OF AN EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTER.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.619
EVENTUALLY, I REALIZED THAT ONLY
INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESS

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.422
A CERTAIN CONNECTION
TO THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.092
CAN SUCCESSFULLY USE
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.528
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT, ODION,

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.698
THAT <i>YOU</i> WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
WHEN YOU PLAY IT.

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:26.533
Odion, thinking:
THANK YOU, MASTER MARIK,

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.668
BUT I'M SURE I CAN
FINISH THIS DUEL

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:31.171
<i>WITHOUT</i> TAKING
THAT CHANCE.

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:32.906
[ALOUD]
NOW, MR. WHEELER!

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:35.108
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE YOUR FINAL MOVE

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.111
BEFORE MY MYSTICAL BEAST
ANNIHILATES YOU,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.747
AND THANKS TO MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT...

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.115
YOU STILL CAN'T ATTACK.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.786
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!
SO HERE GOES.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.921
I PLAY...

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.955
[THINKING]
AW, MAN!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.690
A POLYMERIZATION
CARD!?

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.325
THAT'S NO HELP NOW.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.194
I GOTTA FIND
SOME WAY TO TAKE OUT
HIS <i>MYSTICAL BEAST</i>

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:56.963
BEFORE IT KNOCKS ME
OUTTA DA FINALS!!

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.065
I'LL KEEP
ALL MY MONSTERS
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.168
AND TAKE MY CHANCES.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.969
WHAT'S HIS
STRATEGY, MAI?

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.137
RIGHT NOW,
ALL HE CAN DO

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.806
IS BUY HIMSELF
A LITTLE TIME.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.841
A DESPERATE MOVE.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.943
AND NOW...
SAY GOODBYE!

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.645
MY BEAST <i>CAN'T</i>
BE STOPPED.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.814
SO FEEL HIS
ANCIENT FURY!

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.682
ATTACK HIS JINZO NOW!

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:19.052
[ROAR]

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:23.223
MY MYSTICAL BEAST
NOT ONLY <i>DESTROYS</i>
THE MONSTERS IT ATTACKS...

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:26.893
IT ALSO <i>ABSORBS</i> THEIR POWER,
MAKING IT EVEN STRONGER!

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.228
IT CAN'T BE!

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.430
OH, BUT IT CAN,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.265
AND NOW HALF OF JINZO'S
ATTACK POWER

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.167
IS ADDED TO MY BEAST!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.572
N' DAT
WASN'T THE ONLY
SIDE EFFECT!

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.540
IT'S BIGGER
AND UGLIER, TOO!

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.810
IF IT CONTINUES DESTROYING
JOEY'S MONSTERS...

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.212
THAT MEANS...

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.613
MARIK'S MONSTER'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:48.648
WILL JUST CONTINUE
TO INCREASE...

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.217
'TIL IT'S TOO LATE.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:51.985
UH, DOESN'T
SCARE ME!

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.089
A'RIGHT. WELL,
IT LOOKS LIKE
I GOTTA PASS.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.591
SO JUST GO!

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.894
I WILL! THE PLEASURE
IS ALL MINE!

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.431
NOW <i>MYSTICAL BEAST,</i>

OH!
OH!

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.005
Odion:
BY ABSORBING THE POWER
OF YOUR QUEEN,

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:14.207
MY CREATURE GROWS
EVEN <i>STRONGER!</i>

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.443
THERE'S NO STOPPING ME,
MR. WHEELER!

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.912
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.519
JOEY, HANG
IN THERE!

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.788
YEAH! THIS JOKER
HAS NOTHING ON YOU!

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.290
Odion: FAREWELL!

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.093
MY BROTHER...
I CAN'T WATCH!

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:34.661
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH!

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:38.665

DON'T LEAVE ME <i>NOW!</i>

I CAN'T GET
THROUGH DIS DUEL
WITHOUT YA HERE!

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:45.038
YOU'RE MY
BIGGEST INSPIRATION,
SERENITY.

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:46.873
DO YOU
MEAN THAT?

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.041
ABSOLUTELY!

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.310
WHERE DO YOU THINK
I GET ALL MY COURAGE FROM?

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.046
FROM <i>YOU!</i>
YOU'RE MY <i>FAMILY!</i>

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:55.115
SO YOU GOTTA STAY HERE
AND CHEER ME ON.

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:58.084
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN WIN DIS DING!

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.920
Serenity: YOU GOT IT,
BIG BROTHER!

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.989
[THINKING]
AH, YES...

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.858
I'VE KNOWN COMFORT
LIKE THAT.

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:07.527
FAMILY CAN CHASE AWAY
THE SHADOWS OF FEAR...

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:10.297
LIKE A LIGHT FROM ABOVE.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.032
I WAS ONLY AN INFANT,

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:14.734
BUT I CAN STILL REMEMBER
THAT COLD, DARK NIGHT

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:17.170
WHEN I FELT THE LIGHT
FOR THE FIRST TIME...

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.006
THERE, THERE, YOU
POOR SWEET THING.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.775
Odion: SHE GAVE ME
SHELTER FROM THE COLD

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.445
AND BROUGHT ME INTO HER HOME
DEEP BELOW THE DESERT SANDS...

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.949
TO RAISE ME
AS IF I WERE HER OWN.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:34.020
ALL WAS PEACEFUL UNTIL THE DAY
I DISCOVERED MY FAMILY'S SECRET.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.023
Man: FOR GENERATIONS,
OUR CLAN HAS SERVED
THE GREAT PHARAOH

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:38.959
BY GUARDING
HIS ANCIENT TOMB,

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.228
BUT NOW OUR DESTINY
IS IN JEOPARDY.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.831
WHO WILL WATCH OVER
THE MILLENNIUM ROD
AND NECKLACE

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.033
IF WE HAVE
NO CHILDREN?

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.868
FOR 5,000 YEARS,

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.870
WE'VE WAITED
IN THE DARKNESS FOR
THE PHARAOH'S RETURN.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.973
WE CANNOT
FAIL HIM NOW!

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.474
Woman: BUT WE HAVE <i>ODION.</i>

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.810
<i>HE</i> CAN CARRY ON
OUR LEGACY.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.413
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM
THE TOMB KEEPER'S
INITIATION?

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.415
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.484
ODION IS <i>NOT</i> OUR
FLESH AND BLOOD.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.885
HE'S OUR ONLY HOPE...

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:09.589
IT WAS FATE THAT BROUGHT
HIM TO US ON THAT DAY.

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:13.493
PLEASE INITIATE ODION
BY HIS 12th BIRTHDAY.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.933

ALL THESE YEARS,
A CHILD OF OUR OWN.

YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT OF YOU
AS MY SON...

BUT YOU
CANNOT ASSUME
THE FAMILY LEGACY

HOW WILL THIS
CHANGE ME?

YOU WILL BEAR
THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

THAT IS, IF YOU
STILL <i>WANT</i> TO BECOME
A TOMB KEEPER.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.505
OF COURSE!

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.374
MOTHER, DOES THIS MEAN
THAT I'LL BE EXACTLY
LIKE YOU AND FATHER?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.109
YES, DEAR.

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.945

AS A LASTING REMINDER

ME AGAIN, ODION!

AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!

00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:00.934
YOU VOWED TO US THAT YOU

AND NOW LOOK
AT HIM, ODION!

IT WAS ALL MY FAULT,

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.532
DON'T LET YOUR FATHER

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.903

YOUR DINNER.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.522
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:56.923
BUT YOU NEED TO EAT.

00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:59.292
AT LEAST
HAVE SOME SOUP.

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:00.960
I <i>SAID,</i> I'M NOT HUNGRY!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.595

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.564
I'M SORRY, ODION.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.770
THEN IT WILL BE

FOR THE PHARAOH
TO RETURN...

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:15.675
I'LL BE STUCK
DOWN HERE THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

BUT...

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.247
WHY DID <i>I</i> HAVE
TO BE BORN THE SON
OF A TOMB KEEPER?

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.916
ONCE I HAVE
THE INITIATION,

THERE'S NO ESCAPING
MY FUTURE...

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.655
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
TERRIFIES ME.

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.089
MASTER...

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.859
I KNOW THAT I WAS BORN
INTO THIS TRADITION,

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.827
THAT IT'S MY DESTINY,

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:36.462
BUT WHY?

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:39.465
WHY DO <i>I</i> HAVE TO GIVE UP
SO MUCH FOR THIS PHARAOH?

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.968
IT ISN'T FAIR!

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:43.436
LET ME DO IT.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.205

SAVED ME.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.373
NOW I CAN REPAY THEM
BY SAVING YOU

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.310
FROM A LIFE
OF DARKNESS INSIDE
THE PHARAOH'S TOMB.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:52.812
REALLY?

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.280
I'D BE HONORED.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.585
I SHALL ASK FOR
YOUR FATHER'S CONSENT
RIGHT NOW.

SACRED DUTY

I WILL NOT
BREAK TRADITION!

I KNOW I'M NOT
YOUR <i>REAL</i> SON...

BUT MASTER MARIK
IS TOO FRIGHTENED

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:12.565
TO GO THROUGH
WITH THE INITIATION.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.767
I CAN'T BEAR
TO SEE HIM THIS WAY.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:18.771
LET <i>ME</i> FULFILL
THE FAMILY'S DESTINY
AND PROTECT THE TOMB.

I'LL DEVOTE <i>MY</i> LIFE...

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.343
SO MASTER <i>MARIK</i>
CAN BE FREE.

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:26.946

WHY SHOULD <i>I</i> HAVE
TO PLEDGE MY LIFE
TO SOME PHARAOH!?!

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:08.588

YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:22.101
Odion: EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
MARIK WAS DIFFERENT.

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:26.806
IT WAS AS IF THAT INITIATION
INFUSED HIM WITH AN EVIL FORCE.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.942
OVER THE YEARS, HIS EVIL SIDE
GREW STRONGER.

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.844

WE MUST DEFEAT

SO I CAN WIN THEIR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:44.757

NO MATTER
WHAT YOU DRAW,

IT WILL <i>NEVER</i> MATCH
THE POWER OF MY

OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

AND SIT TIGHT.

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:16.989
SMART MOVE,

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:18.624
BUT FORFEITING THIS DUEL

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.660
WOULD HAVE BEEN
AN EVEN <i>SMARTER</i> MOVE!

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.028
ZIP IT, MARIK!

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.697
YOU MAY LOOK CREEPY,
BUT I'M NOT SCARED,

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.867
AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO WAY I'LL LOSE!

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.003
MY LITTLE SISTA CAN
FINALLY SEE ME DUEL...

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:33.373
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
SHE SEES ME <i>WIN.</i>

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.408
IS THAT SO,
MR. WHEELER?

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:37.310
HOW VERY TOUCHING,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.812
BUT NOTHING
CAN SAVE YOU NOW.

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.047
TOO BAD...

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.316
HE'S MADE SOME
GREAT COMEBACKS...

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:46.486
BUT I THINK HIS STREAK
WILL FINALLY END
HERE ON THIS BLIMP.

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:48.287
HE'S DEFINITELY
COME A LONG WAY

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.789
SINCE THE LAST TIME
<i>I</i> DUELED 'IM.

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:51.290
OH, WELL.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.792
HE DID THE BEST
THAT HE COULD.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:55.628
WAIT, MAI...
LOOK AT JOEY'S EYES.

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.597
YOUR TURN.

00:14:57.597 --> 00:14:59.665
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.435
THEY BURN WITH A FIRE
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN
IN HIM BEFORE.

00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.804
IT'S LIKE HE KNOWS
HE'S GOING TO WIN.

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:05.972
BUT HOW?

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:08.307
I CAN'T THINK OF A MOVE
THAT CAN SAVE HIM!

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:12.912

IS WHAT JOEY FEELS
IN HIS HEART, MAI.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:16.215
HIS DETERMINATION
TO BEAT MARIK
IS VERY STRONG,

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.483
AND SO...

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.719
JOEY BELIEVES
HE'S GOING TO WIN
THIS DUEL,

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.120
EVEN THOUGH
THE LIKELIHOOD

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.790
OF HIS VICTORY
OVER MARIK IS
EXTREMELY SMALL.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.292
HE VOWED TO
HELP ME PUT AN END
TO MARIK'S SCHEME,

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.161
AND HE'S KEEPING
HIS PROMISE.

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.630
BUT HOW'S JOEY GONNA
STOP THIS GUY?

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.999
IF HE TRUSTS HIMSELF
AND THE HEART
OF THE CARDS,

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.100
HE'LL FIND A WAY.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.535
Joey:
LET'S GO MARIK!

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:37.270
IF YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT
YOU'LL WIN DIS,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.071
DEN MAKE YOUR MOVE,
ALREADY!

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.873
VERY WELL, THEN.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:43.075
STAND BACK
AS MY <i>MYSTICAL BEAST</i>

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:46.078
SWALLOWS YOUR LAST
LINE OF DEFENSE!

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:49.682
YOUR LEGENDARY FISHERMAN
IS GONE!

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:53.152
BUT DON'T WORRY.
ITS POWER WON'T BE WASTED.

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.222
IT WILL BE ABSORBED
BY MY <i>MYSTICAL BEAST!</i>

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.926
[THINKING]
SORRY, MAKO.

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:02.962
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO TURN YOUR CARD INTO
A FISH-STICK DINNER!

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.698
IT'S YOUR LAST TURN
BEFORE I DESTROY YOU,

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.066
SO GOOD LUCK.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.634
YOU'LL NEED IT!

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.036
LOOKS LIKE I PASS.

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:12.238
SO MAKE
YOUR BIG MOVE.

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:13.906
THIS IS IT...

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.174
POOR JOEY...

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:16.542
HE FOUGHT WELL...

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.545
ONLY MARIK FOUGHT
EVEN BETTER.

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.280
[THINKING]
LOOKS LIKE
I WON'T GET TO SEE

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.784
MARIK'S EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD, AFTER ALL.

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.385
[THINKING]
AFTER THIS ATTACK,

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.988
YUGI'S LITTLE FRIEND
WILL BE FINISHED!

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.291
YOU'VE SERVED ME
WELL, ODION.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.994
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:35.995
UM...
AH!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.598
CAN'T EXPLAIN
HOW I KNOW...

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:40.266
BUT I GOT
DIS STRANGE FEELIN'

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.335
THAT I'M GONNA
WIN DIS DUEL.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.904
IT'S KINDA LIKE
A VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD.

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:48.140
SO GO AHEAD AND TAKE
YOUR BEST SHOT, MARIK.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.009
Odion: OH, I WILL!

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.712
AND AS SOON AS
MY <i>MYSTICAL BEAST</i>
ATTACKS YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:54.747
IT'S <i>OVER!</i>

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.220
IT'S TIME TO LOSE NOW.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.623
SO SAY GOODBYE
TO THE FINALS!

00:17:03.623 --> 00:17:06.659
BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR
FINAL ATTACK AND TRY
TO WIN DIS DUEL,

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:09.095
I GOT SOMETHIN'
I WANNA SAY TO YOU.

00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:11.330
I'LL NEVER
FORGET WHEN YOU
CONTROLLED MY MIND

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.834
AND FORCED ME TO
HURT MY BEST FRIEND
IN DAT CRAZY DUEL.

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:18.905
NOW! IT'S TIME TO DESTROY YOU
WITH MY <i>HINOTAMA</i> MAGIC CARD!

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.742
AAH! AAH!

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.545
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE COURAGE TO FACE
YUGI YOURSELF,

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.179
SO YOU MADE ME
DO YOUR DIRTY WORK

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:29.415
WHILE YOU HID
LIKE A COWARD!

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.318
I'M FACING YOU NOW,
AREN'T I?
YEAH.

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:34.253
AND LOOK AT THE SCORE.

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:37.356
I'M DESTROYING YOU
IN A DUEL FACE-TO-FACE!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.792
WELL...IT'S FUNNY
YOU BRING DAT UP.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:42.161
SEE, EVA SINCE
WE STARTED DIS DUEL,

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.297
I'VE HAD A WEIRD
FEELIN' ABOUT YOU.

00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:46.232
I CAN'T PUT
MY FINGER ON IT,

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.568
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM
LIKE DA SAME GUY DAT
CONTROLLED MY MIND.

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.504
DAT MARIK'S
A REGULA SLIME-BALL...

00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:53.839
BUT YOU PLAYED
A REALLY FAIR DUEL,

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.676
AND IT WAS ONE
'A DA TOUGHEST ONES
I EVA FOUGHT!

00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:59.545
JUST LIKE I GOT
A LITTLE VOICE
DEEP INSIDE ME

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:02.348
DAT TELLS ME THERE'S
NO WAY I'M GONNA LOSE...

00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:04.083
I ALSO GOT A VOICE
DAT TELLS ME

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.519
YOU'RE NOT
DA ROTTEN SNAKE DAT
TOOK OVER MY BRAIN

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:08.821
AND FORCED ME
TO DUEL YUGI!

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:11.023
AND I'M SURE OF IT!

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:12.625
YOU'RE <i>NOT</i> MARIK!

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.795
I ALWAYS TRUST WHAT
I FEEL IN MY GUT...

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:18.297
AND NOW IT'S TELLIN ME
TWO DINGS...

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.666
YOU'RE NOT WHO YOU'RE
PRETENDIN' TA BE...

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.501
AND YOU WON'T WIN!

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:23.502
GRR...

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.537
GRR...

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:25.905
NONSENSE!

00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:27.406
WHEELER'S INSANE!

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.009
OF COURSE THAT DUELIST
IS MARIK!

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:31.477
Yugi: I'M WITH JOEY.

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:33.212
HIS OPPONENT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE THE MADMAN

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.748
WHO'S BEEN TRYING TO STEAL
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:39.251
AND I DON'T SENSE THE SAME EVIL
AROUND HIM, EITHER.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:42.655
BUT IF HE'S NOT MARIK,
THEN WHO COULD HE BE!?

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:45.257
SO WHERE'S THE <i>REAL</i>
SNAKE IN THE GRASS?!

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:46.792
Yugi: COULD IT BE...

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:48.995
HUH?

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.229
[THINKING] NO!

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:53.866
IF I'M EXPOSED, MY ENTIRE PLAN
WILL BE RUINED.

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.736
IN ADDITION TO YUGI'S PUZZLE
AND EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:58.704
I ALSO NEED KAIBA'S CARD,

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:01.507
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR!

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.210
AND I NEED TO LEARN
KAIBA'S <i>ROLE</i> IN THIS
ANCIENT STRUGGLE

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.046
BEFORE MY SECRET IDENTITY
IS KNOWN!

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:09.248
Odion: ENOUGH OF THIS!

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:11.250
ONLY THE <i>REAL</i> MARIK

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.053
WIELDS THE POWER
OF THE MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:15.688
THINK OF <i>THAT</i>
BEFORE YOU LISTEN

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:18.958
TO THOSE SENSELESS VOICES
INSIDE OF YOU, MR. WHEELER!

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:22.862
NOW THEN, IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO FINISH THIS DUEL!

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:25.998
<i>MYSTICAL BEAST SERKET,</i>
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.502
AND END THIS DUEL
IMMEDIATELY!!!

00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:33.406
THIS DUEL IS OVER.

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:35.775
THIS IS IT, GUYS.

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:37.143
[ROARING]

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:38.611
Marik, thinking:
WAIT, ODION!
HUH?

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.246
STOP YOUR ATTACK!

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:42.081
Tea: HEY, IT STOPPED!

00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:45.518
WHAT'S DA DEAL?
HE'S NOT ATTACKIN'!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.388
Duke: SHOULDN'T JOEY
BE A SCORPION SNACK
RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.557
[THINKING] I HELD BACK MY ATTACK
AS YOU REQUESTED, MASTER MARIK.

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:53.392
BUT WHY!?

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:54.794
[THINKING]
I WANT YOU
TO DESTROY HIM

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:57.263
WITH THE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD!

00:19:57.263 --> 00:20:00.399
PLAY THE WINGED
DRAGON OF RA!

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:03.836
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO CONVINCE EVERYONE
THAT <i>YOU</i> ARE <i>ME!</i>

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:06.472
MY TRUE IDENTITY
MUST BE KEPT A SECRET

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:09.208
IF I AM
TO GAIN THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH!

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.043
BUT IT'S
TOO DANGEROUS, MASTER!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.678
PLEASE!

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:16.315
DON'T MAKE ME REMOVE
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
FROM THE SACRED ARK!

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:21.620
PLAY THAT EGYPTIAN GOD
CARD <i>NOW</i> SO THAT I MAY
RULE AS PHARAOH!
