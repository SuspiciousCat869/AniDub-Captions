DANGER AHEAD.

BEST OF LUCK.

00:06:46.035 --> 00:06:47.436
COME TO PAPA!

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:48.504
HA HA HA!

00:06:48.504 --> 00:06:50.005
AW, YEAH!

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:52.374
BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT,
HERE WE COME.

00:06:52.374 --> 00:06:53.942
Joey: WHO'S DA MAN?

00:06:53.942 --> 00:06:55.511
Tea: WAY TO KEEP
YOUR COOL, JOEY.

00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:56.679
Joey: THANKS.

00:06:56.679 --> 00:07:00.082
Yugi: WE'RE LUCKY.
WE GOT THE LAST TWO DISCS.

00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:01.617
SEND OVER
THE RARE HUNTERS.

00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:04.420
THE BOY WITH THE RED EYES
JUST LEFT.

00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:10.679
Joey: GUYS,
I GOTTA GET GOIN'.

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:13.115
MY SISTER SERENITY'S
OPERATION IS TOMORROW,

00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:15.317
AND I TOLD HER I'D STAY
AT THE HOSPITAL TONIGHT.

00:07:15.317 --> 00:07:16.384
ALL RIGHT.

00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:17.519
WISH SERENITY LUCK
FOR ME, JOEY.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:19.121
I'M SURE EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:21.623
THANKS A LOT, YUGE.
LATER, GUYS.

00:07:21.623 --> 00:07:23.325
Tea: BYE, JOEY.
GOOD LUCK.

00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:25.026
I HOPE
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:27.529
GOING TO THAT HOSPITAL
IS NOT AN EASY THING
FOR HIM TO DO.

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:28.897
HUH?
HUH?

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:31.833
JOEY'S MOTHER IS
GONNA BE AT THAT HOSPITAL,
TOO, GUYS.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:34.369
Tristan: SHE WAS
THE ONE WHO SEPARATED
JOEY AND SERENITY

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:36.171
WHEN THEY WERE KIDS.

00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:38.006
HE HASN'T SPOKEN
TO HIS MOTHER SINCE.

00:07:38.006 --> 00:07:39.741
NO WAY.

00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.110
BUT THAT MEANS THAT JOEY
HASN'T SEEN OR SPOKEN
TO HIS MOTHER

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.979
IN ALMOST 7 YEARS.

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.916
YES, BUT I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT THE WHEELER FAMILY
UNITES ONCE AGAIN.

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:50.652
AREN'T YOU GETTING
JUST A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY
THERE, TRISTAN?

00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:52.154
NOT IF HE'S
TRYING TO BE A HERO

00:07:52.154 --> 00:07:54.122
TO IMPRESS
JOEY'S SISTER
SERENITY.

00:07:54.122 --> 00:07:55.290
UHH...

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.828
[JOEY PANTING]

00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:01.429
I'D BETTER HUSTLE.

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:04.566
I PROMISED SERENITY
I'D BE AT THE HOSPITAL
IN A FEW MINUTES,

00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:06.935
AND I'VE NEVER
LET HER DOWN.

00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:07.936
HUH?

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:11.006
HUH?

00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:13.308
EXCUSE ME.

00:08:13.308 --> 00:08:15.777
UH, HEY, WHAT'S
THE BIG IDEA?

00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:17.612
OUTTA MY WAY.
I'M IN A HURRY.

00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:18.680
HA HA HA!

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.116
YOU WON'T BE GOING
ANYWHERE FOR A WHILE.

00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:23.251
WHAT DO YOU FREAKS
WANT WITH ME?

00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:24.553
HA HA HA!

00:08:24.553 --> 00:08:27.756
YOU'RE A FEISTY LITTLE ONE,
AREN'T YOU, JOEY WHEELER?

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:30.559
I SEE YOU'VE NEVER MET
A RARE HUNTER.

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:33.461
WE STALK OUR PREY
AND TAKE WHAT WE DESIRE--

00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:35.931
IN THIS CASE,
YOUR RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.999
NOW PREPARE
TO DUEL FOR IT.

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:39.935
Joey: HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY RED EYES?

00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:41.503
LOOK.
JUST STEP ASIDE.

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:43.104
IF YOU'D LIKE
TO LEAVE HERE
IN ONE PIECE,

00:08:43.104 --> 00:08:46.575
I'D SUGGEST YOU DO
AS WE SAY AND DUEL.

00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:49.077
YOU'RE NOT GIVIN' ME
A CHOICE, ARE YA?

00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:50.712
DEN I GUESS
I ACCEPT.

00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:52.848
THEN LET THE HUNT
CONTINUE.

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:56.084
NOW, WE'LL DUEL
BY THE BATTLE CITY RULES.

00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:59.487
THAT WAY, WHEN WE WIN,
WE'LL GET YOUR
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.

00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:03.325
I'D SUGGEST
YOU PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE HUNT.

00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:04.593
LET'S GET DIS
OVER WITH.

00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:06.828
I GOT SOMEWHERE
I GOTTA BE.

00:09:06.828 --> 00:09:08.296
[CLANG]

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:11.099
[BEEPS]

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:13.235
TIME TO DUEL!
TIME TO DUEL!

00:09:15.403 --> 00:09:17.839
[MOANS]

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:18.907
HUH?

00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:20.842
SERENITY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, DEAR?

00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:23.111
WELL, I GUESS I'M JUST
REALLY TERRIFIED

00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:25.947
ABOUT GETTING
THIS EYE OPERATION, MOM,

00:09:25.947 --> 00:09:28.283
BUT I KNOW ONCE JOEY
GETS TO THE HOSPITAL,

00:09:28.283 --> 00:09:29.417
I'LL FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER.

00:09:29.417 --> 00:09:31.019
HE SHOULD
BE ON HIS WAY.

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:32.854
JOSEPH'S COMING?

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:38.894
I'LL GET
DIS PARTY STARTED

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:42.063
BY PLAYING
MY PANTHER WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:49.804
IT'S
THE PREDATOR'S MOVE.

00:09:49.804 --> 00:09:54.242
I PLACE ONE CARD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:55.443 --> 00:09:57.879
Joey: NOT MUCH
OF A PREDATOR
SO FAR.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.180
HMM.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.016
THESE LITTLE
FUR-BALLS MAY NOT
LOOK LIKE MUCH,

00:10:01.016 --> 00:10:02.684
BUT THEY'RE
JUST WHAT I NEED
RIGHT NOW.

00:10:02.684 --> 00:10:04.519
SCAPEGOAT...

00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:12.127
PANTHER WARRIOR
CAN'T ATTACK UNLESS I
MAKE A SACRIFICE FIRST,

00:10:12.127 --> 00:10:15.697
SO B'BYE, SCAPEGOAT,
HELLO, PANTHER ATTACK.

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:19.935
[ROARING]

00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:24.472
HMM.

00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:26.241
LOOKS LIKE
MY PANTHER WARRIOR

00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.842
IS THE REAL HUNTER
IN THIS DUEL.

00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:29.911
NOW WHAT?

00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:34.349
THE GRACEFUL CHARITY CARD
ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
3 NEW CARDS.

00:10:38.053 --> 00:10:40.922
MY DECK IS FILLED
WITH SURPRISES,

00:10:40.922 --> 00:10:46.494
AND SOON I'LL BE
ADDING YOUR RED EYES
TO MY COLLECTION.

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.921
[THINKING] WHERE IS JOEY?
HE SAID HE'D BE HERE.

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.490
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE
FOR ME BEFORE.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.058
I HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT.

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.493
[SOBBING]

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.697
[GROWLS]

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.933
THERE'S
SOMEONE OUT THERE
WHO NEEDS MY HELP,

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:09.135
SO I'M GONNA
END DIS DUEL
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:13.206
I PLAY
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD
IN ATTACK MODE...

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.577
AND I'M GONNA SACRIFICE
ANOTHER SCAPEGOAT

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:20.446
SO PANTHER WARRIOR
CAN ATTACK AGAIN.

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.281
[ROARING]

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:30.123
SO YOU GUYS WANNA
PLAY BY BATTLE CITY
RULES, HUH?

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.591
WELL, I JUST HEARD

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:33.626
THAT WHEN YOU
HAVE NO MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD,

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.928
I CAN ATTACK
YOUR LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY.

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:38.231
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD,
ATTACK NOW!

00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:41.033
DIRECT ATTACK
ON DA HOODED FREAK.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.468
[ROARS]

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.270
AAH!

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.371
UH!

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.639
GIVE UP YET?

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.840
NO. NOT QUITE.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.942
I PLAY
GRACEFUL CHARITY AGAIN.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:50.943
AGAIN?

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:52.278
YES. A GOOD HUNTER

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:55.982
MUST ACQUIRE STRONG HOUNDS
TO REPLACE THE WEAK ONES.

00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:57.917
SO I DISCARD
TWO OLD CARDS

00:11:57.917 --> 00:11:59.852
AND PLACE THIS ONE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:02.989
BOOOORRRRIIIING.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:05.858
GIMME A BREAK.
I'M FALLIN' ASLEEP.

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:09.262
HOW MANY TIMES YA GONNA
KEEP THROWIN' THE SAME
LOUSY CARDS DOWN?

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:11.664
YOU DUEL AS BADLY
AS YOU DRESS.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.433
TIME TO END
THIS PATHETIC DUEL

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:16.035
SO I CAN GET BACK
TO WHAT I WAS DOIN'.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:17.904

WIPE DA STREET
WITH DIS BUM.

HUH?

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.342
WAIT A SECOND.

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.044
WHEN YUGI WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT THE BATTLE CITY
RULES TODAY,

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.546
HE SAID SOMETHING

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:28.948
ABOUT HAVIN'
TO SACRIFICE
WEAKER MONSTERS

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:31.851
SO YOU CAN SUMMON
STRONGER MONSTERS.

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.586
I THINK
I CAN OFFER UP
THOSE TWO GUYS

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.222
TO BRING OUT
MY SECRET WEAPON.

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.691
NOW FOR YOUR
WORST NIGHTMARE--

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:41.127
THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN
WAITIN' FOR.

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:45.431
I SUMMON
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:52.271
[ROARING]

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.673
AHH!

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:56.776
SO YOU WANTED TO SEE
MY RED EYES, HUH?

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.277
GUESS YOU GOT
YOUR WISH.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.446
NOW TAKE
A LOOK AT DIS.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.848
HERE WE GO.

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:04.717
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON,
ATTACK.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:12.892
I THINK THIS
WAS MY EASIEST
DUEL EVER.

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:16.028
WHILE YOU WERE BUSY
PICKIN' CARDS
AND PLAYIN' DEFENSE,

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:17.730
I WAS
BLASTIN' YOU AWAY.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.798
FOOLISH BOY,

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.733
I'VE BEEN LEADING YOU
THROUGH THIS HUNT,

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.902
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT
MOMENT TO POUNCE.

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:24.871
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:26.939
I THINK
YOU GOT YOUR CAPE
ON TOO TIGHT.

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.407
I'VE BEEN
CREMATING YA.

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:30.643
WRONG. I'M ABOUT
TO FINISH YOU OFF.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.578
SAY WHAAAAA?

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:35.381
IT'S MY MOVE NOW,

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:39.385
AND IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO UNLEASH
THE ULTIMATE BEAST.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:41.821
I SUMMON EXODIA
THE FORBIDDEN ONE.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.489
NO WAY!
IT'S ALL OVER.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:44.590
NOT EXODIA.

00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:55.101
NO! HOW CAN IT BE?

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:58.671
EXODIA, OBLITERATE.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.076
UHH!

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:06.345
EXODIA'S THE RAREST
CARD I KNOW.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.180
HOW DID YOU GET IT
IN YOUR DECK?

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.248
HMM.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.317
IT IS TRUE THAT
THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:15.421
OF EXODIA THE FORBIDDEN ONE
ARE EXTREMELY RARE CARDS,

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:19.992
BUT RARE HUNTERS THRIVE
ON RELIEVING DUELISTS
OF THEIR RAREST CARDS.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.262
THAT'S HOW I'VE ASSEMBLED
3 COMPLETE SETS OF EXODIA

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.364
IN ONE SINGLE DECK
OF CARDS.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.599
YOU WON THEM ALL?

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.867
LET'S JUST SAY,

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.369
WE ACQUIRE THEM
BY WHATEVER MEANS
NECESSARY.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:33.005
NOW WE'LL
TAKE OUR PRIZE--
YOUR RED EYES.

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:34.206
HEY, I'LL GET IT.

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.242
WE PREFER
TO TAKE IT BY FORCE.

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:38.077
I SAID, I'LL GET IT.

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:40.212
YAAH!

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.081
OH! UH!

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:46.252
AH, THE THRILL
OF THE HUNT.
HERE IT IS.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.620
HMM.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.958
AND NOW YOUR PRECIOUS
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON
IS MINE.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.594
MY
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:56.796
HA HA HA!

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.488
Mother: SERENITY,

00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:04.056
OPEN THE DOOR
RIGHT NOW.

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:05.224
PLEASE LET ME IN.

00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:07.092
SERENITY, PLEASE.

00:15:07.092 --> 00:15:08.160
Serenity:
I WON'T.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.561
I'M NOT GOING TO
HAVE THE OPERATION

00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:11.163
UNTIL JOEY
GETS HERE.

00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:12.798
Yugi: HELLO?

00:15:12.798 --> 00:15:14.600
MRS. WHEELER?

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.168
WHAT'S THAT?

00:15:16.168 --> 00:15:18.904
JOEY NEVER SHOWED UP
AT THE HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT?

00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:21.507
DON'T WORRY, MRS. WHEELER.
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

00:15:24.042 --> 00:15:25.344
YUGI!

00:15:25.344 --> 00:15:26.412
HEY, TEA.

00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:27.613
ANY SIGN OF JOEY?

00:15:27.613 --> 00:15:29.314
Yugi: NOTHING.
THIS ISN'T LIKE HIM.

00:15:29.314 --> 00:15:30.716
I'M REALLY WORRIED.

00:15:30.716 --> 00:15:32.718
WELL, ANYTHING?

00:15:32.718 --> 00:15:33.986
I DIDN'T
SEE HIM ANYWHERE,

00:15:33.986 --> 00:15:36.622
AND I CHECKED ALL
OF HIS USUAL SPOTS.

00:15:36.622 --> 00:15:38.757
THERE MUST BE SOMEPLACE
I'M NOT THINKING OF.

00:15:38.757 --> 00:15:40.359
WHY DON'T YOU
CHECK DOWNTOWN
ON YOUR BIKE?

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.795
NOT A BAD IDEA
AT ALL, TEA.

00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:45.631
WE SHOULD SPLIT UP
AND CHECK EVERY CORNER
OF THE CITY.

00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:48.367
IT JUST ISN'T LIKE JOEY
TO MISS HIS SISTER'S OPERATION.

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.335
SOMETHING MUST HAVE
HAPPENED TO HIM.

00:15:50.335 --> 00:15:52.738
YEAH. HE'D NEVER
LET SERENITY DOWN.

00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:54.673
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE GOTTEN
TO THE HOSPITAL

00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:57.142
TO SEE SERENITY
AT ABOUT 9:00 LAST NIGHT,

00:15:57.142 --> 00:15:59.311
SO WHATEVER HELD HIM UP
FROM DOING THAT

00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:01.413
MUST HAVE HAPPENED
RIGHT AFTER WE LEFT HIM.

00:16:01.413 --> 00:16:02.681
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.917
ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS
SHOULD CHECK UP HERE.

00:16:04.917 --> 00:16:06.185
Tristan:
I'M HEADING DOWNTOWN.

00:16:08.454 --> 00:16:10.456
HEY, JOEY!
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:17.763
HEY, WHEELER!
YOU OUT THERE, BUDDY?

00:16:17.763 --> 00:16:20.065
JOEY, IT'S ME, TEA!
HELLO!

00:16:20.065 --> 00:16:21.767
[PANTING]

00:16:24.036 --> 00:16:26.939
HE'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:28.907
WE CHECKED
EVERYWHERE, YUGI.

00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:30.843
[HORN HONKING]

00:16:30.843 --> 00:16:33.111
HEY, LOOK
WHO I FOUND!

00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:34.613
OH!
HE'S GOT JOEY!

00:16:34.613 --> 00:16:38.484
HE'S ALL RIGHT,
AND HE CAN STILL MAKE IT
FOR THE OPERATION.

00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:40.819
SERENITY,
OPEN THE DOOR
THIS INSTANT.

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:44.022
I HAVE OTHER PATIENTS.
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

00:16:44.022 --> 00:16:46.091
DOCTOR, PLEASE.

00:16:46.091 --> 00:16:48.060
Joey: YEAH.
HANG ON THERE, DOC.

00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:52.030
[GASP] JOSEPH.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.532
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:53.532 --> 00:16:55.601
LET ME TAKE CARE
OF THIS ONE, MA.

00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:58.470
Joey: SERENITY,
IT'S ME, JOEY.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.105
LISTEN, SIS.

00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:02.808
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT YOU GOTTA OPEN
DIS DOOR SO WE CAN TALK.

00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:05.611
Serenity: NO.
I'M NOT OPENING
THE DOOR.

00:17:05.611 --> 00:17:08.080
YOU SAID THAT YOU
WOULD BE HERE
LAST NIGHT, JOEY,

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.816
AND I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

00:17:10.816 --> 00:17:13.085
I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME
THROUGH THIS.

00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:14.419
[SOBS]

00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:15.787
I'M SORRY.

00:17:15.787 --> 00:17:17.789
I KNOW
I LET YA DOWN, SIS,

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:20.125
BUT JUST LEMME
EXPLAIN, PLEASE.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.561
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO DA HOSPITAL YESTERDAY,

00:17:22.561 --> 00:17:24.096
JUST LIKE I PROMISED,

00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:26.064
BUT I RAN INTO
SOME CREEPS DOWNTOWN.

00:17:26.064 --> 00:17:28.500
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS COMIN' TO SEE YA,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.236
BUT THAT GANG OF PUNKS
WOULDN'T LET ME LEAVE.

00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:33.705
THEY CORNERED ME
AND FORCED ME INTO A DUEL.

00:17:33.705 --> 00:17:35.941
THEN THEY TOOK THE BEST
CARD IN MY WHOLE DECK.

00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:38.677
I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING RIGHT.

00:17:38.677 --> 00:17:42.047
SOMEHOW, I MANAGED
TO LET DOWN THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE

00:17:42.047 --> 00:17:43.949
ON THE DAY THAT SHE
NEEDED ME THE MOST.

00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:46.852
I MUST BE THE WORST
BIG BROTHER IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD.

00:17:46.852 --> 00:17:48.720
BUT YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE ME, SERENITY.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.290
I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO HURT YA.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.226
YOU'RE MORE THAN
JUST MY LITTLE SISTER.

00:17:54.226 --> 00:17:55.727
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

00:17:55.727 --> 00:17:56.995
AND THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE WORLD

00:17:56.995 --> 00:17:59.364
THAT CAN BREAK
THE BOND BETWEEN US.

00:17:59.364 --> 00:18:03.135
NOW OPEN DIS DOOR
AND GIVE YOUR BIG BROTHER
A HUG, HUH?

00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:06.672
[SOBBING]

00:18:06.672 --> 00:18:08.240
THAT'S IT.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.241
JOEY!

00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:11.910
Mother: OHH.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.312
IT'S, UH,

00:18:13.312 --> 00:18:14.613
NICE TO SEE YOU, MA.

00:18:14.613 --> 00:18:16.515
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

00:18:16.515 --> 00:18:17.549
THANKS, SON.

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:19.785
HMM.

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.253
Yugi: HEY, JOEY.

00:18:21.253 --> 00:18:23.221
SERENITY'S OPERATION
WENT WELL?

00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:25.190
OH! AWESOME!

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.292
SHE'S IN THE RECOVERY
ROOM NOW.

00:18:27.292 --> 00:18:29.928
Yugi: WHO WERE THOSE GUYS
LAST NIGHT, JOEY?

00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:33.198
YOU MEAN
THOSE 3 BUTT-UGLY CHUMPS
WHO FORCED ME TO DUEL?

00:18:33.198 --> 00:18:36.335
Joey: ALL I KNOW IS,
I'M GONNA FIND 'EM
AND WIN BACK MY RED EYES.

00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:38.704
WELL, I'LL BE THERE
TO HELP YOU, JOEY.

00:18:38.704 --> 00:18:40.606
I KNOW
YOU WILL, PAL.

00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:42.841
LISTEN. I'LL STOP BY
ON MY WAY HOME.

00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:45.811
YOU GOT IT. BYE.

00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:47.713
[THINKING]
I'VE GOT A FEELING
WHOEVER TOOK HIS CARD

00:18:47.713 --> 00:18:49.715
IS MORE DANGEROUS
THAN JOEY THINKS.

00:18:51.483 --> 00:18:53.852
[THINKING] THAT RARE HUNTER,
OR WHATEVER HE CALLS HIMSELF,

00:18:53.852 --> 00:18:56.054
HASN'T SEEN THE LAST
OF JOEY WHEELER.

00:18:56.054 --> 00:18:57.422
DIS BATTLE AIN'T OVER

00:18:57.422 --> 00:19:00.025
TILL I GET BACK
MY RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.
