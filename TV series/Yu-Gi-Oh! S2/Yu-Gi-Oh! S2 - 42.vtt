WEBVTT

00:00:01.197 --> 00:00:02.365
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:02.365 --> 00:00:04.267
Roland:
MAI VALENTINE,
MARIK ISHTAR...

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:06.002
THIS DUEL WILL NOW BEGIN!

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.470
Mai: I'M READY
TO SHOW YOU

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.372
WHAT REAL DUELING'S
ALL ABOUT!

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:12.142
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS MATCH
TO <i>THE SHADOW REALM!</i>

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.176
THERE'S NO WAY!

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:15.045
EACH MONSTER WE PLAY
CARRIES WITH IT

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.515
THE MEMORY OF A PERSON
WE HOLD WITHIN OUR MIND.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:20.583
SO WHEN A MONSTER
IS DESTROYED,

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:24.254
THE MEMORY OF A PERSON
FROM YOUR LIFE
IS DESTROYED WITH IT!

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.156
NOW, MY UNFRIENDLY
AMAZON,

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:28.992
ATTACK THE DARK WITCH
WITH SOARING SLASH!

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:30.827
HA HA HA!
VERY GOOD.

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:33.363
YOU'VE WIPED AWAY
SOME OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:36.399
HOWEVER,
DARK WITCH WAS
ORIGINALLY <i>YOUR</i> MONSTER...

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.400
LET'S SEE WHICH ONE
OF YOUR FRIENDS

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.437
WILL BECOME
YOUR FIRST LOST MEMORY.

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:41.471
NOT TEA!

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:42.472
NOW TEA'S NOTHING MORE

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:45.275
THAN A FACELESS
PHANTOM TO YOU.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:46.476
WHAT!?

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.345
I'M AFRAID THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING,

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:50.080
AND BY THE TIME
I'M THROUGH,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.815
YOU'LL BE
A MINDLESS SHELL

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:57.053
ALL ALONE IN A WORLD
FULL OF STRANGERS!

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:01.925
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:02.926
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:12.135
♪ YU-GI-OH
IS IN THE GAME ♪

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.026
IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:58.047
HA HA HA!

00:01:58.047 --> 00:01:59.482
FEELING LIGHTHEADED?

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:01.451
SINCE I'M WIPING OUT
YOUR MEMORIES,

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:03.386
THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED!

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:06.022
Tristan: HEY, MAI
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
IN A MAJOR DAZE, GUYS.

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:07.023
TRY AND
HANG IN THERE, MAI!

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:10.026
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:11.027
WE'RE ALL HERE FOR YOU!

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:12.028
[THINKING]
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:13.930
WHOSE VOICE IS THAT?

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.231
AND WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.000
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.034
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING ME,

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:20.336
AND WHAT'S WITH
THAT BLANK STARE?

00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:21.337
[THINKING]
IT'S TRUE!

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:23.106
TEA'S BEEN ERASED
FROM MAI'S MIND!

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.874
Marik, thinking:
HA HA HA!

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:27.076
CHERISH YOUR MEMORIES
WHILE YOU CAN, MY DEAR,

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:29.078
FOR, SOON, YOU'LL
FORGET EVERYONE

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:32.015
AND EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER KNOWN!

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:34.384
ALL RIGHT, THEN...

00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:37.353
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN...

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:38.888
AND THEN...

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:42.091
I'LL SUMMON
MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:47.797
NEXT I'LL ADD THIS
ALL-POWERFUL MAGIC CARD,

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:49.032
THE MYSTICAL
BLACK PENDANT!

00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:56.239
BLACK PENDANT'S
DARK MAGIC

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.476
RAISES MY MONSTER'S ATTACK
STRENGTH BY 500 POINTS!

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:03.012
[THINKING]
NOW MARIK'S MONSTER

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:05.782
IS <i>STRONGER</i> THAN
MY UNFRIENDLY AMAZON!

00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:07.517
HE'S GOING TO ATTACK!

00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:08.551
Marik, thinking:
HA HA HA!

00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:10.320
IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.089
A MILLENNIUM'S WORTH
OF ANCIENT MAGICAL POWERS

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.024
AGAINST A MERE MORTAL!

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:18.394
TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO ANOTHER ONE OF
YOUR FRIENDS!

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:19.929
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:21.364
AND NOW, MAKYURA!

00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:23.099
3-CLAW SLASH!

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.135
ACTIVATE TRAP CARD!

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:27.837
AMAZON ARCHERS!

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:32.075
NOW YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS ARE
<i>REDUCED</i> BY 500,

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:35.345
BRINGING THEM BACK
WHERE THEY STARTED!

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.013
VERY CLEVER.

00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:39.582
NOW IT'S <i>MY</i> MONSTER'S
TURN TO ATTACK!

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:41.317
GO, UNFRIENDLY AMAZON!

00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:42.919
SOARING SLASH ATTACK!

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:49.492
MAYBE THAT WILL
ERASE SOMEONE
FROM <i>YOUR</i> MIND!

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:51.427
WHY...THANK YOU.

00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:52.595
HUH?

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:54.097
THERE'S NO ONE
IN MY MIND

00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:55.932
<i>WORTH</i> REMEMBERING.

00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:58.468
I <i>PREFER</i> TO BE ALL ALONE.

00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:01.938
SO ATTACK MY MONSTERS,
AND REMOVE MY SERVANTS
FROM MY MIND.

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:06.042
GIVEN THE CHOICE,
I'D FORGET EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:07.043
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE NUTS.

00:04:07.043 --> 00:04:09.579
PERHAPS,
BUT I'M SANE ENOUGH

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.414
TO HAVE CAUGHT YOU
IN MY TRAP!

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:12.448
YOU SEE,
WHEN A MONSTER

00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:15.385
WEARING THE BLACK PENDANT
IS DESTROYED,

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:17.086
ITS OPPONENT LOSES
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:21.491
AND I'M AFRAID
THERE'S ANOTHER PENALTY
FOR YOU TO PAY, MY DEAR.

00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:24.427
BY SENDING
MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:04:24.427 --> 00:04:26.796
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:29.999
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO PLAY
ANY TRAP CARD I WANT
FROM MY HAND.

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.235
AH!

00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:33.903
AND I THINK
IT WILL SERVE ME BEST

00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:36.205
TO ACTIVATE <i>THIS ONE.</i>

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:38.107
ROPE OF LIFE!

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.981
THIS CARD BRINGS
A MONSTER BACK
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:48.051
AND EMPOWERS IT
WITH 800 EXTRA
ATTACK POINTS!

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:50.086
SO SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR UNFRIENDLY AMAZON!

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.355
IT <i>CAN'T</i> BE!

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:56.960
OH, IT CAN!

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.094
MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR!

00:04:58.094 --> 00:05:01.397
ATTACK HER AMAZON NOW!

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.937
AS <i>SHE</i> GOES, SO GOES
YOUR MEMORY OF ANOTHER FRIEND!

00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:14.043
EH? NO, JOEY!

00:05:14.043 --> 00:05:16.079
PLEASE DON'T GO!

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.947
SO...HOW DOES IT FEEL

00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:21.017
TO HAVE YOUR MIND
WIPED CLEAN OF
<i>TWO</i> DEAR FRIENDS?

00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:22.018
HE'S...SLIPPING AWAY.

00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:25.588
I CAN BARELY SEE HIM.

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:27.590
I FEEL SO ALONE.

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:30.460
Mai, thinking:
IT'S NOTHING NEW.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.128
IT FEELS JUST LIKE
THE LONELINESS I FELT

00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:33.463
WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:35.832
MY FAMILY ALWAYS MOVING...

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:37.367
NEVER HAVING ANY FRIENDS.

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:40.536
MY PARENTS ALWAYS TOO BUSY
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:42.205
I HAD NOBODY.

00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:47.477
EVEN AFTER I GOT MY FIRST JOB
AND DISCOVERED DUEL MONSTERS,

00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:50.246
I WAS STILL JUST A LONELY KID.

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:52.915
THE POWERFUL HARPIE CARDS
I KEPT IN MY DECK

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:55.518
WERE THE CLOSEST THINGS
I HAD TO FRIENDS.

00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:58.221
BUT AS COOL AND POWERFUL
AS MY HARPIES WERE...

00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:01.491
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
I KNEW THEY WEREN'T REAL.

00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:05.161
SO I PRETTY MUCH DECIDED THAT
I WAS JUST <i>MEANT</i> TO BE ALONE,

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:07.363
TO PLAY BY MY <i>OWN</i> RULES,

00:06:07.363 --> 00:06:10.133
UNTIL THAT DAY ON THE BOAT
TO DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:11.901
WHEN EVERYTHING CHANGED.

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.071
AS SOON AS I SAW THOSE GUYS...

00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.340
I FELT SOMETHING
I'D NEVER FELT BEFORE--

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.175
FRIENDSHIP.

00:06:19.175 --> 00:06:20.176
AND THE MORE I HUNG OUT
WITH THEM,

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:21.811
THE MORE THEY BEGAN
TO GROW ON ME...

00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:22.812
[BAWK BAWK BAWK]

00:06:22.812 --> 00:06:23.813
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:25.248
PRETTY GOOD IMITATION
OF KAIBA, RIGHT!?

00:06:25.248 --> 00:06:27.550
Mai, voice-over:
SURE THEY WERE A LITTLE
WEIRD AT TIMES...

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.185
BUT THEY WERE NICE WEIRDOS,

00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:32.221
AND SOON MY LONELINESS WAS GONE.

00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:36.125
BUT NOW I'M LOSING
THE ONLY REAL FRIENDS
I'VE EVER HAD!

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:37.226
SO...

00:06:37.226 --> 00:06:39.228
I'M JUST A LONELY
KID AGAIN.

00:06:39.228 --> 00:06:40.263
[THINKING]
HA HA HA!

00:06:40.263 --> 00:06:43.132
YES. FEEL THE PAIN,
THE HEARTBREAK!

00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:45.568
THE <i>TORMENT</i> OF
LOSING YOUR MIND!

00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:48.004
NO ONE SAID SHADOW GAMES
WERE PLEASANT!

00:06:48.004 --> 00:06:49.005
NOW SAY GOOD-BYE!

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:52.809
JOEY'S GONE FOREVER!

00:06:59.477 --> 00:07:01.379
Marik: YOUR MEMORY
OF JOEY HAS BEEN ERASED!

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:05.850
MAI! YOU OK?!

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.786
GROUND CONTROL
TO MAI!

00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:09.287
COME IN...

00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:10.655
FIRST SHE
IGNORES TEA,

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:12.724
AND NOW SHE'S
IGNORING ME?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.692
SHE'S NOT
<i>IGNORING</i> YOU JOEY.

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:17.529
THIS SHADOW GAME
HAS MADE HER FORGET
WHO YOU ARE.

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:19.164
FORGET WHO <i>I</i> AM?

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:21.466
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:07:21.466 --> 00:07:23.535
Joey: HEY, MAI!
LOOK AT ME!

00:07:23.535 --> 00:07:25.603
HOW CAN YOU FORGET
A MUG LIKE <i>THIS?!</i>

00:07:25.603 --> 00:07:26.604
MAI? OVER HERE!

00:07:26.604 --> 00:07:28.773
IT'S ME,
JOEY WHEELER!

00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:30.442

00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:31.709
[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT.

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:34.879
IF MARIK'S GONNA USE
SHADOW POWERS TO <i>HURT</i> MAI,

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:36.748
THEN I'M GONNA USE THEM
TO <i>HELP</i> HER.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.216
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:39.784
<i>TWO</i> CAN PLAY
AT THIS MIND GAME!

00:07:39.784 --> 00:07:42.520
I HAVE TO SHOW MAI THE TRUTH!

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.122
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT SHE WON'T BE

00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:46.658
WANDERING ALONE
IN THE SHADOWS FOREVER!

00:07:46.658 --> 00:07:49.227
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
FOR ME TO DO IT--

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:50.895
BY USING MY <i>OWN</i>
MILLENNIUM POWERS

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:56.501
TO PENETRATE
MARIK'S SHADOW GAME
AND ENTER MAI'S MIND!

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:58.470
HMM?

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.471
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:01.706
HUH? OH.

00:08:01.706 --> 00:08:04.676
Yami-Yugi:
YOU'RE NOT ALONE,
MAI!

00:08:04.676 --> 00:08:06.211
Mai: WHO'S THERE?

00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:07.245
MAI! IT'S ME!

00:08:07.245 --> 00:08:08.279
YUGI? WHAT--

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.315
WHAT ARE <i>YOU</i>
DOING UP HERE?

00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:12.650
THAT'S WHAT <i>I'D</i>
LIKE TO KNOW!

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.119
LISTEN TO ME,
MAI.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.855
YOU CAN'T LET
MARIK'S ILLUSIONS
DISTRACT YOU.

00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:18.556
ILLUSIONS?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:08:18.556 --> 00:08:19.557
THIS WHOLE THING'S
A <i>FANTASY?</i>

00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:22.193
BUT IT ALL SEEMS
SO <i>REAL!</i>

00:08:22.193 --> 00:08:23.294
PERHAPS,

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.363
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
THE WORLD YOU'RE IN NOW

00:08:25.363 --> 00:08:26.397
IS MAKING IT <i>SEEM</i> REAL.

00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:28.399
WIN THIS MATCH,

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.135
AND YOU'LL SHED
LIGHT ON THE TRUTH

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.103
AND RETURN TO LIFE
AS YOU KNEW IT.

00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:33.538
BUT YUGI...

00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:34.606
WHAT IS IT?

00:08:34.606 --> 00:08:36.474
I DON'T KNOW IF I <i>CAN.</i>

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.409
I FEEL SO <i>EMPTY</i> INSIDE.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.410
FIGHT IT, MAI!

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.846
BUT I'M ALL ALONE.

00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:44.516
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:46.651
Joey: HEY, MAI!
WE'RE <i>HERE</i> FOR YOU!

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:47.652
WHO <i>IS</i> THAT?

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.387
I DON'T KNOW
THE VOICE, BUT...

00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:51.422
SOMETHING ABOUT IT
IS...FAMILIAR.

00:08:51.422 --> 00:08:53.324
YES, MAI. LISTEN.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.460
IT'S THE VOICE
OF YOUR FRIENDS,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.328
WHO CONTINUE
TO SUPPORT YOU.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.663
AND YOU CAN
REST ASSURED

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.199
THAT NO MATTER
HOW DARK IT SEEMS
IN THESE SHADOWS,

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:03.835
THOSE VOICES
ARE ALWAYS THERE.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:04.836
OK.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:05.837
HMM.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:09.140
[GROWLING]

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.142

BE STRONG, MAI.

00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:12.210
IT'S ALL
UP TO YOU NOW.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.612
YOU HAVE TO BEAT MARIK
AND FREE YOUR MIND!

00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:15.847
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.282
THANK YOU.

00:09:17.282 --> 00:09:18.449
COME ON!

00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:20.251
I JUST KNOW YOU CAN
BEAT THIS EVIL FREAK!

00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.386
COME ON!

00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.387
Mai, thinking:
THERE'S THAT VOICE AGAIN.

00:09:22.387 --> 00:09:23.621
MAYBE YUGI'S RIGHT,

00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:25.890
AND I'M NOT AS ALONE
AS I FEEL...

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.661
Marik, thinking:
HOW DARE THAT LITTLE RUNT
INTRUDE ON MY SHADOW GAME?

00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:31.262
HE'LL PAY FOR <i>THAT!</i>

00:09:31.262 --> 00:09:35.533
IS THE DANGER PERHAPS
A LITTLE TOO <i>REAL</i> FOR YOU!?

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.801
Mai: NOT EVEN CLOSE!

00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:40.238
YOUR HEAD GAMES
DON'T SCARE <i>ME,</i>
SWEETHEART!

00:09:40.238 --> 00:09:41.439
SUIT YOURSELF,

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:43.608
BUT REALIZE, WHEN I'M
THROUGH WITH YOU,

00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:46.277
YOUR BRAIN WILL BE
NOTHING BUT AN EMPTY SHELL!

00:09:46.277 --> 00:09:47.278
WELL, BRING IT ON,
MARIK!

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:49.480
I'VE NEVER BACKED
OUT OF A DUEL,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.548
AND I WON'T
START NOW!

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:54.252
HMM. THEN PREPARE
TO LOSE YOUR MIND!

00:09:54.252 --> 00:09:55.687
GUESS WE'LL SEE.

00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:57.422
SO GIVE THE SCARE
TACTICS A REST,

00:09:57.422 --> 00:09:58.456
AND GET READY,
BUDDY,

00:09:58.456 --> 00:09:59.791
BECAUSE NOW
IT'S MY TURN,

00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:05.763
AND I PLAY
AMAZON CHAIN MASTER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:10.368
THEN I'LL PLAY ONE CARD
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:12.337
NOW TAKE
YOUR BEST SHOT,
TOUGH GUY!

00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:16.541
YOUR AMAZON CHAIN MASTER
IS WEAK!

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:18.142
[THINKING]
THAT'S WHAT <i>HE</i> THINKS!

00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:19.644
BUT ONCE
HE TRIES TO ATTACK,

00:10:19.644 --> 00:10:22.614
I'LL ACTIVATE
MY SECRET WEAPON!

00:10:22.614 --> 00:10:24.649
ARE YOU READY?

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:26.417
ONCE MAKYURA
THE DESTRUCTOR

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.420
WIPES OUT YOUR PITIFUL
AMAZON CHAIN MASTER,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.322
ANOTHER PIECE
OF YOUR MEMORY
WILL DISAPPEAR.

00:10:31.322 --> 00:10:33.791
SO IF YOU
WANT TO RETAIN

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.127
WHAT'S LEFT OF
YOUR FLEETING INTELLECT,

00:10:36.127 --> 00:10:39.163
I'D ADVISE YOU
NOT TO SUMMON
SUCH WEAK MONSTERS

00:10:39.163 --> 00:10:40.265
TO THE FIELD,

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.701
OR IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE YOUR ENTIRE WORLD

00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:47.505
IS SHROUDED IN A FOG
OF COMPLETE DARKNESS!

00:10:51.324 --> 00:10:52.325
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:53.793
SO YOU THINK
YOUR AMAZON MONSTER

00:10:53.793 --> 00:10:56.863
WILL STOP ME
FROM WIPING AWAY
YOUR MEMORIES!?

00:10:56.863 --> 00:10:57.864
OH! HMM.

00:10:57.864 --> 00:10:59.699
THINK AGAIN!

00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:03.369
I PLAY HOLDING ARMS!

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:08.841
IT MAY NOT
LOOK LIKE MUCH,
BUT OBSERVE.

00:11:08.841 --> 00:11:11.844
ALTHOUGH IT HAS
ONLY 500 ATTACK POINTS,

00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:13.780
IT CAN STILL
STOP YOUR MONSTER!

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.784
HOLDING ARMS, ATTACK!

00:11:17.784 --> 00:11:21.053
HA HA HA!

00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:23.022
YOU SEE,
MY HOLDING ARMS CARD

00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:24.824
HAS THE ABILITY
TO STOP YOUR MONSTER
FROM ATTACKING

00:11:24.824 --> 00:11:27.059
FOR 3 TURNS.

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:28.861
THAT SHOULD BUY ME
ENOUGH TIME

00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:31.297
TO DESTROY YOU
<i>AND</i> YOUR MIND!

00:11:31.297 --> 00:11:32.398
WACKO.

00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:34.700
[LAUGHING]

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.637
[THINKING]
I HOPE MAI DOESN'T
LET THIS CREEP GET TO HER.

00:11:37.637 --> 00:11:39.338
IF SHE LOSES THIS
SHADOW DUEL TO MARIK,

00:11:39.338 --> 00:11:41.073
HER MIND MAY NEVER RECOVER.

00:11:41.073 --> 00:11:43.309
Yami-Yugi:
MARIK, FORGET
THESE MIND GAMES,

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:44.844
AND JUST DUEL!

00:11:44.844 --> 00:11:46.913
THESE GAMES
<i>ARE</i> HOW I DUEL.

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:48.147
YOU SEE, YUGI...

00:11:48.147 --> 00:11:51.717
DUEL MONSTERS
AND THE SHADOW REALM
ARE INTERTWINED,

00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:53.553
SO I'M SIMPLY
PLAYING THE GAME

00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:56.088
AS IT WAS
ORIGINALLY INTENDED.

00:11:56.088 --> 00:11:58.658
UNFORTUNATELY,
FATE HAS SELECTED <i>MAI</i>

00:11:58.658 --> 00:12:00.726
TO BE THE VICTIM
OF TODAY'S GAME.

00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:02.728
YOU'RE INSANE!

00:12:02.728 --> 00:12:03.763
OH, REALLY? WHY'S THAT?

00:12:03.763 --> 00:12:07.133
BECAUSE I DUEL
WITH ANCIENT MAGIC?

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:09.302
LAST I CHECKED,
SO DO <i>YOU...</i>

00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:12.038
BY TAPPING INTO
THE POWERS OF
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE...

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:13.139
DON'T YOU?

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:14.907
YES, BUT NOT
TO SPREAD EVIL!

00:12:14.907 --> 00:12:17.677
Mai: HEY! YUGI!

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:19.745
I APPRECIATE YOU
TRYING TO HELP AND ALL,

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:21.948
BUT I'M THE ONE

SO PLEASE TRUST ME.

00:12:25.685 --> 00:12:26.819
I CAN DEFEND MYSELF
FROM NOW ON.

YOU'RE NOT JUST
GONNA STAND HERE

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:33.226
AND LET HER
KEEP DUELING, ARE YOU?

00:12:33.226 --> 00:12:34.827
I AM. MAI HAS MADE
HER CHOICE.

00:12:34.827 --> 00:12:36.829

IT'S MY ALL-POWERFUL
GRAVE ARM!

THIS MAGIC CARD
CAN BURY ONE MONSTER

00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:53.779
SORRY,
BUT MY HOLDING ARMS

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:56.115
ARE STILL INVINCIBLE
RIGHT NOW.

00:12:56.115 --> 00:12:58.818
YOUR MAGIC EFFECT
WON'T WORK ON THEM!

00:12:58.818 --> 00:13:00.853

GONNA USE IT
ON <i>YOUR</i> MONSTER?

00:13:00.853 --> 00:13:03.089

ON <i>MY</i> AMAZON

MY MEMORY
STAYS THE SAME!

00:13:12.765 --> 00:13:14.634
SO...
YOU'RE <i>THAT</i> DESPERATE

00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:16.602
TO KEEP THE MEMORY
OF YOUR FRIENDS?

00:13:16.602 --> 00:13:18.371
LOOK, MARIK.
THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY REASON

00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.307
I SENT MY OWN MONSTER
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:23.009
SO GET A LOAD OF THIS!

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:26.345
BEFORE MY AMAZON GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:28.748
SHE LETS ME TAKE
A CARD FROM YOUR DECK.

00:13:28.748 --> 00:13:29.982
REALLY?

00:13:29.982 --> 00:13:31.050
REALLY!

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.718
AND THE MONSTER
I'M TAKING...

00:13:32.718 --> 00:13:33.853
IS YOUR EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD,

00:13:33.853 --> 00:13:36.656
THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA!

00:13:36.656 --> 00:13:37.723
GREAT.

00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:38.925
YEAH!
WAY TO GO, MAI!

00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:49.702

00:13:49.702 --> 00:13:52.038
MAI GOT MARIK'S CARD!

00:13:52.038 --> 00:13:53.306
YOU DON'T LOOK SO TOUGH

00:13:53.306 --> 00:13:55.975
WITHOUT YOUR EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD, MARIK!

00:13:55.975 --> 00:13:57.543
TOO BAD.

00:13:57.543 --> 00:14:00.680
YOU MAY POSSESS
THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA FOR NOW,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.815
BUT THE ONLY WAY
FOR YOU TO KEEP IT
IS BY <i>DEFEATING</i> ME!

00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:04.850
DON'T WORRY.
I PLAN TO.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.585
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D TAKE IT

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:07.887
FOR A LITTLE
TEST DRIVE FIRST.

00:14:07.887 --> 00:14:09.855
[THINKING]
TAKING MARIK'S
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:12.224
WAS AN AWESOME MOVE!

00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:15.361
NOW ALL MAI HAS TO DO
IS SUMMON IT TO THE FIELD!

00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:16.829
[THINKING]
FOOLISH GIRL...

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:20.066
SHE NOW HOLDS
THE MOST POWERFUL CARD
IN DUEL MONSTERS,

00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:21.067
BUT CAN SHE USE IT?

00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:24.170
INTERESTING
TURN OF EVENTS.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.304
YOU SAID IT!

00:14:25.304 --> 00:14:27.006
NOW THAT MAI HAS
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:28.240
SHE MAY WIN!

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.909
[THINKING]
PERHAPS.

00:14:29.909 --> 00:14:32.678
BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN
IF SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.648
NECESSARY TO WIELD
A CARD OF SUCH POWER.

00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:37.817
SHE'S DEFINITELY
A GOOD DUELIST...

00:14:37.817 --> 00:14:40.019
BUT IS SHE GOOD <i>ENOUGH?</i>

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:42.021
IT'S <i>MY</i> MOVE!

00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:43.155
[THINKING]
OK.

00:14:43.155 --> 00:14:45.024
I NEED TO SACRIFICE
<i>3</i> MONSTERS

00:14:45.024 --> 00:14:48.160
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.695
BUT SO FAR, I HAVE <i>NONE,</i>
AND <i>HE</i> HAS <i>TWO,</i>

00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:52.031
SO THIS WON'T BE EASY!

00:14:52.031 --> 00:14:54.567
GO ON.
EVERYONE'S WAITING.

00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:55.568
Joey: YEAH!

00:14:55.568 --> 00:14:56.936
WAITING FOR YOU
TO KICK HIS BUTT!

00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:58.270
NOW GO GET HIM, MAI!

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.805
[THINKING]
COME ON, MAI.

00:14:59.805 --> 00:15:01.407
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO.

00:15:01.407 --> 00:15:04.043
[THINKING]
SHOW ME THAT
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:15:04.043 --> 00:15:06.812
FIRST I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN,

00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:09.982
AND THEN I'LL SUMMON
AMAZON FIGHTER...

00:15:09.982 --> 00:15:11.384
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.156
[THINKING]
AND IF YOU TRY
ATTACKING <i>HER,</i>

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:19.992
YOU'LL GET A VERY
UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.

00:15:19.992 --> 00:15:21.927
IT'S ANOTHER WEAK AMAZON?

00:15:21.927 --> 00:15:23.062
HOW SAD.

00:15:23.062 --> 00:15:24.864
I'LL ELIMINATE HER
WITH EASE,

00:15:24.864 --> 00:15:27.800
ALONG WITH <i>ANOTHER</i> PIECE
OF YOUR EVER-SHRINKING MIND!

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.406
MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR,
ATTACK HER AMAZON
FIGHTER NOW!

00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:37.176
HOLD ON THERE, BUD!

00:15:37.176 --> 00:15:40.112
BECAUSE NOW I ACTIVATE
AMAZON MAGICIAN!

00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:43.649
BY PLAYING
THIS MAGIC CARD,

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:46.318
I'VE INSTANTLY SWAPPED
THE ATTACK POINTS
OF <i>YOUR</i> MONSTER

00:15:46.318 --> 00:15:49.121
WITH THE ATTACK POINTS
OF <i>MY</i> MONSTER!

00:15:51.323 --> 00:15:52.324
HMM.

00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:53.626
AMAZON FIGHTER,

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:55.895
TAKE OUT MAKYURA
THE DESTRUCTOR

00:15:55.895 --> 00:15:59.932
AND SOMEONE ELSE
FROM MARIK'S MEMORY!

00:15:59.932 --> 00:16:01.133
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:03.369
I NEVER CARED MUCH
FOR THAT FOOL ARKANA.

00:16:03.369 --> 00:16:04.870
AAH!

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.874
Mai: LOOKS LIKE
MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR
IS <i>DESTROYED!</i>

00:16:08.874 --> 00:16:10.009
YEAH!

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:12.344
MARIK'S ALMOST DOWN TO
1,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:14.580
HA HA HA!

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.948
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY...
HUH?

00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:18.784
TO HAVE YOU CAUGHT
DEEP WITHIN MY TRAP!

00:16:18.784 --> 00:16:19.785
HUH? A TRAP?

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:21.821
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:23.789
REVEAL CARD OF LAST WILL!

00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:26.759
CARD OF LAST WILL?

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:30.896
YES! IT ALLOWS ME
TO DRAW 5 NEW CARDS
INTO MY HAND

00:16:30.896 --> 00:16:34.266
WHEN ONE OF MY MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS IS DECREASED.

00:16:34.266 --> 00:16:36.635
[THINKING]
NOW MARIK GETS
A BRAND-NEW HAND!

00:16:36.635 --> 00:16:38.204
THIS COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING!

00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:41.140
Marik: I OFFER YOU
MY GRATITUDE.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.844
GAINING 5 NEW CARDS
ISN'T <i>ALL</i> YOU'VE
ALLOWED ME TO DO.

00:16:44.844 --> 00:16:49.648
BY DESTROYING MAKYURA,
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:16:49.648 --> 00:16:53.252
NOW I'LL PLAY A CARD
THAT WILL SURELY
ANNIHILATE YOU!!

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.386
Marik: THIS SHADOW GAME'S
QUITE AMUSING.

00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:03.356
NOW...PREPARE TO LIVE OUT
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE!

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.159
BY WAY OF THE TRAP CARD,
NIGHTMARE WHEEL!

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.160
[GASP]

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:12.532
NOT ONLY DOES IT TRAP
YOUR AMAZON FIGHTER...

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:13.533
HEH HEH!

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.569
BUT THE NIGHTMARE WHEEL

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.006
WILL ALSO TAKE
500 LIFE POINTS
FROM YOU EVERY TURN.

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:21.608
I WAS EXPECTING
SOMETHING

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:22.776
I <i>COULDN'T</i> HANDLE.

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:24.511
PARDON?

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:27.147
I <i>THOUGHT</i> YOU'D
TRY SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, <i>MARIK!</i>

00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:28.715
SO I PLAYED
THIS CARD,

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.317
RESCUE OPERATION!

00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:33.453
THIS TRAP CARD
ALLOWS ME TO RESCUE
MY AMAZON FIGHTER

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:34.754
FROM <i>YOUR</i> TRAP...

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:38.692
IT ALSO LETS ME
SUMMON A NEW MONSTER
TO THE FIELD NOW.

00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:40.560
DO YOU <i>KNOW</i>
WHAT THIS <i>MEANS!?</i>

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.296
Marik: SO, ARE YOU
GOING TO SUMMON
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:17:43.296 --> 00:17:44.564
YOU TOOK FROM ME?

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.999
OF COURSE NOT!

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:48.134
I PAID ATTENTION
THE <i>LAST</i> TIME
IT WAS PLAYED!

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:50.003
AND I KNOW
IF I SUMMONED IT <i>NOW</i>

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:51.237
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
ANY MONSTERS <i>FIRST,</i>

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:54.174
IT WOULD HAVE
<i>ZERO</i> ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:54.174 --> 00:17:55.208
BUT NOT TO WORRY!

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:57.210
I'LL <i>PLAY</i> THAT
WINGED DRAGON

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.211
BY THE END
OF MY NEXT TURN.

00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:00.313
SHE CRAZY?

00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:02.349
HOW'S SHE EVER GONNA
PULL THAT OFF, YUGI!?

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.784
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST!

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:07.754
AMAZON FIGHTER,
RETURN TO MY HAND NOW.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.431
AND NOW TO SUMMON
A NEW MONSTER.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.267
AHH, THIS OUGHT TO DO.

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.538
I SUMMON CYBER HARPIE!

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.808

MAI'S FAVORITE!

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.177
NOW I JUST NEED
<i>ONE</i> CARD.

I'LL BE ABLE TO SUMMON
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.185

A MAGIC CARD THAT
LETS ME DRAW 3 <i>NEW</i> CARDS
FROM MY DECK,

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:51.631
AND THEN I DISCARD
TWO FROM MY HAND.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:54.134
[THINKING]
FIRST I'LL
GET RID OF THESE...

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:57.937
AND NOW LET'S SEE
IF I DREW THE CARD
I NEED!

00:18:57.937 --> 00:18:59.973
OH, I AM <i>SO</i> GOOD.

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.641
WELL, YOU ASKED
FOR IT,

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.109
AND NOW, MARIK,

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:04.444
I'M GONNA GIVE IT
TO YOU!

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:06.079
READY, SWEETHEART!?

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:07.347
THE WINGED DRAGON!

00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:11.151
[THINKING]
BUT MAI ONLY HAS
ONE MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.753
YOU WON'T BE SMILING
FOR TOO LONG,

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:16.356
ESPECIALLY
WHEN YOU SEE THIS!

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:18.825
I PLAY...

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.395
THE MAGIC CARD
ELEGANT EGOTIST!

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:24.297
AND NOW
ELEGANT EGOTIST

00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:27.367
WILL TURN MY ONE
HARPIE LADY INTO <i>3!</i>

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:35.642
LET'S GIVE A BIG
BATTLE CITY "HELLO"

00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:38.511
TO THE HARPIE LADY
SISTERS!

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.214
SHE GOT 3 MONSTERS!
SHE DID IT!

00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:44.150
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
THESE 3 LOVELY LADIES

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.020
AND SUMMON THE WINGED
DRAGON OF RA!

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.057

HUH!

00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:11.244
OH.

00:20:11.244 --> 00:20:12.812
OH.

00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:14.681
[THINKING]
SUCH A FOOL.

00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:18.384
DOES SHE REALLY THINK
SHE CAN CONTROL
AN EGYPTIAN GOD?

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.121
I'M AFRAID IT'S
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:22.655
<i>IT</i> WILL CONTROL <i>HER!</i>

00:20:28.194 --> 00:20:30.830
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS THAT THING?!

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.267
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
IS LOCKED IN THAT SPHERE!

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.335
HMM? NO WAY.

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:38.138
[THINKING]
OH! THIS ISN'T GOOD!

00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:40.740
BUT...
HOW CAN I USE IT?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.609
YOU <i>CAN'T</i> USE IT,
YOU FOOL!

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:46.446
YOU'LL NEVER UNLOCK
ITS ANCIENT POWERS!

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:49.449
HA HA HA!
