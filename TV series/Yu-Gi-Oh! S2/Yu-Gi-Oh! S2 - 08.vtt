00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.739
UNABLE TO ATTACK,
UNABLE TO EVEN MOVE.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:55.709
I SHOULD JUST END
YOUR MISERY.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.777
WHY WAIT FOR YOUR
MAGIC CARD TO EXPIRE

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:01.114
WHEN I CAN DRAW ANOTHER
RIGHT ARM FROM MY DECK?

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:02.983
EXODIA CARDS
ARE SO RARE

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.285
THAT MOST DUELISTS
DON'T OWN A SINGLE PIECE,

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.053
BUT I HAVE
3 COPIES OF EACH,

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:10.056
WHICH MEANS THERE ARE
TWO MORE RIGHT ARMS
WAITING IN MY DECK.

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:11.491
HMM.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.693
HEY! WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.128
YOUR DECK'S
LOADED DOWN

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:17.163
WITH SO MANY
EXODIA BODY PARTS,

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.966
THE ODDS OF DRAWING
THE RIGHT ARM
ARE SLIM TO NONE.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.735
WE'LL FIND OUT,
WON'T WE?

00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:24.170
YOUR MISTAKE IS
THAT YOU'RE RELYING
ON ONE MONSTER,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.438
BUT A GOOD
DUELING DECK

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:28.241
REQUIRES THE RIGHT
BALANCE OF CARDS.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.710
AND YOU'RE STILL
A PRISONER OF MY
LIGHTFORCE SWORD...

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.613
WHICH MEANS
I HAVE 3 TURNS
TO DEFEAT YOU!

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.482
WISHFUL THINKING, YUGI.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:37.083
IT'S MY DRAW.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:40.020
[THINKING]
I KNEW IT:
A SECOND EXODIA HEAD.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.956
IT DOESN'T HELP,
BUT I'VE STILL GOT
THE UPPER HAND.

00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:45.191
AND THANKS TO MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.127
MY LIFE POINTS ARE SAFE.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:50.063
UGH! C'MON YUGE!

00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:51.498
YOU CAN DO IT, BUDDY!

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:53.299
YOU STILL GOT
TWO TURNS TO FIGURE OUT

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.935
HOW TO STOP
THIS CARD-SWIPIN' FREAK!

00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.839
I PLAY ONE CARD
FACEDOWN.

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.843
AND I SUMMON ALPHA,
THE MAGNET WARRIOR

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.645
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:12.218
YOU FORGET ABOUT MY
SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.987
YOU CAN'T ATTACK.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.889
I CAN'T...YET!
HUH?

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.024
BUT ONCE I DESTROY
YOUR SWORDS,

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.993
MY MONSTERS
WILL BE LET LOOSE!

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:21.227
YOU WON'T!

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.196
AND REMEMBER,
YOUR DECK HAS
A TRAGIC FLAW.

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:25.465
IT'S CLUTTERED
WITH SO MANY
EXODIA PIECES

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.367
THAT YOU'VE
SQUEEZED OUT ROOM
FOR OTHER CARDS

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:30.170
NEEDED TO PROTECT
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.272
YOU NEED MORE
MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:33.907
TO DESTROY
MY MONSTERS,

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:37.644
BUT ALL YOU HAVE
IN YOUR HAND
ARE EXODIA CARDS.

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:40.580
GRR!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.116
AND TAKE A LOOK
IN FRONT OF YOU,
RARE HUNTER.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:44.784
I'VE ALREADY
DESTROYED

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:47.020
THE ONLY
TWO MONSTERS
YOU SUMMONED,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.155
LEAVING YOU WITHOUT
A SINGLE MONSTER

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.758
TO GUARD AGAINST
A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.526
THE ONLY THING
STOPPING MY MONSTERS

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.794
IS YOUR SWORDS CARD,

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.696
A WEAK AND
TEMPORARY SHIELD.

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.298
ONCE MY MONSTERS
ARE FREE,

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:00.633
I WILL BEGIN
ATTACKING
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.535
GRR-- IMPOSSIBLE!

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.304
YOU'LL NEVER BREAK
FREE FROM MY TRAP

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.805
BEFORE I SUMMON EXODIA

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:08.141
AND OBLITERATE YOU
AND YOUR MONSTERS.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:09.976
IT'S OVER, YUGI!

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:15.548
YOU'VE LEFT YOURSELF
WIDE OPEN

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.150
FOR A DIRECT ATTACK,
HUNTER.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.086
YUGI! TAKE 'IM DOWN!

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:22.755
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'LL SUMMON
EXODIA IN TIME.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.124
YOU FORGET.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.325
YOUR MONSTERS
ARE TRAPPED

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:27.427
IN MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.229
AND IT'S MY TURN!

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.397
I BET IT'S
A DUPLICATE
EXODIA CARD!

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:33.032
IT MAKES
NO DIFFERENCE TO ME!

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:35.068
YOUR LIGHTFORCE SWORD
WILL SOON DISAPPEAR,

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:38.138
ALLOWING ME TO ACCESS
ALL 5 PIECES OF EXODIA

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.939
FOR AN AUTOMATIC WIN!

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.741
BUT NOT SOON ENOUGH!

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:44.244
[THINKING]
HMM. WHAT IF YUGI DOES
DISCOVER SOME TRICK

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:46.713
TO DESTROY MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT?

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:49.449
HIS MONSTERS WILL
DEVASTATE MY LIFE POINTS

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:52.118
UNLESS I BLOCK WITH
A MONSTER OF MY OWN!

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:54.320
YUGI FORGETS THAT EACH
INDIVIDUAL EXODIA PIECE

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.289
IS ALSO A MONSTER CARD,

00:10:56.289 --> 00:11:00.160
SO I CAN DEFEND MYSELF
WITH MY DOUBLE
OF EXODIA'S HEAD!

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.694
I'LL BE PROTECTED
AND STILL HAVE

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.363
THE NECESSARY
CARDS IN MY HAND

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:04.964
TO SUMMON EXODIA!

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.199
HMM.

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:09.435
I SUMMON EXODIA'S HEAD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:12.105
NOW YOU CAN'T STRIKE
MY LIFE POINTS!

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.140
HMM.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.976
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO DO,
RARE HUNTER.

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:20.013
NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO DESTROY EXODIA!

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.247
WHAT?

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:23.550
YOU ACTIVATED
MY TRAP CARD!

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.752
A COSTLY MISTAKE!

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:28.121
CHAIN DESTRUCTION!

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.159
AAH!

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.395
IT STRUCK MY DECK!

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:36.429
WHILE IT
CAN'T DESTROY

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.830
YOUR EXODIA HEAD
ON THE FIELD,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.668
IT CAN DESTROY
THE ONES IN YOUR
HAND AND YOUR DECK!

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.069
OH NO!

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.504
MY EXODIA HEADS--

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:46.239
ARE GONE!

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:51.878
AAH!

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.780
ALL OF YOUR EXODIA
HEADS HAVE BEEN

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.750
ELIMINATED FROM YOUR
HAND AND YOUR DECK.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.586
AND WITH NO HEADS
LEFT TO PLAY,

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.921
YOU CAN NO LONGER
DRAW ALL FIVE PIECES

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:05.291
INTO YOUR HAND
TO SUMMON EXODIA!

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.760
[THINKING]
NO! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.364
HE FOUND A WAY TO STOP
THE UNSTOPPABLE EXODIA!

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.301
AND I'M NOT THROUGH,
RARE HUNTER!

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:19.672
I ALSO FOUND A WAY
AROUND YOUR SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:22.242
ACTIVATE
DUST TORNADO!

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.514
THIS TRAP DESTROYS
ONE MAGIC CARD,

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:31.451
SHATTERING
YOUR SWORDS OF
REVEALING LIGHT.

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:35.355
WHICH ALLOWS
MY MONSTERS
TO ATTACK!

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:38.324
NEXT, I'LL PLAY...
MONSTER REBORN!

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:41.761
REVIVE CHIMERA
THE FLYING
MYTHICAL BEAST!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.263
[ROARS]

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.499
CHIMERA!
DESTROY THE FINAL
EXODIA HEAD!

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.405
AAH!

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:54.574
NOW YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE DEFENSELESS

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.609
AGAINST MY ATTACK.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:00.913
I PLAY ALPHA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR
AND SUMMONED SKULL!

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:02.415
[GROWLS]

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.750
SUMMONED SKULL'S
ELECTRICITY

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.652
RAISES ALPHA'S
MAGNETIC
ATTACK POWER

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:07.787
BY 200 POINTS!

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.722
OHH!

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.224
NOW, MY MONSTERS,

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:14.193
ATTACK
THE RARE HUNTER'S
LIFE POINTS!

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.928
AAH!

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:19.799
UNH!

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.137
YEAH, YUGE! YOU WON!

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:31.344
Mokuba:
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:32.845
YUGI DEFEATED EXODIA.

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.747
HE MAY HAVE
BEATEN EXODIA,

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.550
BUT THERE'S ONE CARD
YUGI WILL NEVER BEAT,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.519
AND I'M THE ONE
HOLDING IT.

00:13:41.354 --> 00:13:43.222
I'M HEADING
TO BATTLE CITY!

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:44.691
HEY, WAIT UP!

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:46.326
I'M COMMISSIONER,
REMEMBER?

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.828
I GOTTA GO AND MAKE SURE
NO ONE ELSE IS CHEATING!

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.831
OH, IF YOU DETECT
A DUELIST USING

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.067
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,
LET US KNOW RIGHT AWAY!

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.068
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:01.307
WAY TO GO, MY MAN!

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:02.675
THANKS, JOEY.

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:06.012
AH, THERE IT IS!

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:09.582
I'M TAKING
JOEY'S RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:11.217
AND YOUR
LOCATOR CARD.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.619
YOU WON'T NEED TO
FIND THE FINALS NOW.

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:16.522
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.025
SOMETHING'S
RUBBING OFF
ON MY FINGERS.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.461
ALL THESE CARDS
ARE MARKED!

00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:22.895
HE WAS A CHEAT!

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.163
NOT ANYMORE!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.301
Rare Hunter:
I LOST...

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.769
I FAILED...

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:32.305
HMM?
FORGIVE ME,
MASTER...

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:34.207
I TRIED MY BEST!

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.943
NO! PLEASE DON'T
BE ANGRY!

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.279
AAH!

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:43.416
NO, MASTER, DON'T!

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:45.685
PLEASE! SPARE ME!

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:48.621
YUGI, THAT WACKO'S
LOST HIS MIND!

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:51.557
I'VE SEEN
THIS BEFORE!

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.360
Yugi, thinking:
THAT'S THE
MILLENNIUM SYMBOL!

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.863
WE MEET AGAIN, PHARAOH!

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:08.274
REMEMBER ME, PHARAOH?

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.977
ACTUALLY,
PERHAPS YOU DON'T.

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:12.445
YOU WERE TRAPPED
IN THE PUZZLE

00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:14.180
WHEN I DUELED
LITTLE YUGI.

00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:17.049
CONGRATULATIONS
ON DEFEATING

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.284
MY RARE HUNTER,

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:20.420
THOUGH HE WAS
THE WEAKEST DUELIST
IN MY CREW.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.823
MY OTHER MINIONS
WILL PROVE MUCH MORE
FORMIDABLE.

00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:25.191
YUGE...

00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.093
WHAT IS WITH
THIS FREAK SHOW?!

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:30.263
PHARAOH, I'VE WAITED
FOR YOU FOR YEARS.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.131
FINALLY, AFTER
ALL THIS TIME,

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:34.367
I WILL DESTROY YOU!

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:36.803
I WILL NOT ALLOW
MY OTHER RARE HUNTERS

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.005
TO FAIL ME
LIKE THIS ONE DID.

00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:41.541
I HAVE LITTLE TIME
FOR HIS KIND
OF FOOLISHNESS,

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.143
SO I HAVE
TAKEN OVER HIS BODY

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.279
AND TRAPPED HIS MIND
IN THE SHADOW REALM.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.648
I AM IN CONTROL!

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:55.655
YEHH! THIS GUY'S
CREEPIN' ME OUT!

00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.323
HOW DO YOU
CONTROL HIM?

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.325
EACH OF
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:02.695
CONTAINS ITS OWN
UNIQUE POWER.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.364
SO MIND CONTROL IS
A SIMPLE TASK

00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:06.999
WITH MY MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:09.435
NO GOOD CAN COME
FROM THAT POWER.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:12.305
THE EVENTS OF THE PAST
WILL OCCUR ONCE AGAIN,

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:16.476
AND THAT SAME GREAT EVIL
WILL RETURN TO THREATEN
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.643
Yugi, thinking:
HE MUST BE
THE GREAT EVIL

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.046
ISHIZU SPOKE ABOUT!

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.215
ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.619
REMEMBER MY NAME...

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:27.787
MARIK!

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:29.722
MARIK?

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.992
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
FROM ME, MARIK?!

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.695
I WANT WHAT
BELONGS TO ME,

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:37.497
AND I'LL TAKE IT
USING THE STRENGTH

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.732
OF THE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS!

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:40.766
EGYPTIAN WHAT?

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.068
MILLENNIA AGO,

00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:44.003
A TRIO
OF POWERFUL BEHEMOTHS

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.739
RAMPAGED THROUGHOUT
ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.407
THESE EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTERS

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:50.443
SPREAD DESTRUCTION
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:53.112
UNTIL THE PHARAOH SEALED
THEM AWAY FOR ETERNITY,

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:55.548
BUT WHEN PEGASUS
CREATED DUEL MONSTERS,

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:57.950
HE RESURRECTED THESE
MIGHTY BEASTS AS CARDS.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.520
WITH THESE EGYPTIAN GODS,
I CAN DESTROY YOU

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.622
AND CLAIM
THE POWER I DESERVE.

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:05.558
YOU'LL NEVER CLAIM
THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE!

00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:07.493
HMM. YOU MISUNDERSTAND.

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:11.130
I WANT MORE THAN
THE POWER OF THE PUZZLE.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.132
I WANT
THE PHARAOH'S POWER,

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:16.969
THE BOUNDLESS ENERGY
OF THE ANCIENT RULER HIMSELF!

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:20.573
WITH IT, NO ONE
WILL STAND IN MY WAY!

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:22.875
I'LL USE THE ALMIGHTY
MAGIC I GAIN

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.912
TO CONQUER
AND LEAD THE WORLD!

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:28.814
I WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE!

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.816
THE END IS NEAR,
PHARAOH!

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:33.352
IT'S MY WORLD NOW.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.021
NOT YET, MARIK!

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:36.889
I'M BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.424
WHY ISHIZU ASKED ME

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.826
TO PARTICIPATE
IN BATTLE CITY.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:43.095
IT'S MY DESTINY
TO STAND BETWEEN YOU

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:45.631
AND THE EVIL POWERS
YOU SEEK!

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.700
AND I WILL!

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.968
THEN YOUR DESTINY

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.970
IS EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, YOU FOOL.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.039
Yugi, thinking:
I CAN'T LET
MARIK WIN,

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:55.908
OR WHO KNOWS WHAT
DARKNESS WILL COME!

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.244
HE MAY POSSESS
THE MAGIC OF
THE MILLENNIUM ROD,

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:00.780
BUT I HAVE
THE STRENGTH
OF MY PUZZLE!

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.216
I HAFTA BEAT HIM,
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:07.320
PHARAOH, YOUR DAYS
ARE NUMBERED,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.890
SO ENJOY THE GAME
WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.492
BECAUSE YOUR REIGN
IS COMING TO AN END!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.662
[GROANS]

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.598
MAN, THAT WAS WEIRD.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.866
I KNEW THAT GUY WAS
A BIG CREEP,

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.668
BUT WHO KNEW
HE WAS JUST A FRONT

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.537
FOR AN EVEN
BIGGER CREEP?

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:25.571
HUH?

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.273
HERE YOU GO, JOEY.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.841
TAKE YOUR
RED-EYES BACK.

00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:32.578
NAH, YUGE.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:33.846
YOU HOLD ON TO IT.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:35.982
IT ISN'T MINE
TO TAKE, PAL.

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:37.717
YOU WON IT
FAIR AND SQUARE.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.920
BESIDES, THE RARE HUNTERS
HAVE COLLECTED

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.254
TONS OF RARE CARDS.

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:44.256
THEIR DECKS ARE
TOTALLY SOUPED UP,

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:46.092
SO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE
GONNA BE TOUGH TO BEAT,

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:47.426
EVEN FOR YOU!

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:49.362
WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING, JOEY?

00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:51.163
I'M SAYIN'...
ONE DAY, YOU'LL NEED

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.965
ALL THE POWERFUL
MONSTERS YOU CAN GET.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.967
PLUS, YOU CAN THINK OF ME
WHENEVER YOU PLAY MY RED-EYES!

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.969
IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO TO REPAY YA.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.105
SEE, DURIN'
THE DUELIST KINGDOM
TOURNAMENT,

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.240
YOU TAUGHT ME RULES,
KILLER STRATEGIES,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.109
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT I NEEDED TO KNOW

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:05.044
TO HELP ME GET
TO THE FINALS!

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.482
I COULDN'T A DONE IT
WITHOUT YA HELP.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.283
THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS DO.

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.519
DAT'S MY POINT
EXACTLY, BUDDY.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.920
YOU'VE ALWAYS
HAD MY BACK,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.423
SO IT'S TIME
I HELPED YOU
FOR A CHANGE!

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:20.726
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO KEEP MY RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON!

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:23.562
I KNOW IT'S GONNA
COME IN HANDY
FOR YA SOMETIME.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.699
BESIDES, THIS MEANS
THAT A PART OF ME

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:28.901
WILL BE A PART
OF YOUR DECK.

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:32.204
IT'S KINDA COOL KNOWIN'
THAT I'M HELPIN' YA

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.573
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.208
AND I STILL HAVE

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:38.477
THE RARE CARD
REQUIREMENT COVERED.

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.647
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I GUESS TECHNICALLY

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.449
YOU HAVE IT COVERED,
YUGI!

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:44.650
HMM?

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.252
SEE, RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:48.654
WASN'T THE ONLY RARE CARD
I HAD IN MY DECK!

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.289
YOU GAVE ME
ANOTHER RARE CARD

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.324
WAY BACK WHEN
I FIRST STARTED
PLAYIN' DUEL MONSTERS.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.459
REMEMBER?

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:54.760
THE TIME WIZARD!

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.063
YEP. IT BAILED ME
OUTTA JAMS AT
DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:59.932
AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA SAVE
MY BUTT IN BATTLE CITY!

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.169
YOU KNOW, WHEN YA
THINK ABOUT IT, YUGE,

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:05.738
BOTH OF OUR HEARTS
ARE IN OUR DECKS.

00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:07.006
WE'RE A TEAM!

00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:09.408
TOGETHER, WE WON'T LET
ANY DUELISTS BEAT US!

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.077
IT'S TRUE!

00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:12.511
WE'LL WHOOP

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:14.380
AND HIS RARE HUNTER
GOON-SQUAD SO HARD,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.848
THEY WON'T KNOW

00:20:15.848 --> 00:20:18.784
THEY'LL BE SORRY
THEY EVER DECIDED
TO MESS WITH US!

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.686
HMM.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.154

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.500
AND TOGETHER
WE CAN TAKE ON

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.236
ANY EVIL
THAT COMES OUR WAY.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.138

THE RARE HUNTERS HAVE BECOME
