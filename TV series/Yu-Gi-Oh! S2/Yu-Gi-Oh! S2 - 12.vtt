Yami Yugi:

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.385
HA HA HA!

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.187
WELCOME, YUGI MOTO.

00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:10.256
I AM THE ILLUSIONIST
ARKANA.

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:13.125
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO DUEL, ARKANA.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.028
THE WINNER WILL
TAKE THE LOSER'S
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.563
GET READY!
THE SHOW

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:18.964
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:19.999
UNH!

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.333
BRACE YOURSELF...

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.568
WHAT'S THAT?

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:24.270
IT'S A DARK ENERGY DISC.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.473
ONE TOUCH AND YOUR
MIND'S BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM!!

00:00:27.473 --> 00:00:28.908
DARK MAGICIAN...

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:30.676
SHOW HIM
SOME <i>REAL</i> MAGIC!

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:35.281
Arkana: THAT WAS JUST
THE OPENING ACT, YUGI!

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.883
BEFORE THIS SHOW'S OVER
<i>YOUR</i> MIND WILL BE TRAPPED

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.319
IN THE SHADOW REALM
<i>FOREVER!!</i>

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.387

AND END THIS
MADNESS, ARKANA!?

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:51.190
MY DARK MAGICIAN
HAS ALREADY
TAKEN OUT

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.158
MORE THAN <i>HALF</i>
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:54.326
ONE MORE ATTACK

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:55.561
AND THAT
DARK ENERGY DISC

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:57.696
WILL SEND
YOUR MIND RIGHT
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:01:57.696 --> 00:01:59.231
HA HA HA!

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:01.567

[GRR]

00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:06.472
LISTEN, YUGI,
I PROMISED YOU
A SPECTACLE...

00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:08.774
AND I NEVER DISAPPOINT.

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.042
NOT ONLY WILL I WIN,
I'LL TAKE YOUR

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.844
PRECIOUS DARK MAGICIAN
FROM YOU

00:02:11.844 --> 00:02:14.246
AND SEND YOU
TO MENTAL OBLIVION!

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:16.115
[THINKING]
YUGI OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T KNOW

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.017
A MASTER MAGICIAN'S
FIRST RULE:

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.086
<i> ALWAYS</i> SAVE
THE BEST TRICK
FOR THE FINALE!

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:23.188
YOU SHOULD STOP
WORRYING ABOUT ME

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:25.758
AND TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, YUGI!

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:27.593
IT'S <i>MY</i> SHOW,
REMEMBER,

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:28.594
I <i>CAN'T</i> LOSE.

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:30.696
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO SAVE YOURSELF,

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:33.065
BUT YOU'VE LEFT ME
WITH NO CHOICE...

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:35.334
PREPARE TO LOSE
IT ALL, ARKANA!

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:39.805
Tea: I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.240
WHAT HAPPENED TO YUGI?!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.374
HMM.

00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:45.577
HE MUST HAVE FALLEN
INTO A TRAP DOOR.

00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:47.212
YEAH, BUT WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:49.548
IS WHERE THAT TRAP DOOR
MAY HAVE LED HIM!

00:02:49.548 --> 00:02:51.617
WE'VE JUST GOTTA
FIND HIM!

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:53.519
YES AND WE'LL CHECK
EVERY SQUARE INCH

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.488
OF BATTLE CITY
UNTIL WE DO!

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:59.291
NO ONE WILL EVER
FIND US HERE,

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.327
SO YOU'LL BE ALONE
WHEN YOU LOSE IT ALL!

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:03.629
[THINKING]
HMMM. I'VE GOT TO
DEFEND MYSELF

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.032
FROM ANOTHER DIRECT ATTACK
BY YUGI'S DARK MAGICIAN

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.168
OR IT'LL BE
CURTAINS FOR ME.

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:10.269
THIS'LL DO.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.603
MYSTIC TOMATO

00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:13.205
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.279
AND I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.248
LET'S GET ON
WITH THE SHOW!

00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:26.218
Yugi, thinking:
ARKANA'S MYSTIC TOMATO
IS A WEAK DEFENSE.

00:03:26.218 --> 00:03:28.487
IF I SUMMON
ANOTHER MONSTER
AND DESTROY IT,

00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:29.955
I CAN MOUNT
AN ATTACK
ON HIS LIFE POINTS

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:31.623
AND WIN THIS DUEL!

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:33.025
[THINKING]
TAKE THE BAIT, YUGI!

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:35.094
I <i>KNOW</i> YOU WANT TO SUMMON
ANOTHER MONSTER,

00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:36.261
AND WHEN YOU DO,

00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:38.063
I'LL HAVE
A SURPRISE WAITING!

00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:39.798
HERE'S WHERE
IT ENDS!

00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:46.805
I SUMMON BETA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:48.140
ATTACK NOW!

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.708
NOT SO FAST, YUGI!

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.377
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO!?

00:03:51.377 --> 00:03:52.544
AHHHHHH!

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:54.213
YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY TRAP!

00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:55.948
DARK RENEWAL.

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:03.989
IT TAKES A MONSTER
FROM EACH PLAYER

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.058
AND SENDS THEM
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:08.093
BUT IN RETURN,
IT BRINGS <i>BACK</i>
ONE MONSTER

00:04:08.093 --> 00:04:10.229
THAT'S BEEN LOST
BY THE CARDHOLDER.

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.398
IN THIS CASE,
THAT MEANS ME!

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:15.234
HA HA HA!

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:17.569
YOU WANT YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN BACK!

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.038
VERY PERCEPTIVE!

00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:20.572
THAT WILL GIVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.342
TO ANNIHILATE YOU!
HA HA HA!

00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:26.645
WELCOME BACK,
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:04:40.592 --> 00:04:41.894
YOU HAVE YOUR WISH.

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:44.596
IT'S DARK MAGICIAN
VERSUS DARK MAGICIAN.

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:46.999
LET'S FIND OUT WHO
THE <i>REAL</i> MASTER IS.

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.735
OUR MONSTERS' POINTS
ARE IDENTICAL.

00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:51.570
SO MERELY ATTACKING
WON'T BE ENOUGH.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.505
YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK
MORE STRATEGICALLY.

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:55.974
AND ONLY A TRUE
ILLUSIONIST LIKE MYSELF

00:04:55.974 --> 00:04:58.644
CAN MASTER THE POWER
OF A DARK MAGICIAN!

00:04:58.644 --> 00:05:02.214
PREPARE TO LOSE YOUR CARD,
AND YOUR MIND!

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:05.381
THINK AGAIN...

00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.616
NOW I'LL PLACE
THESE TWO CARDS
ON THE FIELD...

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.051
FACEDOWN.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.221
AND END MY TURN.

00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:13.822
[THINKING]
THIS SHOW WILL HAVE
MORE TWISTS

00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:15.691
THAN YUGI EXPECTS.

00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:17.960
I'LL MATCH HIM
MOVE FOR MOVE!

00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:22.298
TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME.

00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:24.466
...I'LL <i>ALSO</i> PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:26.535
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.370
I'LL SHOW YOU.

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:32.942
I'LL PLACE ONE MORE
CARD FACEDOWN.

00:05:32.942 --> 00:05:34.777
BRILLIANT MOVE, YUGI.

00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:39.348
SO <i>I'LL</i> PLACE
ONE MORE CARD
FACEDOWN AS WELL.

00:05:39.348 --> 00:05:41.717
I WILL PLACE
MY LAST.

00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:44.219
AND SO WILL I.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.223
HA! WE EACH HAVE
FOUR CARDS FACEDOWN
AND ONE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:51.927
AND NOW, LET'S SEE
WHO PICKED THE BEST
DUELING STRATEGY!

00:05:51.927 --> 00:05:54.029
I'LL PLAY A MAGIC CARD...

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.765
THE MYSTICAL GUILLOTINE.

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:02.905
SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN, YUGI!

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.606
I WON'T LET YOU
DESTROY HIM!

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:05.741
HA HA HA!

00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:08.577
AS IF YOU HAD A CHOICE!?

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.747
MY DARK MAGICIAN!
NOOOOOO!

00:06:13.882 --> 00:06:15.918
I'M AFRAID IT'S TRUE.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:18.554
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN'S
ABOUT TO BE CUT
FROM THE SHOW,

00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:21.390
AND YOUR <i>MIND</i> WILL BE
TRAPPED IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.926
HA HA HA!

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:31.233
Arkana: IT'S TIME
FOR THE GRAND FINALE!

00:06:31.233 --> 00:06:33.035
NOT YET, ARKANA!!

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:34.603
SORRY BUT
THE SHOW'S OVER

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:36.438
AND THE CURTAIN
MUST NOW FALL!

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:39.041
RIGHT ON YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.810
I'M AFRAID THAT
YOU'LL HAVE TO
<i>FIND</i> HIM FIRST...

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.580
GO, MAGICAL HATS!

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.581
NO!

00:06:50.152 --> 00:06:51.720
NOW YOU'LL
HAVE TO GUESS

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.089
WHICH HAT HE'S UNDER
TO ATTACK HIM!

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:55.858
DON'T BE SO SURE
OF THAT.

00:06:55.858 --> 00:06:58.861
A THOUSAND KNIVES!!

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.032
THESE MAGIC DAGGERS

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:07.169
WILL DETECT AND DESTROY
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN!

00:07:08.203 --> 00:07:09.638
IT'S ALL OVER!

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:11.206
HOLD ON, ARKANA!

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:14.610
I'LL RESCUE HIM
WITH CURSEBREAKER!

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.880
IT CANCELS OUT ALL
OTHER MAGIC CARDS!

00:07:19.848 --> 00:07:21.517
DESTROYING MY
DARK MAGICIAN

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:23.385
WON'T BE EASY,
ARKANA.

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:25.254
WELL WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT!

00:07:25.254 --> 00:07:26.388
Both:
DARK MAGICIAN...

00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:28.590
ATTACK
WITH DARK MAGIC NOW!

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.926
THEY'LL DESTROY
EACH OTHER!

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.531
AND NOW MY DARK MAGICIAN
WILL RETURN!

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.268
MONSTER REBORN!

00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:45.974
LOOKS LIKE, WE'RE BACK
TO WHERE WE STARTED.

00:07:45.974 --> 00:07:47.976
YES, A STALEMATE.

00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:49.678
WHY DON'T
YOU UNLOCK US
FROM THESE SHACKLES

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:52.047
AND FINISH THIS DUEL
WITH HONOR.

00:07:52.047 --> 00:07:53.215
WITH HONOR!?

00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:55.584
AND RUIN ALL THE FUN?
NEVER!

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.387
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

00:07:58.387 --> 00:07:59.822
BUT ANSWER THIS...

00:07:59.822 --> 00:08:02.624
WHY DID YOU LEAD ME
DOWN HERE, ARKANA?...

00:08:02.624 --> 00:08:04.793
AND WHY DID YOU
FORCE ME INTO A DUEL

00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:06.161
IN WHICH
THE LOSER'S MIND

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:08.297
GETS SENT INTO
THE SHADOW REALM?

00:08:08.297 --> 00:08:12.367
I'M JUST FOLLOWING
THE ORDERS OF MY MASTER.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.402
ENOUGH SECRETS,
ARKANA!

00:08:13.402 --> 00:08:15.871
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:17.739
LOOK AT MY FACE.

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:19.108
OHH!

00:08:19.108 --> 00:08:21.577
ONCE, I WAS THE GREATEST
ILLUSIONIST AND MAGICIAN

00:08:21.577 --> 00:08:24.713
SINCE HARRY HOUDINI
HIMSELF...

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:28.317
Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE GREAT ARKANA!

00:08:28.317 --> 00:08:31.487

AND WE'LL FOLLOW YOU!

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.027
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:29.164
NOW, I'LL SUMMON
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:16:29.164 --> 00:16:30.532
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:38.139
Yugi, thinking:
I'VE GOT TO PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS!

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:40.976
LOOK AT YOU, COWERING
BEHIND YOUR MONSTER,

00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:42.344
DESPERATELY TRYING
TO PUT OFF

00:16:42.344 --> 00:16:43.979
YOUR INEVITABLE DEFEAT

00:16:43.979 --> 00:16:46.982
AT THE HANDS
OF <i>MY</i> MIGHTY
DARK MAGICIAN.

00:16:46.982 --> 00:16:49.184
I'M AFRAID THAT DEFENSE
WON'T HELP YOU.

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:52.020
AFTER MY NEXT TURN,
YOU LIFE POINTS
WILL BE ZERO...

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.855
...I PROMISE YOU.

00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:55.156
OHH!

00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:57.225
NOW, IF YOU ARE DONE
WITH YOUR TURN...

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.027
IT'S TIME
FOR <i>MY</i> NEXT MOVE.

00:16:59.027 --> 00:17:00.629
[SIGHS]

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:03.031
I WILL...
ALSO SUMMON A MONSTER...

00:17:03.031 --> 00:17:05.200
SAY HELLO...

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.002
....TO THE DOLL
OF DEMISE!

00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:08.637
HA HA HA!

00:17:08.637 --> 00:17:11.172
AND NOW, YUGI,
BEHOLD THE MAGIC CARD

00:17:11.172 --> 00:17:12.907
THAT WILL ANNIHILATE YOU!

00:17:14.442 --> 00:17:18.346
I PLAY ECTOPLASMER!

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:20.949
CONFUSED, YUGI?

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:23.184
ALLOW ME TO
EXPLAIN IT FOR YOU.

00:17:23.184 --> 00:17:24.953
ECTOPLASMER IS
A MAGIC CARD

00:17:24.953 --> 00:17:26.454
THAT DRAINS
THE VERY SOUL

00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:28.156
OF ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:30.525
CREATING A PURE
CONCENTRATED
FORM OF ENERGY

00:17:30.525 --> 00:17:32.427
KNOWN AS ECTOPLASM...

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.929
WHICH IS THEN FIRED
DIRECTLY AT YOU!

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.733
WHAT? IF YOU TURN
YOUR OWN MONSTERS
INTO HOLLOW SHELLS,

00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:40.301
THEY'LL BE
OF NO USE!

00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:43.038
HA HA HA!
MAYBE SO...

00:17:43.038 --> 00:17:44.406
BUT ONCE I'VE
DESTROYED YOU,

00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:47.776
I'LL HAVE NO MORE USE
FOR THEM ANYWAY.

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.644
THEN MY TASK
WILL BE COMPLETE,

00:17:49.644 --> 00:17:53.114
AND I'LL BE REUNITED
WITH MY SWEET CATHERINE!

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.850
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
CATHERINE, MY DARLING?

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.953
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES,
THEN WE'RE OFF TO HAWAII

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.623
OR TAHITI OR WHEREVER
YOU'D LIKE...

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.925
SAY GOOD-BYE, YUGI...

00:18:03.925 --> 00:18:05.860
I'M ABOUT TO DRAIN
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.563
BY DRAINING ONE
OF MY MONSTER'S
SOULS AWAY!

00:18:08.563 --> 00:18:09.964
[GRR]

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.867
EXTRACT ECTOPLASM!

00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:16.571
ATTACK NOW!

00:18:16.571 --> 00:18:17.739
OHH!

00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:19.407
UNH!

00:18:19.407 --> 00:18:20.542
OHH!

00:18:27.515 --> 00:18:28.783
Yugi, thinking:
ONE MORE HIT
AND MY LIFE POINTS

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:31.820
WILL GO
DOWN TO ZERO!

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.855
YOU PLAYED WELL, YUGI,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:36.791
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU AND YOUR BELOVED
DARK MAGICIAN

00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:38.193
COULDN'T BEAT ME?

00:18:38.193 --> 00:18:40.195
YOU'RE TOO SOFT.

00:18:40.195 --> 00:18:43.465
IN BATTLE, MONSTERS
RESPOND BEST TO FEAR...

00:18:43.465 --> 00:18:46.701
YOU HAVE TO MAKE CERTAIN
THAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF YOU.

00:18:46.701 --> 00:18:50.205
YOU WILL NEVER
COMMAND THEIR RESPECT
WITH KINDNESS AND TRUST.

00:18:50.205 --> 00:18:55.810
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FAVORITE CARD,
THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.145
<i>YOU</i> ARE THE MASTER.

00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:58.279
<i>THEY</i> ARE THE SERVANTS,

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:00.582
AND THEY SHOULD ENSURE
VICTORY FOR YOU

00:19:00.582 --> 00:19:03.718
EVEN IF IT MEANS YOU
HAVE TO DESTROY THEM
TO GET THERE!

00:19:03.718 --> 00:19:05.286
YOU'RE A SICK MAN!

00:19:05.286 --> 00:19:07.722
HMM. IT'S <i>MY</i> SHOW,

00:19:07.722 --> 00:19:11.159
AND <i>MY</i> DARK MAGICIAN
KNOWS THAT I AM HIS MASTER.

00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:13.528
HE IS NOTHING
BUT MY PAWN.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:16.464
NOW, THE GRAND FINALE!

00:19:16.464 --> 00:19:19.534
ACTIVATE ECTOPLASMER!

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:23.138
EXTRACT THE SOUL
OF MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:25.006 --> 00:19:28.176
STOP NOW! THIS DUEL
HAS ALREADY GONE
WAY TOO FAR.

00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:30.078
NOT WHEN I'M
ABOUT TO WIN!

00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:32.547
FIRE THE ECTOPLASM!!

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:35.150
OHH!

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.218
GOOD-BYE, YUGI!

00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:40.522
AAH!

00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:42.357
WHAT'S HAPPENING!?

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:48.396
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.365
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:57.005
[GRUNTING]

00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.373
AAH!

00:19:58.373 --> 00:19:59.908
THE SOUL OF <i>YUGI'S</i>
DARK MAGICIAN

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:01.376
WAS ALSO DRAINED

00:20:01.376 --> 00:20:03.378
AND SEEMS TO BE
BLOCKING MY ATTACK!

00:20:03.378 --> 00:20:06.181
THEY'LL BOTH
BE DESTROYED!

00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:11.019
AAH!

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:12.687
IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR PLAN

00:20:12.687 --> 00:20:15.023
TO DESTROY ME
BACKFIRED!

00:20:15.023 --> 00:20:18.893
YOU'RE SO BUSY
DISRESPECTING
YOUR CARDS, ARKANA,

00:20:18.893 --> 00:20:20.094
THAT YOU
FAIL TO LEARN

00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:21.996
HOW TO USE THEM
PROPERLY.

00:20:21.996 --> 00:20:23.898
WHILE IT
IS TRUE THAT
YOUR ECTOPLASMER

00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:25.600
DRAINS
YOUR MONSTER'S SOUL

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.069
AND FIRES
THAT ENERGY
AT YOUR OPPONENT,

00:20:28.069 --> 00:20:30.104
WHAT YOU OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T REALIZE

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.306
IS THAT WHEN THERE'S
MORE THAN ONE

00:20:31.306 --> 00:20:33.308
OF THE SAME MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:20:33.308 --> 00:20:35.977
THEY'RE ALL AFFECTED
IN THE SAME WAY.

00:20:35.977 --> 00:20:38.012
SO MY DARK MAGICIAN
WAS DRAINED

00:20:38.012 --> 00:20:40.148
OF HIS SOUL ALSO,

00:20:40.148 --> 00:20:42.917
CANCELING OUT
YOUR ATTACK, ARKANA!

00:20:42.917 --> 00:20:44.485
YOU MAY HAVE
AVOIDED THAT ONE,

00:20:44.485 --> 00:20:46.187
BUT YOU'RE STILL
ONE ATTACK AWAY

00:20:46.187 --> 00:20:49.824
