ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN
HOW SLIFER WORKS.

00:06:26.477 --> 00:06:29.247
THE NUMBER OF CARDS
I HOLD IN MY HAND...

00:06:29.247 --> 00:06:31.816
DETERMINES WHAT
SLIFER'S ATTACK POWER
WILL BE.

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:33.117
AND SINCE
I HOLD TWO CARDS,

00:06:33.117 --> 00:06:35.420
IT HAS 2000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.423
I'M AFRAID SLIFER
IS STILL WEAKER
THAN <i>MY</i> MONSTER.

00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:40.725
BUT THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING...

00:06:40.725 --> 00:06:42.860
ALL THANKS
TO MY MAGIC CARD.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.030

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.233
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME
TO DRAW TWO <i>NEW</i> CARDS.

00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:51.402
GREED IS GOOD.

00:06:51.402 --> 00:06:53.972
I LOST ONE CARD
BUT GAINED TWO,

00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:55.773
GIVING ME A TOTAL
OF 3 CARDS...

00:06:55.773 --> 00:06:59.344
AND SLIFER A TOTAL
OF 3000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:00.878
BUT IN DUEL MONSTERS,

00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:03.514
THERE'S A LIMIT
TO HOW MANY CARDS
A PLAYER CAN HOLD,

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:07.318
SO SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
HAS A <i>LIMIT</i>

OF THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE
OF AN EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTER

00:07:16.027 --> 00:07:20.531
BECAUSE HE HAS NO MEMORY
OF THE DAYS WHEN THEY
DEVASTATED THE EARTH!

00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.968
BUT HE'LL LEARN
ABOUT SLIFER'S POWER
THE HARD WAY

00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:25.069
SINCE I HAVE JUST THE CARDS

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.639
TO GIVE MY SKY DRAGON
INFINITE STRENGTH!

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:32.343
I'M AFRAID ANY HOPES
YOU HAVE OF SURVIVAL
ARE COMPLETELY IN VAIN,

00:07:32.343 --> 00:07:36.848
FOR NO ONE HAS EVER DEFEATED
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:07:36.848 --> 00:07:37.849

SLIFER WILL WIPE YOU OUT
WITH ONE SINGLE ATTACK!

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.887
THEN I'LL TAKE YOUR PUZZLE

00:07:42.887 --> 00:07:45.957
AND SEND YOU TO A PLACE

00:07:45.957 --> 00:07:47.759

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.896
HA HA HA!

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:52.997
Yugi, thinking:
I GOT TO
FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:54.399
TO BRING DOWN
MARIK'S DRAGON!!

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.666
HMM.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.435
MY BUSTER BLADER
RECEIVES
500 ATTACK POINTS

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.270
FOR EVERY DRAGON
ON THE FIELD,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.406
SO RIGHT NOW,
<i>MY</i> MONSTER IS STRONGER

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:02.807
THAN HIS SKY DRAGON.

00:08:02.807 --> 00:08:04.642
WITH 3100 ATTACK POINTS,

00:08:04.642 --> 00:08:06.878
MY SWORDSMAN WOULD
SLAY MARIK'S DRAGON

00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:08.579
WITH ONE SWIPE
OF HIS LANCE.

00:08:10.882 --> 00:08:11.949
BUT AS LONG AS
I'M IN THIS CAGE,

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:13.384
I <i>CAN'T</i> ATTACK.

00:08:13.384 --> 00:08:14.585
AND BY THE TIME
I <i>CAN</i> ATTACK,

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:17.288
HIS MONSTER
MAY BE TOO STRONG!

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:19.624
YOU SEE?

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.526
MY SKY DRAGON WILL
ONLY GET STRONGER

00:08:21.526 --> 00:08:23.294
AS I DRAW MORE CARDS.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.495
HA HA HA!

00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:26.831
SO WHEN I DRAW
IN MY NEXT TURN...

00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:29.567
SLIFER WILL HAVE
4000 ATTACK POINTS,

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:32.036
MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO ANNIHILATE
YOUR BUSTER BLADER

00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:34.839
AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGE
YOUR LIFE POINTS...

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:37.108
THEN SOON ENOUGH,
YOU'LL BE OUT OF MY WAY.

00:08:37.108 --> 00:08:38.109
[GROWLS]

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.612
YOUR REIGN IS OVER,
YAMI!

00:08:41.612 --> 00:08:44.215
HAND OVER THAT PUZZLE
AND ACCEPT THE INEVITABLE!

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:45.817
HA HA HA!

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.452
NEVER.

00:08:47.452 --> 00:08:49.087
I'LL TRUST MY DECK...

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.957
Yugi, thinking:
<i>THIS</i> CARD MAY BE
ABLE TO HELP.

00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:54.826
BUT I'M STILL TRAPPED
FOR ONE MORE TURN.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.160
IF I CAN HANG ON
UNTIL THEN,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.896
MAYBE I CAN TURN
THIS DUEL AROUND.

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:00.965
I JUST HAVE TO
TRUST THE HEART
OF THE CARDS.

00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:03.067
Yami-Yugi:
THIS DUEL IS
FAR FROM OVER, MARIK.

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:04.202
HOW SAD.

00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:05.503
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.105
JUST EMBRACE IT.

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:10.007
YOU'VE HAD YOUR CHANCE
TO BE PHARAOH, YAMI.

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:13.177
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO TAKE OVER
AND RULE THE WORLD.

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:14.479
HA HA HA!

00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:16.047
Yugi, thinking:
NOT IF I CAN
HELP IT, MARIK.

00:09:16.047 --> 00:09:17.849
IT'S MY DESTINY
TO STOP YOU!

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:18.916
I'LL PLACE...

00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:22.120
THESE TWO CARDS
FACE DOWN!

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.388
AND I SUMMON KURIBOH
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:27.892
MAKE YOUR MOVE,
MARIK.

00:09:27.892 --> 00:09:30.828
YES! THE MOMENT
HAS NOW ARRIVED!

00:09:30.828 --> 00:09:32.063
HA HA HA!

00:09:32.063 --> 00:09:35.233
PREPARE TO FEEL THE WRATH
OF AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.969
THE STEELCAGE
IS EVAPORATING,

00:09:37.969 --> 00:09:41.672
LEAVING YOU WIDE OPEN
FOR ANNIHILATION!

00:09:41.672 --> 00:09:44.008
YOU ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS
AN ANCIENT FORCE

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:47.411
SO MIGHTY IT ALMOST
DESTROYED THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:09:47.411 --> 00:09:48.713
HA HA HA!

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:56.215
Marik:
YOU ARE POWERLESS
AGAINST SLIFER!

00:09:56.215 --> 00:09:58.050
LET'S END THIS!

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.185
I DRAW!

00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:01.554
AND SINCE SLIFER GETS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:03.656
FOR EVERY CARD
IN MY HAND,

00:10:03.656 --> 00:10:05.224
NOW IT'S UP TO
<i>4,000!</i>

00:10:05.224 --> 00:10:08.160
ENOUGH TO INCINERATE
YOUR BUSTER BLADER!!

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.462
[ROARS]

00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:11.931
AND NOW,
MY EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTER,

00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:13.933
ATTAAAACK!

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:15.201
[GROWLING]

00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:20.272
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
MY TRAP CARD!

00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:21.273
TRAP CARD!?

00:10:21.273 --> 00:10:23.376
MY LIGHTFORCE SWORD!

00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:24.610
THIS TRAP CARD
ALLOWS ME

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.712
TO SLASH ONE CARD
OUT OF YOUR HAND

00:10:26.712 --> 00:10:28.347
FOR THE DURATION
OF THE TURN!

00:10:29.849 --> 00:10:31.083
Marik, thinking:
NOOOO!

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:32.685
WHICH LOWERS
YOUR DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:10:32.685 --> 00:10:34.387
BACK TO 3000,

00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:36.555
MAKING IT <i>WEAKER</i>
THAN MY MONSTER!

00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:37.857
NOW, BUSTER BLADER,

00:10:37.857 --> 00:10:41.360
SWING YOUR MIGHTY SWORD
AND SLAY HIS DRAGON!

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.265
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS DEFEATED.

00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:49.802
HUH!

00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:51.671
Strings: NOT EXACTLY!

00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:54.807
YOU FORGOT MY JAM DEFENDER
IS STILL IN PLAY,

00:10:54.807 --> 00:10:56.108
WHICH MEANS MY REVIVAL JAM

00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:58.277
WILL INTERCEPT
ALL YOUR ATTACKS...

00:11:00.446 --> 00:11:02.048
AND FROM NOW ON,

00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:04.717
<i>THIS</i> MAGIC CARD
WILL ALSO BE IN PLAY.

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:06.686
CARD OF SAFE RETURN!

00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:08.654
CARD OF SAFE RETURN?

00:11:08.654 --> 00:11:09.822
YES.

00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:12.658
THIS RARE MAGIC CARD
LETS ME DRAW 3 NEW CARDS

00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:15.995
EVERY TIME MY JAM DEFENDER
REFORMS ITSELF.

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:18.497
THIS BRINGS THE CARDS
IN MY HAND UP TO <i>5,</i>

00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:20.399
GIVING SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:23.335
A GRAND TOTAL OF
<i>5,000</i> ATTACK POINTS
SO FAR!

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.938
5,000 POINTS?!

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:26.972
NOW WHAT?!

00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:29.909
HUH?

00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:31.210
EH.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.411
Tristan:
YOU SHOULDA
CHALLENGED <i>HIM.</i>

00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:34.580
YOU WOULDA
DESTROYED 'IM
1, 2, 3.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.715
C'MON!

00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:36.782
YOU'RE JUST TWO
LOCATOR CARDS AWAY

00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:38.117
FROM THE FINALS!

00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:39.585
HE WAS A <i>LIGHT</i> WEIGHT.

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:40.686
HUH?

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:42.688
I GOT A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD OVA HERE.

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:45.124
I CAN'T GO DUELING
EVERY INEXPERIENCED
CHUMP I SEE!

00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:46.192
WHAAAT?

00:11:46.192 --> 00:11:47.460
YOU'RE OUTTA
YOUR MIND, JOEY.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.828
DUDE, I DON'T CARE
IF THAT GUY

00:11:48.828 --> 00:11:50.730
COULDN'T EVEN PLAY
GO FISH!

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.399
HIS LOCATOR CARDS
ARE JUST AS GOOD
AS ANYONE ELSE'S,

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.567
AND YOU
NEED 'EM NOW!

00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:55.634
LOOK, TRISTAN,

00:11:55.634 --> 00:11:57.369
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW IT FEELS.

00:11:57.369 --> 00:11:59.772
I CAME IN SECOND PLACE
IN DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:01.474
DAT PUTS ALOTTA
PRESSURE ON ME

00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:03.476
TA KICK SOME
SERIOUS KEISTER
IN <i>DIS</i> TOURNAMENT.

00:12:03.476 --> 00:12:05.144
NO ONE'S GONNA CLAIM
JOEY WHEELER

00:12:05.144 --> 00:12:06.445
DID IT THE <i>EASY</i> WAY.

00:12:06.445 --> 00:12:07.446
HUH?
HMM?

00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:10.049
PLUS AFTER DA WAY
I BEEN DUELIN' LATELY,

00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:12.351
I KNOW I'M READY
TO TAKE ON ANYONE
IN BATTLE CITY,

00:12:12.351 --> 00:12:13.552
AND I MEAN <i>ANYONE!!</i>

00:12:13.552 --> 00:12:14.687
WELL...

00:12:14.687 --> 00:12:15.988
IT'S TRUE
YOUR DUELING SKILLS

00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:17.656
<i>HAVE</i> IMPROVED
QUITE A BIT...

00:12:17.656 --> 00:12:20.526
ESPECIALLY DURING
YOUR <i>LAST</i> TWO DUELS.

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:23.662
BUT BESIDES
HAVING CONFIDENCE
IN ONESELF, JOEY,

00:12:23.662 --> 00:12:25.297
BEING A GREAT DUELIST
MEANS KNOWING

00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:26.899
THAT THERE'S ALWAYS
MORE TO LEARN...

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:27.967
HUH?

00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:30.469
Kaiba: WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

00:12:30.469 --> 00:12:32.471
HUH?
Tea: KAIBA!

00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.273
WHY IS A COMPLETE
AMATEUR LIKE YOU

00:12:34.273 --> 00:12:36.909
WEARING ONE OF
MY DUEL DISCS, WHEELER?

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:38.110
AMATEUR!?

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.945
I'M GOIN' TO DA TOP!

00:12:39.945 --> 00:12:43.449
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
SCREWED UP AT REGISTRATION.

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:45.284
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU
LATER.

00:12:45.284 --> 00:12:46.385
COME ON, MOKUBA.

00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:47.486
HUH?

00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:49.555
Kaiba: WE'VE WASTED
ENOUGH TIME HERE.

00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:52.825
TRISTAN, I THINK
I FEEL A <i>CHALLENGE</i>
COMING ON HERE.

00:12:52.825 --> 00:12:54.126
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SAVE KAIBA

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:55.427
FOR THE FINALS,
JOEY.

00:12:55.427 --> 00:12:58.264
Joey: KAIBA!
YOU WANNA PIECE'A ME?

00:13:00.566 --> 00:13:02.368
GRR.
JOEY...

00:13:02.368 --> 00:13:03.836
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RETHINK THIS.

00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:09.008
<i>NOBODY</i> DISSES ME
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.

00:13:09.008 --> 00:13:11.143
JOEY, YOU'RE AN OK
DUELIST AND ALL,

00:13:11.143 --> 00:13:12.178
BUT PLAYING
AGAINST YOU

00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:13.546
WOULD BE
A COMPLETE WASTE

00:13:13.546 --> 00:13:14.814
OF MY BIG BROTHER'S
TIME.

00:13:14.814 --> 00:13:15.848
Kaiba:
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:16.849
HUH?

00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:21.353
HUH!
LET'S ROCK'N'ROLL!

00:13:21.353 --> 00:13:22.788
Kaiba: YOU FOOL.

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:24.456
LOOKS LIKE I'LL
HAVE TO TEACH YOU
TO BEHAVE...

00:13:24.456 --> 00:13:26.826
JUST LIKE
THE DOG YOU ARE.

00:13:35.462 --> 00:13:36.796
KAIBA!
YOU'RE TOAST!

00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:37.964
HAH!

00:13:37.964 --> 00:13:41.334
AH! WHAT'S WIT
ALL DIS WIND, HAH?!

00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:42.335
AHHHHH!

00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:43.336
IT'S A TWISTER!

00:13:46.072 --> 00:13:47.974
YOUR CHOPPER!

00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:49.342
Pilot on radio:
MR. KAIBA.

00:13:49.342 --> 00:13:52.545
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WAS PLAYED EXACTLY
5 MINUTES AGO!

00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:54.214
WE'LL FLY YOU TO IT!

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:57.050
QUIT STALLIN'!

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.418
THERE'S DUELING
TO BE DONE!

00:13:58.418 --> 00:14:00.186
HAH!

00:14:00.186 --> 00:14:01.988
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY!

00:14:01.988 --> 00:14:03.423
HUH?

00:14:03.423 --> 00:14:04.491
WHAT?

00:14:04.491 --> 00:14:05.692
LATER, JOEY!

00:14:05.692 --> 00:14:08.194
WE GOT A DATE
WITH AN EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD!

00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:10.363
DEN IT'S
<i>YOUR</i> LUCKY DAY, PUNK!

00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:12.599

00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:16.002
WHEW!

00:14:18.138 --> 00:14:19.205
Joey: MAN,

00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:20.673
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
HE TOOK OFF?

00:14:20.673 --> 00:14:21.708
Tristan:
YOU CAN DROP THE ACT.

00:14:21.708 --> 00:14:22.876
Tea:
YOU'RE SAFE, JOEY.

00:14:22.876 --> 00:14:23.977
WHAT!?

00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:25.945
I WOULDA
CRUSHED 'IM!

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:32.185
Man on radio:
MORE INFORMATION
HAS JUST COME IN.

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:34.487
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WAS ACTIVATED

00:14:34.487 --> 00:14:37.657
IN A DUEL INVOLVING...
YUGI MUTO.

00:14:37.657 --> 00:14:39.692
HMM. YUGI!

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:41.461
Kaiba:
I HAVE A PLAN, MOKUBA.

00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:43.763
THAT CARD <i>WILL</i> BE MINE.

00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:47.534
Strings: AND NOW,
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON,

00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:50.670
DESTROY
HIS BUSTER BLADER!

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.539
[ROARS]

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:54.974
AND TAKE A BITE
OUT OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:14:54.974 --> 00:14:56.509
UNH!

00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.180
DO YOU SURRENDER YET?

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.514
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:03.650
SLIFER WILL ONLY
GET STRONGER.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.552
AND THANKS
TO MY JAM DEFENDER,

00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:07.787
YOU STILL CAN'T
ATTACK, PHARAOH.

00:15:07.787 --> 00:15:09.823
FOR IF YOU DO,
I'LL DRAW MORE CARDS,

00:15:09.823 --> 00:15:13.126
AND SLIFER WILL GROW
EVEN MORE POWERFUL.

00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:16.729
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN WIN!?

00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:18.965
HAND OVER YOUR PUZZLE.

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:22.268
ONCE MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
FINISHES YOU OFF,

00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:24.671
YOUR DAYS AS PHARAOH
WILL BE OVER!

00:15:24.671 --> 00:15:25.972
HA HA HA!

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:27.474
Yugi, thinking:
NONE OF MY MONSTERS
ARE STRONG ENOUGH

00:15:27.474 --> 00:15:28.875
TO BEAT HIS SKY DRAGON.

00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:31.311
SO I'M GONNA NEED
THE RIGHT MAGIC CARD
TO DO IT!

00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:32.912
COME ON,
HEART OF THE CARDS,

00:15:32.912 --> 00:15:34.214
GUIDE ME!

00:15:34.214 --> 00:15:35.248
HUH.

00:15:35.248 --> 00:15:37.016
HERE I GO!

00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:38.384
NOW!

00:15:38.384 --> 00:15:39.953
HMM.

00:15:39.953 --> 00:15:41.120
Yugi, thinking:
MAGIC CYLINDER.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.655
THIS CARD COULD
DO THE TRICK,

00:15:42.655 --> 00:15:43.656
BUT IT HAS TO BE
COMBINED

00:15:43.656 --> 00:15:44.924
WITH A MAGICIAN CARD
TO WORK.

00:15:44.924 --> 00:15:46.526
AND I'M IN LUCK...

00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:49.195
'CAUSE I'M HOLDING
THE DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:15:49.195 --> 00:15:50.463
PERFECT!

00:15:51.564 --> 00:15:52.966
ALRIGHT...

00:15:52.966 --> 00:15:55.468
I SACRIFICE
KURIBOH...

00:15:55.468 --> 00:15:58.171
TO SUMMON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:15:58.171 --> 00:15:59.472
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:59.472 --> 00:16:01.841
YAH!

00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:04.744
Strings: BY SUMMONING
A NEW MONSTER
TO THE FIELD,

00:16:04.744 --> 00:16:07.714
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
MY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:16:07.714 --> 00:16:09.015
OH, NO!

00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:13.686
Strings:
ITS <i>SECOND</i> MOUTH!

00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:15.154
HA HA HA!

00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:17.857
Yami-Yugi: SLIFER IS
FULL OF SURPRISES!

00:16:17.857 --> 00:16:19.526
EVEN IF IT'S <i>YOUR</i> TURN,

00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:22.362
SLIFER WILL
AUTOMATICALLY ATTACK
EVERY MONSTER YOU SUMMON

00:16:22.362 --> 00:16:24.264
WITH ITS SECOND
SET OF JAWS,

00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:26.266
WIPING OUT 2000 POINTS

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:28.635
FROM WHICHEVER MODE
YOUR MONSTER IS IN.

00:16:28.635 --> 00:16:32.138
SO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:16:32.138 --> 00:16:33.473
OH, NO!

00:16:33.473 --> 00:16:36.242
SHE ONLY HAS <i>1,700</i>
DEFENSE POINTS.

00:16:36.242 --> 00:16:37.877
SLIFER, ATTACK!

00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:44.250
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SAVE
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.752
IT'S TOO LATE!

00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:47.787
OBSERVE!

00:16:47.787 --> 00:16:49.689
WHY DON'T <i>YOU</i> OBSERVE!

00:16:49.689 --> 00:16:50.690
YAH!

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:53.560
Strings and Marik:
IT REALLY IS A PITY

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.695
THAT YOUR MAGICIAN
HAD TO LEAVE US SO SOON.

00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:58.231
WHO SAID SHE'S GONE?

00:16:58.231 --> 00:16:59.899
I DID!

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:01.167
GUESS AGAIN!

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:03.269
I ACTIVATED
MAGICAL HATS
JUST IN TIME.

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:06.172
SO SHE'S HIDING INSIDE
ONE OF THOSE HATS?

00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:07.740
NOT JUST HIDING.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.577
SHE'S INSIDE
PREPARING TO LAUNCH
A COUNTERATTACK.

00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:13.813
YUGI, YOUR MONSTER'S
NOT STRONG ENOUGH!

00:17:13.813 --> 00:17:14.981
NOT TO DEFEAT SLIFER!

00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:16.916
HA HA HA!

00:17:16.916 --> 00:17:19.852
IT'S TRUE
THAT YOUR DRAGON
IS POWERFUL, MARIK...

00:17:19.852 --> 00:17:21.788
BUT I HAVE FAITH...

00:17:21.788 --> 00:17:24.724
AND SO I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN...

00:17:24.724 --> 00:17:28.294
BENEATH MY MAGICAL HATS.

00:17:28.294 --> 00:17:29.929
Strings and Marik:
YOUR HATS MERELY PROVIDE YOU

00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:32.065
WITH A TEMPORARY HIDING PLACE.

00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:34.734
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
PHARAOH...

00:17:34.734 --> 00:17:37.270
I'LL PLAY MY OWN MAGIC CARD!

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.873
AND IT WILL MAKE
MY DRAGON'S POWER INFINITE!

00:17:40.873 --> 00:17:42.375
YOU SEE...

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:45.511
Strings:
INFINITE CARDS LETS ME
EXCEED THE 6-CARD LIMIT

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:48.715
AND HOLD AS MANY CARDS
AS I WISH IN MY HAND!

00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:50.950
NO! THAT CAN'T BE!

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.018
HEH.

00:17:52.018 --> 00:17:54.687
SINCE SLIFER GETS
1000 ATTACK POINTS

00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:56.222
FOR EVERY CARD IN MY HAND...

00:17:56.222 --> 00:17:59.859
NOW THERE'S NO LIMIT
TO MY MONSTER'S POWER!

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.729
SLIFER...UNLEASH
YOUR THUNDER FORCE!

00:18:02.729 --> 00:18:05.632
ON THE RIGHT-HAND HAT!!

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:10.670
YOU MADE
A LUCKY GUESS, MARIK!

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.905
YOU COULDN'T
HIDE HER FOREVER.

00:18:14.507 --> 00:18:16.909
THIS DUEL'S NOT OVER!

00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:20.980
IT MAY AS WELL BE.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.216
YOUR MONSTER IS DESTROYED!

00:18:23.216 --> 00:18:24.384
WHAT'S <i>THIS!?</i>

00:18:27.186 --> 00:18:28.988
SHE'S ABSORBING
MY ATTACK!

00:18:28.988 --> 00:18:30.657
THAT'S RIGHT, MARIK.

00:18:30.657 --> 00:18:32.125
IT SEEMS
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:35.662
I ALSO HID
TWO TRAP CARDS
UNDER THAT HAT!

00:18:35.662 --> 00:18:36.929
MAGIC CYLINDER...

00:18:36.929 --> 00:18:40.066
AND MY SPELLBINDING
CIRCLE.

00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:42.301
SO I'LL WEAKEN
YOUR SKY DRAGON'S POWER

00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:44.804
AND THEN
REDIRECT HIS <i>OWN</i>
THUNDER FORCE ATTACK

00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:46.072
RIGHT <i>BACK</i> AT HIM!

00:18:46.072 --> 00:18:47.140
FIRE!

00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:50.176
SAY GOOD-BYE!
MARIK!

00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:51.778
NEVER.

00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:55.148
YOU <i>CAN'T</i> ATTACK ME
WITH MY REVIVAL JAM IN PLAY!

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.652
SO YOUR PLASMA MONSTER

00:18:59.652 --> 00:19:01.921
CAN EVEN BLOCK
<i>REDIRECTED</i> ATTACKS!?

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.559
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT,
PHARAOH.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.861
THEN IT REGENERATES
UNHARMED,

00:19:08.861 --> 00:19:12.165
WHICH ALSO MEANS
I CAN DRAW 3 <i>NEW</i> CARDS.

00:19:12.165 --> 00:19:14.834
SO MY SKY DRAGON
GROWS EVEN STRONGER,

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.736
PLUS I'LL DRAW AGAIN,

00:19:16.736 --> 00:19:19.539
GIVING IT A TOTAL
OF OVER 8,000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:22.475
THAT EGYPTIAN GOD...
IS UNSTOPPABLE!

00:19:22.475 --> 00:19:26.045
PRECISELY, AND SINCE
YOUR SPELLBINDING
CIRCLE CARD HAS EXPIRED,

00:19:26.045 --> 00:19:28.014
SLIFER GAINS BACK
MORE ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:29.615
GIVING HIM 9,000!

00:19:29.615 --> 00:19:33.986
NOW, SLIFER,
DEMOLISH HIS
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!!!

00:19:38.124 --> 00:19:40.693
HUH!

00:19:40.693 --> 00:19:44.864
BEHOLD: THE ULTIMATE
5-CARD COMBINATION

00:19:44.864 --> 00:19:47.700
THAT MAKES ME
COMPLETELY INDESTRUCTIBLE!

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.737
WHEN THESE 5 ALMIGHTY CARDS
ARE PLAYED TOGETHER,

00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:53.706
THEY COMPLETE A STRATEGY
THAT CANNOT BE DEFEATED!

00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:58.010
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL CONTINUE TO GROW STRONGER,

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.414
AND YOUR ATTACKS ARE
COMPLETELY USELESS!

00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:02.949
OH, NO.

00:20:02.949 --> 00:20:06.586
I CAN'T LET MARIK
WIN MY PUZZLE.

00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:08.488
[GRUNTING]

00:20:08.488 --> 00:20:09.655
Kaiba:
GET ON YOUR FEET,
YUGI!

00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:10.656
HUH?

00:20:10.656 --> 00:20:12.158
KAIBA!

00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:16.162
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
<i>BOW</i> TO YOUR RIVALS?

00:20:16.162 --> 00:20:17.730
NEVER!

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.666
THEN GET UP AND STOP
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF,

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:22.568
SO YOU CAN DEFEAT
THIS <i>NOBODY</i>

00:20:22.568 --> 00:20:25.638
AND RELIEVE HIM OF
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:20:25.638 --> 00:20:27.740
AND DO IT NOW!

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.742
DON'T LET THIS PUNK <i>WIN.</i>

00:20:29.742 --> 00:20:32.712
YOU CAN TAKE <i>DOWN</i>
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:20:32.712 --> 00:20:35.248
JUST FIND OUT
ITS WEAKNESS!

00:20:35.248 --> 00:20:38.718
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'VE LOST YOUR TOUCH.

00:20:38.718 --> 00:20:40.920
IF YOU STILL HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES...

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.956
THEN GET UP
AND PROVE IT TO ME NOW!

00:20:43.956 --> 00:20:45.558
Kaiba: ONCE <i>I</i> LEARN
ITS WEAKNESS,

00:20:45.558 --> 00:20:47.393
I'LL <i>TAKE</i> SLIFER
FROM YUGI,

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:50.363
AND SOON <i>I'LL</i> HAVE
THE MOST POWERFUL DECK
IN THE WORLD!
