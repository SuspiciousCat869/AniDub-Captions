WEBVTT

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:02.596
Yami-Yugi:
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:04.831
Marik:
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.101
KAIBA AND LITTLE YUGI
SHOULD BE ARRIVING MOMENTARILY.

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:09.369
I THINK I SEE
SOMEONE ON THE PIER.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.937
AND IT KINDA LOOKS
LIKE JOEY.

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:12.306
JOEY.

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:13.707
NOT EXACTLY.

00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:15.976
YOUR MIND IS UNDER
THE CONTROL OF MARIK

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.511
AND YOU MUST
BREAK FREE.

00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:19.212
YOU'LL NEVER
SET HIM FREE.

00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:21.882
WELCOME TO MY VERY
SPECIAL DUELING ARENA.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.550
TRY THESE ON FOR SIZE.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.386
YOU'RE BOTH SECURELY
FASTENED TO A CHAIN

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:28.055
THAT LEADS
TO A LARGE ANCHOR.

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:31.558
30 SECONDS AFTER
A PLAYER'S LIFE POINTS
REACH ZERO,

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:33.927
THE ANCHOR WILL DROP
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA.

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:36.029
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO STOP
THIS DUEL,

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:39.966
THE CRATE YOU SEE
HANGING OVER MY HEAD
WILL FALL.

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.768
HEY, WHO ARE
YOU PUNKS?

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:42.769
Serenity:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:43.937
GET ON MY BACK.

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:45.072
OK.
LET'S GO.

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:46.306
DON'T LET 'EM
GET AWAY!

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:49.109
I THINK IT'S FINALLY TIME
TO BEGIN THIS DUEL.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.878
HINOTAMA,
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:53.347
YUGI! NO!

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:54.781
HA HA HA.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.956
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.825
♪ YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:12.132
♪ YU-GI-OH! ♪

00:01:33.153 --> 00:01:34.921
IT'S TIME

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.324
TO D-D-D-DUEL.

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:54.307
♪ YU-GI-OH! ♪

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.146
Joey: I'VE ATTACKED
YOUR LIFE POINTS
YET AGAIN, YUGI.

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:01.648
HA HA HA.
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:02:01.648 --> 00:02:03.583
AS SOON AS I WIPE OUT
THE REST,

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.085
THAT ANCHOR WILL DROP,

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:07.954
TAKING YOU WITH IT
RIGHT INTO THE SEA.

00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:11.792
MARIK, I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET
AWAY WITH YOUR PLAN.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:14.361
IS THAT SO, YUGI?

00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.631
I'D SAY YOU'RE
IN NO POSITION
TO MAKE THREATS.

00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.033
I KNOW THE REAL JOEY
IS IN THERE,

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.903
AND I'M GOING
TO SET HIM FREE
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:23.970
OH?

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.573
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'LL WIN MY PUZZLE

00:02:26.573 --> 00:02:28.375
OR MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.545
Marik: WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT, YUGI.

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:34.080
JOEY BELONGS TO ME NOW,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.817
THANKS TO MY MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:40.554
SO DESTROY YOUR FORMER
BEST FRIEND, MY MIND PUPPET,

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:42.823
AND STRIP HIM
OF ALL THAT HE HAS

00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:46.660
SO THAT I MAY RULE
THE WORLD AS PHARAOH.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.430
YUGI, YOUR FRIEND
IS GONE.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.098
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:54.034
THEN MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:55.702
NOT THAT IT MATTERS.

00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:58.138
NEITHER ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS
IS POWERFUL ENOUGH

00:02:58.138 --> 00:02:59.840
TO DEFEAT MY
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.275
HEY, JOEY.
SNAP OUT OF IT.

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:04.411
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS,
REMEMBER?

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:06.146
Yugi: TEA'S RIGHT.

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:08.815
I HAVE AN IDEA.

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.484
WHAT IS IT?

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:12.752
I MAY HAVE COME UP
WITH A WAY TO SAVE JOEY

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:13.753
AND GET US
OUT OF THIS MESS.

00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:15.355
WHAT'S THAT?

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:18.825
WELL, IT JUST CAME TO ME
WHEN TEA REMINDED US
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:21.661
THERE'S A CHANCE
WE CAN BREAK THROUGH
TO THE REAL JOEY.

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:24.064
I THINK YOU SHOULD LET ME
DUEL IN YOUR PLACE.

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:25.599
BUT WHY?

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.200
BECAUSE THROUGH
THICK AND THIN,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.604
JOEY AND I
HAVE ALWAYS SHARED
A REALLY STRONG BOND--

00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:34.474
A BOND THAT I THINK
MIGHT BREAK THROUGH
TO HIM NOW.

00:03:34.474 --> 00:03:36.510
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH TOGETHER.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.978
LIKE THE TIME HE RESCUED ME
FROM THAT FIRE.

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:40.714
JOEY AND TRISTAN
RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR US.

00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:42.549
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.418
THIS IS A VERY
DANGEROUS MATCH, YUGI.

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:46.987
I KNOW IT IS.

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:49.055
BUT I CAN'T LET
THAT STOP ME.

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:52.559
I FEEL IN MY HEART
THAT IF THERE'S ANYONE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.061
THAT CAN GET THROUGH
TO JOEY RIGHT NOW,
IT'S ME.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.429
BUT, YUGI...

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.666
I'M READY TO GO IN THERE
AND DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.468
JOEY'S MY BEST FRIEND,

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:05.305
AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD DO
THE EXACT SAME THING FOR ME.

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:06.973
PLEASE UNDERSTAND,
YAMI,

00:04:06.973 --> 00:04:09.142
THIS ISN'T JUST
SOMETHING I WANT TO DO,

00:04:09.142 --> 00:04:11.344
IT'S SOMETHING
I FEEL I HAVE TO DO.

00:04:11.344 --> 00:04:13.313
WELL, YUGI...

00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:15.181
IF YOU FEEL
THAT STRONGLY...

00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:17.217
THEN GO.

00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:19.386
GO AND RESCUE
YOUR BEST FRIEND

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:22.155
AND KNOW THAT
I WILL BE RIGHT HERE
SHOULD YOU NEED ME.

00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:31.231
OK, JOEY,
IT'S JUST US NOW.

00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:32.966
WHAT? NO.

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:36.303
I WANT THE PHARAOH,
NOT THIS LITTLE RUNT.

00:04:36.303 --> 00:04:38.905
I WANT TO DEFEAT
THE ANCIENT RULER.

00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:40.974
THAT SPINELESS COWARD.

00:04:40.974 --> 00:04:44.244
HE SENT LITTLE YUGI
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:45.645
YOU CHEAT!

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:48.148
I WANT TO DESTROY
THE PHAROAH.

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:49.516
[THINKING]
BUT THEN AGAIN...

00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:51.651
HA HA HA.

00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:54.020
THIS MIGHT BE
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.389
I CAN WIN THIS DUEL
WITH EASE

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.093
NOW THAT I'M UP
AGAINST LITTLE YUGI
INSTEAD OF THE PHARAOH.

00:05:00.093 --> 00:05:02.963
AND IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER WHICH
ONE OF THEM I DEFEAT.

00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:07.534
I'LL STILL WIN
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
AND SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.536
MY TURN, MARIK.

00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:13.540
YUGI, TEA AND JOEY
ARE COUNTING ON YOU,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.942
AND AS LONG AS YOU
BELIEVE IN THE HEART
OF THE CARDS,

00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:18.578
I KNOW YOU'LL COME
THROUGH FOR THEM.

00:05:18.578 --> 00:05:19.980
[YUGI, THOUGHTS]
RIGHT.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.348
COME ON,
HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:05:21.348 --> 00:05:23.450
PLEASE GUIDE ME.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.552
ITS JOEY'S RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON!

00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:27.153
THIS IS MY ONLY HOPE!

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:34.755
HOLD ON TIGHT,
SERENITY.

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:35.756
YOU CAN'T RUN
FOREVER!

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:37.858
WANNA BET?

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:39.493
YES, I DO.

00:05:39.493 --> 00:05:41.028
NICE TRY, KID.

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:42.930
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,
TRISTAN?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.999
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
A LITTLE TRIP WITH US.

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.333
I SUGGEST YOU
COME QUIETLY.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.103
GUESS AGAIN, PAL.

00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:51.172
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:05:51.172 --> 00:05:53.507
YOU'RE EVEN MORE FOOLISH
THAN YOU LOOK.

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:54.909
Serenity:
PLEASE BE CAREFUL,
TRISTAN.

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.012
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO THIS THE HARD WAY.

00:05:58.012 --> 00:06:00.381
Tristan:
YOU GUESSED RIGHT,
SO BRING IT ON.

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.416
DON'T SAY WE
DIDN'T WARN YOU.

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:03.684
THIS SHOULD BE AMUSING.

00:06:03.684 --> 00:06:06.120
YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN UP
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.688
BUT NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:10.558
LET'S DO THIS.

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:11.859
HEY, LET ME GO.

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:14.662
STOP! PLEASE!

00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:17.531
AND THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM,
TOUGH GUY.

00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:20.467
Serenity:
WHAT'S GOING ON, TRISTAN?

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:22.436
WHOA, IS THAT
DUKE DEVLIN?

00:06:22.436 --> 00:06:24.205
THE ONE AND ONLY.

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:28.609
ALL RIGHT, SERENITY,
HANG ON.

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:29.977
OK.

00:06:29.977 --> 00:06:31.478
SO HOW YA BEEN,
TRISTAN?

00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:32.947
TALK LATER,
RUN NOW.

00:06:32.947 --> 00:06:34.448
RIGHT.

00:06:34.448 --> 00:06:35.716
THEY'RE GETTIN' AWAY.

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:38.552
AFTER 'EM!

00:06:40.454 --> 00:06:42.122
Yugi: I DID IT.

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:44.058
I DREW THE CARD
JOEY GAVE ME--

00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:45.326
HIS RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:06:45.326 --> 00:06:46.794
NOW, HOW SHOULD
I USE IT?

00:06:46.794 --> 00:06:50.831
YUGI, YOU MAY BE ABLE
TO USE THAT CARD
TO SAVE JOEY

00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:52.266
BUT YOU MUST
PLAY IT WISELY.

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:53.701
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:56.370
THIS RED-EYES HAS ALWAYS
BEEN SPECIAL TO JOEY.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.138
HE'S GOTTA REMEMBER IT.

00:06:58.138 --> 00:07:00.708
[THINKING] YEAH.
JOEY GAVE ME THIS CARD

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:03.310
SO I'D ALWAYS HAVE
A PIECE OF HIM
IN MY DECK.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.080
ONCE HE SEES IT,
THE REAL JOEY
WILL BREAK THROUGH.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.015
THIS HAD BETTER WORK.

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:10.517
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
SOMEWHERE, PAL.

00:07:10.517 --> 00:07:13.120
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU'RE
PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.556
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO JOG
YOUR MEMORY

00:07:15.556 --> 00:07:18.826
WITH AN OLD FRIEND
OF YOURS THAT'S NOT
TOO EASY TO FORGET--

00:07:18.826 --> 00:07:21.428
YOUR RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:23.330
REMEMBER,
WHEN TIME RUNS OUT,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.132
THAT ANCHOR FALLS,
SO MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:28.002
OK, IN ORDER
TO SUMMON RED-EYES,

00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:30.337
I'LL NEED TO SACRIFICE
TWO MONSTERS.

00:07:30.337 --> 00:07:32.072
LUCKILY,
I'VE GOT KURIBOH

00:07:32.072 --> 00:07:33.674
AND BIG SHIELD GARDNA
ON THE FIELD.

00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:36.176
ALL I NEED TO DO IS SEND
THEM TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:37.411
AND I CAN BRING OUT
RED-EYES.

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.179
WELL, HERE GOES.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:40.347
Yugi-Yami:
YUGI, WAIT!

00:07:40.347 --> 00:07:42.082
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO SUMMON RED-EYES NOW?

00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:44.852
MARIK MAY HAVE SOMETHING
THAT CAN DESTROY IT,

00:07:44.852 --> 00:07:47.121
AND WITH ONLY 1,500
LIFE POINTS LEFT,

00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:48.455
WE MUST BE CAREFUL.

00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:50.491
AS SOON AS
THEY REACH ZERO,

00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:52.159
THAT ANCHOR WILL PULL US
INTO THE OCEAN

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:54.862
AND THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE IN JEOPARDY.

00:07:54.862 --> 00:07:55.863
GO.

00:07:55.863 --> 00:07:57.331
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:59.066
YAMI'S RIGHT.

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:00.734
SUMMONING RED-EYES
IS TOO RISKY.

00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:02.069
BUT WAIT.

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:04.238
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
I CAN SHOW THIS CARD
TO JOEY

00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:06.774
WITHOUT ACTUALLY
SUMMONING IT
TO THE FIELD.

00:08:06.774 --> 00:08:09.176
BUT IT MIGHT BE AN
EVEN RISKIER MOVE.

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:10.678
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT TO DO.

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.513
Kaiba:
ALL RIGHT, YUGI...

00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:14.014
IT'S TIME
TO SINK OR SWIM,

00:08:14.014 --> 00:08:16.517
QUITE LITERALLY.

00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:19.920
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY
TO GET THROUGH TO JOEY.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.021
HE'S OUR FRIEND.

00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:22.990
WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH TOGETHER.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.825
JOEY'S ALWAYS SAID
THAT WHENEVER HE'S DOWN,

00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:26.260
HIS FRIENDS GIVE HIM
THE STRENGTH

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.561
TO GET BACK UP AGAIN.

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.430
AND I KNOW
OUR FRIENDSHIP
CAN SAVE HIM NOW.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.598
JOEY, PLEASE WAKE UP.

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.167
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:34.935
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER
OUR BOND.

00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:36.337
LOOK.

00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:38.105
THIS IS THE SYMBOL
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:39.406
IT IS?

00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:42.376
I KNOW MARKER INK WILL
EVENTUALLY FADE AWAY,

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:43.911
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.513
BECAUSE THIS RING
IS NEVER GOING TO VANISH
IN OUR HEARTS.

00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:48.849
REMEMBER OUR RING
OF FRIENDSHIP?

00:08:48.849 --> 00:08:50.184
NOTHING CAN BREAK
THAT BOND.

00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:53.287
SO SNAP OUT OF IT,
JOEY. PLEASE!

00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:54.421
[YUGI, THOUGHTS]
TEA'S RIGHT.

00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:55.989
NO MATTER WHAT
THE RISKS ARE,

00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:58.826
JOEY IS MY FRIEND
AND I HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:01.228
TO BREAK
MARIK'S CONTROL
AND SAVE HIM.

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:02.730
THERE'S NO
OTHER CHOICE.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.331
AFTER ALL,
WE MADE A PACT

00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:05.933
THAT I'D ALWAYS BE
THERE FOR HIM

00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:08.035
AND HE'D ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR ME.

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:11.572
AND I'D NEVER BREAK
A PROMISE TO A FRIEND,
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:14.808
SO NOW IT'S TIME
TO SHOW MARIK WHAT
FRIENDSHIP'S ALL ABOUT.

00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:19.079
I PLAY THE MAGIC CARD
EXCHANGE!

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:20.647
A FOOLISH MOVE.

00:09:20.647 --> 00:09:22.182
[KAIBA, THOUGHTS]
WHAT'S YUGI THINKING?

00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:24.184
THE EXCHANGE CARD
ALLOWS WHEELER TO TAKE

00:09:24.184 --> 00:09:26.019
ANY CARD HE WANTS
FROM YUGI'S DECK.

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:27.955
LOOK AT YOU.

00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:29.323
HA.

00:09:29.323 --> 00:09:32.493
YOU MUST BE DESPERATE
TO PLAY A CARD LIKE THAT.

00:09:32.493 --> 00:09:35.496
BUT IF YOU INSIST,
I'D BE GLAD TO TAKE A CARD

00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:37.164
FROM YOUR HAND,
LITTLE YUGI.

00:09:37.164 --> 00:09:39.299
HA HA HA!

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.235
NOT THAT I NEED
ANY HELP.

00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:45.606
SHOW ME YOUR
PITIFUL CARDS.

00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:47.107
NOW...

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:49.510
WHICH CARD SHALL I TAKE?

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.879
Joey: AAH!
MY RED-EYES!

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.080
Marik:
SILENCE, WHEELER.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.516
YOU'RE UNDER
MY CONTROL NOW.

00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:57.451
YOU HAVE NO MIND
OF YOUR OWN.

00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.153
I OWN YOU.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.754
Marik: PLAYING
THAT EXCHANGE CARD

00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:07.323
WAS A HUGE MISTAKE,
LITTLE YUGI.

00:10:07.323 --> 00:10:08.924
WELL, PICK YOUR CARD,
MARIK.

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:10.926
YOU CAN HAVE
ANY ONE YOU WANT,

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:13.095
INCLUDING THE RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:16.866
Joey: IT'S THE CARD
I GAVE YUG.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.434
MY RED-EYES!

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:19.535
Marik:
QUIET, YOU FOOL!

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.237
I'M IN CONTROL
OF YOUR MIND.

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:22.905
Yami-Yugi: YUGI,
IT MAY BE WORKING...

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:24.607
Joey: YUGI...

00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:25.908
NEEDS THAT CARD.

00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:27.776
THAT'S WHY
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:29.111
Marik:
YOU WILL DO AS I SAY

00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:32.581
AND TAKE THAT RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON FROM YUGI, NOW.

00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:36.352
YOU HAVE NO MIND
OF YOUR OWN, JOEY.

00:10:36.352 --> 00:10:38.087
SAY IT.

00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:39.922
Joey: I HAVE
NO MIND OF MY OWN.

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:43.692
EXCELLENT. SO TAKE YUGI'S
RED-EYES RIGHT NOW.

00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:45.628
THAT'S RIGHT,
MY OBEDIENT MIND PUPPET.

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:46.795
TAKE IT.

00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:49.265
YOUR FRIEND
IS LONG GONE.

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.867
SO I'LL BE TAKING YOUR
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:53.035
Yugi:
IT'S NOT WORKING.

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:54.870
HE'S STILL UNDER
MARIK'S CONTROL.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.305
Yugi-Yami:
HOLD ON, YUGI...

00:10:56.305 --> 00:11:00.109
LOOK AGAIN.

00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:02.077
[JOEY, THOUGHTS]
I CAN'T TAKE RED-EYES.

00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:03.879
IT'S YUGI'S CARD NOW.

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:05.948
I MADE A PROMISE.

00:11:05.948 --> 00:11:08.050
Marik: NO, YOU FOOL.
TAKE THAT DRAGON.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.251
I COMMAND YOU.

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.220
TAKE THE RED-EYES
FROM YUGI.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.356
NO. I JUST CAN'T.
NOT THAT CARD.

00:11:14.356 --> 00:11:15.758
OBEY ME.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.594
TAKE THAT CARD SO WE
CAN FINISH YUGI OFF NOW.

00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:21.330
NO. YUGI NEEDS IT.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.765
TAKE IT NOW!

00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:28.170
HA! YEAH, JOEY!

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.139
YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT.

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:31.273
[MARIK, THOUGHTS]
WHAT?

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.375
HOW DARE
YOU DISOBEY ME!

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:34.376
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:35.544
JOEY?

00:11:35.544 --> 00:11:37.613
NO.

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:40.683
I TOLD YOU,
JOEY HAS GONE AWAY.

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:45.587
AND I'M HERE TO DEFEAT
YOU WITH MY ARSENAL
OF RARE MAGIC CARDS,

00:11:45.587 --> 00:11:47.389
SO I DON'T NEED
YOUR RED-EYES.

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:48.857
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

00:11:48.857 --> 00:11:51.360
NOW I GET TO PICK ONE
OF YOUR CARDS, JOEY.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.962
I SAID,
JOEY IS GONE...

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.396
AND YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:11:54.396 --> 00:11:57.132
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:11:57.132 --> 00:11:59.368
YOU CAN DENY IT
ALL YOU WANT,

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:01.770
BUT I KNOW MY
BEST FRIEND IS IN THERE

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.572
AND I'M GONNA
SET HIM FREE, MARIK.

00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:05.007
YOU'RE FOOLING YOURSELF.

00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:06.775
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:08.978
THAT'S WHY YOU
DIDN'T TAKE MY RED-EYES,

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.780
'CAUSE THE REAL JOEY
IS IN THERE FIGHTING
TO GET OUT.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.615
AND HE GAVE ME
THAT RED-EYES

00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:16.418
WHEN HE PROMISED TO HELP
ME DEFEAT YOU, MARIK.

00:12:16.418 --> 00:12:17.519
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.921
ADMIT IT.

00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:20.756
AS SOON AS HE
SAW THAT CARD,

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.591
THE REAL JOEY
CAME THROUGH.

00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:24.293
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:26.195
I'M CONTROLLING HIS MIND.

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:27.930
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.933
I KNOW I CAN USE
THIS CARD TO STOP YOU

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:33.168
AND BRING MY
BEST FRIEND BACK.

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:34.536
JUST WAIT.

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:35.671
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:38.340
NOW LET'S GET ON
WITH THIS DUEL, ALREADY,

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.609
SO I CAN CLAIM
WHAT IS MINE

00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:43.312
AND GET RID OF YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:12:43.312 --> 00:12:45.848
IT'S STILL MY TURN,
SO STAND BACK.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.684
GO AHEAD AND MAKE
YOUR PATHETIC MOVE,
LITTLE YUGI.

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:51.186
THERE'S NOT A CARD
IN YOUR HAND

00:12:51.186 --> 00:12:52.521
THAT CAN STOP ME
FROM WIPING OUT

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:54.556
THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:58.027
AND NOW I SACRIFICE
MY TWO MONSTERS,

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:01.530
SO I CAN SUMMON
THIS TO THE FIELD.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.099
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.439
Joey: IT'S MY RED-EYES.
YUGI!

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:11.607
Joey: IT'S MY RED-EYES.
YUGI!

00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:13.609
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY.
FIGHT IT.

00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:16.111
LOOK AT YOUR RED-EYES
AND BREAK FREE.

00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:18.280
Marik:
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.749
I'M LOSING CONTROL
OF MY MIND SLAVE.

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:24.253
MY POWER OVER HIM
IS SLIPPING AWAY.

00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:26.422
I CAN'T LET THAT
LITTLE BRAT YUGI

00:13:26.422 --> 00:13:29.425
STOP THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:31.226
SIR...
HMM?

00:13:31.226 --> 00:13:34.430
I'M AFRAID
JOEY WHEELER'S
SISTER GOT AWAY.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.199
THEN WHY ARE YOU
STANDING HERE, YOU FOOL?

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:40.903
GO SEE TO IT THAT
SHE IS CAPTURED. NOW!

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.604
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY.

00:13:42.604 --> 00:13:44.840
I KNOW YOU REMEMBER
YOUR RED-EYES.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.577
I REMEMBER MY DRAGON.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:52.881
Kaiba: THAT RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON SEEMS TO BE
AFFECTING WHEELER'S MIND.

00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:54.383
WELL, YOU HEARD YUGI.

00:13:54.383 --> 00:13:56.351
IT USED TO BE
JOEY'S CARD.

00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:58.587
MUST BE A HARD SPOT
TO BE IN...

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:01.590
A CARD YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT BEING PLAYED
AGAINST YOU.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.892
IT'S ABOUT
TO GET HARDER.

00:14:03.892 --> 00:14:05.494
Yugi: JOEY!

00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:08.931
MARIK HAS TAKEN OVER
YOUR MIND AND HE'S USING
YOU TO DESTROY ME.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:12.367
SO I'M GONNA TRY
TO BLAST YOU BACK
TO YOUR SENSES.

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:13.602
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:16.405
YOU, ME AND THE WHOLE
WORLD ARE IN DANGER.

00:14:22.072 --> 00:14:23.740
JOEY, I'M ONLY DOING THIS
BECAUSE I'M YOUR FRIEND.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.176
NOW PREPARE TO BE KNOCKED
BACK TO YOUR SENSES.

00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:29.112
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON,

00:14:29.112 --> 00:14:32.416
ATTACK HIS ALLIGATOR'S SWORD
WITH INFERNO FIRE BLAST.

00:14:39.623 --> 00:14:41.425
ARE YOU THERE, JOEY?

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:44.561
ARGH! GET UP
AND FIGHT BACK,
MIND SLAVE.

00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:47.731
HEY, JOEY,
IS THAT YOU?

00:14:47.731 --> 00:14:50.834
SORRY, YUGI.
YOUR TRICK DIDN'T WORK.

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.769
I'M STILL IN CONTROL.

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:54.905
AND NOW IT'S TIME.

00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:58.842
I'LL WIPE OUT WHAT'S
LEFT OF YOUR LIFE POINTS,
MY LITTLE FRIEND,

00:14:58.842 --> 00:15:02.079
AND TAKE WHAT
BELONGS TO ME.

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:04.514
Marik: YES. WE'LL ATTACK HIM
WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE

00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:07.751
AND SOON THE POWER OF
THE PHARAOH WILL BE MINE.

00:15:07.751 --> 00:15:09.052
Yami-Yugi: YUGI.

00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:10.621
THIS IS GETTING
TOO DANGEROUS.

00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:11.755
I'M TAKING OVER.

00:15:11.755 --> 00:15:13.490
NO I CAN'T LET YOU,
YAMI.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.258
[GASP]

00:15:15.258 --> 00:15:17.160
I NEED TO DO
THIS MYSELF.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.997
AND I HAVE ONE
LAST IDEA.

00:15:19.997 --> 00:15:21.398
BUT, YUGI!

00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:23.066
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME
ON THIS ONE,

00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:25.202
'CAUSE I KNOW
I CAN SAVE HIM.

00:15:25.202 --> 00:15:27.571
SINCE THE DAY
I PUT TOGETHER
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:30.741
YOU'VE GIVEN ME HOPE,
COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE.

00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:33.810
YOU'VE EVEN HELPED ME
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.880
BUT I CAN'T GO
THROUGH MY LIFE
DEPENDING ON YOU.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.149
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT EVEN WITHOUT

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:41.318
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
HANGING AROUND MY NECK,

00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:44.655
I CAN STILL BE BRAVE
AND HELP OUT MY FRIENDS.

00:15:44.655 --> 00:15:46.823
I GUESS WHAT
I'M SAYING IS...

00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:49.326
SOMETIMES I NEED
TO PROVE TO MYSELF

00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:51.895
THAT I CAN BE LIKE YOU,
WITHOUT YOU, YOU KNOW?

00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:53.397
YES, I DO.

00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:56.667
THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT I NEED TO FINISH
THIS MYSELF.

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.001
YOU ARE AWARE
OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN

00:15:58.001 --> 00:16:00.437
IF YOU LOSE THIS DUEL,
AREN'T YOU?

00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:02.572
I SURE AM.

00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:04.241
THAT'S WHY I NEED
TO DO THIS--

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:05.842
BECAUSE I CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

00:16:05.842 --> 00:16:07.344
HMM.

00:16:07.344 --> 00:16:09.079
ALL RIGHT.

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:10.514
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF,

00:16:10.514 --> 00:16:12.983
THEN I BELIEVE
IN YOU, TOO, YUGI.

00:16:12.983 --> 00:16:14.084
GOOD LUCK.

00:16:14.084 --> 00:16:16.219
YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO WIN.

00:16:16.219 --> 00:16:18.555
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
RESTS WITH YOU.

00:16:18.555 --> 00:16:20.390
AND I WON'T
DISAPPOINT YOU, YAMI.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.892
[THOUGHTS] ALL RIGHT.

00:16:21.892 --> 00:16:24.061
IT'S TIME TO SAVE
MY BEST FRIEND,

00:16:24.061 --> 00:16:26.329
AND THE WORLD,
ON MY OWN.

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:28.231
WELL, NOW.

00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:31.068
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP OR
ARE YOU READY FOR MORE?

00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:33.003
[THOUGHTS] I DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME LEFT.

00:16:33.003 --> 00:16:34.404
MY LIFE POINTS ARE LOW,

00:16:34.404 --> 00:16:36.740
AND IF I LOSE,
MARIK GETS EVERYTHING.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.209
MY ONLY HOPE IS
TO FREE JOEY'S MIND.

00:16:39.209 --> 00:16:40.343
ALL RIGHT.

00:16:40.343 --> 00:16:42.713
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO FINISH YOU OFF NOW,

00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:45.549
AND TAKE THE POWER
I DESERVE.

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:47.484
SO SAY GOOD-BYE,

00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:49.920
AS I ATTACK YOUR
LIFE POINTS AGAIN

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.458
WITH YET ANOTHER
HINOTAMA MAGIC CARD.

00:16:54.458 --> 00:16:56.693
FIRE SHOWER ATTACK.

00:16:58.562 --> 00:16:59.596
OH, NO.

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:04.835
WHERE'D THEY GO?

00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:06.503
THEY MUST BE CLOSE.

00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:07.571
LET'S KEEP LOOKING.

00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:09.172
THEY CAN'T HIDE
FOREVER.

00:17:09.172 --> 00:17:12.476
WE'LL FIND YOU, FOOLS.

00:17:12.476 --> 00:17:14.578
Duke Devlin:
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
THE FOOLS.

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:16.646
FINALLY, A CHANCE
TO CATCH OUR BREATH.

00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:19.883
AND CATCH UP
WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

00:17:19.883 --> 00:17:21.885
I MEAN, THAT LAST TIME
I SAW YOU, DUKE,

00:17:21.885 --> 00:17:23.186
WAS WHEN YOU
WERE SHOWING OFF

00:17:23.186 --> 00:17:25.489
THAT DUNGEON DICE
MONSTERS GAME YOU CREATED.

00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:27.124
YEAH, WELL.

00:17:27.124 --> 00:17:30.127
I HEARD ABOUT THIS
WHOLE BATTLE CITY THING
THAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:17:30.127 --> 00:17:33.029
IT SOUNDED LIKE FUN,
SO I DECIDED TO STOP BY
AND CHECK THINGS OUT.

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:35.732
I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING
TO RUN INTO YUGI,

00:17:35.732 --> 00:17:36.967
BUT I GUESS
YOU GUYS'LL DO.

00:17:36.967 --> 00:17:39.336
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHO'S SHE?

00:17:39.336 --> 00:17:42.339
TO YOU?
SHE'S OFF LIMITS.

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:44.608
YOU REMEMBER
JOEY WHEELER, RIGHT?

00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:46.710
IT'S HIS SISTER.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.411
OH, RIGHT.

00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:51.815
WASN'T HE THE GUY
I MADE DRESS UP IN
THAT DOGGIE COSTUME?

00:17:51.815 --> 00:17:54.251
YEAH, BUT DO ME A FAVOR
AND DON'T BRING THAT UP.

00:17:54.251 --> 00:17:56.720
YOU'LL UPSET SERENITY.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.156
FINE.
NOW THAT THAT'S
ALL CLEARED UP,

00:17:59.156 --> 00:18:00.891
WHO WERE THOSE GUYS
CHASING US?

00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:04.060
I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE
THE LOOK OF THOSE PUNKS.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.864
I WONDER WHAT
THOSE ROBED FREAKS
WERE AFTER, ANYWAY.

00:18:07.864 --> 00:18:09.065
WHO KNOWS?

00:18:09.065 --> 00:18:11.401
I CAN DEFINITELY TELL
YOU ONE THING, THOUGH.

00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.070
THEY WEREN'T VERY
FOND OF YOU GUYS.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.606
WOW, SHERLOCK.
YOU'RE REAL SMART, PAL.

00:18:16.606 --> 00:18:18.842
DID YOU FIGURE THAT OUT
ALL BY YOURSELF

00:18:18.842 --> 00:18:20.610
OR DID SOMEONE HELP YOU?

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.546
VERY FUNNY.
WELL, SOMEONE'S
AFTER YOU,

00:18:22.546 --> 00:18:23.647
AND YOU NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

00:18:23.647 --> 00:18:25.015
HEY, GUYS.

00:18:25.015 --> 00:18:27.284
IF THOSE JERKS
ARE AFTER US,
DOES THAT MEAN...

00:18:27.284 --> 00:18:28.618
MEAN WHAT?

00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:31.521
THAT THEY'RE AFTER
THE OTHERS, TOO.

00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:34.324
JOEY, TEA, AND YUGI
MAY BE IN EVEN MORE TROUBLE

00:18:34.324 --> 00:18:35.559
THAN WE ARE NOW.

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:38.228
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE YUGI,

00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:40.797
DID MY DIRECT ATTACK
LEAVE YOU SPEECHLESS?

00:18:42.833 --> 00:18:45.502
Tea: PLEASE, JOEY.
COME TO YOUR SENSES.

00:18:45.502 --> 00:18:49.372
KAIBA, MOKUBA,
CAN'T YOU GUYS DO
SOMETHING TO STOP THIS?

00:18:49.372 --> 00:18:52.242
BUT IF WE MOVE,
TEA WILL BE...

00:18:52.242 --> 00:18:55.178
WELL,
WE'VE GOT TO STOP
THIS WHOLE THING

00:18:55.178 --> 00:18:56.646
BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.

00:18:56.646 --> 00:18:57.814
I KNOW.

00:18:57.814 --> 00:18:59.149
Marik:
SURRENDER YET, YUGI?

00:18:59.149 --> 00:19:02.219
LISTEN,
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP

00:19:02.219 --> 00:19:06.089
UNTIL MY BEST FRIEND
IS SAFE FROM HARM.

00:19:06.089 --> 00:19:08.158
AND I KNOW JUST
HOW TO GET THROUGH
TO HIM, MARIK,

00:19:08.158 --> 00:19:10.393
SO WATCH ME.

00:19:10.393 --> 00:19:11.728
TOO LATE.

00:19:11.728 --> 00:19:14.397
I'M ABOUT TO SEND YOU
INTO THE SEA

00:19:14.397 --> 00:19:16.900
WHEN I SUMMON
ROCKET WARRIOR.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:23.073
ANY MONSTER STRUCK BY
ROCKET WARRIOR LOSES
500 ATTACK POINTS

00:19:23.073 --> 00:19:24.207
FOR THE DURATION
OF THE TURN.

00:19:24.207 --> 00:19:25.575
WAIT, JOEY.

00:19:25.575 --> 00:19:27.510
I KNOW YOU
CAN HEAR ME.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.412
AND THEN I'LL PLAY
ATTRITION.

00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:32.082
I KNOW YOU REMEMBER.
THINK, JOEY.

00:19:32.082 --> 00:19:34.885
I SAID YOU'RE TOO LATE,
YOU FOOL.

00:19:34.885 --> 00:19:37.487
ROCKET WARRIOR,
ATTACK NOW.

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:38.955
IN ITS INVINCIBLE MODE,

00:19:38.955 --> 00:19:41.324
IT WILL WEAKEN
YOUR RED-EYES WHILE
REMAINING UNHARMED.

00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:50.133
JOEY, HOLD ON.

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:52.135
I JUST WANT
TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING OF MINE.

00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:55.071
AND NOW MY ATTRITION
CARD ACTIVATES.

00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:57.407
IT TAKES THE ATTACK POINTS
OF MY ROCKET WARRIOR

00:19:57.407 --> 00:19:58.942
AND SUBTRACTS THEM
FROM YOUR RED-EYES,

00:19:58.942 --> 00:20:01.378
MAKING IT EVEN WEAKER.

00:20:01.378 --> 00:20:04.347
HOW SAD.

00:20:04.347 --> 00:20:05.548
Marik:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:20:05.548 --> 00:20:08.718
I FEEL MY CONTROL
WEAKENING AGAIN.

00:20:08.718 --> 00:20:11.221
YOU'RE MY
BEST FRIEND.

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:13.657
AND JUST LIKE
YOU GAVE ME
YOUR RED-EYES,

00:20:13.657 --> 00:20:15.825
I WANNA GIVE YOU
SOMETHING THAT'S
MEANINGFUL TO ME.

00:20:15.825 --> 00:20:17.961
NO. FORGET ABOUT HIM.

00:20:17.961 --> 00:20:21.264
AAH! WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO ME?

00:20:21.264 --> 00:20:24.034
JOEY, IT'S ME.

00:20:24.034 --> 00:20:25.735
PLEASE TAKE THIS.

00:20:25.735 --> 00:20:28.405
IT'S MY MOST
PRECIOUS POSSESSION.

00:20:28.405 --> 00:20:30.273
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:20:30.273 --> 00:20:35.145
NOW A PIECE OF ME
WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

00:20:35.145 --> 00:20:36.146
TAKE CARE OF IT, JOEY.
IT'S YOURS NOW.
