WEBVTT

00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:02.358
Yami-Yugi:
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:02.358 --> 00:00:04.994
Joey: I'VE ATTACKED YOUR
LIFE POINTS YET AGAIN, YUGI!

00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:06.396
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:08.398
AS SOON AS I
WIPE OUT THE REST

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:11.167
THAT ANCHOR WILL DROP
TAKING YOU WITH IT!

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.503
MARIK, I KNOW
THE REAL JOEY
IS IN THERE

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:15.104
AND I'M GOING
TO SET HIM FREE

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:16.673
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!

00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:18.708
Tristan: HOLD ON TIGHT SERENITY!

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:21.177
Man: I GUESS WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS
THE HARD WAY!

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.915
Duke Devlin: AND THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM, TOUGH GUY.

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:27.617
WHOA, IS THAT DUKE DEVLIN!?

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.885
THE ONE AND ONLY!

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.688
AND NOW I SACRIFICE
MY TWO MONSTERS...

00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:35.058
SO I CAN SUMMON
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:37.794
IT'S MY RED-EYES.

00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:39.362
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:42.131
I'M LOSING CONTROL
OF MY MIND SLAVE!

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:44.234
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND...

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.169
AND JUST LIKE YOU
GAVE ME YOUR RED-EYES,

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:48.972
I WANNA GIVE YOU SOMETHING
THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO ME.

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:50.940
IT'S MY MOST PRECIOUS
POSSESSION.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.375
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.777
TAKE CARE OF IT JOEY.
IT'S YOURS NOW.

00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:02.952
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:05.255
♪ YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:12.729
♪ YU-GI-OH! ♪

00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:35.151
IT'S TIME

00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:37.553
TO D-D-D-DUEL.

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:54.170
♪ YU-GI-OH! ♪

00:01:57.774 --> 00:02:01.110
Yugi: I WANT YOU TO KEEP
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE, JOEY.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.912
IT BELONGS TO YOU NOW.

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:05.114
HOPEFULLY THAT PUZZLE
WILL FREE JOEY

00:02:05.114 --> 00:02:08.151
FROM MARIK'S MIND CONTROL
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:11.421
CAUSE THAT ANCHOR'S
GONNA FALL INTO THE OCEAN
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.356
TAKING ME AND JOEY WITH IT!

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:17.293
BUT IF JOEY COMES TO HIS SENSES
SOON, WE MAY BE ABLE TO ESCAPE!

00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:20.396
I GAVE HIM MY PUZZLE AS A SYMBOL
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:22.832
JUST LIKE HE GAVE ME
HIS RED-EYES.

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.402
AND I KNOW OUR BOND IS STRONGER
THAN MARIK'S MAGIC!

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:29.505
I'VE ALREADY SEEN SIGNS
OF MARIK'S POWER WEAKENING.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:32.108
WHEN JOEY SAW HIS
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON

00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:34.177
IT TRIGGERED SOMETHING
INSIDE HIM.

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:36.879
MARIK MAY BE ABLE TO
CONTROL JOEY'S MIND

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.082
BUT HE CAN'T CONTROL
JOEY'S HEART.

00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:40.683
YUGI'S...PUZZLE...

00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:41.718
JOEY...

00:02:41.718 --> 00:02:43.086
ARE YOU IN THERE!?

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.320
IGNORE HIM!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.190
HE'S TRYING TO BRIBE YOU
WITH THAT PUZZLE!

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.792
YUGI IS YOUR ENEMY
AND I AM YOUR MASTER

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.628
SO LISTEN TO ME NOW!

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:56.366
THE PUZZLE MUST BE WON IN A DUEL
IN ORDER TO USE ITS MAGIC.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:59.969
SO UNTIL WE WIN THIS DUEL
IT'S USELESS TO ME!

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.838
NOW DESTROY YUGI!

00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:04.006
DESTROY! YUGI!

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:06.676
THAT'S RIGHT!
HE WANTS TO HURT YOU!

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:09.345
SO GET RID OF
HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:12.248
HURL IT INTO THE OCEAN
SO YUGI CAN'T WEAKEN US!

00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:14.817
AND ONCE WE WIN THIS DUEL...

00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:18.955
I'LL SEND MY RARE HUNTERS INTO
THE SEA TO RETRIEVE THE PUZZLE.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:22.725
IT'S DESTINY, AND I WILL NOT
BE DENIED MY FATE!

00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:25.828
Joey: SAY GOODBYE TO
YOUR PUZZLE, LITTLE YUGI!

00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:27.964
FIGHT IT, JOEY.

00:03:27.964 --> 00:03:29.732
THE ONLY THING
I'M FIGHTING IS YOU!

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.168
THAT'S RIGHT, SHOW YUGI
YOU DON'T NEED IT

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:35.605
AND THROW THAT THING
INTO THE OCEAN, MY MIND SLAVE!

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:36.773
FAREWELL.

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:38.608
Yugi: WAIT JOEY!
DON'T DO IT!

00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:39.742
DO IT!

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:41.577
Yugi: PLEASE STOP!

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:42.979
PLEASE STOP!

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.814
MY GRANDPA JUST GAVE ME
THAT PUZZLE!

00:03:44.814 --> 00:03:46.649
SORRY TWERP!

00:03:48.317 --> 00:03:51.154
HAVE YOU WIMPS HAD ENOUGH...
OR DO YOU WANT MORE?

00:03:51.154 --> 00:03:53.256
CAUSE I'M NOT THROUGH
WITH YOU JUST YET!

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:54.624
LEAVE THEM ALONE!

00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:56.726
THESE GUYS ARE MY FRIENDS!
GOT IT!?

00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:59.195
I CAN'T BELIEVE DIS KIDS
STANDIN' UP FOR US!

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:01.664
EVEN AFTA I TOSSED HIS PUZZLE
OUT DA WINDOW!

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:03.232
WELL I'M GONNA GET IT BACK.

00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:04.801
DIS YUGI'S A TRUE PAL!

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.771
THROW IT NOW!

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.445
I SHOULDN'T...

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:18.114
TOSS HIS PUZZLE.

00:04:18.114 --> 00:04:20.650
I CAN'T!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.219
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
YOU FOOL!

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.855
GET UP AND DISPOSE
OF THAT PUZZLE!

00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:30.026
NO...YUGI'S...
MY...FRIEND.

00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:32.528
I'M LOSING
MY GRIP AGAIN!

00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:33.629
ALRIGHT!

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.133
KEEP THE PUZZLE
IF YOU WANT.

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.267
YES SIR.

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:40.169
KEEP DA PUZZLE.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.473
PUZZLE OR NO PUZZLE YOU'LL
DESTROY YUGI FOR ME!

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:46.542
YOUR LITTLE FRIENDSHIP PLAN
WON'T WORK YUGI!

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.911
YOUR FRIEND'S MIND
BELONGS TO ME!

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:50.446
HEAR ME!?

00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:51.647
PREPARE FOR DEFEAT!

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:54.383
YUGI! GET ON WITH THE DUEL!

00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:56.352
THE SOONER YOU
MAKE YOUR MOVE

00:04:56.352 --> 00:04:59.021
THE SOONER I CAN ELIMINATE
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:00.890
AND YOU'D BETTER ACT QUICKLY

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.692
BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE
FOURTEEN MINUTES

00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:05.094
BEFORE THAT ANCHOR PULLS YOU
AND YOUR BEST FRIEND

00:05:05.094 --> 00:05:06.863
INTO THE OCEAN'S DEPTHS!

00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:10.233
YOU'LL BE OUT OF MY WAY
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:16.297
MAKE YOUR MOVE LITTLE YUGI!

00:05:16.297 --> 00:05:17.365
FINE!

00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:19.133
SINCE YOUR TURN
IS NOW OVER,

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:21.369
RED-EYES REGAINS 500
OF THE ATTACK POINTS

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:23.371
IT LOST LAST TURN,
MARIK!

00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:26.340
GET READY!

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.476
Yugi, voice-over: BETA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR COULD HELP!

00:05:28.476 --> 00:05:31.579
I NEED TO FREE JOEY'S MIND
FROM MARIK'S CONTROL!

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:35.249
AND LAST TURN WHEN MARIK
FORCED HIM TO ATTACK
HIS FAVORITE CARD--

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.686
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON--
THE REAL JOEY BROKE THROUGH.

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:42.156
SO I HAVE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
AGAIN IF I'M GOING TO SAVE HIM

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.325
AND GET US OUTTA THIS MESS!

00:05:44.325 --> 00:05:46.827
BUT RED-EYES IS WEAK
AND IF IT DOES GET ATTACKED,

00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:48.296
I COULD LOSE THIS DUEL TO MARIK

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:50.164
AND PUT THE WHOLE WORLD
IN DANGER!

00:05:50.164 --> 00:05:53.167
I PLACE TWO CARDS FACEDOWN!

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:58.072
AND THEN I SUMMON
BETA THE MAGNET WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:05:58.072 --> 00:06:00.174
AND THAT WILL END
MY TURN.

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:01.642
HOW FOOLISH!

00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:03.811
HE COULD HAVE ATTACKED US!

00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:07.148
INSTEAD HE LEFT HIMSELF
WIDE OPEN FOR US TO ATTACK HIM!

00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:09.517
SO DON'T DISAPPOINT ME NOW!

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:11.285
Joey: IT'S TIME TO END THIS!

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:12.653
Marik: EXCELLENT!

00:06:12.653 --> 00:06:16.057
PANTHER WARRIOR IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO DESTROY THAT RED-EYES

00:06:16.057 --> 00:06:18.025
AND YUGI, TOO!

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:19.994
DESTROY YUGI.

00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:22.229
THAT'S RIGHT
MY OBEDIENT SERVANT!

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.364
SO DO IT!

00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:25.366
Joey: ALRIGHT LITTLE YUGI!

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:28.402
TIME TO WIPE OUT YOUR RED-EYES
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:30.071
Yami-Yugi: YUGI!
YOU'RE LOSING HIM!

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.673
MARIK'S HOLD ON JOEY
IS GETTING STRONGER!

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:34.308
Marik: DESTROY!

00:06:34.308 --> 00:06:35.476
DESTROY!

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:37.611
DESTROY!

00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:39.547
I PLAY PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:40.548
YOU'RE DONE!

00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:45.386
BUT FIRST, BEFORE I STRIKE,

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:49.957
I'LL TRANSFORM ROCKET WARRIOR
INTO ITS INVINCIBLE MODE!

00:06:49.957 --> 00:06:52.059
Marik: IT ALL ENDS HERE.

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.162
HIS RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON
IS BARELY ALIVE.

00:06:55.162 --> 00:06:58.232
THAT PATHETIC CREATURE
WON'T STAND A CHANCE

00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:02.069
AGAINST PANTHER WARRIOR'S
FEROCIOUS ONSLAUGHT.

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.039
AND WHEN THAT RED-EYES GOES...

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.575
SO DOES YUGI.

00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:11.178
THAT LITTLE RUNT
HAS ONLY 1000 LIFE POINTS.

00:07:11.178 --> 00:07:13.381
THIS DUEL'S OVER.

00:07:13.381 --> 00:07:16.617
IT'S THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!

00:07:16.617 --> 00:07:20.788
NOW WHEELER, ATTACK HIS RED-EYES
WITH YOUR PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:22.890
I'LL ATTACK
WITH ROCKET WARRIOR!

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.692
WHAT?!

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:28.129
AND THE TARGET SHALL BE
YUGI'S MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:32.733
BUT I COMMANDED YOU TO TAKE OUT
HIS RED-EYES, WHEELER!

00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:34.035
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:07:34.035 --> 00:07:37.605
HE'S NOT RESPONDING TO THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:39.073
Yugi: NOT SO FAST!

00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:41.976
I REVEAL MY FACE DOWN TRAP!

00:07:41.976 --> 00:07:43.944
ACTIVATE MAGIC-ARM SHIELD!

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:50.084
I'LL INTERCEPT
YOUR ROCKET WARRIOR

00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:52.586
AND REDIRECT
THE ROCKET ATTACK!

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.722
TOWARDS YOUR
PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:07:58.592 --> 00:08:01.162
AND THANKS TO
YOUR ATTRITION
MAGIC CARD,

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:04.398
PANTHER WARRIOR
LOSES FIFTEEN HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS

00:08:04.398 --> 00:08:09.003
BRINGING ITS STRENGTH
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 500!

00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:12.473
ALSO, BECAUSE
ROCKET WARRIOR WAS
IN ITS INVINCIBLE MODE,

00:08:12.473 --> 00:08:15.076
YOUR MONSTER
LOSES FIVE HUNDRED
EXTRA ATTACK POINTS

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:16.744
LEAVING IT WITH ZERO!

00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:18.546
I THINK MY PLAN WORKED.

00:08:18.546 --> 00:08:21.248
MARIK WOULD HAVE
ATTACKED MY RED-EYES
TO WIN THE DUEL,

00:08:21.248 --> 00:08:22.883
BUT JOEY
MUST'VE STOPPED HIM!

00:08:22.883 --> 00:08:25.486
VERY WELL, MY MIND SLAVE.

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:28.889
IT APPEARS YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
TO DISOBEY MY ORDERS...

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:31.559
AND DISRESPECT MY POWER.

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:33.861
BUT I ASSURE YOU
MY MILLENNIUM ROD

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.097
IS NOT A FORCE
TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY!

00:08:36.097 --> 00:08:39.767
ALL I NEED TO DO IS KEEP YOU
UNDER MY CONTROL LONG ENOUGH...

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:43.003
TO DESTROY LITTLE YUGI,
FOREVER!

00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:50.878
Serenity: I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT JOEY!

00:08:50.878 --> 00:08:52.580
DO YOU THINK HE'S OK?

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.381
Tristan: I'M SURE
HE'S FINE SERENITY!

00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:57.985
HE'S PROBABLY ON HIS WAY
TO THE BATTLE CITY
FINALS RIGHT NOW!

00:08:57.985 --> 00:09:00.521
UNLESS THE SAME THUGS THAT
ATTACKED US GOT TO HIM ALSO.

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.491
OH NO! MY POOR BROTHER!

00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:04.859
NICE GOIN!

00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:06.961
THE NEXT TIME
I NEED SOME WORDS
OF ENCOURAGEMENT

00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:08.863
REMIND ME
NOT TO CALL YOU!

00:09:08.863 --> 00:09:12.433
BUT I'M SURE HE'S DUELING
IN THE FINALS RIGHT NOW!

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:14.869
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHERE THE FINALS ARE.

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:17.338
THE QUICKEST WAY
IS TO FIND SOME DUELIST

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:19.306
AND HOPE THAT HE HAS
SIX LOCATOR CARDS.

00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:20.808
LET'S SEE...

00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:21.942
HEY, THERE'S ONE!

00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:23.377
AHH, HANG ON DUDE!

00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:24.812
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YA!

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:28.616
Joey: MAKE YOUR PATHETIC MOVE
LITTLE YUGI!

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:29.917
FINE MARIK!

00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:32.386
AND SINCE ROCKET WARRIOR'S
EFFECT IS OVER,

00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:35.923
MY PANTHER WARRIOR REGAINS
THE 500 ATTACK POINTS IT LOST!

00:09:35.923 --> 00:09:38.092
BIG DEAL!

00:09:38.092 --> 00:09:39.894
WATCH THIS MOVE!

00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:42.830
I SACRIFICE BETA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.301
SO I CAN SUMMON
MY BEAST OF GILFER!

00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:50.638
I'LL SAVE YOU YET, JOEY!

00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:53.007
NOW MY MIGHTY BEAST

00:09:53.007 --> 00:09:55.442
ATTACK HIS ROCKET WARRIOR!

00:10:05.152 --> 00:10:07.154
YOU THERE JOEY?

00:10:07.154 --> 00:10:09.290
NO! JOEY'S GONE!

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.058
YOU SEE UNLIKE YOUR DRAGON,

00:10:11.058 --> 00:10:12.793
I'VE GOT PLENTY
OF STRENGTH LEFT!

00:10:12.793 --> 00:10:14.094
HE'S RIGHT.

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:15.930
THANKS TO MARIK'S
MAGIC CARD,

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.266
RED-EYES IS DOWN
TO A MEASLY 900
ATTACK POINTS.

00:10:19.266 --> 00:10:21.001
AND I CAN'T LET IT
GET DESTROYED.

00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:23.170
IT MAY BE MY ONLY
HOPE TO SAVE JOEY

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.005
AND THE ENTIRE WORLD
FROM MARIK!

00:10:25.005 --> 00:10:27.474
Joey: I'M AFRAID IT'S
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

00:10:27.474 --> 00:10:29.109
BEFORE YOU
AND YOUR PATHETIC FRIEND

00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:31.212
ARE OUT OF MY WAY
FOR GOOD!

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:38.185
Tristan: WHADDA YOU MEAN YOU
ONLY HAVE ONE LOCATOR CARD?

00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:39.787
TAKE A HIKE!

00:10:39.787 --> 00:10:42.156
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
A DUELIST?

00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:45.226
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY LUCK?

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:48.128
NOPE, I COULDN'T FIND
ANY DUELISTS AT ALL.

00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:50.130
WELL EXCUSE ME
FOR TRYIN' 'A HELP!

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.432
HEY!

00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:53.267
SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE!?

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:55.603
Tristan, voice-over:
THAT DUKE DEVLIN'S
GOT A LOT A NERVE

00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:57.605
HOLDING SERENITY'S HAND
LIKE THAT!

00:10:57.605 --> 00:10:59.073
Man: THEY MUST BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

00:10:59.073 --> 00:11:00.841
Tristan:
IT'S THOSE CAPED CREEPS!

00:11:02.443 --> 00:11:04.812
AND THEY SPOTTED US! RUN!

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.881
WAIT A SEC GUYS!

00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:09.116
ARE YOU NUTS?

00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:10.351
THEY'LL CATCH US!

00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:12.319
LOOK, JUST TAKE SERENITY
AND RUN!

00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:13.520
HUH? AND YOU?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.823
I GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO.

00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:17.458
C'MON, MOVE IT, NOW!

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:18.592
I'M MOVIN' IT!

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:20.894
HERE, SERENITY, THIS WAY.

00:11:20.894 --> 00:11:21.929
WE GOT ONE!

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:23.297
OH YEAH?!

00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:26.400
WE'LL SEE WHO'S GOT WHO
WHEN THIS THING'S OVER!

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.169
SO WHO'S GONNA BE FIRST?

00:11:33.641 --> 00:11:34.708
WATCH IT!

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:36.176
CROSS ON THE GREEN
NOT IN-BETWEEN!

00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:38.078
PLEASE HELP US!

00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:40.848
WE'RE BEING CHASED
BY A GANG OF
ROBED WEIRDOES!

00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:49.847
Joey: I HOPE YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE LITTLE TEA.

00:11:49.847 --> 00:11:52.950
IN THE FRONT ROW SEAT
TO YOUR FRIENDS' LAST DUEL!

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.853
AS LONG AS NO ONE INTERFERES,
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:11:55.853 --> 00:11:58.522
BUT I CAN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR YUGI!

00:11:58.522 --> 00:12:00.791
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS MARIK!

00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.727
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG,
LITTLE YUGI!

00:12:03.727 --> 00:12:06.563
IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES
THE ANCHOR HANGING ABOVE YOU

00:12:06.563 --> 00:12:08.732
WILL DROP INTO THE OCEAN
TAKING YOU

00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:11.034
AND YOUR FRIEND JOEY
WITH IT!

00:12:11.034 --> 00:12:13.136
ANY QUESTIONS?

00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:16.907
IF YOU GOONS
HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH,

00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:19.109
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

00:12:19.109 --> 00:12:20.110
WELL!?

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.747
WHERE'RE MY FRIENDS
YOU FREAK!?

00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:25.115
SPILL IT! NOW!

00:12:25.115 --> 00:12:26.583
D-DOMINO PIER.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:27.951
THEY BETTER BE!

00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:29.086
IT'S TRUE.

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:34.024
HEY TRISTAN.
NEED A LIFT?

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:36.560
HEY MAI HOW DID YOU ALL
END UP TOGETHER?

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.395
I TOLD HER WE WERE PALS
WITH YOU AND JOEY

00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:40.998
AND SHE SAID HOP IN.

00:12:40.998 --> 00:12:42.532
Mai: ALRIGHT TRISTAN.

00:12:42.532 --> 00:12:44.468
BASED ON YOUR DESCRIPTION
OF THOSE CREEPS...

00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:47.137
THEY SOUND LIKE THESE
RARE HUNTERS I'VE BEEN
HEARING ABOUT LATELY.

00:12:47.137 --> 00:12:49.172
AND WHAT'S
A RARE HUNTER?

00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:51.909
THEY'RE UNDERGROUND DUELISTS
THAT LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL.

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:54.044
THEIR GOAL IS COLLECTING
RARE CARDS.

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:57.014
AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
THEY KIDNAPPED YOUR FRIENDS.

00:12:57.014 --> 00:12:59.216
THIS ISN'T THE WAY!
TURN AROUND!

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:00.584
SURE IT IS, SEE!

00:13:00.584 --> 00:13:02.920
I WON SIX LOCATOR CARDS!

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.254
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:05.656
THEY'RE NOT THERE MAI.

00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:07.824
THEY'RE AT A PIER
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE CITY!

00:13:07.824 --> 00:13:10.327
ARE YOU SURE, TRISTAN?

00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:12.696
YEP! I GOT IT STRAIGHT
FROM THOSE CREEPS!

00:13:12.696 --> 00:13:13.730
SO LET'S GO!

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.032
RIGHT!

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.468
HOLD ON TIGHT!

00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:20.337
DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!

00:13:22.406 --> 00:13:24.808
Mai: WE'RE COMIN'
TO GET YOU GUYS!

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:32.149
Joey: I CAN BARELY CONTAIN
MY EXCITEMENT LITTLE YUGI!

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:35.886
SAY GOODBYE TO THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:37.287
Marik: SKULL DICE.

00:13:37.287 --> 00:13:39.690
THIS TRAP CARD MAY HELP...

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.759
EITHER WAY I CAN'T LOSE!

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:46.496
I'LL WIN IF LITTLE YUGI'S LIFE
POINTS ARE REDUCED TO ZERO.

00:13:46.496 --> 00:13:48.498
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY.

00:13:50.534 --> 00:13:54.638
WHEN THE TIMER RUNS OUT
I'LL AUTOMATICALLY WIN!

00:13:54.638 --> 00:13:57.941
WHILE YUGI AND HIS BEST FRIEND
WHEELER ARE REUNITED AGAIN

00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:59.743
IN THE SEA!

00:13:59.743 --> 00:14:01.845
AND OF COURSE,
ONCE YUGI IS DEFEATED

00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:04.047
I'LL POSSESS
HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:14:04.047 --> 00:14:07.718
AND HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:10.187
Joey: READY TO LOSE EVERYTHING?

00:14:10.187 --> 00:14:11.555
Yugi: COME ON JOEY!

00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:13.123
YOU GOTTA BREAK FREE!

00:14:13.123 --> 00:14:14.725
Marik: LISTEN, TO ME.

00:14:14.725 --> 00:14:16.560
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO...

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.794
HE'LL LOSE.

00:14:17.794 --> 00:14:20.864
SO WE CAN DESTROY HIM
WITH OUR MAGIC CARDS...

00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:22.499
OR JUST KEEP WAITING...

00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:23.934
WHEN TIME'S UP,

00:14:23.934 --> 00:14:26.436
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I'LL BE THE VICTOR!

00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:28.171
SNAP OUT OF IT JOEY!

00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:29.740
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.908
IF I BRING UP
MORE OLD STORIES,

00:14:31.908 --> 00:14:33.643
MAYBE HE'LL REMEMBER
SOMETHING!

00:14:33.643 --> 00:14:35.512
COME ON JOEY.

00:14:35.512 --> 00:14:37.581
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
DUELIST KINGDOM?

00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:39.282
YOU GOTTA TRY!

00:14:39.282 --> 00:14:40.517
THINK BACK.

00:14:40.517 --> 00:14:41.852
'MEMBER HOW
YOU WANTED TO WIN

00:14:41.852 --> 00:14:44.855
SO YOU COULD PAY FOR
YOUR SISTER'S OPERATION?

00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:47.057
SERENITY WAS
YOUR INSPIRATION

00:14:47.057 --> 00:14:50.027
AND THANKS TO YOU,
SHE'LL SEE AGAIN.

00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:54.631
SE REN I TY...

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:57.334
HANG IN THERE,
SERENITY!

00:14:57.334 --> 00:15:00.303
SIR, WE'VE GOT TO GET HER
INTO SURGERY, NOW.

00:15:00.303 --> 00:15:02.172
I'M RIGHT HERE!

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:03.507
BE STRONG!

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:06.243
YOU KEPT YOUR PROMISE
TO HER, JOEY.

00:15:06.243 --> 00:15:08.979
AND DON'T FORGET THE PLEDGE
YOU MADE TO ME.

00:15:08.979 --> 00:15:10.547
IT'S TRUE!

00:15:10.547 --> 00:15:12.449
WE'LL WHOOP THIS MARIK CREEP

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:14.418
AND HIS RARE HUNTER
GOON-SQUAD SO HARD

00:15:14.418 --> 00:15:16.086
THEY WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT 'EM!

00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:18.789
THEY'LL BE SORRY THEY EVER
DECIDED TO MESS WITH US!

00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:21.124
I...PROMISED...

00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:22.459
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:24.061
AND YOU NEVER BROKE
A PROMISE!

00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:27.564
THEN I PROMISE
TO ANNIHILATE YOU,
LITTLE YUGI!

00:15:27.564 --> 00:15:30.233
SO I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:15:30.233 --> 00:15:33.036
AND...END MY TURN,

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:36.540
SO, TRY AND ATTACK
MY PANTHER WARRIOR
IF YOU DARE!

00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:41.011
Marik, voice-over:
ONCE HE DOES, I'LL CRUSH HIM!

00:15:41.011 --> 00:15:43.713
LITTLE YUGI CAN TRY TO REASON
WITH HIS FRIEND JOEY

00:15:43.713 --> 00:15:45.348
ALL HE WANTS...

00:15:45.348 --> 00:15:48.251
HE'LL NEVER BREAK THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:50.987
AND SOON VICTORY WILL BE MINE!

00:15:50.987 --> 00:15:53.657
EXCELLENT DUELING
MY MIND SLAVE!

00:15:53.657 --> 00:15:55.358
IT'S ALMOST OVER!

00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:56.793
PLEASE WAKE UP!!

00:15:56.793 --> 00:16:00.130
Joey: HAVEN'T YOU REALIZED THAT
YOUR FRIEND ISN'T COMING BACK!

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.898
YOU'RE DEALING WITH ME NOW

00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:05.268
AND I'M ABOUT TO TAKE
EVERYTHING AWAY FROM YOU!

00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:11.715
Yugi: YOU GOTTA SNAP
OUT OF THIS JOEY!

00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:13.650
TIME'S RUNNING OUT!

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.051
THIS TRAP CARD MAY HELP.

00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:16.553
NOTHING CAN SAVE YOU!!

00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:20.156
WELL I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN AND NOW...

00:16:20.156 --> 00:16:21.358
BEAST OF GILFER!

00:16:21.358 --> 00:16:23.293
ATTACK HIS PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:16:25.362 --> 00:16:27.831
THIS IS FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD JOEY!

00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:33.403
YOU'VE FALLEN RIGHT INTO
MY TRAP, LITTLE YUGI!

00:16:33.403 --> 00:16:35.905
AND YOUR FOOLISH MISTAKE
WILL COST YOU DEARLY!

00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:38.208
AS SOON AS YOUR BEAST ATTACKS
YOU'RE DONE!

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.243
DON'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT THAT!

00:16:40.243 --> 00:16:44.347
GILFER, ROAST
HIS PANTHER WITH
YOUR FLAME ATTACK!

00:16:44.347 --> 00:16:45.649
WRONG!

00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:47.884
REVEAL MY SKULL DICE!

00:16:47.884 --> 00:16:50.253
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE
MY MOVE WORKS...

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:51.821
I'LL ADD THIS CARD!

00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:53.256
MY GRACEFUL DICE!

00:16:53.256 --> 00:16:55.025
STOP HIS ATTACK NOW!

00:16:56.693 --> 00:16:59.963
GRACEFUL DICE WILL INCREASE
MY MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:16:59.963 --> 00:17:02.499
ACCORDING TO THE ROLL
OF THE DIE!

00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:07.370
WHILE SKULL DICE REDUCES
YOUR MONSTER'S STRENGTH!

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.273
AND I'M FEELING
VERY LUCKY TODAY!

00:17:10.273 --> 00:17:11.474
GUESS AGAIN!

00:17:11.474 --> 00:17:12.676
WHAT?!

00:17:12.676 --> 00:17:15.879
NOW I REVEAL
MY MAGIC CARD DE-SPELL!

00:17:15.879 --> 00:17:18.748
I'LL USE IT TO DESTROY
YOUR GRACEFUL DICE!

00:17:21.918 --> 00:17:23.720
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT
YOU MARIK,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.822
BUT NOW YOU CAN'T RAISE
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:17:25.822 --> 00:17:27.490
OF YOUR PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.492
BUT I CAN STILL WEAKEN
YOUR MONSTER!

00:17:29.492 --> 00:17:31.127
GO SKULL DICE!

00:17:33.963 --> 00:17:35.198
A TWO!?

00:17:35.198 --> 00:17:36.599
SORRY,

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:39.569
THAT ONLY CUTS
MY MONSTER'S ATTACK
STRENGTH IN HALF!

00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:41.471
MY PANTHER'S DOOMED!

00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:52.115
Tristan: IT'S DOWN THERE!

00:17:52.115 --> 00:17:54.217
TIME TO CRASH
THIS PARTY! NOW!

00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:58.188
I'M SCARED GUYS.

00:17:58.188 --> 00:17:59.856
Tristan: EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE SERENITY!

00:17:59.856 --> 00:18:01.257
HE'S RIGHT.

00:18:01.257 --> 00:18:03.693
WITH ME ON YOUR SIDE
YOU CAN'T LOSE SERENITY!

00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:05.261
WE'LL GET JOEY
OUTTA HERE

00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:07.797
AND PRETTY SOON
YOU'LL BE WATCHING HIM
DUEL IN THE FINALS!

00:18:07.797 --> 00:18:09.199
THANKS, MAI.

00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:12.569
Duke Devlin:
HEY! SOMETHING'S
GOING ON OVER THERE!

00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:14.070
IT LOOKS LIKE A DUEL!

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.606
YOU MAY HAVE DESTROYED
MY PANTHER WARRIOR

00:18:16.606 --> 00:18:19.542
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE
THIS DUEL, LITTLE YUGI!

00:18:19.542 --> 00:18:21.544
IN JUST OVER 5 MINUTES,

00:18:21.544 --> 00:18:23.780
YOU'LL SINK TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.915
WHILE I ACQUIRE
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:18:25.915 --> 00:18:28.251
AND YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:31.688
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO GET THROUGH TO JOEY
AND SAVE US BOTH!

00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:34.124
YUGI ONLY HAS 1000
LIFE POINTS LEFT!

00:18:34.124 --> 00:18:36.259
ONE MORE MAJOR ATTACK
BY JOEY

00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:39.028
AND THAT ANCHOR'S
GONNA TAKE HIM DOWN, SETO!

00:18:39.028 --> 00:18:40.830
BUT IF THAT TIMER
RUNS OUT FIRST,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.433
YUGI AND WHEELER
WILL BOTH BE FISH FOOD.

00:18:49.973 --> 00:18:51.007
HEY JOEY!

00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:53.009
YUGI!

00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:54.544
THEY FOUND US!!

00:18:54.544 --> 00:18:55.979
Tea: HELP US GUYS!

00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:57.380
TEA?!

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.482
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:00.917
DON'T GET ANY CLOSER!

00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:02.619
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:04.921
CHECK IT OUT.

00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:06.790
IF WE TRY TO SAVE TEA,

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.759
THAT RARE HUNTER
WILL RELEASE THE CRATE
HANGING ABOVE HER HEAD!

00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:13.029
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
TO RISK, TRISTAN!

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:14.664
WHY WOULD THEY
WANNA DO THAT?

00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:17.167
SO WE DON'T BREAK UP JOEY
AND YUGI'S DUEL.

00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:18.701
THAT'S JUST SICK!

00:19:18.701 --> 00:19:20.470
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S SICK TRISTAN,

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.406
JUST LOOK AT THE DUELING SET-UP
THESE GUYS PUT TOGETHER!

00:19:23.406 --> 00:19:24.741
WHOA!
WHOA!
WHOA!

00:19:24.741 --> 00:19:26.743
Mai: THESE GUYS
DON'T MESS AROUND!

00:19:26.743 --> 00:19:30.680
Tristan: MAN! WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE ANCHOR AND THE CHAINS?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.983
AND HOW COME YUGI AND JOEY
ARE DUELING IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:37.020
C'MON WILL SOMEONE PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.923
YOUR FRIEND WHEELER
IS ON THEIR SIDE.

00:19:39.923 --> 00:19:40.924
HUH?

00:19:40.924 --> 00:19:42.926
WAIT. WHOSE SIDE?

00:19:42.926 --> 00:19:44.561
SOMEHOW JOEY
LOST HIS MIND,

00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:46.930
AND NOW HE'S DUELING
ON THE RARE HUNTERS' SIDE!

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.465
WHOEVER LOSES GETS PULLED
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA!

00:19:49.465 --> 00:19:50.633
THAT'S INSANE!

00:19:50.633 --> 00:19:52.035
WE GOTTA STOP THIS!

00:19:52.035 --> 00:19:53.469
BUT WE CAN'T.

00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:56.039
MY BROTHER!

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:58.908
Tea, voice-over: I CAN'T LET
SERENITY SEE JOEY LIKE THIS!

00:19:58.908 --> 00:20:00.410
SHE'LL BE DEVASTATED!

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.911
SERENITY!

00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:04.948
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
YOUR BANDAGES OFF YET!

00:20:04.948 --> 00:20:06.216
LISTEN!

00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:09.586
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME
ON THIS ONE, OK!?

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:11.855
Tea, voice-over: SERENITY LIVES
FOR HER BIG BROTHER!

00:20:11.855 --> 00:20:15.058
IF HER FIRST SIGHT IS JOEY,
POSSESSED BY SOME EVIL NUTCASE,

00:20:15.058 --> 00:20:16.993
SHE WOULD NEVER GET OVER IT!

00:20:16.993 --> 00:20:19.028
POOR JOEY.

00:20:19.028 --> 00:20:20.463
DON'T YOU WORRY.

00:20:20.463 --> 00:20:23.433
IF ANYONE CAN SAVE JOEY
YUGI CAN.

00:20:23.433 --> 00:20:25.602
Joey: THE END IS NEAR, YUGI.

00:20:25.602 --> 00:20:27.403
I COULD JUST LET
THE TIMER RUN OUT,

00:20:27.403 --> 00:20:29.038
DESTROYING YOU AND JOEY...

00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:31.641
BUT OUT-DUELING YOU
WILL BE SO MUCH MORE FUN!

00:20:31.641 --> 00:20:33.343
AND NOW ALL OF
YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS

00:20:33.343 --> 00:20:35.411
ARE HERE TO WITNESS
YOUR DEMISE!

00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:37.914
SOOOO HERE GOES.

00:20:37.914 --> 00:20:39.916
METEOR OF DESTRUCTION!

00:20:39.916 --> 00:20:42.452
EXCELLENT WORK MY MIND SLAVE!

00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:45.355
THAT'S JUST THE CARD
WE NEED TO WIN.

00:20:45.355 --> 00:20:48.224
NOW, PLAY IT
AND WIN ME THAT PUZZLE!

00:20:48.224 --> 00:20:51.160
AND DESTROY YOUR BEST FRIEND!

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.097
Joey: ONE MORE MOVE
AND YOU'LL BE GONE FOR GOOD,

00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:56.132
WHILE I RULE THE WORLD!
