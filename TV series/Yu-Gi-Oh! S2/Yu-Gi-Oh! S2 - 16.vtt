THE WAY TO THIS ITEM, MY RING.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.154
SOON ALL SEVEN
WILL BELONG TO ME.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.592
EVIL.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:16.563
THE MYSTICAL MILLENNIUM ENERGIES
ARE GROWING STRONGER.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:18.832
I MUST BE GETTING CLOSER
TO THE SOURCE.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.000
YES.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.535
THE MILLENNIUM ITEM I SEEK
IS IN HERE.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:27.073
WHAT'S THIS?

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.709
THE FORCE IS GONE.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.584
THE PHARAOH'S TABLETS ARE HERE.

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:39.686
[CHUCKLING]
IT'S BEEN QUITE A LONG TIME

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.722
SINCE I'VE LAID MY EYES
ON THESE STONE CARVINGS.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:43.990
BUT I AM SURE,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.659
ONCE I OBTAIN THE SEVEN
MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.829
I CAN UNLOCK
THE SHADOW MAGIC IT DEPICTS.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.566
THIS SPIRIT HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE
OF THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.869
BUT DOESN'T KNOW ALL.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.404
FOR MY BROTHER...

00:08:57.404 --> 00:09:00.173
SEEKS A POWER
FAR MORE DANGEROUS!

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.209
YOU CANNOT STOP ME.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.311
YOU'D USE
YOUR MILLENNIUM ROD

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.714
ON YOUR OWN FLESH
AND BLOOD, MARIK?

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.817
IF YOU CONTINUE TO STAND
IN MY WAY, SISTER...

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:13.319
THEN YES.
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:18.792
THE PHARAOH'S POWER
ISN'T YOURS!

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:19.893
HUH?

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.227
MARIK!

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:26.900
[THINKING]
ONLY MY BROTHER'S FAILURE
CAN SAVE HIM.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.937
HE MUST NOT SUCCEED,
OR THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE IN JEOPARDY.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:35.508
THE TRUE PHARAOH IS
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP HIM.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.277
[THINKING]
ONCE I AM VICTORIOUS,

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:41.081
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE WILL BE
AROUND MY NECK AT LAST.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.283
THEN I CAN FOCUS
ON STRIPPING KAIBA

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.385
OF THE THIRD
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:49.122
ONCE I POSSESS ALL THREE,
I'LL COMBINE THEIR STRENGTH...

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.391
AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.094
I'LL DRAIN THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH HIMSELF!

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.829
NOTHING CAN STOP ME!

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:59.265
BATTLE CITY, AND THE WORLD,
WILL TREMBLE AT MY FEET!

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.536
YOUR PLAN WILL NEVER
WORK, MARIK.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.738
I'M AFRAID
IT ALREADY HAS.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:08.808
I'VE DRAWN YOU INTO A DUEL
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY WIN!

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:11.778
IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU,
PHARAOH!

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.079
ALL RIGHT, MARIK...

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.581
NO MORE TALK!

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:23.890
PREPARE TO BE DESTROYED
BY THE FORCE OF MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.128
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.830
LET'S DUEL!

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:37.804
YOU AND YOUR
MIND-SLAVE WILL NEVER
WIN MY PUZZLE, MARIK!

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.974
I DISAGREE.
AND NOW...

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.643
I SET ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:48.248
AND PLAY THIS MONSTER
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:50.183
MEET HUMANOID SLIME!

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.190
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE END FOR YOU, PHARAOH.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.860
SO MAKE YOUR MOVE,
AND PREPARE TO LOSE
EVERYTHING.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.195
YOU WILL FAIL!

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.865
AH, SINCE HE PLAYED
A REALLY WEAK MONSTER,

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:07.967
I BET HE WANTS
ME TO ATTACK IT!

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:11.471
THEN HE'LL USE
HIS FACEDOWN CARD
TO DESTROY MY MONSTER.

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:14.440
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA LET HIM
GET A WAY WITH IT!

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.576
I ALSO SET
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:20.547
AND THEN I'LL SUMMON
A MONSTER KNOWN AS GAZELLE,

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:23.983
THE KING OF MYTHICAL BEASTS,
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:27.754
[GROWLING]

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:29.389
A STRONGER BEAST
THAN YOURS!

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:32.725
YES, YOUR MONSTER
IS ALMOST TWICE
AS STRONG AS MINE.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:35.895
BUT, DON'T BE SO CONFIDENT
THAT YOUR GAZELLE
WILL PREVAIL.

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.865
IT TAKES MORE THAN STRENGTH
TO WIN A DUEL.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.600
I AM WELL AWARE OF THAT.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.202
THEN YOU WON'T
BE SURPRISED

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.405
WHEN MY HUMANOID SLIME
ANNIHILATES YOUR MONSTER!

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:48.508
HMM, I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU
TRY THAT, MARIK.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.077
VERY WELL.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:53.379
I SUMMON...
WORM DRAKE.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.150
[ROARING]

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.787
NOW WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I ACTIVATE
MY MAGIC CARD!

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:02.889
TIME FOR POLYMERIZATION!

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:07.093
I'LL USE IT TO FUSE HUMANOID
SLIME AND WORM DRAKE TOGETHER

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.429
INTO A DIABOLICAL NEW MONSTER!

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.268
[ROARING]
BEHOLD MY NEW WEAPON...

00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:17.136
HUMANOID WORM DRAKE!

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:20.073
ITS 2200 ATTACK POINTS
ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.608
TO DESTROY YOUR GAZELLE,

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:24.644
AS WELL AS A PORTION
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:27.380
WHEN YOU FUSE
TWO MONSTERS TOGETHER,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.916
YOU MUST WAIT ONE TURN
BEFORE YOU CAN ATTACK!

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.719
SO YOU'VE LEFT YOURSELF
WIDE OPEN, MARIK.

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.487
THAT'S OF NO CONCERN
TO ME.

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:36.956
RULES ARE MEANT
TO BE MANIPULATED.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:40.226
AND MY FACEDOWN CARD
WILL TAKE CARE OF
THAT TASK FOR ME.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.495
I'VE SIMPLY
OUTSMARTED YOU, PHARAOH!

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.596
LET'S SEE!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.331
JUST AS YOU WISH!

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.433
REVEAL FACE DOWN CARD!

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.769
THE QUICK ATTACK MAGIC CARD!

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.137
YOU CAN ATTACK NOW!

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.039
VERY PERCEPTIVE.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.374
QUICK ATTACK ALLOWS MY MONSTER

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:57.176
TO ATTACK IN THE SAME TURN
IT WAS FORMED!

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:01.114
HMM, YOU'VE UNDERESTIMATED ME
AS A DUELIST...

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.882
AND FOR THAT
YOU MUST PAY A PRICE.

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:05.151
SO WATCH AS I DESTROY
YOUR MONSTER

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:06.486
AND MOVE ONE STEP CLOSER

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:09.522
TO RELIEVING YOU OF YOUR
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE FOREVER!

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:12.492
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR ME, PHARAOH!

00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:13.726
HMM.

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:16.963
NOW WATCH, AS MY
HUMANOID WORM ATTACKS!

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.465
DESTROY HIS GAZELLE,
MY BEAST!

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.633
[ROARING]

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.635
HA! HOLD ON, MARIK!

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:27.740
ACTIVATE DE-FUSION,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.677
TURNING YOUR ONE MONSTER
INTO TWO AGAIN!

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:33.179
OH! SO YOU KNEW MY PLAN
AT THE START.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:35.114
YES. AS SOON AS YOU
PLAYED A MONSTER

00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:37.583
AS WEAK AS
HUMANOID SLIME
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:41.387
I KNEW THEN AND THERE
THAT YOU WERE LURING ME
TO ATTACK IT, MARIK.

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:43.456
AND I THOUGHT
YOU FELL FOR IT.

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.692
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO THINK,

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:47.827
BUT IT WAS REALLY I
WHO WAS LURING YOU

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.629
TO USE YOUR HIDDEN
MAGIC CARD

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.931
SO THAT
I COULD REVERSE IT.

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:55.268
I WAS HOPING FOR
A FAR MORE CHALLENGING
DUEL FROM YOU...

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:57.403
BUT YOU'VE ONLY
DISAPPOINTED ME.

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:00.573
THIS DUEL'S FAR FROM OVER.

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.675
YOU'LL NEVER WIN
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.744
IF YOU CONTINUE DUELING
LIKE THAT!

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:08.381
HUH, IT SEEMS YOU'RE AS SMART
AS THEY SAY YOU ARE.

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.883
BUT THAT LAST TURN
WAS ONLY A TEST.

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:14.921
I WILL NOT BE DENIED MY VICTORY
OR YOUR PUZZLE!

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.423
YOU WILL IF YOU KEEP
MAKING AMATEUR MOVES.

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:20.560
YOU SHALL WITNESS MY TRUE SKILLS
IN DUE TIME.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.629
AND ONCE I DEFEAT YOU,

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:27.500
I'LL BECOME PHARAOH AND BANISH
YOU TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.737
THE RELENTLESS POWER
OF MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:33.940
WILL DELIVER ME YOUR PUZZLE
AND ASSURE YOUR DESTRUCTION!

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.575
PREPARE TO FACE A FORCE

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.543
THE LIKES OF WHICH
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN!

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:40.012
[GROWLING]

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:45.785
YOUR PUZZLE AND YOUR POWER
WILL SOON BE MINE!

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:48.154
ONLY IF YOU WIN.

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:51.891
[THINKING] BUSTER BLADER'S
TOO POWERFUL TO WASTE
ON HIS WEAK MONSTERS.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.094
BUT I'M SURE IT'LL COME
IN HANDY WHEN MARIK PLAYS
SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL,

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:57.764
SO I'LL HOLD IT
'TIL THE TIME IS RIGHT.

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.733
NOW I'LL DISPOSE
OF YOUR WEAK MONSTERS!

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.971
I PLAY
BETA THE MAGNET WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:07.039
DESTROY HIS WORM DRAKE,
NOW!

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.610
[GROANING]

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.212
AND NEXT MY GAZELLE
WILL ATTACK!

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:15.515
DESTROY
HIS HUMANOID SLIME

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:17.917
WITH YOUR CLAW
OF DESTRUCTION!

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.819
THE DIFFERENCE IN
THEIR ATTACK STRENGTHS

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:22.688
MEANS YOU LOSE
1,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:23.956
NOW, MARIK...

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.592
YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS
LEFT TO PROTECT YOU!

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.861
VERY IMPRESSIVE DUELING.

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.364
BUT I'M JUST TESTING OUT
YOUR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.299
SO THAT I CAN ULTIMATELY
DESTROY YOU

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.234
AND TAKE AWAY
ALL THAT YOU POSSESS!

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.870
IT'S TIME FOR ROUND TWO,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.973
AND THIS DUEL IS ABOUT
TO GET INTERESTING!

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:42.141
ARE YOU READY?

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.647
THE CARD I NOW HOLD
IS LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE
EVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:51.050
IT IS A CREATURE
THAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE DESTROYED.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.854
IT'S A SHAPELESS BEING MADE
COMPLETELY OF PLASMA,

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:56.522
WITH NO SOLID MASS,

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.491
MAKING IT
UTTERLY INDESTRUCTIBLE

00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.294
AND THE PERFECT DEFENSE
AGAINST ENEMY ATTACK.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:07.066
SO PREPARE TO EXPERIENCE
REVIVAL JAM IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.601
JUST TRY TO ATTACK!

00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:11.003
YOU WILL FAIL,
I TELL YOU.

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:12.839
IT LOOKS WEAK TO ME,
MARIK.

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.440
IT LOOKS WEAK DOES IT?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.275
WELL, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS!
AH!

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:25.084
IT'S MY JAM
BREEDING MACHINE!

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:28.287
AND IT BEGINS THE COUNTDOWN
TO YOUR DESTRUCTION!

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:32.758
WHAT'S IT DO?

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.827
THINK OF IT AS
A MONSTER-CREATING MACHINE,

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.930
BREATHING LIFE INTO
A NEW PLASMA CREATURE
EVERY TURN.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.833
AND THIS MACHINE WILL
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ME

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.602
WITH MORE AND MORE
PLASMA BEASTS

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:44.403
CALLED SLIME TOKENS!

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:46.105
YOUR PLAN'S OBVIOUS.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.007
YOU'RE GOING TO PRODUCE
PLASMA MONSTERS

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.042
UNTIL YOU HAVE
ENOUGH TO SACRIFICE

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.345
AND SUMMON
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.380
VERY IMPRESSIVE, PHARAOH.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.449
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.852
ONCE MY BREEDING MACHINE
CREATES THREE SLIME TOKENS,

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.355
I'LL BE ABLE
TO SUMMON THE MONSTER
THAT WILL BRING ABOUT

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.925
YOUR ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION--
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:09.829
AND THEN YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
WILL BELONG TO ME, FOREVER!

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.332
SORRY MARIK, BUT
AS LONG AS I BELIEVE

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:14.700
IN THE HEART
OF THE CARDS,

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.669
YOUR PLAN
WILL NEVER WORK.

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:18.704
SO PREPARE TO LOSE!

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.508
[THINKING]
MY BUSTER BLADER!

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.809
NOW'S THE PERFECT TIME
TO SUMMON HIM.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.745
I NEED TO WIPE OUT
MARIK'S LIFE POINTS

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.581
BEFORE HIS BREEDING MACHINE
CREATES THREE MORE MONSTERS!

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:32.118
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
MY TWO MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD...

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:34.353
TO SUMMON
THIS CREATURE--

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:37.690
MY ALL-POWERFUL
BUSTER BLADER!

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:43.829
MY EXPERT SWORDSMAN HAS
THE POWER TO WIPE OUT
YOUR REVIVAL JAM

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:47.266
AND MORE THAN HALF
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:50.703
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK STRENGTH
IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE, PHARAOH,

00:17:50.703 --> 00:17:54.240
BUT IT'S STILL USELESS
AGAINST MY REVIVAL JAM.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.274
WE'LL SEE!

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:57.310
NOW, MY SWORD-WIELDING
MONSTER...

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.478
DESTROY HIS REVIVAL JAM!

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.213
[GROWLING]

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.783
YOUR MONSTER'S
BEEN SPLATTERED!

00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:05.618
HAS IT?

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:13.926
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.328
IT'S REFORMING!

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:20.333
[LAUGHING]
YOU'RE SURPRISED?

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:24.070
I TOLD YOU MY REVIVAL JAM
EMPLOYED THE PERFECT DEFENSE.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.972
EVEN THE MOST POWERFUL SWORD

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.307
CANNOT DESTROY
MY PLASMA MONSTER.

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.610
IT WILL ALWAYS
REFORM ITSELF.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.178
SO I CAN'T ATTACK!?

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:34.714
YOU CAN,
IT JUST WON'T WORK!

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:35.881
[LAUGHING]

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.517
SO REVIVAL JAM WILL PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:41.053
WHILE MY BREEDING MACHINE
CONTINUES TO CREATE MONSTERS

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.989
FOR MY ULTIMATE SACRIFICE!

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:46.325
BUT I NEED TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY TO WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS...

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.828
AND FAST!

00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:51.364
YOUR DUELING DAYS
ARE ALMOST OVER.

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:55.835
SOON MY BREEDING MACHINE
WILL HAVE CREATED ENOUGH
MONSTERS TO SACRIFICE.

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:58.537
THEN COMES
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE!

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.606
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:02.842
HERE'S THE FIRST.

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:05.277
ACTIVATE
MY JAM BREEDING MACHINE!

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.849
THERE'S SLIME TOKEN
NUMBER ONE!

00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:12.718
I'LL ALSO SET ONE CARD
FACE DOWN.

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.420
ONLY TWO TURNS LEFT!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.722
THEN YOU'LL MEET YOUR DOOM!

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.959
SOON, THAT PUZZLE'S MINE.

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:22.361
I MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO STOP
YOUR BREEDING MACHINE,

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.964
BUT YOUR PLAN
HAS ONE TRAGIC FLAW,
MARIK.

00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:27.867
THE RULES STATE
YOU NEED TO SACRIFICE
THREE SLIME TOKENS

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:30.503
TO SUMMON YOUR ONE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.406
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DESTROY THEM FIRST!?

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:36.008
YOU SEE, YOUR SLIME TOKENS
ARE DEFENSELESS

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.011
AGAINST THE SUPERIOR ATTACK
POWER OF MY BUSTER BLADER.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.415
I CAN TAKE THEM OUT
WITH NO RESISTANCE,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY...

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.618
EACH TIME BUSTER BLADER
DESTROYS ONE OF YOUR
SLIME TOKENS,

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:49.422
YOU'LL LOSE OVER 2000
LIFE POINTS BECAUSE
THEY'RE SO FEEBLE.

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:51.424
SO ACCORDING TO
MY CALCULATIONS...

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:54.093
IN TWO TURNS
YOU'LL BE DEFEATED!

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:57.296
NOW, BUSTER BLADER,
ATTACK HIS SLIME TOKEN!

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.764
OR DON'T!

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.933
REVEAL FACEDOWN CARD!

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:04.203
THE CONTINUOUS TRAP CARD,
JAM DEFENDER!

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:07.206
[GASPING]

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.714
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.049
REVIVAL JAM SHIELDED
YOUR MONSTER!

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.786
EXACTLY. AND AS LONG
AS REVIVAL JAM STAYS
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:24.156
THE JAM DEFENDER CARD
FORCES IT TO ABSORB
ALL OF YOUR ATTACKS...

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:27.226
WHICH MEANS EVERY ONE OF
YOUR ATTACKS WILL BE BLOCKED!

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.432
YOU SEE, I KNEW YOU'D
ATTACK MY SLIME TOKENS

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.000
IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT
TO STOP ME

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.369
FROM SUMMONING
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:41.040
SO I PROTECTED THEM WITH
AN INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE!

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.441
THE END IS NEAR!

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.144
NOW, ANOTHER BEAST
TO SACRIFICE.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.615
MEET SLIME TOKEN
NUMBER TWO!

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:52.184
[GRUNTING]
I'VE GOT TO STOP THIS.

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:56.956
I'M AFRAID THERE'S ONLY
ONE TURN LEFT, PHARAOH!

00:20:56.956 --> 00:21:00.459
THEN I'LL SUMMON
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
TO DESTROY YOU!

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.728
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE...

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.764
I THINK I'LL PLAY
THIS MAGIC CARD,

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.766
NIGHTMARE'S STEEL CAGE,

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.735
TO MAKE SURE
YOU CAN'T ATTACK ME
FOR THE NEXT TWO TURNS.

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:12.304
NOT THAT YOU'LL
BE AROUND THAT LONG.

00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:19.345
NOW ALL YOU CAN DO
IS WATCH

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:22.114
WHILE I SUMMON THE MOST POWERFUL
FORCE YOU'VE EVER SEEN

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.716
TO ANNIHILATE YOU!

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.186
[THINKING] SOON,
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:30.189
