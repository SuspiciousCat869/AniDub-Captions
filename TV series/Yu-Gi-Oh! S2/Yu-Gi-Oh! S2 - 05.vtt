UNTIL I SEE IT
WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:13.919
AND THE BEST TEST
OF OBELISK THE TORMENTOR'S
STRENGTH

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.855
IS AGAINST THE MIGHT OF NOT ONE,

00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:18.057
BUT 3
OF THE MOST POWERFUL DRAGONS

IN ALL OF DUEL MONSTERS.

00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:27.533
Kaiba, aloud:
3 ON ONE MAY SEEM UNFAIR,

00:08:27.533 --> 00:08:30.603
BUT IF EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS ARE
AS POWERFUL AS ISHIZU CLAIMS,

00:08:30.603 --> 00:08:33.272

'CAUSE I'M SURE
THERE'S STILL DANGER AHEAD.

00:16:53.322 --> 00:16:55.824
YES. WHOEVER IS AFTER
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:16:55.824 --> 00:16:57.826
IS STILL OUT THERE.

00:17:00.462 --> 00:17:02.498
BUT YOU MUST
TRUST ME, TEA.

00:17:02.498 --> 00:17:05.467
THIS DECK HAS NEVER
LET ME DOWN BEFORE.

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:08.637
AS LONG AS YUGI AND I
STAY CONNECTED
TO ONE ANOTHER,

00:17:08.637 --> 00:17:10.272
I'M CONFIDENT
WE CAN USE THIS DECK

00:17:10.272 --> 00:17:12.641
TO WIN
THIS TOURNAMENT,

00:17:12.641 --> 00:17:14.810
UNLOCK THE MYSTERIES
OF MY ANCIENT PAST,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.079
AND REALIZE
OUR DESTINY.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.413
AHH.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:21.049
HMM. AND YOU CAN COUNT
ON MY HELP.

00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:23.652
[MAN CACKLING]

00:17:23.652 --> 00:17:25.220
Man: I HEAR THEY
PUT TOGETHER THE BEST
OF THE BEST

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.522
FOR THIS ONE.

00:17:26.522 --> 00:17:28.790
YEAH. IT'S GOING
TO BE GREAT.

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:31.793
HEY! WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:17:31.793 --> 00:17:33.428
IS EVERYTHING OK?

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.664
MMM. YES, TEA.
IT WAS NOTHING.

00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:38.667
Woman: HEY, YUGI!
THERE YOU ARE!

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:39.801
IT'S MAI VALENTINE.

00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:41.169
OH, JOY.

00:17:41.169 --> 00:17:43.305
I KNOW YOU GUYS MISSED ME.

00:17:43.305 --> 00:17:45.807
IT'S SUCH A SHAME
WE DON'T HANG OUT
MORE OFTEN.

00:17:45.807 --> 00:17:48.710
YES, IT IS,
ISN'T IT?

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.412
YOU'RE LOOKING
SNAZZY, TEA.

00:17:50.412 --> 00:17:51.680
IS THIS A DATE?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.048
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS, MAI.

00:17:53.048 --> 00:17:54.216
UH-HUH.

00:17:54.216 --> 00:17:55.651
I ASSUME YOU'VE COME HERE
FOR THE TOURNAMENT.

00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.419
BUT OF COURSE.

00:17:57.419 --> 00:18:00.322
I PRESUME YOU GOT
AN INVITATION ALSO.

00:18:00.322 --> 00:18:02.891
YES, I DID, BUT IT DIDN'T
SAY WHO IT WAS FROM.

00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:04.393
DO YOU KNOW WHO'S HOSTING
THIS TOURNAMENT?

00:18:04.393 --> 00:18:05.894
I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:07.563
IT'S A MYSTERY.

00:18:07.563 --> 00:18:09.064
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW.

00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:12.134
EVERYONE I SPOKE TO
GOT AN ANONYMOUS
INVITATION.

00:18:12.134 --> 00:18:13.635
BUT THERE IS A BUZZ
GOING AROUND

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.804
THAT IT'S SOMEONE
WITH A TON OF CASH

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.940
AND AN OBNOXIOUS
ATTITUDE.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.075
I'D GUESS KAIBA.

00:18:20.075 --> 00:18:23.745
UHH! THAT MUST BE WHY
ISHIZU TOLD ME TO ENTER.

00:18:23.745 --> 00:18:25.781
IF THE EVENTS OF THE PAST
ARE TO HAPPEN AGAIN,

00:18:25.781 --> 00:18:28.283
I MUST FACE KAIBA
IN THIS TOURNAMENT.

00:18:28.283 --> 00:18:29.351
HMM...

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.520
WHAT ARE YOU
MUMBLING ABOUT?

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.021
ANYWAY, NOBODY
KNOWS FOR SURE

00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:34.990
WHO IT IS THAT'S
THROWING THIS THING.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.692
I SUPPOSE
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON.

00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:37.926
IT'S PRETTY SAFE
TO SAY

00:18:37.926 --> 00:18:39.728
IT'S NOT PEGASUS AGAIN.

00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:41.897
SPEAKING OF PEGASUS,
THIS IS BEGINNING TO LOOK

00:18:41.897 --> 00:18:44.733
LIKE DUELIST KINGDOM
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:18:44.733 --> 00:18:45.968
YOU CAN
SAY THAT AGAIN.

00:18:45.968 --> 00:18:47.669
THERE CERTAINLY
ARE A LOT
OF FAMILIAR FACES

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:48.704
IN THIS CROWD.

00:18:48.704 --> 00:18:49.905
MMM.

00:18:49.905 --> 00:18:52.975
MOST OF WHOM I'M NOT
TOO HAPPY TO SEE.

00:18:52.975 --> 00:18:56.144
AHH! UHH!
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:18:56.144 --> 00:18:59.781
THAT'S WEEVIL UNDERWOOD
AND REX RAPTOR.

00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:02.150
AND OVER THERE'S
ESPA ROBA.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.853
THEY SAY HE
USES PSYCHIC POWERS
TO DUEL.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.188
AND MAKO'S HERE,
TOO!

00:19:06.188 --> 00:19:08.690
IF WHAT MAI SAID EARLIER
IS CORRECT,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.326
THEN <i>THIS</i> TOURNAMENT
IS GOING TO HAVE
ONE <i>NEW</i> WRINKLE.

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:14.329
AND THERE HE IS NOW.

00:19:15.897 --> 00:19:17.366
KAIBA!

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:19.067
Kaiba: GREETING, DUELISTS.

00:19:24.906 --> 00:19:26.942
WELCOME TO <i>MY</i> TOURNAMENT.

00:19:26.942 --> 00:19:28.010
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH IS BIGGER--

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.179
HIS EGO OR HIS MELON
ON THE BIG SCREEN.

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:33.615
LET'S HEAR WHAT KAIBA
HAS TO SAY.

00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:36.184

BEING THAT YOU ARE ALL
ELITE DUELISTS,

00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:50.332
I'VE ADDED SPECIAL RULES
TO MY TOURNAMENT,

00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:51.867
JUST FOR EXPERTS.

00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:54.369
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WILL DUEL

00:19:54.369 --> 00:19:57.105

THE COOLEST PRODUCTS!

00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:03.412
ANOTHER NEW RULE THAT I DESIGNED
FOR THE TOURNAMENT

00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:05.280
IS THAT BEFORE EACH DUEL,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.949
BOTH PLAYERS MUST ANTE UP
THEIR RAREST CARD,

00:20:07.949 --> 00:20:10.419
AND THE LOSER OF THE DUEL
FORFEITS HIS CARD

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:11.853
TO THE WINNER.

00:20:11.853 --> 00:20:14.089
FORFEIT
MY DARK MAGICIAN?!

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:15.891
THAT MEANS LOSING
EVEN ONE DUEL

00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:18.026
CAN RUIN MY DECK.

00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:20.128
MY COMPETITION WILL MAKE PEGASUS

00:20:20.128 --> 00:20:21.663
AND HIS DUELIST
KINGDOM TOURNAMENT

00:20:21.663 --> 00:20:23.098
LOOK LIKE A JOKE.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:26.535
