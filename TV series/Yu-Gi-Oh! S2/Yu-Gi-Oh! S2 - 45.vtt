NARRATOR: PREVIOUSLY

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.246
WE MEET AGAIN,
SETO KAIBA.

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.248
THE POWER OF MY
MILLENNIUM NECKLACE

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:08.950
SHALL PREDICT
YOUR EVERY MOVE,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.951
AND YOU WILL
SUFFER DEFEAT.

00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:11.852
LET'S SEE WHICH
IS STRONGER,

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:14.689
YOUR TRICKS
OR MY SKILLS!

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.924
FACE DOWN CARDS, GO!

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:19.126
WATCH AS MY CRUSH
CARD DESTROYS

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:20.895
BOTH MONSTERS ON
THE FIELD AS WELL AS

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.997
EVERY POWERFUL MONSTER
IN YOUR ENTIRE DECK!

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:26.267
ACCORDING TO MY
MILLENNIUM NECKLACE,

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:27.969
I DON'T NEED A POWERFUL
MONSTER TO DEFEAT YOU.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.339
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO DESTROY ISHIZU

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.041
WITH THE VERY CARD
SHE GAVE TO ME.

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.344
USE OBELISK
AND YOU'LL BE DESTROYED.

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.913
NOTHING CAN SAVE YOU
FROM OBELISK'S WRATH!

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:39.914
SO, DON'T RESIST IT,

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.951

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:48.215
Kaiba: TELL ME, ISHIZU,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.052
DO YOU STILL THINK
DESTINY IS ON YOUR SIDE?

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:54.722
OR HAVE YOU FINALLY FACED UP
TO THE UNDENIABLE TRUTH

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:56.290
THAT THIS DUEL IS MINE!

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.226
[THINKING] I HAVE SEEN
THE FUTURE QUITE CLEARLY.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:03.431
KAIBA WILL LOSE AT THE HANDS
OF HIS OWN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:04.999
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA
HAND IT TO HER...

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.101
SHE'S ABOUT TO
GET STOMPED,

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:08.869
BUT THAT ISHIZU'S
KEEPING HER COOL!

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.237
YEAH. I'M
STARTING TO THINK

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:12.773
THAT MAYBE SHE DOES
KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T.

00:02:12.773 --> 00:02:14.275
NO WAY. THAT'S
JUST AN ACT.

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:17.078
ACT OR NO ACT,
SHE'S IN BIG TROUBLE.

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:18.879
YEAH, THANKS TO KAIBA,
MOST OF HER MONSTERS

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.215
ARE IN THE GRAVEYARD NOW.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:22.883
OH, NO!

00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:25.186
[THINKING] WHAT IF
ISHIZU DOES LOSE?

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:28.789
WILL THE EVIL WITHIN
MARIK GROW EVEN STRONGER?

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.358
SHE JOINED THIS
TOURNAMENT TO HELP ME

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:33.994
DEFEAT HER BROTHER AND TO
UNCOVER THE GOOD INSIDE HIM.

00:02:33.994 --> 00:02:35.363
SHE HAS TO WIN!

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.099
Kaiba: YOUR MOST POWERFUL
MONSTERS ARE IN THE GRAVEYARD,

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.000
AND SOON THE REST OF YOUR
CARDS WILL JOIN THEM!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.003
Ishizu: I'M WELL AWARE
OF YOUR PLAN, KAIBA.

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:46.006
[THINKING]
SETO KAIBA
IS SO NAIVE,

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.175
BELIEVING
THAT MERE SKILL

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:50.711
CAN LEAD TO
VICTORY IN THIS GAME.

00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:52.947
THAT FOOL MUST ACCEPT
HIS ANCIENT PAST

00:02:52.947 --> 00:02:54.482
IN ORDER TO WIN!

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:57.985
[THINKING] SHE HAS
NO IDEA WHAT SHE'S IN FOR!

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:01.389
[THINKING] NOW
HE'S COMING AFTER
MY MAGIC CARDS.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.357
HA! THIS IS IT!

00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:06.427
MY FACEDOWN CARD WILL
FINISH YOU OFF!

00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:09.797
VIRUS CANNON, WIPE OUT
10 MAGIC CARDS IN HER DECK!

00:03:09.797 --> 00:03:10.865
WHAT'S THIS!

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.768
[GROWLS]

00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:16.470
I'M ABOUT TO
DESTROY YOUR DECK--

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.139
OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT!

00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:27.214
AND NOW, ALMOST EVERY
MAGIC CARD IN YOUR DECK

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:29.216
HAS BEEN SENT TO
THE GRAVEYARD!

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:31.018
[LAUGHS]

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:33.888
AS IF YOUR DECK WASN'T
PATHETIC ENOUGH!

00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:35.389
FIRST, MY CRUSH CARD

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.458
DESTROYED ALL YOUR
HIGH-POWERED MONSTERS,

00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:40.828
THEN MY CANNON DID THE SAME
THING TO YOUR MAGIC CARDS.

00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:42.863
YOUR DECK IS NO
LONGER A THREAT!

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:44.899
SO, DO YOU STILL
THINK I'M GONNA LOSE?

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.034
I DO.

00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:49.236
YOU'VE PLAYED INTO
MY HANDS, KAIBA.

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:51.772
NOW YOU'VE SEALED
YOUR OWN FATE.

00:03:51.772 --> 00:03:53.274
NONSENSE!

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.776
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH OF
YOUR FALSE PREDICTIONS!

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:58.078
MY PREDICTIONS
ARE QUITE REAL.

00:03:58.078 --> 00:04:00.381
AND NOW YOU'VE FALLEN
INTO MY TRAP!

00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:01.682
BUT HOW?!

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:03.417
YOU'RE CARDS...
THEY'RE GONE!

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:05.886
I STILL HAVE MY
TRAP CARDS!

00:04:05.886 --> 00:04:08.789
REVEAL EXCHANGE
OF THE SPIRIT!

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.991
THIS TRAP CARD WILL
BE THE BEGINNING

00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:15.296
OF YOUR DOWNWARD SPIRAL
TOWARD DEFEAT, KAIBA!

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.698
AT A COST OF 1,000
LIFE POINTS,

00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:20.401
MY TRAP REPLACES THE CARDS
IN EACH OF OUR DECKS

00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:21.836
WITH THOSE IN
OUR GRAVEYARDS.

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:25.473
BUT THAT LEAVES ME WITH
A DECK OF ONLY 6 CARDS!

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:28.175
Mokuba: SO FAR SO GOOD.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:31.345
I ALMOST HAVE THE ENTIRE
PARAGRAPH TRANSLATED.

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:32.880
SOON WE'LL KNOW
EXACTLY HOW

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.015
THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA WORKS!

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:37.351
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW!

00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:38.352
HUH?

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:40.488
OH, NO!
SETO'S IN TROUBLE.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.923
DON'T WORRY!
I'M COMING!

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:45.860
[THINKING] HOW COULD
I HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.262
[THINKING] BY PLAYING
EXCHANGE OF THE SPIRIT,

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:50.231
ISHIZU BROUGHT ALL
OF HER POWERFUL CARDS

00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.832
BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:53.868
AND DESTROYED KAIBA'S
DECK AT THE SAME TIME!

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:57.371
ISHIZU HASN'T
LOST HER TOUCH.

00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.973
SHE STRUNG
KAIBA ALONG

00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:00.174
JUST AS SHE USED TO

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:02.142
STRING ME ALONG
AS A CHILD.

00:05:02.142 --> 00:05:03.844
EARLIER KAIBA SENT
ALMOST EVERY MONSTER

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:07.748
IN ISHIZU'S DECK RIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:09.683
NOW SHE GETS
THEM ALL BACK

00:05:09.683 --> 00:05:10.985
ALONG WITH THE MAGIC
CARDS SHE LOST LAST TURN.

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:14.388
BUT KAIBA'S NOT SO LUCKY.

00:05:14.388 --> 00:05:16.891
HE HAD ONLY 6 CARDS
IN HIS GRAVEYARD.

00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:18.726
ONCE HE USES THEM UP,

00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:20.861
HIS DECK WILL BE EMPTY
AND HE'LL LOSE THE DUEL!

00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.198
I BELIEVE IT'S
MY TURN, KAIBA.

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:25.199
THEN GO!

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.236
VERY WELL...
I SUMMON KELBEK!

00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:36.911
IT LOOKS LIKE
KAIBA'S TOAST...

00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:38.979
THERE'S NO WAY HE
CAN TURN THIS AROUND
WITH JUST 6 CARDS.

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.749
HE STILL HAS THAT
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:42.950
IN HIS HAND,
DOESN'T HE?

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.119
WOULDN'T HE WIN
IF HE PLAYED THAT?

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.788
Joey: LOOK AT YOU
WITH ALL THE ANSWERS!

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:48.956
Ishizu: I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:51.492
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:05:51.492 --> 00:05:53.127
[THINKING] THIS
IS MY TOURNAMENT.

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:54.862
IF I LOSE I'LL
BE HUMILIATED!

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:01.402
Joey: I LOVE SEEING
KAIBA SQUIRM LIKE THIS!

00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:05.306
[LAUGHS]

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:06.607
SETO!

00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:07.675
MOKUBA!

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:09.544
WHAT HAPPENED
UP THERE?!

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:11.245
NEVER MIND...

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:12.980
HAVE YOU FINISHED
TRANSLATING
THAT CARD YET?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.482
NOT QUITE YET!

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:16.851
THERE'S STILL ONE
LINE LEFT, SETO!

00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:18.753
Ishizu:
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.188
WHEN I'M READY!

00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:22.623
YOU WILL PICK
VIRUS CANNON.

00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:23.624
TAKE A LOOK?

00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:27.328
YOU HAVE CHOSEN VIRUS
CANNON, CORRECT?

00:06:27.328 --> 00:06:29.597
I'LL TAKE YOUR
SILENCE AS A "YES."

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.499
SO, GO AHEAD AND PLAY
YOUR TRAP CARD RIGHT NOW.

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:35.436
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.438
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO ANY
MORE OF THIS NONSENSE.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:41.542
ACTIVATE VIRUS CANNON!

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:43.177
MY TRAP
WILL SEND IT

00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:44.345
STRAIGHT TO
THE GRAVEYARD.

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:45.780
[GASPS]

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.782
Ishizu: ACTIVATE MUKO!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.383
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE END OF YOUR CANNON.

00:06:49.383 --> 00:06:53.921
AND SOON IT WILL BE
THE END OF YOU, KAIBA!

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:54.922
OH, NO.

00:06:54.922 --> 00:06:55.923
OH, YES.

00:06:55.923 --> 00:06:58.226
HAVE YOU ACCEPTED
THE POWER

00:06:58.226 --> 00:06:59.794
OF MY MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE YET?

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.896
OR DO YOU STILL DENY
THAT I HAVE

00:07:01.896 --> 00:07:03.931
ALREADY FORESEEN
YOUR DEFEAT?

00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:05.399
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.336
KAIBA'S DARK
GREMLIN'S STANDING
THERE DOING NOTHING

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:10.738
WHEN EVERYONE
KNOWS IT'S STRONGER
THAN HER MONSTER--

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:12.773
SO WHY ISN'T
KAIBA ATTACKING?

00:07:12.773 --> 00:07:15.409
MAYBE KAIBA DOESN'T
WANT TO ATTACK YET.

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:16.611
HUH?

00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:18.646
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
THE KAIBA I KNOW, YUG.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.381
YES, WELL...

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:22.416
KAIBA'S IN QUITE
A TOUGH SITUATION HERE.

00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:25.319
HE WANTS TO SUMMON
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.788
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
MONSTERS TO SACRIFICE.

00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:29.991
SO, HE MAY BE PLANNING
TO SACRIFICE

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.692
ISHIZU'S MONSTERS
INSTEAD!

00:07:31.692 --> 00:07:33.294
Joey: OH.

00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:34.629
SO, THAT'S WHY HE'S
NOT ATTACKING HER!

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:37.865
Kaiba, thinking: THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY FOR ME TO WIN THIS:

00:07:37.865 --> 00:07:40.635
I MUST SUMMON OBELISK,
THE TORMENTOR!

00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:42.570
ISHIZU WILL
COWER IN FEAR

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.706
BEFORE THE VERY EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD SHE GAVE TO ME!

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:49.343
AND NOW I SUMMON...
ZORGA, IN ATTACK MODE!

00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:58.553
[THINKING] SOON KAIBA
WILL SACRIFICE

00:07:58.553 --> 00:08:00.788
MY MONSTERS
TO SUMMON OBELISK,

00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:02.823
CONTINUING HIS
PATH TO DEFEAT.

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:06.194
[THINKING] I MAY ONLY HAVE
A FEW CARDS LEFT IN MY DECK,

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.564
BUT I HAVE EVERYTHING I
NEED IN ORDER TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:08:09.564 --> 00:08:11.232
Yugi: KAIBA,
LISTEN TO ME!

00:08:11.232 --> 00:08:12.300
HUH?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.601
YOU'RE IN OVER
YOUR HEAD.

00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:14.602
STAY OUT OF THIS!

00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:16.971
THIS TOURNAMENT
OF YOURS

00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:19.373
IS MORE THAN
JUST A GAME!

00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:20.841
HAVE YOU NOT
SEEN THE DAMAGE

00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.376
MARIK HAS
CAUSED SO FAR,

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:23.377
THE PEOPLE
HE'S HARMED!?

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.412
YOU MIGHT BE NEXT!

00:08:24.412 --> 00:08:27.248
THERE IS AN ANCIENT
MAGIC AT WORK

00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:28.482
THAT CANNOT BE DENIED!

00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:30.685
AND IF YOU
CONTINUE TO IGNORE IT,

00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:32.453
YOU'RE A FOOL!

00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:33.454
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO!

00:08:33.454 --> 00:08:35.456
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.892
YOU'LL REGRET
THOSE WORDS, KAIBA.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.795
ZORGA, ATTACK
HIS DARK GREMLIN

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:42.763
WITH CAPE OF
DESTRUCTION!

00:08:42.763 --> 00:08:45.499
[GROWLS]

00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:47.201
[GRUNTS]

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:48.402
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.403
COME FORTH, KELBEK,

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:52.773
AND ATTACK HIS LIFE
POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:08:52.773 --> 00:08:55.409
[GRUNTS]

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:56.644
ARE YOU DONE?

00:08:56.644 --> 00:08:58.212
NO, KAIBA.

00:08:58.212 --> 00:09:00.681
NEXT I'LL PLACE
THIS CARD FACE DOWN.

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:02.216
AND NOW I AM DONE.

00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:05.720
[THINKING] ISHIZU'S FACEDOWN
CARD MUST BE A TRAP,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.755
BUT WHAT KIND
OF TRAP IS IT?

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:09.590
WELL, I KNOW WHAT
I NEED TO DO:

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.792
AVOID LOSING MY LIFE
POINTS LONG ENOUGH

00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:13.761
TO SUMMON OBELISK,
THE TORMENTOR!

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.363
THEN THIS DUEL WILL BE OVER!

00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:17.865
I HOPE YOU'RE READY...

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:19.600
READY TO LOSE THAT IS!

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.668
I DRAW.

00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:24.205
ACTIVATE
TRAP CARD MUKO!

00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:25.206
[GROANS]

00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:26.274
MY CARD!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.309
IT GOES STRAIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:30.945
LOOKS LIKE KAIBA'S
RUNNING PRETTY LOW
ON CARDS TO ME.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.913
IF HE STILL WANTS
TO SUMMON OBELISK,

00:09:32.913 --> 00:09:33.914
THEN HE BETTER MOVE FAST.

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:35.583
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:36.584
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE?

00:09:36.584 --> 00:09:38.286
Joey: IT'S POSSIBLE,

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.954
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
A LONG SHOT TO ME.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.689
LET'S GO,
SETO!

00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:42.857
I KNOW YOU
CAN DO THIS!

00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:44.292
COME ON!

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.393
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE THIS, BIG BROTHER!

00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:48.663
USE YOUR SECRET WEAPON NOW!

00:09:48.663 --> 00:09:50.798
[THINKING] HMM. HE'S RIGHT.

00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:53.801
I HAVE TO SUMMON OBELISK
NOW IF I'M GOING TO WIN!

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:57.305
BUT I'LL NEED TO SACRIFICE
3 MONSTERS FIRST.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.240
THAT'S WHERE
ISHIZU COMES IN.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.908
ONCE SHE SUMMONS
A THIRD MONSTER,

00:10:00.908 --> 00:10:02.710
I'LL ACTIVATE
SOUL EXCHANGE.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.212
IT WILL LET ME
SACRIFICE HER MONSTERS.

00:10:05.212 --> 00:10:08.616
AND ONCE I DO,
OBELISK IS MINE!

00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:11.519
I PLAY THIS FACE DOWN!

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:13.254
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:10:13.254 --> 00:10:15.389
ONE MORE DIRECT ATTACK
AND KAIBA'S HISTORY.

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.959
SO, WHATEVER FACEDOWN CARD
HE PLAYED BETTER BE STRONG.

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.262
[THINKING] IF WHAT
ISHIZU SAID IS TRUE,

00:10:21.262 --> 00:10:22.496
THERE'S NOTHING KAIBA
CAN DO TO WIN.

00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:24.432
IT'S HIS DESTINY TO LOSE!

00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:27.935
Ishizu, thinking:
SOUL EXCHANGE...

00:10:27.935 --> 00:10:29.570
THIS IS THE CARD
KAIBA WILL USE

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.572
TO SACRIFICE
MY MONSTERS.

00:10:31.572 --> 00:10:34.775
HE WILL SUMMON THE EGYPTIAN GOD
I PLACED IN HIS DECK,

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:36.344
AND THEN VICTORY
WILL BE MINE.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:40.815
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF THE END, KAIBA.

00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:42.316
NOW I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

00:10:45.286 --> 00:10:46.420
[THINKING] PLAY A MONSTER!

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.421
SHE NEEDS TO HAVE
3 ON THE FIELD

00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:49.890
FOR MY PLAN TO WORK!

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.992
[THINKING] THE FACEDOWN
CARD I'VE JUST PLAYED

00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:53.828
IS THE KEY TO MY VICTORY

00:10:53.828 --> 00:10:56.163
AND TO KAIBA'S
DESTRUCTION.

00:10:56.163 --> 00:10:58.399
THIS TRAP CARD HAS
ALREADY BEGUN WORKING,

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.434
INFUSING ONE OF
MY OWN MONSTERS

00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:01.502
WITH A DANGEROUS WEAPON--

00:11:01.502 --> 00:11:03.471
A BIOTIC BLASTER
THAT WILL BE HIDDEN

00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:05.439
DEEP WITHIN THE BODY
OF MY CREATURE.

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:08.976
WHEN KAIBA SACRIFICES
THIS MONSTER,

00:11:08.976 --> 00:11:11.679
THE WEAPON WILL
TRANSFER INTO OBELISK!

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:15.616
NOW I SUMMON
THE MONSTER, AGITO!

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.553
[THINKING] EXCELLENT!

00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:22.223
NOW THE STAGE IS SET
FOR MY SACRIFICE!

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.526
[THINKING] THE WAY ISHIZU
HAS TOYED WITH KAIBA'S MIND

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:28.429
IS QUITE AMUSING INDEED.

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:29.697
[THINKING]
HOLD ON!

00:11:29.697 --> 00:11:33.401
WHAT IF ISHIZU IS EXPECTING
ME TO PLAY SOUL EXCHANGE?

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.237
I COULD BE WALKING
INTO A FATAL TRAP!

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.538
NO.

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:39.740
THIS IS MY ONLY CHANCE
TO SUMMON OBELISK.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.642
I MUST SEIZE THE MOMENT NOW!

00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:44.478
KELBEK! AGITO! ZORGA!

00:11:44.478 --> 00:11:46.380
THESE MONSTERS ARE
NOW IN MY CONTROL

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.216
AND WILL SOON BE SACRIFICED!

00:11:49.216 --> 00:11:53.187
OPEN FACEDOWN CARD,
SOUL EXCHANGE.

00:11:53.187 --> 00:11:56.390
[THINKING]
AS I PREDICTED.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.562
AND NOW I WILL SUMMON
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:12:01.562 --> 00:12:05.199
SHOW YOURSELF,
OBELISK, THE TORMENTOR!

00:12:13.507 --> 00:12:15.376
[LAUGHING]

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.214
AH! THINGS ARE
GETTING INTERESTING.

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:30.050
ALL RIGHT! GO, BRO!

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.953
WHOA! KAIBA SACRIFICED
ISHIZU'S MONSTERS

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:34.921
SO HE COULD
SUMMON HIS OWN!

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.023
STILL THINK I'M
GOING TO LOSE?

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:38.692
LET'S SEE WHICH
IS STRONGER,

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:42.362
YOUR NECKLACE OR MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:43.897
WE SHALL FIND OUT.

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:44.898
COUNTING ON
A PIECE OF JEWELRY

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:47.968
IN ORDER TO WIN THIS
DUEL IS PATHETIC!

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.270
TO WIN A DUEL
TAKES SKILL

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.073
AND AN EXTREMELY
POWERFUL DECK.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:55.041
YOU'LL SEE THAT SOON

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:56.843
WHEN I ATTACK YOU WITH
OBELISK, THE TORMENTOR

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.878
AND WIPE OUT YOUR
LIFE POINTS!

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:02.916
[THINKING] YOU ARE
SADLY MISTAKEN, KAIBA.

00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:04.184
WHEN I SECRETLY PLAYED

00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:06.219
THE TRAP CARD
SACRIFICE'S BLAST,

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.021
I INFUSED MY OWN MONSTER

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:10.123
WITH A SELF-DESTRUCTING TRAP,

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:13.760
ONE THAT NOW LIVES WITHIN
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTER--

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.496
WAITING TO DESTROY
IT FROM THE INSIDE!

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:19.165
WHEN YOU ACTIVATED
SOUL EXCHANGE

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:23.236
AND SACRIFICED MY 3
MONSTERS TO SUMMON YOURS,

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:27.307
THIS SECRET TRAP CARD INFECTED
OBELISK, THE TORMENTOR.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.010
SO, AS SOON AS YOU
USE IT TO ATTACK ME,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.746
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL SELF-DESTRUCT,

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:35.448
TAKING WITH IT THE REMAINDER
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:37.851
THEN FINALLY VICTORY
WILL BE MINE.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:41.187
TRY AS YOU MAY, THERE'S
NO ESCAPE FROM

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:44.057
THE DEFEAT THAT AWAITS
YOU IN YOUR NEXT MOVE.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.658
FAT CHANCE!

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.628
YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS
LEFT TO PROTECT YOU!

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:51.197
SO, SPARE ME THE GLOOM
AND DOOM SPEECH...

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.233
AND JUST SURRENDER
TO ME NOW!

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.702
YUGI, CAN
ISHIZU BE RIGHT

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.137
ABOUT KAIBA LOSING
EVEN THOUGH

00:13:57.137 --> 00:14:00.073
HE HAS AN EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD ON THE FIELD?

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.242
AHH, YUGI?

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.010
[THINKING] ISHIZU
PREDICTED SHE'D WIN,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.980
BUT HOW CAN KAIBA LOSE
WITH OBELISK ON THE FIELD?

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.782
[THINKING]
WHAT'S UP WITH YUGI?

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:11.017
COULD HER MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE BE WRONG?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.053
OR DOES ISHIZU
HAVE A STRATEGY

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:14.054
TO DEFEND AGAINST
HIS ATTACK?

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:16.689
[THINKING]
ATTACK ME, KAIBA!

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.124
THE END IS HERE.

00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:21.094
NO ONE CAN SURVIVE
THE FURY OF OBELISK!

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.796
[THINKING] THAT CARD
BELONGED TO ME

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:23.997
BEFORE HE EVEN
KNEW IT EXISTED!

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:27.000
AND NOW IT SHALL
DESTROY HIM.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.903
I CAN SEE THE FUTURE
VERY CLEARLY!

00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:31.971
AND NOW...

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:34.340
Ishizu: KAIBA WILL
BE COMPLETELY UNAWARE

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.910
THAT MY TRAP BEATS
WITHIN OBELISK!

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.414
ATTACK HER LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY, MY BEAST!

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.316
Ishizu, thinking:
THE MOMENT IT
BEGINS TO ATTACK,

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.251
MY TRAP CARD WILL
BE TRIGGERED,

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.953
DESTROYING OBELISK
AND KAIBA!

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:47.954
HUH?!

00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:52.926
[SCREAMS]

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.828
YOU'VE RIDICULED
MY POWERS

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:57.997
AND TURNED MY OWN
CREATURE AGAINST ME.

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.299
NOW YOU'LL PAY.

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:01.935
Marik, thinking: THIS DUEL
WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER,

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:02.936
AND ONCE KAIBA'S
DEFEATED...

00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:05.738
ISHIZU WILL COME LOOKING

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.407
FOR HER BROTHER'S
GOOD HEART.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.076
SHE'S IN FOR A SURPRISE.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:13.046
ALL RIGHT,
OBELISK, ATTACK!

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.247
[THINKING]
DESTINY IS SERVED.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.248
[THINKING] WHAT'S THIS!?

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:17.884
MY MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:21.254
IT'S ACTIVATING
BY ITSELF!

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.455
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:25.225
OBELISK...

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:26.326
[GRUNTS]

00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:29.295
I FEEL SOMETHING
STRANGE INSIDE.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.231
Joey: HEY,
CHECK OUT KAIBA!

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:34.033
Yugi: FOR SOME REASON
HE STOPPED HIS ATTACK!

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.668
YEAH, BUT WHY?

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.070
YOU OK?

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.304
SNAP OUT
OF IT, BRO!

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:39.873
[THINKING] THIS IS CRAZY!

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:42.342
I'VE NEVER FELT
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE!

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:43.877
IS THIS ANOTHER ONE
OF ISHIZU'S TRICKS?

00:15:43.877 --> 00:15:46.212
[GASPS]

00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:50.016
WHY ARE THESE VISIONS
FLASHING BEFORE MY EYES?

00:15:50.016 --> 00:15:52.919
ISHIZU'S MIND GAMES
MUST BE GETTING TO ME.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.220
WAIT A SECOND!

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.091
THAT'S THE STONE CARVING OF
MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:15:58.091 --> 00:16:00.126
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.762
MAYBE I SHOULD RETHINK
MY STRATEGY

00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:04.164
AND CALL OFF OBELISK!

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:07.800
SOMEONE ELSE IS
CONTROLLING MY
MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.970
Kaiba, thinking: THIS FEELING
IS TOO STRONG TO IGNORE!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.307
Yugi: THE MILLENNIUM ROD
IS AFFECTING KAIBA!

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.910
[THINKING] MY INSTINCT TELLS
ME OBELISK ISN'T THE ANSWER.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.847
IT'S AS IF MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:22.215
IS CALLING TO ME.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:24.951
MAYBE I SHOULD ATTACK
ISHIZU WITH BLUE-EYES

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:27.153
INSTEAD OF OBELISK!

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.822
[ROARS]

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.325
THIS GOES AGAINST
MY ENTIRE STRATEGY!

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.861
I PLANNED TO DESTROY
ISHIZU WITH OBELISK

00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:35.995
FROM THE BEGINNING!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.765
BUT NOW I KNOW
TO WIN THIS DUEL,

00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:41.801
I MUST SUMMON MY
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:47.170
OBSERVE AS I ACTIVATE
MY MAGIC CARD...

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.139
SILENT DOOM,

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:52.108
WHICH LETS ME SUMMON
A CARD FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:16:52.108 --> 00:16:55.912
GADGET SOLDIER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:58.415
[THINKING] THIS
ISN'T THE FUTURE MY
NECKLACE PREDICTED!

00:16:58.415 --> 00:17:00.116
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED!

00:17:00.116 --> 00:17:02.219
BEFORE I CAN SUMMON MY
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:05.555
I MUST SACRIFICE
TWO MONSTERS!

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:06.623
FIRST, THIS!

00:17:06.623 --> 00:17:07.624
OH, NO!

00:17:07.624 --> 00:17:09.025
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:10.494
IT'S MY EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD!

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:11.628
RIDICULOUS!

00:17:11.628 --> 00:17:12.629
NO WAY, MAN!

00:17:12.629 --> 00:17:14.197
WHAT'S HE
THINKING?

00:17:14.197 --> 00:17:15.432
IT CAN'T BE!

00:17:15.432 --> 00:17:16.933
HEAR ME NOW:

00:17:16.933 --> 00:17:19.102
I WON'T BE CONTROLLED!

00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:21.438
I DECIDE MY FUTURE!

00:17:21.438 --> 00:17:25.242
SO, NOW I SACRIFICE
MY MONSTERS.

00:17:25.242 --> 00:17:26.243
OBELISK AND GADGET SOLDIER,

00:17:26.243 --> 00:17:29.279
I SEND YOU TO
THE CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:31.515
[THINKING] BUT HOW COULD
MY MILLENNIUM NECKLACE

00:17:31.515 --> 00:17:32.649
HAVE BEEN WRONG?

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:34.484
YOU'RE SO QUIET, ISHIZU!

00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:36.219
WHERE'S YOUR MAGIC NOW?

00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:37.921
OR HAVE YOU REALIZED THAT

00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:39.055
THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS DESTINY!?

00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:43.460
NOW, OBSERVE AS
I SUMMON MY BLUE-EYES!

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.128
SHOW YOURSELF!

00:17:45.128 --> 00:17:47.030
[ROARS]

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.036
SO, SOMEHOW KAIBA WAS ABLE
TO CHANGE THE FUTURE

00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:57.073
BY SUMMONING HIS
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:17:57.073 --> 00:17:58.074
BUT HOW?

00:17:58.074 --> 00:18:01.177
WHAT DID HE SEE?

00:18:01.177 --> 00:18:02.178
[THINKING] SOMETHING
FROM KAIBA'S PAST

00:18:02.178 --> 00:18:05.048
MUST HAVE AWAKENED
INSIDE HIM!

00:18:05.048 --> 00:18:07.717
FOR HE WAS THE ANCIENT
KEEPER OF THE BLUE-EYES!

00:18:07.717 --> 00:18:08.752
ISHIZU...

00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:10.220
IF YOU COULD FORESEE
ALL MY MOVES,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.556
HOW DID BLUE-EYES
SURPRISE YOU?

00:18:12.556 --> 00:18:15.358
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A FAKE--

00:18:15.358 --> 00:18:16.993
AS I SUSPECTED!

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:18.161
[THINKING] SOON HE
SHALL SEE THE TRUTH.

00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:21.197
TIME TO FINISH
YOU OFF NOW!

00:18:21.197 --> 00:18:23.066
[ROARING]

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:25.635
Kaiba: BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:18:25.635 --> 00:18:28.638
[ROARS]

00:18:28.638 --> 00:18:30.607
WIPE OUT HER
LIFE POINTS

00:18:30.607 --> 00:18:33.443
WITH WHITE
LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:18:33.443 --> 00:18:34.945
FAREWELL!

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.556
VICTORY IS MINE!
THAT'S IT!

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:49.159
Roland: THE WINNER OF
THIS DUEL IS SETO KAIBA!

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:50.994
ALL RIGHT.

00:18:50.994 --> 00:18:51.995
I KNEW THAT
YOU WERE GONNA

00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:54.364
WIN THIS DUEL ALL
ALONG, BIG BROTHER!

00:18:54.364 --> 00:18:56.399
[THINKING] THAT WAS INSANE!

00:18:56.399 --> 00:18:58.635
MARIK'S MILLENNIUM ROD
MUST HAVE SHOWN KAIBA

00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:00.337
THE SECRET TO
WINNING THIS DUEL!

00:19:00.337 --> 00:19:01.438
I BET IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH

00:19:01.438 --> 00:19:04.708
THE IMAGES ON THAT
ANCIENT STONE TABLET.

00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:07.644
KAIBA'S DESTINY IS CONNECTED
TO THE BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:19:07.644 --> 00:19:09.646
AND I BET THAT'S WHY
HE HAD TO PLAY IT!

00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:12.349
MAYBE NOW HE'LL
BELIEVE IN DESTINY!

00:19:12.349 --> 00:19:14.684
VERY IMPRESSIVE,
KAIBA.

00:19:14.684 --> 00:19:16.319
YOU MANAGED TO
OVERCOME THE FATE

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:18.288
THAT MY MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE SHOWED ME.

00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:20.190
YOUR PAST IS THE KEY
TO YOUR POWER.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.226
I WON THIS DUEL
FOR THE SAME REASONS

00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:24.294
I'LL WIN THE TOURNAMENT--

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:27.397
MY SUPERIOR SKILLS
AND INTELLIGENCE.

00:19:27.397 --> 00:19:28.732
PERHAPS.

00:19:28.732 --> 00:19:30.700
BUT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME
A VALUABLE LESSON

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.469
ABOUT THE NATURE
OF DESTINY,

00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:35.538
AND FOR THAT I AM
GRATEFUL, KAIBA.

00:19:35.538 --> 00:19:36.573
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME HOPE

00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:39.376
FOR CHANGING THE FUTURE
OF MY BROTHER.

00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:43.079
[THINKING] THOUGH I KNOW
THE TASK WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:44.314
THAN I CAN IMAGINE.

00:19:44.314 --> 00:19:46.383
TO SAVE THE GOODNESS
TRAPPED WITHIN,

00:19:46.383 --> 00:19:48.952
I'LL NEED MORE THAN
MY MILLENNIUM POWERS.

00:19:48.952 --> 00:19:50.153
I'LL NEED THE WISDOM
AND THE STRENGTH

00:19:50.153 --> 00:19:51.154
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME--

00:19:51.154 --> 00:19:54.758
ESPECIALLY SETO KAIBA.

00:19:54.758 --> 00:19:58.094
[THINKING] THE BROTHER
SHE KNEW NO LONGER EXISTS!

00:19:58.094 --> 00:19:59.129
I MAY HAVE
LOST THE DUEL,

00:19:59.129 --> 00:20:01.765
BUT IN THE PROCESS
I HAVE GAINED

00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:03.967
SOMETHING OF FAR
GREATER IMPORTANCE:

00:20:03.967 --> 00:20:06.336
THE REALIZATION
THAT IF I AM TO WIN

00:20:06.336 --> 00:20:08.371
THIS BATTLE FOR
MY BROTHER'S SPIRIT,

00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:11.374
I WILL NEED
YOUR HELP, KAIBA.

00:20:11.374 --> 00:20:12.642
THANK YOU.

00:20:12.642 --> 00:20:15.612
FOR I KNOW YOU WILL HELP
ME SAVE MY BROTHER.

00:20:15.612 --> 00:20:19.282
HMM! BELIEVE WHATEVER
YOU NEED TO, ISHIZU,

00:20:19.282 --> 00:20:23.720
BUT I'M ONLY IN
THIS FOR MYSELF.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.121
ALL RIGHT, SETO!

00:20:25.121 --> 00:20:26.756
WHAT AN AWESOME
DUEL!

00:20:26.756 --> 00:20:28.992
YOU REALLY
ARE THE BEST
DUELIST I KNOW!

00:20:28.992 --> 00:20:32.495
Joey: HERE COMES
JOHNNY SUNSHINE.

00:20:32.495 --> 00:20:33.697
IF I WERE YOU,

00:20:33.697 --> 00:20:35.265
I'D START PREPARING
FOR OUR DUEL NOW, YUGI.

00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:38.468
I WILL.

00:20:38.468 --> 00:20:40.070
GOOD LUCK.
YOU'LL NEED IT.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.872
[THINKING] WHEN
THE TIME IS RIGHT,

00:20:42.872 --> 00:20:46.176
KAIBA WILL ACCEPT
DESTINY'S ROLE FOR HIM--

00:20:46.176 --> 00:20:49.546
AND MY BROTHER,
AND THE WORLD, WILL BE SAVED.
