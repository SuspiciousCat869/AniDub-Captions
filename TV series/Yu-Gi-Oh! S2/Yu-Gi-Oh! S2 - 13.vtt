Yami-Yugi:
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.639
WHY DID YOU LEAD ME
DOWN HERE, ARKANA?

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.708
AND WHY DID
YOU FORCE ME
INTO A DUEL

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:09.076
IN WHICH
THE LOSER'S MIND

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.311
GETS SENT INTO
THE SHADOW REALM?

MARIK, HE MADE ME
AN OFFER...

FIRE THE ECTOPLASM!

THE SOUL OF <i>YUGI'S</i>

ALSO DRAINED

IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
PLAN TO DESTROY ME
BACKFIRED!

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.172
YOU MAY HAVE
AVOIDED THAT ONE,

AND ONCE I HAVE IT
I WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.430
THE WORLD WILL
BELONG TO ME!

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.434
...AND NO ONE WILL STAND
IN THE WAY OF MY DESTINY!

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.335
ESPECIALLY NOT YOU!

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.204
OH YEAH?

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:39.839
JUST WATCH ME,
MARIK!

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.108
LISTEN, LITTLE YUGI!

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.011
MY FAMILY HAS SLAVED
FOR CENTURIES.

00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.779
PROTECTING THE TOMB
OF THE PHARAOH

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.080
UNTIL HIS RETURN.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.615
AND FOR WHAT!?

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.117
<i>I</i> SHOULD BE THE PHARAOH!

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.385
NEVER!

00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:54.253
YOU WON'T
GET THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH,

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:55.788
AND I'LL MAKE
SURE OF IT!

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.357
THAT POWER BELONGS
TO YAMI, NOT YOU!

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:02.328
HA! WELL WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT, LITTLE YUGI.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:05.465
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A VESSEL FOR
THE PHARAOH'S SPIRIT.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.034
YOU COULD NEVER COMPREHEND
HIS STRENGTH.

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:11.003
NOR COULD YOU STAND
IN MY WAY OF GETTING IT!

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:15.041
WE'VE GIVEN UP TOO MUCH
TO LET SOMEONE ELSE
CLAIM THE THRONE.

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:17.443
I WAS RAISED
ON THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:18.878
LEARNING ALL
THERE IS TO KNOW

00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:20.379
ABOUT KING YAMI
THE PHARAOH

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.181
AND THE SHADOW GAMES.

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.283
THE KEY TO HIS POWER
IS YOUR PUZZLE

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:26.686
AND THE THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:30.022
BUT I CAN'T JUST <i>TAKE</i>
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
FROM YOU.

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.757
ACCORDING TO
THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:34.160
I HAVE TO DEFEAT YOU
IN A DUEL FIRST.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.429
THEN <i>I'LL</i> BANISH YOU
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.664
BUT WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT!?

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.666
TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY
OUT OF MY WAY!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.669
ONCE I GAIN CONTROL
OF THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.506
AND OBTAIN ALL THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS...

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.874
I'LL BE KING!

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:49.775
AND A MUCH MORE
WORTHY KING

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.878
THAN YOUR
COUNTERPART, YAMI.

00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:53.679
HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO HARNESS

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.382
THE GREAT POWERS THAT LIE
DORMANT WITHIN HIM!

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.018
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
KNOW FULL WELL

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.521
HOW TO <i>TAKE</i> THEM
FROM HIM.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:06.359
AND MY MILLENNIUM ROD
WILL ENSURE THAT I GET
EVERYTHING I NEED!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.461
WHO HASTH'CARDS?

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:11.297
<i>I</i> ALREADY POSSESS <i>TWO</i>
OF THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.466
AND I KNOW WHERE
TO FIND THE THIRD ONE.

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:16.068
SOON ENOUGH MY LOYAL TEAM
OF RARE HUNTERS

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:19.438
WILL BRING
THE <i>FINAL</i> CARD TO ME!

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:21.941
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME, YOU SEE...

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:24.810
THAT IS, UNTIL I TAKE
WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.380
AND BANISH YOU
AND THE FORMER PHARAOH...

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.682
TO THE DREADED
SHADOW REALM,

00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:32.385
WHERE YOU WILL SPEND
ALL OF ETERNITY

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.120
WHILE THE REST
OF THE WORLD
IS KNEELING

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.356
BEFORE KING MARIK,
THE NEW PHARAOH!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.824
HA HA HA!

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:45.565
Marik: YOU'RE POWERLESS
AGAINST ME, LITTLE YUGI.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.800
MY DESTINY
CAN'T BE STOPPED.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.236
DON'T YOU SEE IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME!?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.438
THE THREE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS,

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:55.775
ALONG WITH YOUR
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,
WILL BELONG TO ME!

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:59.312
THEN I WILL
STRIP THE PHARAOH
OF HIS ANCIENT POWERS

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.314
AND INFUSE THEM
WITHIN MYSELF!

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:02.648
[THINKING]
I HAFTA KEEP MARIK

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.283
FROM GETTING
ALL THIS POWER.

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.385
I WISH I KNEW MORE
ABOUT YAMI'S
ANCIENT PAST

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.987
'CAUSE HISTORY
IS REPEATING ITSELF,

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:11.257
AND IT'S MY DESTINY
TO HELP HIM SAVE
THE WORLD AGAIN!

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.725
I <i>DO</i> KNOW THAT MARIK
CAN'T SUCCEED

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:14.360
WITHOUT THE
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.595
AND IN ORDER
TO GET IT FROM ME

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.363
HE HAS TO DEFEAT ME
IN A DUEL...

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:18.464
SO AS LONG
AS I BELIEVE

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.899
IN THE HEART
OF THE CARDS

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.735
AND STAY
CONNECTED TO YAMI,
I CAN STOP HIM!

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:24.036
MARIK!

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.938
YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT
ME IN A DUEL

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:29.041
SO YOU'LL NEVER GET
YOUR GREEDY HANDS
ON MY PUZZLE!

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:33.179
I PROMISE YOU
BY THE SANDS OF EGYPT...

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:35.548
THE PHARAOH'S POWER
WILL BE MINE.

00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:39.385
ANOTHER OF MY MIND-SLAVES
IS ALREADY IN BATTLE CITY

00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:41.554
WAITING TO DEFEAT YOU
AND TAKE YOUR PUZZLE!

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:45.057
AND, HE HOLDS
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:48.060
AND WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS CARD!?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.796
YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH, LITTLE YUGI!

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.699
'TIL THEN,
BEWARE THE QUIET ONE.

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.267
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MARIK?

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.536
WHO IS
THE QUIET ONE?

00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:01.107
WE'LL MEET AGAIN, YUGI.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.108
[SIGHS]

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:04.410
OHH!

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.012
[MOANING]

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:07.680
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF YOU!

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.149
NEXT TIME SHOW ME
YOUR FACE,
YOU COWARD!

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.217
UNH!

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:12.318
YUGI!

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:13.319
YOU ALRIGHT, BUDDY?

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.787
Tea: WE'RE HERE!

00:19:14.787 --> 00:19:16.489
Grandpa: YUGI!
HEY, GUYS!

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.857
YOU'RE OK!

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:19.058
WHAT <i>HAPPENED</i> HERE?

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.430
SOON WE WILL
HAVE YUGI'S
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.799
<i>AND</i> THE THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:29.101
AND HOW WILL YOU GET
OBELISK FROM KAIBA?

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.670
THAT'S
A SIMPLE TASK...

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.438
I'M NOT CONCERNED...

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:34.740
ONCE <i>YUGI</i> IS
TAKEN CARE OF...

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.511
I'LL STRIP <i>KAIBA</i>
OF HIS EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.514
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO DUEL KAIBA YOURSELF?

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.683
IF IT COMES
TO THAT, YES...

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:46.018
BUT LIKE I SAID,
MY FIRST CONCERN

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.587
IS YUGI AND HIS
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE...

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:50.423
AND KEEP
AN EYE ON THOSE
FRIENDS OF HIS.

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:51.524
RIGHT.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.093
I DON'T WANT THEM
GETTING IN MY WAY.

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:58.164
ACTUALLY, ODION,
THEY MAY PROVE TO BE
QUITE USEFUL TO ME.

00:19:58.164 --> 00:20:01.500
I COULD ALWAYS
USE MORE SERVANTS
TO DO MY BIDDING!

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:05.471
IN THE MEANTIME,

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:06.906
I'LL USE
THE QUIET ONE

00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:09.041
TO CRUSH YUGI MOTO
IN A DUEL

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:13.312
AND BRING HIS
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
TO ME! HA HA HA!

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:19.185
Marik, thinking:
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:21.921
BEFORE I POSSESS
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:24.356
WITHIN WHICH LIES
THE SPIRIT OF THE PHARAOH.

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:25.925
THEN I'LL COMBINE

00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:28.360
THE STRENGTH
OF THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.829
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON,

00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:33.933
AND THE SOON-TO-BE MINE
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.135
AND IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:38.904
THE UNLIMITED POWER
OF THE PHARAOH HIMSELF

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.673
WILL BELONG TO ME!

00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:43.776
THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL
KNEEL AT MY FEET

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:46.579
AND NO ONE WILL
BE ABLE TO STOP ME!

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.482
