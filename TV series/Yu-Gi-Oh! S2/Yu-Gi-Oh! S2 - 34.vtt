Roland: I WELCOME YOU
TO THE STRATOS DUELING ARENA.

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:09.937
BAKURA'S OPPONENT
IN THE FIRST DUEL IS YUGI MOTO.

00:00:09.937 --> 00:00:12.640
[THINKING]
FIRST I'LL WIN
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.643
AND DELIVER IT
TO MARIK IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:19.547
THEN SEIZING YUGI'S PUZZLE
WILL BE A SIMPLE TASK.

00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:21.248
I MUST WIN THIS.

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:23.984
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
DEPENDS ON IT.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:25.553
I HOLD A CARD IN MY HAND

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:28.756
WITH DARK POWERS BEYOND
YOUR WILDEST IMAGINATION.

STARE INTO THE FACE
OF DEFEAT,

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:34.261
NOW I SUMMON THE BEAST
THAT WILL CAUSE YOUR DEMISE--

DARK NECROFEAR.

00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:40.801
YOU SEE, NOT ONLY
IS MY MONSTER STRONG,

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.537
BUT IT ALSO POSSESSES
A DARK MAGIC HIDDEN WITHIN.

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:45.539
ATTACK HIS NECROFEAR

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.841
WITH DARK
BURNING ATTACK!

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:51.478
THANKS. ONCE AGAIN,
YOU'VE DONE EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED, YUGI.

00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:53.080
SO I CAN PLAY THIS.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.917

IN A SHROUD OF DARK MAGIC

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.921
KNOWN AS "DARK SANCTUARY."

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:02.690
PREPARE TO EXPERIENCE AN EVIL

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.062

Bakura: HA HA HA!
YUGI, YOU FOOL!

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:14.762
YOU'VE HELPED ME RELEASE
THE POWER OF DARK SANCTUARY!

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:17.898
AND NOW THE FIELD IS COVERED
WITH A MAGIC SO TERRIFYING,

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:20.334
IT WILL KEEP YOU
IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FEAR

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:22.536
AND EVENTUALLY DESTROY YOU!

Yami-Yugi:
IT IS YOU WHO
SHOULD BE AFRAID!

YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS LEFT,

AND YOU'RE DOWN
TO YOUR LAST
150 LIFE POINTS.

THAT'S TRUE.

HOWEVER, THE EVIL GHOST
OF DARK SANCTUARY

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.082

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:22.529
YES, AND THAT
IS HOW I WAS ABLE

YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
FIGURE THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF

00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:34.041
IF YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO TRY
AND ATTACK ME AGAIN...

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:35.743

THE MISTAKE OF ATTACKING ME

ABOUT THAT, YUGI.

WILL REVEAL ONE LETTER,

AFTER 5 TURNS PASS

DARK GHOST,
COUNTER ATTACK!

00:07:43.074 --> 00:07:44.842
[GRUNTING]

00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:48.446
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:50.448
SHE WAS POSSESSED!

00:07:50.448 --> 00:07:52.283
WITH EACH TURN,
I CAN CHOOSE
A DIFFERENT MONSTER

00:07:52.283 --> 00:07:54.385
FOR MY SPIRIT TO POSSESS.

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:57.355
AND NOW
YOU LOSE EVEN MORE
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:59.657
BUT FORTUNATELY,
THEY GET ADDED TO MY OWN!

00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:02.527
MY DARK SANCTUARY
IS FULL OF SURPRISES!

00:08:02.527 --> 00:08:03.861
AND SINCE
YOUR TURN IS OVER,

00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.830
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.266
WHAT?! TELL ME!

00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:11.102
DESTINY BOARD
GETS ANOTHER LETTER!

00:08:13.204 --> 00:08:15.540
AND THE SECOND LETTER IS "I."

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.509
ONLY 3 LETTERS LEFT!

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:19.610
HEY, GUYS, LOOK!

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.078
NOW IT
SPELLS "F-I."

00:08:21.078 --> 00:08:22.547
WAIT!
Bakura: YES?

00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:25.016
OUR DUEL DISKS
ONLY HAVE 5 SLOTS,

00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:27.285
WHICH MEANS ONLY
5 MAGIC CARDS

00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:28.519
CAN BE IN PLAY
AT ONCE,

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:31.022
AND EACH OF YOUR LETTERS
IS ONE MAGIC CARD!

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:33.291
SO AS LONG AS
YOUR DARK DOOR CARD
IS IN PLAY,

00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:35.626
YOU CAN'T SPELL OUT
YOUR ENTIRE WORD.

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:38.863
VERY OBSERVANT, YUGI.

00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:40.731
HOWEVER,
WITH DARK SANCTUARY

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.167
I CAN PLAY MORE
THAN 5 MAGIC CARDS.

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.535
UHH!

00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:47.238
IN OTHER WORDS,
EVEN WITH MY
DARK DOOR MAGIC CARD

00:08:47.238 --> 00:08:49.407
ON THE PLAYING FIELD,
I CAN STILL PLAY

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:53.044
ALL 5 LETTERS
OF THE DESTINY BOARD
AND FINISH YOU OFF!

00:08:53.044 --> 00:08:55.346
[CACKLING]

00:08:55.346 --> 00:08:57.615
YOU MEAN YOUR
DARK SANCTUARY CARD

00:08:57.615 --> 00:08:59.517
ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY
EXTRA MAGIC CARDS

00:08:59.517 --> 00:09:02.720
AND POSSESS MY MONSTERS
WITH AN EVIL GHOST?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.690
YES, AND THAT
IS WHAT MAKES ME
UNSTOPPABLE!

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.093
YUGI, YOUR HOPE
OF WINNING IS OVER.

00:09:09.093 --> 00:09:12.697
IN JUST 3 SHORT TURNS,
YOU WILL BE FINISHED!

00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:15.132
HA HA! SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THE FINALS!

00:09:15.132 --> 00:09:16.200
OH, NO!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.602
HE BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHING QUICK!

00:09:17.602 --> 00:09:18.936
IF YUGI COULD
JUST FIGURE OUT

00:09:18.936 --> 00:09:20.605
WHICH ONE
OF HIS MONSTERS
IS POSSESSED

00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:21.672
BY DARK SANCTUARY,

00:09:21.672 --> 00:09:23.241
THEN HE COULD
LAUNCH AN ATTACK.

00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:25.576
I STILL THINK
HE HAS A CHANCE
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:09:25.576 --> 00:09:27.712
BUT HE CAN'T KEEP
LOSING LIFE POINTS.

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:29.814
MAYBE
HE'S OVERTHINKING
ALL THIS,

00:09:29.814 --> 00:09:31.349
AND THE KEY IS
NOT TO THINK AT ALL,

00:09:31.349 --> 00:09:33.317
LIKE TRISTAN DOES.
HA HA!

00:09:33.317 --> 00:09:35.920
HEY, JOEY, YUGI'S
GONNA WIN, RIGHT?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.889
YEAH. YUGI'LL
PULL THROUGH.

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.557
BUT IT SURE
WON'T BE EASY.

00:09:39.557 --> 00:09:42.827
AS LONG AS THE MAGIC
OF DARK SANCTUARY
SURROUNDS US,

00:09:42.827 --> 00:09:44.462
I'M IN CONTROL!

00:09:44.462 --> 00:09:46.631
[THINKING]
AND I'LL NEED TO
SACRIFICE THIS MONSTER

00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:49.433
IN ORDER TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:50.868
I SUMMON SANGAN!

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.505
[SHRIEKS]

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:56.140
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE IT
TO MAINTAIN

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.509
THE POWER OF DARK SANCTUARY!

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:00.311
[SHRIEKS]

00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:02.246
SANGAN'S SPECIAL EFFECT
ALLOWS ME

00:10:02.246 --> 00:10:04.015
TO DRAW ONE MORE CARD

00:10:04.015 --> 00:10:06.450
AFTER IT'S BEEN SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.786
NOW LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU CAN DO--

00:10:08.786 --> 00:10:10.821
NOT MUCH I'M SURE.

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:12.857
YOU'RE WRONG.
I DRAW.

00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:17.094
[THINKING]
IT'S TIME TO POSSESS
YUGI'S NEXT MONSTER.

00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:20.031
BUT WHICH ONE SHOULD
MY GHOST HIDE WITHIN?

00:10:20.031 --> 00:10:22.500
YES! HE'D NEVER SUSPECT

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.736
THAT I'D CHOOSE
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
TWICE IN A ROW!

00:10:25.736 --> 00:10:27.939
IT'S THE PERFECT PLAN.

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:29.573
[THINKING]
I KNOW ONE
OF MY 3 MONSTERS

00:10:29.573 --> 00:10:32.043
IS POSSESSED
BY THE GHOST
OF DARK SANCTUARY.

00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:33.644
BUT WHICH ONE?

00:10:33.644 --> 00:10:35.246
I DOUBT
IT'S KURIBOH.

00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:37.715
HE'S TOO WEAK FOR ME
TO ATTACK WITH ANYWAY.

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:40.318
SO THAT LEAVES ME
WITH 2 CHOICES--

00:10:40.318 --> 00:10:42.386
GAMMA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR

00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:45.089
OR THE DARK
MAGICIAN GIRL.
WHICH IS IT?

00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:47.858
I CAN ONLY
ATTACK ONCE, THANKS
TO HIS DARK DOOR CARD,

00:10:47.858 --> 00:10:50.061
AND IF I CHOOSE
THE WRONG MONSTER
TO ATTACK WITH,

00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:51.696
I'LL LOSE
MORE LIFE POINTS,

00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:53.230
AND HE'LL GAIN THEM!

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.667
I CAN'T MESS UP
OR I'M FINISHED!

00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:09.785
Bakura: PROCEED
WITH YOUR ATTACK, YUGI.

00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:11.453
BUT CHOOSE WISELY,

00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:12.888
FOR ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
IS POSSESSED

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:16.058
BY THE EVIL GHOST
OF DARK SANCTUARY.

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:18.093
[THINKING]
I KNOW THIS MONSTER
ISN'T POSSESSED

00:11:18.093 --> 00:11:19.495
'CAUSE I JUST DREW IT.

00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:21.230
BUT HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE LOW,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.233
SO I'LL JUST
USE IT TO PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS.

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:26.602
[ALOUD]
I SUMMON
BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:28.637
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:29.939
[MOANS]

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.540
THAT WAS POINTLESS.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.542
NOTHING CAN PROTECT
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:36.178
FROM THE GHOST
OF DARK SANCTUARY!

00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:37.479
[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT.

00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:39.615
TIME TO ATTACK.
BUT I GOTTA MAKE SURE

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:42.084
I DON'T CHOOSE
THE MONSTER
THAT'S POSSESSED

00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:43.319
OR HALF
OF THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:45.454
WILL BE TAKEN OUT
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:47.223
SINCE MY MAGNET WARRIOR
HAS LESS ATTACK POINTS,

00:11:47.223 --> 00:11:48.991
I'LL CHOOSE HIM!

00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:53.095
GAMMA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR,
ATTACK NOW!

00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:55.731
[THINKING]
YUGI DIDN'T CHOOSE
THE POSSESSED MONSTER,

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:56.765
BUT NO MATTER!

00:11:56.765 --> 00:11:59.001
I HAVE A CARD
TO CHANGE ALL THAT!

00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:00.669
[ALOUD]
YOU'VE TRIGGERED
MY TRAP CARD--

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:02.838
DARK SPIRIT OF THE SILENT!

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.443
THIS CARD INSTANTLY
STOPS YOUR MAGNET WARRIOR

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:08.811
FROM ATTACKING ME.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.246
DID YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:13.249
I'D LET YOU ATTACK
MY LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY, YUGI?

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:15.484
NEVER! AND THERE'S MORE.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.820
ONCE MY TRAP CARD
STOPS YOUR WARRIOR,

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.990
IT WILL FORCE
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
TO ATTACK!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.025
NO! IF MY
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.661
IS THE MONSTER
THAT'S POSSESSED
AND SHE ATTACKS YOU,

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.997
THEN THAT MEANS
I'LL LOSE MORE
LIFE POINTS!

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.366
CORRECT,
AND I'M AFRAID SHE IS.

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:34.236
SO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO 1,250 LIFE POINTS!

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:35.905
[SCREAMS]

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:37.006
UHH!

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.707
LOOKS LIKE YOU GET WEAKER

00:12:38.707 --> 00:12:41.110
AS MY LIFE POINTS
GROW HIGHER AND HIGHER!

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.913
YUGI'S RUNNING OUT
OF LIFE POINTS
PRETTY FAST.

00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:45.414
HE'S A GONER!

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:48.484
OH, NO! ARE YOU SAYING
YUGI'S GONNA LOSE?

00:12:48.484 --> 00:12:49.785
UH...

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:51.887
HEY, YOU! WHEN ONE
OF OUR BUDDIES
IS DUELING,

00:12:51.887 --> 00:12:53.455
WE SUPPORT THEM
ALL THE WAY!

00:12:53.455 --> 00:12:56.258
SO THINK POSITIVE,
OR YOU'RE GOING OVERBOARD!

00:12:56.258 --> 00:12:57.993
YUGI, YUGI!
HE'S OUR MAN!

00:12:57.993 --> 00:12:59.762
HEY, JOEY.

00:12:59.762 --> 00:13:01.830
I KNOW YUGI'S GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.799
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:06.902
ALL THE GHOSTS
AND EVIL SPIRITS
IN THIS DUEL

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:08.837
ARE FREAKING ME OUT,
SETO.

00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:11.206
[THINKING]
NONSENSE.
SPIRITS DON'T EXIST.

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:13.275
THE ONLY THING
YUGI HAS TO BE AFRAID OF

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:16.011
IS LOSING THIS DUEL
AND HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:19.114
WHEN ALL 5 LETTERS APPEAR
ON THE DESTINY BOARD.

00:13:19.114 --> 00:13:22.351
NOT THAT IT MATTERS,
SINCE I'LL WIN EVERYTHING
IN THE END.

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:26.755
Bakura: I'M AFRAID
THIS DUEL IS ALMOST OVER.

00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:29.191
TOO BAD.
THERE'S NO HOPE LEFT.

00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:31.026
ONE MORE ATTACK
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:13:31.026 --> 00:13:33.595
AND YOU'RE FINISHED.
HA HA!

00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:34.797
[THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT.

00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:36.332
IF I ATTACK HIM
WITH ONE MORE MONSTER

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:37.466
THAT'S POSSESSED,

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:39.201
I'LL LOSE THE REST
OF MY LIFE POINTS

00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:41.170
AND BE ELIMINATED
FROM THE FINALS.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.238
IF I COULD
ONLY FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DESTROY

00:13:43.238 --> 00:13:45.874
THE EVIL GHOST
OF DARK SANCTUARY.

00:13:45.874 --> 00:13:47.543
THERE MUST BE A WAY!

00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:51.413
BUT HOW CAN I
DESTROY SOMETHING
I CAN'T EVEN SEE?

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:52.681
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:55.084
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE
TO FORFEIT THE DUEL?

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.552
[THINKING]
I'LL NEVER QUIT!

00:13:56.552 --> 00:13:57.920
THIS DUEL ISN'T OVER,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.588
AND I KNOW I HAVE
SOMETHING IN MY HAND

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:01.490
THAT CAN HELP
TURN THINGS AROUND!

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.492
HMM. WAIT!

00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:05.327
MAYBE THOSE CARDS
CAN HELP!

00:14:05.327 --> 00:14:08.130
I PLACE 2 CARDS
FACEDOWN

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.698
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:12.568
SO, I SEE THAT YOU
HAVEN'T YET REALIZED

00:14:12.568 --> 00:14:14.403
THAT NOTHING
CAN SAVE YOU NOW!

00:14:14.403 --> 00:14:16.705
IT'S MERELY A MATTER
OF TIME, YUGI.

00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:18.474
WRONG.
I CAN ASSURE YOU

00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:20.476
THAT YOUR EVIL GHOST
OF DARK SANCTUARY

00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:22.444
IS IN FOR
A RUDE AWAKENING,

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:25.214
AND ONCE IT'S GONE,
I'LL BE FREE
TO ATTACK YOU.

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:27.916
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR THE POWER
OF MY DECK, YUGI!

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.451
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.186
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:33.255
LOOK AT THE DESTINY BOARD!

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:34.656
Yami-Yugi:
THE THIRD LETTER!

00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.058
WHAT IS IT?

00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:37.192
"N."

00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:40.763
OHH! F-I-N!

00:14:40.763 --> 00:14:43.165
2 SHORT TURNS,
AND IT'S ALL OVER!

00:14:55.117 --> 00:14:57.353
THE DESTINY BOARD
IS DISPLAYING 3 LETTERS.

00:14:57.353 --> 00:14:58.521
Yami-Yugi:
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

00:14:58.521 --> 00:14:59.688
THAT'LL DO.

00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:02.391
I PLAY SOULS
OF THE FORGOTTEN

00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.561
AND SACRIFICE IT
TO KEEP DARK SANCTUARY.

00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:06.996
[CACKLES]

00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:10.199
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO TRY
AND ATTACK ME AGAIN,

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:11.634
IF YOU DARE.

00:15:11.634 --> 00:15:14.103
BUT REMEMBER
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
IS POSSESSED,

00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:15.838
SO BE CAREFUL.

00:15:15.838 --> 00:15:17.873
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:20.109
I'LL DO IT
WITH PLEASURE.

00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:22.511
I HAVE A PLAN
TO DEMOLISH
YOUR EVIL GHOST

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:23.646
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:15:23.646 --> 00:15:24.813
IT CAN'T BE!

00:15:24.813 --> 00:15:25.881
IT IS!

00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:27.383
AND ONCE
YOUR GHOST IS GONE,

00:15:27.383 --> 00:15:29.185
I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT MY MONSTERS

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:30.619
BEING POSSESSED.

00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:33.589
I HAVE A FEELING YUGI'S ABOUT
TO TURN THIS THING AROUND!

00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:34.757
Joey: YUGI!

00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:37.426
GIVE THIS
HORROR SHOW
A HAPPY ENDING!

00:15:37.426 --> 00:15:40.095
[THINKING]
YUGI WILL CERTAINLY
NEED SOMETHING POWERFUL

00:15:40.095 --> 00:15:41.597
TO GET HIMSELF
OUT OF THIS.

00:15:41.597 --> 00:15:43.599
LET'S SEE
WHAT HE HAS PLANNED.

00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:45.768
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR GHOST!

00:15:45.768 --> 00:15:48.971
Bakura: MY INVISIBLE GHOST
IS POSSESSING A MONSTER NOW!

00:15:48.971 --> 00:15:51.607
SO, WHY DON'T YOU
FIGURE OUT WHERE IT IS

00:15:51.607 --> 00:15:53.309
AND THEN DESTROY IT?

00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:54.643
I DON'T HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT

00:15:54.643 --> 00:15:56.245
WHERE
YOUR DARK GHOST IS!

00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:57.913
I HAVE A CARD
IN MY DECK

00:15:57.913 --> 00:15:59.481
THAT CAN FIND IT
FOR ME!

00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.318
AND NOW BEHOLD!

00:16:02.318 --> 00:16:04.787
THE TRAP CARD
COLLECTED POWER!

00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:06.455
IT FORCES
CERTAIN MAGIC CARDS

00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:09.091
TO FOCUS THEIR EFFECT
ON KURIBOH!

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.566
Kaiba, thinking:
WHY WOULD YUGI
USE COLLECTIVE POWER

00:16:17.566 --> 00:16:19.602
ON A WEAK CARD
LIKE KURIBOH?

00:16:19.602 --> 00:16:21.837
ALL IT DOES IS ALLOW
HIS PATHETIC MONSTER

00:16:21.837 --> 00:16:24.440
TO ABSORB THE EFFECTS
OF A FEW MAGIC CARDS.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.643
THAT WON'T SAVE HIM
FROM BAKURA'S DARK SANCTUARY,

00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:29.979
UNLESS IT ALSO
ABSORBED THE GHOST!

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.248
SO WHO'S
IN CONTROL NOW?

00:16:32.248 --> 00:16:33.916
I KNEW THAT YOUR
EVIL GHOST LIVED

00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:36.252
WITHIN
DARK SANCTUARY.
GRR!

00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:38.220
THEREFORE, I KNEW
I HAD TO PLAY

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.623
MY TRAP CARD
COLLECTIVE POWERS.

00:16:40.623 --> 00:16:42.324
BECAUSE IT WOULD
FORCE YOUR EVIL GHOST

00:16:42.324 --> 00:16:43.525
RIGHT OUT
OF ITS HIDING PLACE

00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:44.960
AND INTO KURIBOH.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.295
[SCREAMS]

00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:50.766
UHH! WHAT DO YOU
PLAN TO DO?

00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:53.235
SIMPLE.
I'LL USE THIS--

00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:56.105
A MAGIC CARD CALLED
"EXILE OF THE WICKED,"

00:16:56.105 --> 00:16:58.741
WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY
DESTROY MY KURIBOH.

00:16:58.741 --> 00:17:01.510
HA HA! SO,
EXILE OF THE WICKED,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.013
WIPE OUT MY KURIBOH
AND HIS DARK GHOST!

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:06.148
[SCREAMING]

00:17:08.817 --> 00:17:11.787
AND NOW EVIL SPIRIT
OF DARK SANCTUARY,

00:17:11.787 --> 00:17:12.955
BEGONE!

00:17:12.955 --> 00:17:15.658
UHH! YOU MAY HAVE
DEFEATED MY GHOST,

00:17:15.658 --> 00:17:17.960
BUT MY DESTINY BOARD
WILL STILL DESTROY YOU

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.896
IN ONLY 2 TURNS
WHEN IT COMPLETES
ITS MESSAGE!

00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:22.431
DON'T COUNT ON IT.

00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:25.401
THIS DUEL ISN'T OVER,
AND IT'S STILL MY MOVE.

00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:26.735
Joey: ALL RIGHT!

00:17:26.735 --> 00:17:28.637
Tea: WAY TO GO, YUGI!

00:17:28.637 --> 00:17:32.141
[THINKING]
IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE CHAT.

00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:34.576
JUST IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:36.612
YOU'VE LOST CONTROL
OF THIS DUEL.

00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:38.314
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:17:38.314 --> 00:17:41.083
YOUR OPPONENT
HAS CRUSHED
YOUR STRATEGY

00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.685
BY VANQUISHING
YOUR GHOST.

00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.320
GO AWAY.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.921
I DON'T NEED HELP.

00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:47.189
DON'T BE A FOOL!

00:17:47.189 --> 00:17:48.590
I SAID GO!

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.693
YOU SEEM TO FORGET
THAT WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT.

00:17:50.693 --> 00:17:52.294
SO IF YOU'RE
STILL INTERESTED

00:17:52.294 --> 00:17:53.529
IN THOSE MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:55.230
YOU'LL LISTEN TO ME.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.900
REMEMBER, YOU FOOL,
IF YOU LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.535
YOU'LL BE REMOVED
FROM THE FINALS,

00:17:59.535 --> 00:18:01.070
MAKING YOU INCAPABLE
OF WINNING ME

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.372
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:18:03.372 --> 00:18:05.107
Bakura:
I WON'T LOSE, MARIK.

00:18:05.107 --> 00:18:07.042
I'M AFRAID THAT'S HARD
FOR ME TO BELIEVE

00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:10.212
BASED ON THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN DUELING
SO FAR.

00:18:10.212 --> 00:18:11.714
THEN WATCH ME.

00:18:11.714 --> 00:18:14.717
WIN THIS OR NO DEAL.

00:18:14.717 --> 00:18:16.185
ALL RIGHT.
NOW IT'S TIME

00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:18.620
TO BRING BACK A MONSTER
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.290
I PLAY
MONSTER REBORN!

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.828
I'LL BRING BACK
A MONSTER FROM
YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:18:25.828 --> 00:18:29.832
DARK NECROFEAR,
RETURN!

00:18:29.832 --> 00:18:32.701
SO SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR DARK SANCTUARY!

00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:35.404
SINCE DESTROYING
DARK NECROFEAR
RELEASED IT,

00:18:35.404 --> 00:18:37.539
I KNEW BRINGING IT BACK
WOULD DEFEAT IT.

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:38.674
UHH! NO!

00:18:38.674 --> 00:18:40.943
AND NOW
THAT DARK SANCTUARY
IS GONE,

00:18:40.943 --> 00:18:43.045
I'M AFRAID THAT YOU
ARE NO LONGER PERMITTED

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.880
TO HAVE MORE
THAN 5 MAGIC CARDS

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.348
IN PLAY AT ONE TIME.

00:18:46.348 --> 00:18:49.985
THIS MAY FOIL
SOME OF YOUR PLANS.

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:53.021
AND NOW
I'LL ATTACK YOUR
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY

00:18:53.021 --> 00:18:56.258
WITH DARK NECROFEAR!

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.928
AAH!

00:18:59.928 --> 00:19:02.564
ALL RIGHT.
THIS DUEL'S ALMOST DONE

00:19:02.564 --> 00:19:06.368
SINCE YOU'VE LOST
MORE THAN HALF OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:19:06.368 --> 00:19:10.839
NOW I ADD THE FOURTH LETTER
TO THE DESTINY BOARD--

00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:12.207
THE LETTER "A."

00:19:12.207 --> 00:19:14.710
Yami-Yugi: F-I-N-A.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.012
YOUR WORD
IS "FINAL."

00:19:17.012 --> 00:19:18.614
IT'S TOO BAD
YOU'LL NEVER PLAY

00:19:18.614 --> 00:19:19.782
THE LAST LETTER.

00:19:19.782 --> 00:19:21.417
LOOK
AT YOUR DUEL DISK!

00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:23.452
YOU HAVE
5 MAGIC CARDS
IN PLAY,

00:19:23.452 --> 00:19:26.422
AND YOU HAVE NO ROOM
FOR ANY OTHERS.

00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:29.425
SO IF YOU WANT
TO PLAY THE LAST LETTER
OF YOUR MESSAGE,

00:19:29.425 --> 00:19:32.227
YOU MUST DISCARD
YOUR DARK DOOR
MAGIC CARD

00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:33.996
AND ITS EFFECT
ON MY MONSTERS,

00:19:33.996 --> 00:19:35.764
ALLOWING ME
TO ATTACK

00:19:35.764 --> 00:19:37.466
MORE THAN ONCE
IN A TURN!

00:19:37.466 --> 00:19:39.601
AND WITH NO MONSTERS
TO PROTECT YOU

00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:41.737
AND ONLY
1,200 LIFE POINTS,

00:19:41.737 --> 00:19:44.873
MY 3 MONSTERS
WOULD WIPE YOU OUT
IN ONE TURN!

00:19:44.873 --> 00:19:46.675
THE DECISION
IS YOURS!

00:19:46.675 --> 00:19:49.178
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.

00:19:49.178 --> 00:19:51.680
STICK A FORK
IN THAT GUY
'CAUSE HE'S DONE!

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.482
Joey:
BE GLAD TO!

00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:54.683
WHAT, SETO?

00:19:54.683 --> 00:19:56.819
IT'S NOT OVER.
I THINK BAKURA

00:19:56.819 --> 00:19:58.454
HAS SOMETHING ELSE
PLANNED FOR YUGI.

00:19:58.454 --> 00:20:01.790
Marik, thinking:
WHAT'S THAT FOOL DOING?!

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.459
NEED I POINT OUT
THAT YOU'RE TRAPPED?

00:20:03.459 --> 00:20:05.027
I KNOW.

00:20:05.027 --> 00:20:07.296
SO, SHALL I
CONTROL YOUR MIND

00:20:07.296 --> 00:20:08.330
AND TAKE OVER?

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.498
NEVER!

00:20:09.498 --> 00:20:10.866
I PLAN TO OVERPOWER

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:14.536
THIS PATHETIC DUELIST
ON MY OWN, MARIK!

00:20:14.536 --> 00:20:16.772
NOW PREPARE YOURSELF,
YUGI!

00:20:16.772 --> 00:20:19.775
IT'S MY MOVE, AND THIS DUEL
IS FAR FROM OVER.

00:20:21.243 --> 00:20:24.546
HUH? HA HA HA!

00:20:24.546 --> 00:20:25.781
I'VE DONE IT, YUGI!

00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:29.485
THE TIME HAS ARRIVED
FOR ME TO REGAIN MY CONTROL

00:20:29.485 --> 00:20:30.519
WITH THIS CARD!

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:32.721
OH, NO!
HOLD ON!

00:20:32.721 --> 00:20:33.755
YUGI JUST HAD
THIS GUY

00:20:33.755 --> 00:20:34.923
IN THE PALM OF
HIS HAND, RIGHT?

00:20:34.923 --> 00:20:37.926
IT SEEMS LIKE HE JUST DREW
A PRETTY POWERFUL CARD.

00:20:37.926 --> 00:20:40.429
Duke Devlin:
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:42.865
Bakura:
IT'S ALL OVER, YUGI.

00:20:42.865 --> 00:20:44.933
THE CARD I HOLD
IN MY HAND IS MY KEY

00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:46.101
TO ANNIHILATING YOU!

00:20:46.101 --> 00:20:47.936
Yami-Yugi: WHAT CARD
HAVE YOU DRAWN?

00:20:47.936 --> 00:20:51.106
SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP ME
TAKE ALL THAT YOU HAVE!

00:20:51.106 --> 00:20:54.443
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
DEPENDS ON MY VICTORY.
