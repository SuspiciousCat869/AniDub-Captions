WEBVTT

00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:02.996
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:05.265
Tea: IT'S BAKURA,
AND HE'S HURT!

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.634
I JUST FOUND HIM LYING
ON THE GROUND.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:09.136
Tea: HE DOESN'T
LOOK SO GOOD.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.038
HE NEEDS TO GO TO
A HOSPITAL. QUICKLY.

00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:12.673
Marik, voice-over:
THOSE FOOLS HAVE NO IDEA

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:14.508
WHO I REALLY AM!

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:16.877
JOEY, LOOK
BEHIND YOU!
AAH!

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:18.479
LET GO OF HER,
YOU CREEP!

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.615
Tea: JOEY, BEHIND YOU!

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.750
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY FRIENDS?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.786
THAT'S FOR US TO KNOW.

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:27.821
AND LOOK WHO ELSE IS
COMING WITH US...

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:29.189
BIG BROTHER!

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.558
BUT THERE IS ONE WAY
TO SAVE YOUR BROTHER.

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:34.027
MEET US AT THE TOP
OF THAT BUILDING, KAIBA.

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:36.396
IF YOU EXPECT
TO BE REUNITED
WITH YOUR FRIENDS,

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:39.032
YOU'LL JOIN US
AS WELL, YUGI.

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:41.168
I SEE YOU TWO
DECIDED TO SHOW UP.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:42.703
Yugi: YES.
NOW TELL US...

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:44.738
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:47.107
IT WILL BE A DOUBLE DUEL--
US AGAINST YOU TWO.

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:50.844
IF YOU WIN, YOU'LL SEE
YOUR LOVED ONES AGAIN.
AND AS FOR THE LOSERS?

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:52.646
WHEN YOUR LIFE POINTS
REACH ZERO,

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:54.648
THE SURFACE BELOW YOU
WILL BE DESTROYED,

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:56.650
OPENING UP A VORTEX

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.119
THAT LEADS DIRECTLY
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.256
SO IF YOU'RE READY,
LET'S DUEL!

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:10.664
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:12.065
♪ YOUR MOVE ♪

00:01:18.038 --> 00:01:19.606
♪ YU-GI-OH IS
KING OF GAME ♪

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.398
♪ IT'S TIME
TO D-D-D-D-D-DUEL ♪

00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:11.525
Lumis: ACCEPTING
OUR CHALLENGE WAS
A HUGE MISTAKE.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:13.393
WHEN THIS DOUBLE DUEL
IS OVER,

00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:16.597
YOU TWO WILL BE BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:19.199
THEN WE'LL DELIVER BOTH
OF YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.835
TO MASTER MARIK AND HE
SHALL POSSESS ALL THREE!

00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:23.570
Yugi: WRONG!
WE WILL PREVAIL

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.039
AND YOU WILL
RELEASE MOKUBA
AND MY FRIENDS.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.074
NEVER!

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:31.712
JUST LOOK AT THIS.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:35.015
IT'S MY MASK OF
THE ACCURSED MAGIC CARD.

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.084
AND ONCE I PLACE IT
ON YOUR MONSTER,

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:40.287
IT WILL BE RENDERED
USELESS, YUGI.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:43.857
SO TRY MY MASK ON FOR
SIZE, MAGNET WARRIOR.

00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:45.259
HA HA!

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.027
IT'S A PERFECT FIT.

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.996
AS LONG AS
THIS MASK STAYS ON,

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:50.797
YOUR MONSTER
CAN'T ATTACK OR DEFEND.

00:02:50.797 --> 00:02:52.733
AND THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY EFFECT, YUGI.

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:54.401
UNTIL THE MASK COMES OFF,

00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:57.871
YOU WILL LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS FOR
EVERY TURN YOU TAKE.

00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:59.306
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:02.276
I'LL ALSO PLACE
ONE CARD FACE-DOWN.

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:04.511
NOW IT'S BACK
TO YOUR SIDE.

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.513
Voice-over:
IT'S PROBABLY
A TRAP CARD.

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:08.715
LUMIS HASN'T PLAYED
ONE MONSTER CARD YET.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:12.085
I THINK I'M ON TO
THEIR TEAM STRATEGY.

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:14.755
I BET UMBRA
HOLDS THEIR MONSTER
ARSENAL IN HIS DECK

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:18.125
WHILE LUMIS HOLDS
A DECK FULL OF MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:19.993
TO WEAKEN
OUR MONSTERS!

00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:22.929
YOU'LL BE IN
THE SHADOW REALM
VERY SOON,

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.399
AS SOON AS YOUR
LIFE POINTS REACH ZERO.

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:26.967
AND SPEAKING
OF LIFE POINTS,

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:29.569
YOU LOSE 500 THANKS TO
MY MASK OF THE ACCURSED.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.738
ENOUGH!

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:33.273
Voice-over:
PERFECT!

00:03:33.273 --> 00:03:34.875
THE BEAST
OF GILFER.

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.877
NOW I CAN SACRIFICE
MY MAGNET WARRIOR,

00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:39.012
DESTROYING THEIR
MASK OF THE ACCURSED

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:41.515
AND SUMMON THIS MORE
POWERFUL MONSTER!

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:43.450
Voice-over: IF YUGI
MAKES A FOOLISH MOVE,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.152
HE'LL TAKE ME DOWN WITH HIM.

00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:47.020
SO HE'D BETTER NOT
SCREW THIS UP.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.955
I DEFEATED THESE
2 RARE HUNTERS

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:50.457
ON MY OWN BEFORE,

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:52.492
AND I CAN DO IT AGAIN.

00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:54.961
WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE YOUR MOVE, YUGI?

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:57.397
TRYING TO DELAY YOUR TRIP
TO THE SHADOW REALM?

00:03:57.397 --> 00:03:58.398
HA HA!

00:03:58.398 --> 00:03:59.700
NOT QUITE.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.001
NOW!

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.302
I'LL
SACRIFICE...

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:03.337
MY MAGNET
WARRIOR.

00:04:03.337 --> 00:04:06.306
NOT SO FAST, YUGI!

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:08.075
BEHOLD!

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:11.244
YOU'VE JUST TRIGGERED
MY TRAP CARD--
MASK OF RESTRICT.

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:16.083
WITH THIS ON THE FIELD,
YOU TWO CAN'T WIN.

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:17.584
THAT'S BECAUSE

00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:20.520
AS LONG AS MY
MASK OF RESTRICT CARD
REMAINS IN PLAY,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.389
NEITHER OF YOU
CAN SACRIFICE
YOUR MONSTERS.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.091
AND WITHOUT SACRIFICES,

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:26.860
YOU TWO CAN'T
SUMMON MORE POWERFUL
MONSTERS TO THE FIELD,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.963
MAKING IT THAT MUCH
EASIER TO DEFEAT YOU.

00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:31.565
Voice-over:
I KNEW IT.

00:04:31.565 --> 00:04:34.668
IF WE LOSE THIS DUEL
BECAUSE OF YUGI,
HE'LL BE SORRY!

00:04:34.668 --> 00:04:38.372
OF COURSE, WITHOUT
THE ABILITY TO SACRIFICE,

00:04:38.372 --> 00:04:41.041
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
ARE ALL BUT USELESS NOW

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.009
UNTIL WE CLAIM THEM
FOR MARIK!

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.011
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.814
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN WIN
WITH WEAK MONSTERS.

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.250
WE'VE GOT TO TURN
THIS DUEL AROUND!

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.019
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE-DOWN,

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:54.521
AND THEN I
WILL SUMMON

00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:56.423
KURIBOH
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:04:56.423 --> 00:04:58.392
Voice-over: IF WE'RE GONNA
BEAT THESE RARE HUNTERS,

00:04:58.392 --> 00:05:01.194
KAIBA AND I WILL HAVE
TO DUEL LIKE A TEAM.

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:04.331
KAIBA, YOU KNOW THERE IS
ONLY ONE WAY WE CAN WIN.

00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.467
I DON'T NEED YOU
TELLING ME HOW
TO DUEL, YUGI.

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:10.070
SO YOU CAN
FORGET THE OLD
TEAMWORK SPEECH.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.571
GOT IT?

00:05:11.571 --> 00:05:13.607
WHO NEEDS IT?

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:15.342
YOU DO.

00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:17.611
IF YOU TWO
ARE FINISHED ARGUING...

00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:19.012
IT'S MY TURN.

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:21.047
HMM...

00:05:21.047 --> 00:05:23.583
I COULD ATTACK YOUR
MAGNET WARRIOR, YUGI,

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:26.553
BUT SINCE IT REDUCES
YOUR LIFE POINTS
BY 500 EVERY TURN,

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:28.722
I'D BE A FOOL
TO DESTROY IT.

00:05:28.722 --> 00:05:30.657
THEN THERE'S
YOUR MONSTER, KAIBA.

00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:33.560
BUT YOUR FACE-DOWN CARD
COULD BE A TRAP.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.061
NOT TO WORRY, UMBRA.

00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:36.062
ATTACK.

00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:37.931
I'VE GOT US COVERED.

00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:39.266
EXCELLENT.

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.635
FIRST OFF, I'LL SET
ONE CARD FACE-DOWN.

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:45.505
AND NOW,
MY SHINING ABYSS,

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:48.542
ATTACK KAIBA'S
VORSE RAIDER!

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:50.010
HOLD ON, FOOL.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.412
YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY
RING OF DESTRUCTION!

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:57.017
MY DESTRUCTIVE
TRAP CARD

00:05:57.017 --> 00:05:59.085
WILL WIPE OUT
YOUR SHINING ABYSS.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:01.922
BOTH OF US
WILL LOSE CLOSE TO
2,000 LIFE POINTS,

00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:05.525
BUT ONLY YOU WILL
BE OUT ONE MONSTER!

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:07.160
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.062
BUT MY CARD CANCELS
YOUR TRAP!

00:06:09.062 --> 00:06:10.297
WHAT?

00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:12.332
ACTIVATE
CURSE TRANSFER.

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:14.868
MY COUNTER-TRAP CARD
IS TRIGGERED

00:06:14.868 --> 00:06:16.770
WHENEVER YOU PLAY
A TRAP CARD.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.672
IT AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERS

00:06:18.672 --> 00:06:20.874
YOUR CARD'S EFFECT
BACK TO YOUR MONSTER.

00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:22.843
SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR VORSE RAIDER.

00:06:22.843 --> 00:06:24.478
Voice-over: UMBRA AND KAIBA

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:26.346
WILL BOTH LOSE
ALMOST 2,000 LIFE POINTS

00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:28.248
WHEN VORSE RAIDER
IS DESTROYED

00:06:28.248 --> 00:06:31.017
UNLESS THEY HAVE
A MAGIC CARD
TO PROTECT THEM.

00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:33.119
Yugi: KAIBA, THEY MAY HAVE
SOMETHING PLANNED.

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.321
ZIP IT, YUGI.

00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:35.856
I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON,

00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:38.024
AND I DON'T NEED
YOUR ADVICE.

00:06:38.024 --> 00:06:39.860
PREPARE TO LOSE
YOUR MONSTER

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.363
AND ALMOST HALF
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:46.833
I'VE ACTIVATED
MY MAGIC CARD--
RING OF DEFENSE.

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:50.937
IT WILL PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS
FROM ANY DAMAGE.

00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:52.472
NICE TRY.

00:06:52.472 --> 00:06:53.773
WHY, THANK YOU.

00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:55.375
BUT I'M AFRAID

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:57.677
YOUR RING OF DEFENSE
WON'T BE HELPING
YOU, KAIBA.

00:06:57.677 --> 00:06:58.712
WHY NOT?

00:06:58.712 --> 00:07:01.448
BECAUSE I ACTIVATE THIS--

00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:03.884
MY SPELL TRANSFER
MAGIC CARD.

00:07:03.884 --> 00:07:06.620
IT TRANSFERS YOUR
CARD'S EFFECTS TO ME,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.922
WHICH MEANS MY LIFE POINTS
WILL REMAIN UNTOUCHED

00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:12.125
WHILE YOURS ARE
ALMOST CUT IN HALF.

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:14.594
KAIBA!

00:07:14.594 --> 00:07:16.062
HA HA!

00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:18.398
TOO BAD YOU
WON'T BE SEEING
YOUR BROTHER AGAIN.

00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:20.066
BUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING

00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:22.802
THAT WILL BE
THE LEAST OF
YOUR WORRIES, KAIBA.

00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:25.171
TIME TO WIPE OUT
THE REST OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:26.840
SHINING ABYSS...

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.408
ATTACK NOW!

00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:30.977
SAY HELLO TO
THE SHADOW REALM.

00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:32.746
HA HA!

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:44.213
NOW, WHICH WAY IS
THE HOSPITAL AGAIN?

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:51.387

OF MINIATURE MONSTERS.

00:14:52.202 --> 00:14:54.772
AND I HAVE JUST
THE MAGIC CARD TO DO IT.

00:14:54.772 --> 00:14:56.373
ANOTHER MASK.

00:14:56.373 --> 00:14:58.008
BEHOLD!

00:14:59.643 --> 00:15:01.512
MY MASK OF DISPEL!

00:15:03.213 --> 00:15:04.648
HA HA!

00:15:04.648 --> 00:15:06.917
IT WILL COVER YOUR
MULTIPLYING MAGIC CARD

00:15:06.917 --> 00:15:08.452
AND CONCEAL ITS EFFECT.

00:15:08.452 --> 00:15:10.854
SO I'M AFRAID
YOUR KURIBOH ARMY

00:15:10.854 --> 00:15:13.290
WILL BE REDUCED
BACK DOWN TO ONE.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.892
WITH YOUR WEAK
DEFENSES CRUMBLING,

00:15:14.892 --> 00:15:19.330
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE WE DESTROY YOU BOTH.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.166
THIS WAS EVEN EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:24.635
AND I'M NOT
THROUGH WITH YOU YET.

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:26.537
JUST LIKE YOUR
MAGNET WARRIOR'S MASK,

00:15:26.537 --> 00:15:28.172
WITH THIS IN PLAY,

00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:30.774
YOU LOSE 500 MORE
LIFE POINTS EVERY TURN.

WITH 2 OF MY CARDS
COVERED BY MASKS,

00:15:35.112 --> 00:15:37.715
I'LL LOSE 1,000
LIFE POINTS EVERY TURN!

00:15:37.715 --> 00:15:41.085
IF WE DON'T FIGURE
OUT HOW TO STOP THEM
SOON, IT'S ALL OVER.

00:15:41.085 --> 00:15:42.319
NEXT I'LL SUMMON

00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:43.754
MY GRAND TIKI ELDER

00:15:43.754 --> 00:15:45.322
AND RID THE FIELD

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:47.057
OF YOUR KURIBOH!

00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:48.992
[ROARING]

00:15:53.564 --> 00:15:54.631
ATTACK NOW!

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:02.706
NOW YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:16:02.706 --> 00:16:04.708
ARE WIDE OPEN FOR
A DIRECT ATTACK, YUGI,

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:07.077
SINCE YOUR MAGNET WARRIOR
CAN'T DEFEND YOU,

00:16:07.077 --> 00:16:08.746
THANKS TO THE MASK
IT'S WEARING.

00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:11.782
AND AS SOON AS YOUR
LIFE POINTS REACH ZERO,

00:16:11.782 --> 00:16:14.718
YOU'LL PLUMMET DIRECTLY
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:16:19.422 --> 00:16:21.524
YOU TWO CAN'T POSSIBLY
WIN THIS DUEL.

00:16:21.524 --> 00:16:24.927
NOT ONLY CAN'T YOU
SACRIFICE YOUR MONSTERS
TO SUMMON STRONGER ONES,

00:16:24.927 --> 00:16:26.829
BUT THANKS
TO OUR MASK CARDS,

00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:29.298
YOU LOSE 1,000 LIFE POINTS
EVERY TURN, YUGI.

00:16:29.298 --> 00:16:30.466
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.602
WE'LL SEE!

00:16:32.602 --> 00:16:34.637
Voice-over:
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

00:16:34.637 --> 00:16:37.073
I NEED A CARD
TO TURN THIS AROUND!

00:16:37.073 --> 00:16:39.008
Yugi: I DRAW!

00:16:39.008 --> 00:16:40.743
Voice-over: THIS TRAP CARD
ALLOWS ME TO DESTROY

00:16:40.743 --> 00:16:42.345
ONE CARD
IN MY OPPONENT'S HAND.

00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:44.547
BUT THAT'S NOT
ENOUGH TO HELP US.

00:16:44.547 --> 00:16:46.048
MAYBE <i>THAT</i> CARD CAN HELP.

00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.217
IF I WERE TO ACTIVATE
CARD DESTRUCTION,

00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:51.254
EACH DUELIST WOULD HAVE TO
THROW OUT ALL THEIR CARDS

00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:53.422
AND REDRAW
AN ENTIRELY NEW HAND.

00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:55.258
BUT WAIT...

00:16:55.258 --> 00:16:57.159
IF KAIBA HAS A PLAN
TO BEAT THEM

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:59.228
AND I FORCE HIM TO GET RID
OF HIS ENTIRE HAND,

00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:02.064
I COULD RUIN HIS PLAN.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:04.834
KAIBA DOESN'T WANT
TO DUEL AS A TEAM,

00:17:04.834 --> 00:17:06.836
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HIS STRATEGY IS.

00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:09.805
I HAVE TO MAKE A MOVE, BUT
IT COULD COST US THE DUEL.

00:17:09.805 --> 00:17:11.841
AND WE CAN'T
AFFORD TO LOSE.

00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:13.743
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

00:17:13.743 --> 00:17:15.645
YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY MAKE
THINGS ANY WORSE

00:17:15.645 --> 00:17:17.847
THAN YOU ALREADY
HAVE, YUGI.

00:17:17.847 --> 00:17:20.249
THANKS TO YOU,
THE CARDS
WE'RE HOLDING

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:21.984
ARE ABSOLUTELY
USELESS.

00:17:21.984 --> 00:17:25.187
IN FACT, I HAVE
A CARD IN MY HAND

00:17:25.187 --> 00:17:26.956
THAT COULD WIN
THIS GAME FOR US.

00:17:26.956 --> 00:17:28.958
BUT DUE TO YOUR
SLOPPY DUELING,

00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.761
I CAN'T SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD.

00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:34.497
IT'S BETTER OFF
IN THE GRAVEYARD.

00:17:34.497 --> 00:17:38.401
IT SOUNDS LIKE KAIBA WANTS
TO DISCARD HIS HAND.

00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:41.270
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.939
HA HA! WELL...

00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:44.707
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
SUCH A PATHETIC TEAM?

00:17:44.707 --> 00:17:46.309
DEFEATING THEM

00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:49.178
AND TAKING THEIR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
WILL BE SIMPLE.

00:17:49.178 --> 00:17:51.647
THEY'VE ALREADY DONE
MOST OF THE WORK FOR US.

00:17:51.647 --> 00:17:54.617
THAT'S ENOUGH! I PLACE
ONE CARD FACE-DOWN.

00:17:54.617 --> 00:17:56.852
AND THAT WILL END MY TURN.

00:17:56.852 --> 00:17:58.220
I SEE.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.157
IT APPEARS YOU WEREN'T ABLE
TO SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER

00:18:01.157 --> 00:18:03.025
TO DEFEND YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:18:03.025 --> 00:18:04.794
NOT THAT IT
WOULD HAVE MATTERED,

00:18:04.794 --> 00:18:07.296
FOR I'M ABOUT TO SUMMON
AN UNSTOPPABLE CREATURE.

00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:11.000
BUT FIRST, I NEED TO PLAY
MY ALL-POWERFUL MAGIC CARD

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.303
KNOWN AS CURSE
OF THE MASKED BEAST.

00:18:14.303 --> 00:18:16.505
WHAT IS THAT?!
WHAT IS THAT?!

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.842
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME TO
SACRIFICE BOTH OUR MONSTERS

00:18:19.842 --> 00:18:21.344
AND CALL FORTH

00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:25.348
ONE OF THE MOST
DESTRUCTIVE FORCES
YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED!

00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:28.117
BEHOLD THE ALMIGHTY POWER
OF THE MASKED BEAST!

00:18:28.117 --> 00:18:29.418
[BEAST GROWLING]

00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:35.091
NOTHING CAN
STOP HIS WRATH.

00:18:35.091 --> 00:18:38.060
SO PREPARE TO LOSE
IT ALL, YUGI.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.161
IT CAN'T BE.

00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:42.565
TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS. NOW!

00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:46.168
SEND HIM TO THE SHADOW
REALM, MY MASKED BEAST!

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.206
Kaiba: BATTLE OX,
DEFEND.

00:18:55.878 --> 00:18:57.146
WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:57.146 --> 00:18:59.749
KAIBA'S MONSTER
INTERCEPTED MY ATTACK?

00:18:59.749 --> 00:19:00.983
IT CAN'T BE.

00:19:00.983 --> 00:19:02.451
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:04.220
THIS IS A DOUBLE
DUEL, AFTER ALL,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.789
AND MY TEAMMATE
WAS IN DANGER.

00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:08.858
SO I USED
MY BATTLE OX

00:19:08.858 --> 00:19:11.327
TO DEFEND HIS
LIFE POINTS AGAINST
YOUR MASKED BEAST.

00:19:11.327 --> 00:19:12.795
I THOUGHT

00:19:12.795 --> 00:19:15.564
THAT THEY WEREN'T WORKING
TOGETHER AS A TEAM, LUMIS.

00:19:15.564 --> 00:19:16.665

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.467
LOOK, YUGI,
GIVE IT A REST.

00:19:18.467 --> 00:19:20.403
THERE'S ONE REASON
I HELPED YOU--

00:19:20.403 --> 00:19:21.904
SO I COULD WIN.

THEN YOU'RE A FOOL!

SAVING YOUR PARTNER

00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:27.710
CAUSED YOU
TO LOSE YOUR ONLY
DEFENSIVE MONSTER.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.913
AND SOON IT WILL CAUSE
YOU TO LOSE THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:19:30.913 --> 00:19:33.649
WHEN MY MASKED BEAST
MOVES IN FOR THE ATTACK.

OH, NO!

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:43.359
WE LOSE
OUR ENTIRE HANDS!

00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:44.760
THAT'S CORRECT!

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.929
NOW EACH DUELIST
MUST DEPOSIT

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:50.833
EVERY CARD IN THEIR HAND
INTO THE CARD GRAVEYARD.

00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:53.436
ONCE THEY'RE BURIED,
YOU MUST START OVER

00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:56.806
BY DRAWING
A COMPLETELY NEW HAND.

00:19:56.806 --> 00:19:59.675

THIS MIGHT BE MY ONLY
CHANCE TO SAVE MY FRIENDS.

00:19:59.675 --> 00:20:01.710
NOW I'LL SEND MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.312

00:20:03.312 --> 00:20:06.182
FORCE YOU TO GIVE UP
ANY CARDS YOU NEEDED?

00:20:06.182 --> 00:20:07.883
ACTUALLY, WHAT
JUST HAPPENED IS

QUITE THE OPPOSITE,

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:12.121
WITHOUT THE ABILITY
TO SACRIFICE,

00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:14.557
I WASN'T ABLE TO SUMMON
THE MONSTER IN MY HAND.

00:20:14.557 --> 00:20:15.891
BUT NOW I CAN.

00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:16.892
AAH!

00:20:16.892 --> 00:20:18.661
WATCH CLOSELY!

REVEAL MONSTER REBORN.

00:20:21.797 --> 00:20:23.532

IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

IT IS!

00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:34.376
THIS IS
THE PRICE YOU PAY

00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:36.912
FOR USING
MY LITTLE BROTHER
TO GET TO ME.

00:20:36.912 --> 00:20:38.614
NOW MAYBE
YOU'LL THINK TWICE

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:40.950
BEFORE DISRESPECTING
THE KAIBA FAMILY.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.053
