00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.633
THE VERY SEA THAT
TOOK HIM FROM ME

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.001
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.536
Young Mako:
I CAN'T HANG ON!

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.271
YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE,
SON, I PROMISE.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:54.007
DADDY!!!

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.345
Mako: THE OCEAN
CAN BE A VIOLENT
AND UNPREDICTABLE FORCE,

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:01.181
AS WELL AS A CALM
AND TRANQUIL ONE.

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.817
THE STORM PASSED
AS QUICKLY AS IT ARRIVED,

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.020
BUT MY FATHER WAS GONE.

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:09.022
DADDY?

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:11.024
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:12.125
DADDY?!

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.426
Mako: I NOTICED THE LIFEBOAT
WAS MISSING FROM OUR SHIP,

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.495
SO I KNEW
MY FATHER ESCAPED,

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:18.365
AND I WAITED DAY AFTER DAY
FOR HIM TO RETURN.

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:21.001
I EVEN BUILT A MONUMENT
OVERLOOKING THE SEA

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.469
TO GUIDE HIM HOME.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.037
YEARS PASSED,
BUT STILL I WAITED,

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.539
WATCHING THE WAVES FOR ANY
GLIMPSE OF MY FATHER.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.174
HE TAUGHT ME
NEVER TO GIVE UP,

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.377
NO MATTER HOW HOPELESS
THE SITUATION SEEMS.

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:32.779
RAIN OR SHINE,
I KEPT WATCH,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.382
KNOWING HE HAD TO BE
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.183
AND THAT ONE DAY,

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.119
THE SEA WOULD
BRING HIM HOME TO ME.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.121
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.523
Man: SPECIAL
OVERSEAS DELIVERY
FOR MR. TSUNAM...

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.991
AHHHHHH! UNH!

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:46.993
Mako, voice-over:
IT WAS A PACKAGE CONTAINING

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:48.495
A DUEL MONSTERS CARD

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.865
AND AN ANONYMOUS NOTE
THAT READ, "DON'T GIVE UP!"

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.567
THE CARD IN THE PACKAGE
WAS SEA STEALTH TWO,

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.003
A LEGENDARY FISHERMAN,
JUST LIKE MY FATHER.

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:59.439
I WON'T GIVE UP, DAD!

00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:02.175
I'LL FIND YOU SOMEDAY!

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.179
Mako: SO NOW,
I BATTLE EVERY DUEL

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.048
IN THE NAME OF
MY FATHER.

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:09.682
THINKING OF
HIS BRAVERY

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.317
GIVES ME STRENGTH
AND DETERMINATION.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.253
AND MY LEGENDARY
FISHERMAN CARD

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:14.954
REMINDS ME
NEVER TO GIVE UP,

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.057
NO MATTER HOW HARD
THE STRUGGLE.

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:20.126
AND I CAN PROMISE ALL
OF YOU BY THE SEVEN SEAS,

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.495
I WILL NOT
LOSE THIS BATTLE.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:24.864
MY LEGENDARY FISHERMAN
WILL TAKE ME

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.000
STRAIGHT TO THE FINALS.

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:29.869
LET'S GO!

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.871
YES. LET'S GET BACK TO
THIS DUEL SO I CAN WIN!

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.307
I GOT A LOT OF RESPECT
FOR YOU, MAKO,

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:36.576
BUT I'M THE ONE
GOIN' TO THE FINALS,

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.179
AND I'M GONNA FILLET
ALL YOUR FISH
TO GET THERE!

00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:42.182
THEN GO AHEAD
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE,
LITTLE MINNOW!

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:45.518
I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN...

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.822
AND THEN I'LL
SUMMON A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:50.857
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.792
MY OCEAN ASSAULT
SHALL CONTINUE.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:54.828
SO, PREPARE
FOR THE WORST,

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.464
FOR THIS NEXT MONSTER
CAN'T BE STOPPED!

00:09:58.465 --> 00:09:59.499
NOW, I'LL PLAY THIS!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.634
MY FORTRESS WHALE'S
OATH CARD!

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:06.272
I'LL USE THIS MAGIC CARD
AND SACRIFICE TWO MONSTERS...

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.512
SO I CAN
BRING FORTHTHIS!

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:16.449
ARISE,
MY FORTRESS WHALE!

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:22.956
WHOA!
WHAT'S THAT THING?!

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.059
THE MOST POWERFUL
CREATURE IN MY DECK,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.029
CAPABLE OF CRUSHING YOU
WITH A SINGLE SWIPE!

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.368
Yami-Bakura:
WHAT DO I NEED
TO DO FORYOU

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:37.437
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE
MILLENNIUM ITEMS, MARIK?

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:39.506
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE,
ACTUALLY.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.407
ALL RIGHT,
I'M LISTENING.

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:43.343
WELL, FIRST,
ANSWER ME THIS...

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:45.645
HOW STRONG ARE
YOUR DUELING SKILLS?

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:47.614
THEY'RE
EXTREMELY STRONG!

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.048
EXCELLENT.

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:52.218
YOU SHOULD KNOW,
I'VE DUELED IN
SEVERAL SHADOW GAMES

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:53.753
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:55.555
SURPRISED?

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.725
I'M NOT.
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.060
I'VE RETURNED FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.129
OF OBTAINING THE
SEVEN MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.297
AND THE POWER
THEY POSSESS.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.099
NOW, I'LL ASK YOU
ONCE AGAIN,

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:07.734
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROMME?

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:10.203
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO DUEL ON MY BEHALF.

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:12.572
THEN I'LL DELIVER
THE ITEMS TO YOU.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.041
I'LL DUEL WHOMEVER
YOU WANT ME TO,

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.777
PROVIDED I RECEIVE MY
PAYMENT ONCE I'M DONE.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:20.513
BUT TELL ME,
JUST WHAT IS IT
YOU EXPECT TO GAIN

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.882
FROM THIS BATTLE I DUEL
FOR YOU, MARIK?

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:24.884
I TOLD YOU.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:26.586
I'M A COLLECTOR
LIKE YOU.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.724
WIN ME THE CARDS I WANT,
AND THE ITEMS ARE YOURS.

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:36.930
THAT'S A WHALE
OF A MONSTER
RIGHT THERE, FOLKS!

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:38.331
Mako:
AND THE OCEAN FIELD

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:40.200
GIVES IT EVEN MORE
ATTACK POINTS.

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.368
I THINK I MAY BE IN
OVER MY HEAD HERE!

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:44.337
I MUST AGREE!

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.206
FOR STARTERS,
I'M GOING TO DESTROY

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.707
YOUR DEFENSE MONSTER.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.776
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN,
ATTACK!

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:52.312
HUH?

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.950
NOW THAT YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS ON THE FIELD...

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.887
FORTRESS WHALE, ATTACK HIS
LIFE-POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.356
AAH!

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.659
OH, NO!
Both:
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.064
Man: WHEELER'S
ALMOST FINISHED!

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.066
Woman:
COME ON, JOEY!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.567
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:16.269
THIS DUEL
ISN'T OVER YET!

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.706
YOU'RE ONE STEP AWAY
FROM THE BATTLE CITY
FINALS, JOEY!

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:22.809
Mako: YOUR LIFE-POINTS
ARE ALMOST DEPLETED.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.144
ONE MORE ATTACK,
AND YOU'RE SUNK!

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.680
[THINKING]
IF I'M GONNA GET
OUTTA THIS MESS,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.515
I GOTTA SUMMON A MONSTER
AND ATTACK HIM.

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:31.184
BUT, HIS WHALE'S
TOO POWERFUL,

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.785
AND IN ORDER TO ATTACK
HIS FISHERMAN,

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.221
I'D HAVE TO
FINDIT FIRST!

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:37.223
COME ON, JOEY!

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.425
THERE'S STILL TIME TO
TURN THIS DUEL AROUND!

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.494
JUST BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF!

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.097
LOOK! SEE THOSE
TWO SHADOWS?

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.699
HM?
ONE OF THEM HAS
GOTTA BE THE FISHERMAN

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:48.167
THAT MAKO HID
UNDER THE WATER!

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.437
MAKE YOUR MOVE, JOEY,
SO I CAN END THIS DUEL!

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.706
WITH MY FORTRESS WHALE
ABOVE

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.276
AND MY LEGENDARY FISHERMAN
HIDDEN BELOW,

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:58.044
YOU'RE FINISHED!
HUH?

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.680
AAH! HUH?

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:02.682
[THINKING]
THE AQUARIUM'S
KILLER WHALE!

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.083
IF HE'S OVER THERE,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.585
THEN THE OTHER SHADOW
UNDERWATER

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:07.153
MUST BE MAKO'S
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN!

00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:08.688
I FOUND HIM!

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.223
NOW, I JUST NEED
THE RIGHT CARD

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.391
SO I CAN
DESTROY HIM!

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:14.060
HMM,
LET'S SEE HERE.

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:16.062
I GOT TWO MAGIC CARDS,

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.364
ONE MONSTER CARD,
AND ONE TRAP CARD,

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.067
PLUS ONE CARD FACEDOWN
ON THE FIELD.

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:23.069
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.738
BUT I THINK I KNOW
HOW TO DESTROY
BOTH HIS MONSTERS.

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:29.175
I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.944
THEN, I'LL SUMMON
MY PANTHER WARRIOR

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.047
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.685
SINCE PANTHER WARRIOR
NEEDS A SACRIFICE

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.821
IN ORDER TO ATTACK,
I GOTTA END MY TURN.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.090
GO AHEAD, CRAB-CAKE!

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:46.526
AS SOON AS MY
FORTRESS WHALE ATTACKS,

00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:48.995
YOUR LIFE POINTS
WILL GO DOWN TO ZERO!

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.865
PREPARE TO BE CAPSIZED
BY MY ALMIGHTY BEHEMOTH!!

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.503
TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.272
ATTACK, MY WHALE!

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.008
Joey: NOT QUITE.
I GOT A PLAN TO TURN

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.010
BOTH YOUR MONSTERS
INTO FISH STICKS!

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.379
SO, I'LL ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD NOW!

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.648
MAGIC ARM SHIELD!

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:10.717
ATTACH TO
PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.486
AND NOW, IT'S TIME
TO GO FISHING!

00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:16.856
AND I KNOW JUST
WHERE TO FIND THE
CATCH OF THE DAY!

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.257
Crowd: WHOA!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.259
Joey: NOW IT'S TIME
TO REEL HIM IN

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:22.261
AND USE HIM AS A SHIELD
AGAINSTYOURATTACK!!

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.465
NO!
MY LEGENDARY FISHERMAN!

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:28.534
IDON'T HAVE TO
DESTROY HIM,

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:31.738
'CAUSEYOURWHALE'S
ABOUT TO DO THAT FOR ME!

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:35.508
IT CAN'T BE!

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.343
DADDY, LOOK OUT!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.379
AAH!

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:44.283
[SIGHS]

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.986
I DESTROYED MY OWN
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN,

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:50.390
THE MOST PRIZED CARD
IN MY ENTIRE DUELING DECK.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.392
HOW COULD I BE
SO CARELESS

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.360
TO LET SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN?

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.162
HEY,
IT'S JUST A CARD.

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:57.864
IT'S MORE
THAN JUST A CARD.

00:14:58.765 --> 00:14:59.899
I NEED MY
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN
