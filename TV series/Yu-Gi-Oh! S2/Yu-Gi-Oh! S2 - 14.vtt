I'VE GOT DUELS TO WIN!

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:09.265
Boy: HERE COMES
JOEY NOW.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:11.200
HEY GUYS,
LONG-TIME-NO-SEE!

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.635
HEY.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:14.670
STILL IN THE TOURNAMENT,
WHEELER?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.738
YOU BET.

00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:17.106
I'M ALREADY
THE PROUD OWNER

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:18.574
OF TWO LOCATOR CARDS.

00:01:18.574 --> 00:01:21.244
THEN I GUESS
I'M TWICE AS GOOD.

00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:24.013
WHAT? YOU GOT
4 LOCATOR CARDS?!

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:25.181
AWESOME JOB,
MAI!

00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:26.783
I'VE GOT 3
SO FAR.

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:27.817
Joey: AW, MAN.

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:29.385
I GOT THE LEAST!

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.722
HOW AM I EVER GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!?

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:34.223
DON'T WORRY, JOEY.

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:35.725
THERE'S STILL
PLENTY OF TIME.

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:37.493
YOU NEED A TOTAL
OF 6 LOCATOR CARDS

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:39.662
TO GET TO THE FINALS,
AND I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT!

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:41.063
WELL, NONE OF
US ARE GONNA

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:42.198
GET TO THE FINALS
IF WE'RE STANDING

00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:43.232
AROUND HERE.

00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:44.300
MAI'S RIGHT.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.035
WATCH OUT, 'CAUSE
I'M ABOUT TO

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:47.537
DO SOME SERIOUS
CATCHING UP!

00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:50.072
GOOD LUCK

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.542
LUCK IS
FOR AMATEURS!

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:53.676
LATER, YUGE!

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:56.279
I KNOW ONE OF MARIK'S
HUNTERS IS AFTER ME.

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.948
I'LL BE READY FOR HIM.

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:00.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.921
Marik: I'M WATCHING EVERY MOVE
YOU MAKE, LITTLE YUGI.

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:10.660
Girl: YUGI ALREADY
TOOK OFF!?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.628
Man: YES, HE WANTED
TO GET AN EARLY START

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:14.530
ON THE TOURNAMENT TODAY.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.032
I TOLD YOU TO
GET OFF OF THE PHONE

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:17.166
SO WE COULD MEET
HIM ON TIME!

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.068
YEAH, WELL I WAS ON

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:20.837
AN EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT CALL.

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:24.006
I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF
SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS, TEA.

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.875
Tea: YOU MEAN FLIRTING
WITH SERENITY!?

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.577
AT THIS RATE,
I'M NEVER GONNA

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:28.678
GET TO SEE YUGI DUEL.

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:31.514
NOT TRUE! I'LL SLIP
ON MY COMFY SHOES

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:33.216
AND HELP YOU
TWO FIND HIM.

00:02:33.216 --> 00:02:35.685
Joey: I GOTTA SNAG ME SOME
OF THOSE LOCATOR CARDS

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:37.353
SO MAI DOESN'T
TOTALLY SHOW ME UP.

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:38.788
BUT WHO'S GONNA BE
MY NEXT CHALLENGE?

00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:41.190
NOW I'M READY FOR ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO DUEL!

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.659
THIS DECK OF MINE
ALWAYS COMES THROUGH.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.595
Boy: JOEY WHEELER?!

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:47.196
HUH?

00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:49.098
I KNEW I
RECOGNIZED YOU!

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:51.067
THINK I COULD HAVE
YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.336
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
JUST WALKING AROUND

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:54.971
THE STREET LIKE
A REGULAR GUY.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:56.539
YUP, IT'S ME,

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:57.707
SO WHO SHOULD
I MAKE IT OUT TO?

00:02:57.707 --> 00:02:58.774
LET'S SEE...

00:02:58.774 --> 00:03:00.142
MAKE IT OUT TO MY
SISTER JESSICA.

00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:01.210
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.212
THIS WILL TOTALLY
BLOW HER MIND.

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:04.347
SHE HAS A BIG CRUSH
ON YOU!

00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:05.848
YEAH!

00:03:05.848 --> 00:03:07.483
LET'S SEE,

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:09.352
"TO MY ADORING FAN,
JESSICA."

00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:11.454
THAT DUEL DISC IS
SO TOTALLY COOL!

00:03:11.454 --> 00:03:12.722
OH, YEAH...

00:03:12.722 --> 00:03:15.758
I DO MAKE THIS THING LOOK
PRETTY COOL, DON'T I?

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.260
HEY, JOEY,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.428
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
OK IF I TRIED IT ON?

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:20.763
JUST FOR A SEC!

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:22.265
I PROMISE I'LL BE
CAREFUL WITH IT.

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:25.434
OKAY. I GUESS IT
COULDN'T DO ANY HARM.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:26.569
HERE YOU GO.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.504
WOW! SAY,
THIS IS SO COOL!

00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:30.439
BEIN' A DUELIST
IS HARD WORK.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.974
YOU DON'T JUST
PUT A DUEL DISC

00:03:31.974 --> 00:03:33.643
ONTO YOUR ARM
AND THEN PRESTO.

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:36.112
YOU GOTTA EXERCISE...

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:37.580
MY DUEL DISC!

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.115
GET BACK HERE
YOU LITTLE RAT!

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:41.317
Tea: YUGI COULD
BE ANYWHERE.

00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:42.585
WE'LL FIND HIM.

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:44.820
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
VIEW FROM UP HERE.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.455
CHECK THAT OUT, GUYS.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.057
Joey: YOU LITTLE
LYING PUNK!

00:03:48.057 --> 00:03:49.725
IT'S A CHASE?

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:51.427
LOOKS LIKE SOME
YOUNGSTERS ARE
PLAYING TAG.

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:54.397
Tea: WAIT A SEC!

00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:56.032
All: HEY, THAT'S JOEY!

00:03:56.032 --> 00:03:57.967
I GOT YOUR BACK, MAN!

00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:01.704
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
GET OFF OF ME!

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:02.972
TRISTAN!

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:04.407
WHAT'S HE DOING WITH
YOUR DUEL DISC?

00:04:04.407 --> 00:04:06.876
THAT'S WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO FIND OUT!

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.745
Boy: I'M REALLY SORRY.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:13.082
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO BECOME A DUELIST.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:15.084
SEE, I FINALLY BUILT A DECK

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:16.252
THAT I COULD DUEL WITH

00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:19.488
WHEN THIS GUY
STOLE ALL MY CARDS.

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:20.756
SO, YOU STOLE
SOMEONE ELSE'S.

00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:22.291
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:24.727
I JUST WANTED TO BE IN
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT.

00:04:24.727 --> 00:04:25.995
THAT'S ALL.

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:28.230
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF BEING A GREAT DUELIST

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.899
IS ALWAYS PLAYING WITH HONOR.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:32.868
THERE WOULD BE NO SATISFACTION
IN CHEATING YOUR WAY IN.

00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:34.437
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

00:04:34.437 --> 00:04:36.973
SO, WHO'S THE PUNK THAT
STOLE YOUR DUELING DECK?

00:04:36.973 --> 00:04:39.375
I DON'T KNOW--
HE HAD BUG EYES

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.910
AND A HEAD
LIKE A BLUE BEETLE.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.080
BUG EYES?
HEAD LIKE
A BEETLE?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.282
WAIT A SEC!

00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:48.484
All: IT'S GOTTA BE
WEEVIL UNDERWOOD!

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:51.520
I GUESS WEEVIL'S STILL UP TO
HIS OLD TRICKS, EH, JOEY?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.855
Joey: ALRIGHT,
NOW I'M ANGRY!

00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:54.490
WHERE IS HE?

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.791
NOW I'M GONNA TEACH
THAT LITTLE BUG

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.859
A THING OR TWO!

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.461
Boy: HE'S BY
THE FOUNTAIN.

00:04:58.461 --> 00:04:59.996
Joey: HE'S MINE!
HOLD ON!

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:02.398
JOEY!
GOODBYE, NOW!

00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:04.767
SEE YA,
AND GOOD LUCK!

00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:14.176
SO, WERE YOU
SUCCESSFUL?

00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:15.611
YUP, TOTALLY!

00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:17.680
I DID WHAT
YOU TOLD ME TO,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.849
AND THEY BELIEVED
EVERY SINGLE WORD.

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.352
HA! THEN THE FOOLS HAVE
CRAWLED RIGHT INTO MY TRAP!

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:25.121
WHEELER IS MINE!

00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:26.188
[LAUGHS]

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:27.456
ALRIGHT, I DID IT.

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:29.225
NOW GIVE ME THAT RARE
CARD YOU PROMISED ME.

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:31.660
AH, YES, THE RARE CARD.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.728
OH, AWESOME!

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:35.598
HEY! IT'S A STINKING
GOKIBORE CARD!

00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:37.033
EVERYBODY
HAS THIS ONE!

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.601
HA.

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:41.070
SO, YOU WANT ME TO
GIVE YOU SOMETHING ELSE?

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.571
YEAH!
ALRIGHT...

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.207
HOW ABOUT A TASTE
OF MY ARACHNO SLIME!!

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:47.176
[LAUGHS]

00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:50.713
MY PLAN IS COMING
TOGETHER PERFECTLY.

00:05:50.713 --> 00:05:56.252
YUGI MAY HAVE DEFEATED MY
GREAT MOTH IN DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:57.987
BUT AFTER THE TRAP
I'VE SET...

00:05:57.987 --> 00:05:59.822
WHEELER WON'T
STAND A CHANCE!

00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:01.791
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.340
Woman: KENTA! YOU
CAN'T HIDE FROM ME!

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.809
SERENITY,

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.410
DID YOU HEAR ANYONE
COME IN HERE?

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.978
NO.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

00:06:22.978 --> 00:06:24.246
THERE'S A LITTLE BOY
RUNNING AROUND THE WARD

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:26.382
TRYING TO AVOID
GETTING HIS X-RAYS TAKEN.

00:06:26.382 --> 00:06:28.484
HE MUST BE SCARED.

00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:30.786
YEAH, HE WON'T GO
NEAR THE MACHINE,

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:33.355
EVEN THOUGH I TOLD HIM
IT'S PAINLESS.

00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:37.359
IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN
COME OUT NOW.

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:39.795
YOU KNEW I WAS HERE?

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:41.030
I COULD HEAR
YOU BREATHING

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.865
UNDER THE BED.

00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:45.167
SO, HOW COME YOU
DIDN'T TURN ME IN?

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:47.770
I WAS KINDA SCARED OF
SOME OF THE TESTS HERE, TOO.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.338
BUT YOU KNOW,

00:06:49.338 --> 00:06:51.507
THEY'RE NOT AS BAD
AS YOU THINK THEY ARE.

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:53.042
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:54.677
TO PAY YOU BACK
FOR COVERING FOR ME!

00:06:54.677 --> 00:06:55.778
ANY IDEAS?

00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:58.914
YEAH, I'VE GOT IT.

00:06:58.914 --> 00:07:01.150
YOU COULD CHECK OUT
THE BATTLE CITY
WEB SITE FOR ME.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.952
SURE, BUT HOW COME?

00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:04.720
MY BROTHER'S DUELING TODAY.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.156
HE'S A DUELIST?
AWESOME!

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.758
Joey: WHERE IS THAT
BUG-EYED PUNK?

00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:12.161
THAT KID SAID HE
WAS AROUND HERE!

00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:15.531
Weevil: LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:18.234
Tristan: I THOUGHT
I SMELLED A DUNG BEETLE.

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:21.971
THAT'S MY GREETING
AFTER ALL THIS TIME?

00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:24.006
YOU STOLE THAT
LITTLE KID'S CARDS,

00:07:24.006 --> 00:07:25.174
DIDN'T YOU,
WORM-BREATH?

00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:27.576
I DON'T REMEMBER
STEALING ANY CARDS.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:31.147
WELL THEN, MAYBE I CAN HELP
REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:32.681
TRISTAN, WAIT.

00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:34.884
WE'LL SETTLE THIS FAIR
AND SQUARE WITH A DUEL.

00:07:34.884 --> 00:07:36.986
Tea: BE REALLY
CAREFUL, JOEY.

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:39.388
REMEMBER WHEN
WEEVIL THREW
YUGI'S EXODIA CARDS

00:07:39.388 --> 00:07:40.723
OFF THE BOAT TO
DUELIST ISLAND?

00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:42.191
THIS GUY'S
A MAJOR CHEATER!

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:43.692
[LAUGHING]

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:46.162
CAREFUL WHERE YOU POINT
THAT FINGER, TEA.

00:07:46.162 --> 00:07:48.397
IT MIGHT GET BITTEN
BY ONE OF MY PETS.

00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:50.533
GROSS!

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:51.934
Joey: ALRIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS!

00:07:51.934 --> 00:07:53.669
THAT'S FINE WITH ME,

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.038
BUT WE'LL DUEL FOR
TWO LOCATOR CARDS!

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:57.106
TWO OF THEM?

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:59.008
Tea: BUT IF YOU LOSE
BOTH LOCATOR CARDS,

00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:01.243
YOU'LL HAVE NO WAY OF
GETTING TO THE FINALS!

00:08:01.243 --> 00:08:03.078
IT'S WAY
TOO RISKY, JOEY.

00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:05.648
THAT'S IF YOU
EVEN HAVE TWO!

00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:06.949
THAT'S IT!!

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:08.050
BE CAREFUL,
JOEY!

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.052
YUGI SQUASHED THIS
CREEPY LITTLE BUG

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:11.287
THE FIRST TIME
THEY SQUARED OFF

00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:12.421
AT DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:14.390
NOW I GUESS IT'S MY
TURN TO DO THE SAME.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.725
HOW MANY LOCATOR CARDS
DO YOU HAVE?

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:17.826
TWO!

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:19.762
THEN ONCE I STEP ON
YA AND TAKE THEM BOTH,

00:08:19.762 --> 00:08:21.163
PLUS YOUR RAREST CARD,

00:08:21.163 --> 00:08:22.731
I'LL BE PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.401
FOR KICKING YOUR
UGLY MUG OUT OF
THE TOURNAMENT!

00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.204
JUST LIKE YUGI DID
LAST TIME!

00:08:30.172 --> 00:08:32.074
[LAUGHS]

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.578
LET'S DO THIS!

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:36.845
Both: IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:08:36.845 --> 00:08:38.380
Joey: FIRST
I'LL PLAY...

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.550
MY SWORDSMAN
OF LANDSTAR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.319
[ROARS]

00:08:43.319 --> 00:08:44.420
AND I'LL LEAVE
THIS LITTLE NUMBER

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.889
FACE DOWN FOR LATER.

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:48.224
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:08:48.224 --> 00:08:49.992
YOUR "SWORDSMAN"
LOOKS LIKE

00:08:49.992 --> 00:08:51.860
HE POPPED OUT
OF A TOY-BOX!

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.929
THIS TOY'S GONNA SLICE
AND DICE YOUR HIDE.

00:08:53.929 --> 00:08:55.798
WELL IS THAT SO?

00:08:55.798 --> 00:08:58.067
NOT IF I PLAY
THE MUCH MORE POWERFUL

00:08:58.067 --> 00:09:00.836
FLYING KAMAKIRI #1!

00:09:00.836 --> 00:09:03.672
NOW MY FLYING FRIEND,
ATTACK!

00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:05.207
CRUSH HIS MINI-MONSTER!

00:09:05.207 --> 00:09:08.177
UH-UH.
WATCH THIS!

00:09:08.177 --> 00:09:10.980
IT'S MY SHIELD
AND SWORD MAGIC CARD!

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.015
IT SWAPS THE ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:09:13.015 --> 00:09:14.183
OF BOTH OUR MONSTERS,

00:09:14.183 --> 00:09:15.851
MAKING MY SWORDSMAN'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:17.553
A CUT ABOVE YOUR BUG'S!

00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:19.255
[GROANS]

00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:20.856
[LAUGHS]

00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:22.324
NICE TRY.

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:25.361
BUT WHEN FLYING KAMAKIRI #1
IS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:27.930
IT AUTOMATICALLY SUMMONS
THE EVEN MORE POWERFUL WARRIOR

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.964
TO TAKE ITS PLACE!

00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:31.734
THE DREADED
FLYING KAMAKIRI #2!

00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:33.702
[LAUGHS]

00:09:33.702 --> 00:09:35.437
SERENITY,

00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:37.373
YOUR BROTHER'S NAME
IS JOEY WHEELER, RIGHT?

00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:38.474
THAT'S IT.

00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:41.477
OH MAN! IT SAYS
HE'S DUELING

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:43.445
WITH A REGIONAL
CHAMPION RIGHT NOW!

00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:45.848
HEY, DON'T SOUND
SO WORRIED.

00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:48.083
MY BROTHER CAME
IN SECOND PLACE

00:09:48.083 --> 00:09:50.185
IN THE DUELIST
KINGDOM TOURNAMENT.

00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:52.821
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:56.258
I KNOW JOEY WILL
BEAT THIS GUY.

00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:58.694
YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR
MY WINGED WARRIOR,

00:09:58.694 --> 00:10:00.629
SO GIVE IT UP, WHEELER!

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.532
[THINKING]
AWESOME--IT'S JINZO,

00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:05.167
THE CARD I WON
FROM ESPA ROBA!

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:06.969
NOW I JUST NEED TO
GET IT ON THE FIELD.

00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:08.504
HURRY UP, WHEELER.

00:10:08.504 --> 00:10:11.340
MY FLYING KAMAKIRI
IS GETTING HUNGRY.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.708
AND IT'S FEEDING TIME!

00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:14.176
JUST IGNORE HIM.

00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:15.544
Tristan:
COME ON, JOEY.

00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:17.346
HA, NO SWEAT.

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:18.914
I'LL JUST SACRIFICE
MY SWORDSMAN,

00:10:18.914 --> 00:10:20.783
SO I CAN PUT JINZO
ON THE MAP!

00:10:20.783 --> 00:10:23.519
[ROARS]

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.654
JINZO! SMASH
HIS KAMAKIRI

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:27.022
LIKE A BUG
ON A WINDSHIELD!

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:29.892
Joey: YEAH!

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.327
OH!

00:10:31.327 --> 00:10:33.362
THAT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN!

00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:35.698
HA! EAT DIRT,
YOU LITTLE GRUB!

00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:37.032
Tea: SQUASH THAT
MEALWORM, JOEY!

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:40.002
HERE'S ONE MORE...
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:40.002 --> 00:10:42.438
JUST TRY TO ATTACK THIS!

00:10:42.438 --> 00:10:44.740
YOU JUST SET 'EM UP...

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.475
AND I'LL KNOCK 'EM DOWN.

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:47.843
JINZO, ATTACK!

00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.913
AAH!

00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:52.381
HA HA HA!

00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:53.382
WHAT'S THAT?

00:10:53.382 --> 00:10:56.452
THAT'S MY FLYING
LEECH, KISEITAI!

00:10:56.452 --> 00:10:59.388
IT ATTACHES ITSELF
TO THE FIRST MONSTER
THAT ATTACKS IT.

00:10:59.388 --> 00:11:00.923
THEN IT INCREASES
MY LIFE POINTS

00:11:00.923 --> 00:11:02.858
BY 1200 EVERY TIME
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:11:02.858 --> 00:11:05.260
SO, AS LONG AS MY LEECH
CONTINUES TO FEED,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.262
MY LIFE POINTS
CONTINUE TO GROW!

00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:08.230
THAT'S NOT COOL.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.232
DISGUSTING.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.235
AND THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING

00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:15.337
OF WHAT I HAVE
PLANNED FOR YOU.

00:11:15.337 --> 00:11:18.107
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT THE INSECT WORLD,

00:11:18.107 --> 00:11:20.876
AND I'M JUST THE DUELIST
TO TEACH YOU, WHEELER!

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:24.046
NOW I'LL PLAY ANOTHER
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:24.046 --> 00:11:25.848
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT!

00:11:25.848 --> 00:11:28.083
AND I'LL TAKE
MORE LIFE POINTS!

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:30.018
[LAUGHS]

00:11:30.018 --> 00:11:33.288
THANKS TO MY
LEECH FRIEND.

00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:35.424
JINZO MAY HAVE
A LEECH ON HIM,

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:37.259
BUT HE CAN
STILL CYBER-ATTACK!

00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:42.931
[LAUGHING]
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:45.334
HEY WAIT.
MORE LIFE POINTS?

00:11:45.334 --> 00:11:48.337
THAT'S RIGHT! YOU ATTACKED
MY SKULL-MARK LADYBUG,

00:11:48.337 --> 00:11:50.773
WHICH GIVES ME AN EXTRA
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:54.309
DIDN'T I TELL YOU,
YOU HAD A LOT TO LEARN!?

00:11:54.309 --> 00:11:57.946
INSECT CARDS CAN BE
VERY, VERY TRICKY.

00:11:57.946 --> 00:11:59.815
I'M AFRAID JOEY IS
GOING TO HAVE TO BE

00:11:59.815 --> 00:12:01.216
READY FOR ANYTHING.

00:12:01.216 --> 00:12:05.788
HA! I'LL PLAY YET ANOTHER
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:05.788 --> 00:12:07.856
AND SINCE IT'S
YOUR TURN AGAIN...

00:12:07.856 --> 00:12:09.925
MORE LIFE POINTS, PLEASE.

00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:10.926
[LAUGHS]

00:12:10.926 --> 00:12:12.361
WITH MY LEECH FEEDING
ON YOUR MONSTER,

00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:14.029
MY LIFE POINTS WILL
CONTINUE TO GROW,

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:15.731
MAKING ME INDESTRUCTIBLE!

00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:19.201
SAY GOODBYE TO
THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT, WHEELER!

00:12:23.098 --> 00:12:24.900
NOW HOW'S JOEY DOING?

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.170
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
IN KIND OF A TIGHT SPOT.
OH.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.238
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:30.406
HE'S PLAYING
REALLY WELL...

00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.875
BUT THIS UNDERWOOD GUY
KEEPS TURNING THINGS AROUND.

00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:34.910
I KNOW MY BROTHER
CAN HANDLE

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.279
WHATEVER HIS OPPONENT
TRIES TO DO.

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.781
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

00:12:38.781 --> 00:12:41.784
MY BROTHER JOEY WON'T
LET ANYTHING STOP HIM.

00:12:41.784 --> 00:12:43.919
HE'S BEEN IN TOUGH
SITUATIONS BEFORE,

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:46.088
AND HE ALWAYS COMES
THROUGH AND MAKES ME PROUD.

00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:48.090
I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT...

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.626
BECAUSE IF HE LOSES HIS
ONLY TWO LOCATOR CARDS,

00:12:50.626 --> 00:12:51.727
HE'S OUT OF
THE TOURNAMENT!

00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:52.961
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING

00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:55.397
THAT MY BROTHER
NEEDS TO DO RIGHT NOW:

00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:57.833
HE NEEDS TO BELIEVE
IN HIMSELF.

00:12:57.833 --> 00:12:58.834
HERE GOES
NOTHING...

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:01.937
AHH, THIS
WILL HELP.

00:13:01.937 --> 00:13:03.872
IT'S TIME TO BURN
OFF YOUR LEECH.

00:13:03.872 --> 00:13:05.741
BUG BOY,
MEET PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.015
IT NEEDS A SACRIFICE
IN ORDER TO ATTACK,

00:13:13.015 --> 00:13:16.018
SO, I'LL SACRIFICE MY JINZO

00:13:16.018 --> 00:13:18.253
AND GET RID OF YOUR LEECH.

00:13:18.253 --> 00:13:21.123
NOW PANTHER WARRIOR,
ATTACK!

00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:25.327
ALRIGHT!

00:13:25.327 --> 00:13:27.563
JOEY GOT RID OF THAT
BLOODSUCKING LEECH!

00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:28.630
THAT STOPS WEEVIL'S
LIFE POINTS

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.698
FROM INCREASING!

00:13:29.698 --> 00:13:33.969
OKAY, WHEELER,
ENOUGH PLAYING AROUND.

00:13:33.969 --> 00:13:36.872
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
I'VE BEEN GOING EASY ON YOU.

00:13:36.872 --> 00:13:39.108
BUT YOU'RE
STARTING TO BUG ME,

00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:40.843
SO THE TIME HAS COME
TO UNLEASH

00:13:40.843 --> 00:13:43.746
THE FURY OF MY ULTIMATE
DESTROYER!

00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:46.181
I SUMMON THE LARVAE MOTH!

00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:53.589
IT'S THE BUG THAT WEEVIL
USED AGAINST YUGI...

00:13:53.589 --> 00:13:55.390
[LAUGHS]

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.193
I SEE YOUR MEMORY'S
