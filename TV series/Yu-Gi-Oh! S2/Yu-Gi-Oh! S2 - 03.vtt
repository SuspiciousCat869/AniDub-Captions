WELCOME TO AMERICA.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.575
THANK YOU, BUT PLEASE,
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.843
OF COURSE.
I MUST SAY, WE WERE
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.246
THAT YOU CHOSE OUR
TOWN TO HOST YOUR
EGYPTIAN COLLECTION.

YOUR RARE ARTIFACTS,

WE'VE TAKEN
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS.

I DEVISED
AN INGENIOUS PLAN
TO TRANSPORT THE ITEMS

WITHOUT A HINT
OF DETECTION.

ABOUT THESE THINGS.

PLEASE EXCUSE ME,

BUT ESPECIALLY FOR POWER.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.974
THESE GAMES WERE
EPIC BATTLES.

MAY HAVE COMPETED IN A GAME

TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE WORLD.

OF COURSE, THIS IS
STILL SPECULATION,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.146
THOUGH HE COULD NOT
PERMANENTLY DEFEAT
THE MONSTERS,

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:37.050
HE MANAGED TO USE HIS
MAGIC TO SEAL THEM AWAY
IN STONE TABLETS

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.386
AND BROUGHT PEACE
TO THE WORLD.

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.287
HOWEVER,
OVER TIME,

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:44.090
EVIL SORCERERS
LEARNED HOW TO
CONTROL THE MONSTERS

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.959
AND RELEASED THEM
FROM THE TABLETS.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.128
WITH THEIR ARMY
OF POWERFUL MONSTERS,

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:51.164
THE SORCERERS WERE
CONFIDENT THAT NO ONE
COULD STAND IN THEIR WAY.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:52.465
THEY BETRAYED
THE PHARAOH

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.834
AND WAGED
AN ALL-OUT WAR
AGAINST HIM.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.906
THIS IS THE ONE
YOU MUST LOOK AT.
HMM?

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.575
THIS CARVING IS THE REASON
I'VE CALLED YOU HERE TONIGHT.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.578
IT DEPICTS ONE
OF THE MAIN CONFLICTS

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:09.349
IN THE WAR BETWEEN
THE PHARAOH AND HIS
GREATEST OPPONENT.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.819
CLOSELY EXAMINE
THIS ARTIFACT.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.854
AFTER THIS MOMENT,
KAIBA,

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.023
YOUR LIFE WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.360
AH!

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.594
THAT'S THE PHARAOH?

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.596
BUT... THAT'S YUGI!

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:27.834
AND THE MONSTER
CARVED ABOVE HIM
IS THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:30.737
ON THE LEFT
IS THE SORCERER
FIGHTING AGAINST HIM.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.672
THAT'S YOU, KAIBA.

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:34.207
IF YOU STILL
HAVE ANY DOUBT,

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:35.942
LOOK AT HIS MONSTER.

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:38.111
IT'S THE BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:39.913
AH!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.586
THE HIEROGLYPHICS READ
THAT THE MIGHTY SORCERER

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.188
MARCHED INTO
THE PHARAOH'S CHAMBER

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:51.024
AND CHALLENGED HIM
AND HIS LEGION
OF NOBLE MAGICIANS

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:54.828
TO A LEGENDARY DUEL
WITH THE FATE
OF THE WORLD AT STAKE.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.564
AH!

00:09:57.564 --> 00:09:59.933
THE PHARAOH ACCEPTED
THE SORCERER'S CHALLENGE,

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.302
AND THEIR
EPIC BATTLE BEGAN.

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:05.672
BOTH OPPONENTS
UNLEASHED THEIR MOST
POWERFUL MONSTERS

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.107
AGAINST EACH OTHER--

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.742
THE SORCERER
FIGHTING TO CONTROL
THE WORLD,

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.678
AND THE PHARAOH
AND HIS LOYAL
FOLLOWERS

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:13.113
FIGHTING TO SAVE IT.

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.682
TODAY,
5,000 YEARS LATER,

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:19.018
THIS ANCIENT BATTLE
IS BEING PLAYED OUT
ONCE AGAIN.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.487
DO YOU SEE?

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:23.223
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE
IN DESTINY, KAIBA?

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:26.392
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.
THERE'S NO WAY.

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:30.330
THIS PIECE OF ROCK
HAS GOT TO BE A FAKE.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.132
IF YOU WON'T
TRUST MY WORDS,

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.766
THEN YOU MUST
LOOK BACK IN TIME

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.603
AND EXPERIENCE
A PART OF THE BATTLE
FIRSTHAND,

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.472
WHICH I CAN
HELP YOU DO WITH MY
MILLENNIUM NECKLACE.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.442
UH! UGH.

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.112
AHH!

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:51.451
NOW OPEN YOUR MIND
AND SEE INTO THE PAST!

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.386
AAAH!

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.594
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.764
I HEREBY DECLARE
A CHALLENGE TO THE PHARAOH.

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:06.299
BY THE RITES
OF TRADITION,

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.234
DUEL ME, IF YOU
ARE NOT A COWARD.

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:10.103
MAGIC POWERS,
HEED MY CRY.

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:12.472
RELEASE THE MONSTER
TRAPPED INSIDE.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:14.040
MAGIC POWERS,
HEED MY CRY.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.909
RELEASE THE MONSTER
TRAPPED INSIDE.

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:17.844
[ROAR]

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.679
AS THE PHARAOH'S
LOYAL SERVANT,

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.915
I WILL STAND
AGAINST YOU,
TRAITOR.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.521
[ROAR]

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.727
I BANISH YOU ALL
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:37.397
[ROAR]

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.637
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.439
OH NO.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.308
WHAT IS THIS?

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.412
Yugi: I FEEL
LIKE A TOTAL LOSER.

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:55.114
I ALMOST LOST YOU
AND THE PUZZLE
FOREVER IN THAT FIRE.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.983
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
FACE THIS ENEMY.

00:11:56.983 --> 00:11:59.485
WHAT IF
I MESS UP AGAIN?

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.287
YOU DIDN'T FAIL.

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.356
ONLY BECAUSE
MY FRIENDS CAME

00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:04.557
AND SAVED ME.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.426
OTHERWISE, I'D
NEVER HAVE ESCAPED.

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:08.728
YOU'RE WRONG,
YUGI.
HUH?

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:12.098
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF LIKE
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.634
IN ALL MY YEARS,
I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.603
A SOUL AS BRAVE
AS YOURS, YUGI.

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:20.139
THERE IS A REASON
WHY FATE HANDED YOU
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:22.875
AND BROUGHT US
TOGETHER.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.044
YOU HAVE THE HEART
OF A TRUE CHAMPION

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.980
AND A SOUL THAT IS
COURAGEOUS AND TRUE.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.149
IN ANOTHER TIME,
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
PHARAOH.

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.718
[GASP]

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:37.023
THE DUEL RAGED ON
WITH NEITHER SIDE
SHOWING ANY MERCY.

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:38.925
THEY SUMMONED MONSTERS
THAT WERE INCREASINGLY

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.127
MORE POWERFUL
AND VICIOUS.

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.695
THE WINNER
OF THE DUEL
WAS WRITTEN HERE,

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:44.264
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.699
THE HIEROGLYPHICS
HAVE BEEN WORN AWAY.

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.101
I SEE.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.937
YES, BUT THOUGH
WE DON'T KNOW
THE OUTCOME,

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.905
THERE'S STILL MUCH
THAT WE CAN LEARN.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.774
LET US TAKE A GLANCE
INTO THE PAST AGAIN

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.043
USING THE POWERS
OF MY MILLENNIUM
NECKLACE.

00:12:57.043 --> 00:13:00.246
UHH. OHH! AH!

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.451
HEH HEH HEH!

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.819
YOUR LA JINN MAY
BE STRONG,

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.921
BUT DID YOU THINK
I WOULD NOT
COME PREPARED?

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:12.892
IT IS NO MATCH FOR
THE COMBINED FURY
OF MY DRAGONS.

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.995
LET TWO BE ONE.
LET TWO BE ONE.
LET TWO BE ONE.

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.530
UNITE, MY DRAGONS!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.599
YOU SHALL BE
UNSTOPPABLE.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.140
ATTACK.
BOMBARD THE TRAITOR

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.408
WITH YOUR
BLAZING INFERNO!

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:30.376
[ROAR]

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:32.078
HEH HEH HEH.

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:36.616
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:37.917
[GROWLS]

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.819
YOU HAVE NOT
WON YET, PHARAOH.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.321
IT IS FAR FROM OVER.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.122
DO YOU THINK ONE
OF YOUR PATHETIC MINIONS

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:45.024
HAVE THE MAGIC
TO DEFEAT ME?

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:48.528
I WILL SHATTER THEM
FROM EXISTENCE RIGHT
BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.799
THAT SORCERER IS
A BIG-MOUTH LOSING CHUMP!

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.867
YOU CAN'T
COMPARE HIM TO ME.

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:58.071
WELL, THEN MAYBE
THE FINAL VISION
WILL CONVINCE YOU.

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.172
NO!

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.376
UHH!

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:07.547
YOU SHOULD HAVE
FINISHED ME OFF WHEN
YOU HAD THE CHANCE,

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:09.048
FOR I WILL
NOW CALL FORTH

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.484
THE ULTIMATE BEAST
OF DESTRUCTION.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:13.519
NOW, PHARAOH,
THIS IS THE END.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.321
HMM?

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:16.456
MY FAITHFUL MONSTERS,

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:18.358
YOU HAVE ALL
SERVED ME WELL.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.826
WAKE FROM YOUR
ETERNAL SLUMBER

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.395
AND OBEY ME
ONE LAST TIME.

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.799
[ROAR]
[ROAR]

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.067
BEHOLD.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.569
I WILL OFFER THEM,

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:33.072
INFUSE THEIR LIFE FORCES
INTO THE LEGENDARY DRAGON.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.974
[ROARING]

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:41.347
[ROARING]

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:45.918
NOW, THE BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.221
BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON?

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.589
UH!

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:53.292
DRAGON, DESTROY THEM ALL
WITH YOUR WHITE LIGHTNING.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.006
[LAUGHING]

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.377
VICTORY IS MINE.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.985
OHH!

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:20.620
NOW ARE YOU
CONVINCED, KAIBA?

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.021
AS I SAID BEFORE,

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:23.990
HISTORY IS DESTINED
TO REPEAT ITSELF.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.425
IT'S NOT JUST
COINCIDENCE

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.427
THAT YUGI IS YOUR
GREATEST OPPONENT.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.263
YOU TWO HAVE BATTLED
IN THE ANCIENT PAST.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.235
Ishizu: IT WAS DESTINY
THAT YOU AND YUGI DUELED,

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:39.672
AND IT'S DESTINED THAT
YOU TWO WILL BATTLE AGAIN.

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.040
Kaiba: THANKS
FOR THE LECTURE,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.075
BUT I MAKE
MY OWN DESTINY,

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.545
AND I DO WHAT
I WANT TO DO.

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:49.782
KAIBA,
WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.351
WERE POWERFUL
MONSTERS.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:56.522
THE DUEL MONSTERS CARDS
THAT SURPASS THE POWER
OF EXODIA.

00:15:56.522 --> 00:16:01.093
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THEY
WERE IN FRONT OF YOUR
EYES THE WHOLE TIME?

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.295
WHAT?

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.230
TAKE A LOOK
AT THE TOP.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.134
THEY WERE THE STRONGEST
AND MOST FEARED CREATURES
OF ANNIHILATION--

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.570
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.005
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.941
THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA.

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:18.411
CONTROL ONE,
AND YOU CAN DESTROY
A MILLION ARMIES.

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.512
WIELD ALL 3,

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:21.814
AND THE PLANET ITSELF
WILL QUAKE IN FEAR.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.316
AND PEGASUS TURNED
THEM INTO CARDS?

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.784
YES.
YOU LIE.

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.853
IF HE HAD THEM,
WHY DIDN'T HE
USE THEM AGAINST ME

00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:28.354
AT DUELIST KINGDOM?

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:31.757
BECAUSE PEGASUS FEARED
THE POWER OF THESE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:35.862
YOU CANNOT FATHOM
THE MAGICAL ENERGY
CONTAINED WITHIN.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:39.165
PEGASUS COULD NOT
CONTROL THE POWER
OF THE CARDS HE CREATED.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:42.268
THEY THREATENED
TO OVERWHELM
AND DESTROY HIM.

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:44.937
[THINKING] CARDS
THAT EVEN MAKE PEGASUS
QUAKE IN HIS BOOTS.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.240
IF I CAN OBTAIN
THE 3 LEGENDARY
MONSTERS,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.875
I'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE
IN ANY DUEL.

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.776
YUGI WON'T
STAND A CHANCE.

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.278
BUT HOW DO
I GET THEM?

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:53.779
I CAN'T ASK PEGASUS.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.381
HE'S DROPPED
OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.984
THEY HAVE TO EXIST
SOMEWHERE.

00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:59.252
[SPEAKING]
ISHIZU,

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:02.555
WHAT DID PEGASUS DO
WITH THE CARDS?

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:05.391
HE GAVE THEM TO ME
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:09.829
Ishizu, voice-over:
PEGASUS REALIZED THAT
IF THESE CARDS FELL

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.497
INTO THE WRONG HANDS,
THEY COULD BRING ABOUT

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:12.765
THE END OF THE WORLD.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.301
HE HAD ME BURY THEM
IN SECRET LOCATIONS,

00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:16.802
BUT THE CARDS
WERE DISCOVERED.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.972
I MUST FIND THEM
AND HIDE THEM ONCE AGAIN.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:24.277
Kaiba: YOU MEAN,
SOMEONE ALREADY
FOUND THE CARDS?

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.212
YES.
TELL ME WHO.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.947
THE RARE HUNTERS.

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.682
RARE HUNTERS?

00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:33.019
THEY'RE A RUTHLESS
UNDERGROUND SECT
OF ELITE DUELISTS.

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:35.655
THEY ROB AND STEAL
RARE CARDS WORLDWIDE

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:38.624
TO SELL
ON THE BLACK MARKET
FOR ENORMOUS PROFITS.

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:41.527
HOWEVER, THEY KEEP
THE STRONGEST CARDS
FOR THEMSELVES

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:45.765
TO CREATE POWERFUL DECKS
THAT DESTROY ALL OPPOSITION.

00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:48.968
THEY OPERATE IN SHADOW,
SO THEY ARE NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:52.138
THAT IS WHY I NEED
YOUR HELP TO DRAW THEM
OUT INTO THE OPEN.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.642
KAIBA, IF YOU WERE
TO START A DUEL MONSTERS
TOURNAMENT,

00:17:56.642 --> 00:18:00.212
YOUR REPUTATION WOULD
ATTRACT THE GREATEST
DUELISTS IN THE WORLD.

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:02.949
THIS WOULD BE
THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION
OF PRECIOUS CARDS

00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:05.585
EVER ASSEMBLED
IN ONE LOCATION.

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:06.986
Kaiba: I SEE.

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:08.220
IT'S A TRAP.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.655
THE RARE HUNTERS
WON'T BE ABLE

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.257
TO RESIST
SUCH TEMPTING BAIT.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.125
THEY'LL COME
BY THE DROVES

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.961
LIKE VULTURES
TO A CARCASS,

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:18.631
AND THEY'LL BRING
THE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.701
ONE LAST THING--

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.102
TAKE THIS CARD.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.438
HMM?
CAN IT BE?

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.873
IT'S OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR.

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.575
I THOUGHT THE CARDS
WERE STOLEN.

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.344
I NEVER SAID
THEY WERE ALL STOLEN.

00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:33.479
I MANAGED TO RETRIEVE
ONE IN TIME.

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:36.315
YOU MAY BORROW IT
DURING THE TOURNAMENT,
BUT I EXPECT IT BACK.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:39.352
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
A CARD THIS RARE
IS HANDED TO ME.

00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:41.988
WHAT IF I CHOSE
TO KEEP IT FOREVER?

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:44.390
WHAT MAKES
YOU THINK
I CAN BE TRUSTED?

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.993
I COULD WALK OUT,
AND YOU'D NEVER
SEE IT AGAIN.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.696
YOU WILL
RETURN THE CARD.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.131
HMM.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.334
I HAVE FORESEEN IT.

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:57.136
I'LL BET.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.538
YOU MAY NOT YET
BELIEVE IN DESTINY,

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:01.407
BUT BEFORE
THE TOURNAMENT
IS DONE,

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:04.143
YOU WILL HAVE
TO FACE YOUR PAST.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.445
HMM. YOU KNOW,
I READ THAT ONCE

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.714
IN A FORTUNE COOKIE.

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.683
I'LL ORGANIZE
THIS TOURNAMENT...

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:12.018
I THANK YOU.

00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:13.719
BUT I'M NOT
GOING TO SET IT UP

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.987
BECAUSE OF YOUR
FAIRY TALES

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.256
AND YOUR HOCUS-POCUS
MIND TRICKS.

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.459
I WANT TO RECLAIM
MY TITLE AS
THE NUMBER-ONE DUELIST.

00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:25.331
Yugi: I WISH
WE KNEW MORE
ABOUT OUR NEW ENEMY.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.200
HE SAID HE WAS FAMILIAR
WITH THE POWER OF

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.201
A MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:30.836
I BET HE HAS ONE.

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.406
THAT MUST BE
HOW HE CONTROLS
PEOPLE'S MINDS.

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:36.842
IT ALSO SEEMS
HE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF
THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.779
OUR FOE IS
SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO THE PAST.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.714
BUT WHO IS HE?
I DON'T KNOW.

00:19:41.714 --> 00:19:43.182
THEN HOW
CAN WE STOP HIM?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.589
DON'T WORRY.
WE CAN DEFEAT
THIS EVIL TOGETHER.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.791
[SIGH]

00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:53.325
AS LONG AS WE
STAY CONNECTED,

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:54.994
YOU AND I CAN
FACE ANYTHING.

00:19:54.994 --> 00:19:56.595
MAYBE,

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.665
BUT WHAT IF
I FAIL AGAIN?

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.334
HOW DO I KNOW THAT
I WON'T LOSE YOU?

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:07.373
I BELIEVE
IN YOU, YUGI.

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:15.081
[KAIBA CHUCKLING]

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:20.419
ONE CARD DOWN
AND TWO MORE TO GO.
