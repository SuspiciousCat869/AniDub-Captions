00:06:45.957 --> 00:06:48.193
OH, LIKE IT REALLY
MAKES A DIFFERENCE!

00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:49.961
I'LL WIN NO MATTER
WHO IT IS.

00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:51.796
AS FOR YOU FELLOWS...

00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:54.065
I'LL BE SEEING YOU
AT THE FINALS.

00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:56.668
BUT, MAI...
WE'LL BE AT
ROOTING FOR YOU!

00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:57.902
DON'T BOTHER.

00:06:57.902 --> 00:06:58.903
WHAT?

00:06:58.903 --> 00:06:59.971
Tea: BUT WHY NOT?

00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:01.806
I DON'T NEED
YOU GUYS TO WIN.

00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:02.974
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

00:07:02.974 --> 00:07:05.276
I WAS A GOOD DUELIST
BEFORE I MET YOU.

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:06.511
AND QUITE FRANKLY,

00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:08.313
CERTAIN BLOND-HAIRED
KNUCKLEHEADS IN YOUR GROUP

00:07:08.313 --> 00:07:10.148
ARE BEGINNING TO
GET ON MY NERVES!

00:07:10.148 --> 00:07:12.017
ME?

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:13.385
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY!

00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:14.753
IT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR
THAT YOU

00:07:14.753 --> 00:07:15.887
DON'T CONSIDER
ME A FRIEND,

00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:17.222
AND I DON'T
CONSIDER YOU ONE.

00:07:17.222 --> 00:07:19.524
SO, LET'S JUST LEAVE IT
AT THAT, MONKEY BOY!

00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:21.292
THAT IS
COMPLETELY UNTRUE!

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:22.660
AND I'M NO
MONKEY-BOY!

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.896
RELAX,
JOEY...

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:27.532
LATER.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

00:07:27.532 --> 00:07:29.467
HMM! GIRLS!

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:37.475
I'LL TAKE THAT KEY,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:42.614
IT'S TIME TO TAKE
CARE OF SOMETHING

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:44.282
I SHOULD HAVE
DONE AGES AGO!

00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:48.820
ODION, YOU POOR,
PATHETIC FOOL.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.688
NOW, MY OLD FRIEND,

00:07:50.688 --> 00:07:53.458
IT'S TIME TO TAKE A TRIP
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:56.194
AFTER ALL, WE CAN'T
HAVE YOU WAKING UP

00:07:56.194 --> 00:07:57.929
AND TRYING TO
CONTAIN ME AGAIN,

00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:00.231
NOW CAN WE?

00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.499
GOODBYE, ODION.

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.401
AND WHEN YOU SEE
MY FATHER,

00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:05.070
GIVE HIM A MESSAGE
FOR ME...

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.706
TELL HIM THAT I CAN'T THANK HIM
ENOUGH FOR CREATING ME!

00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:11.509
Roland: DUELIST
NUMBER 5, MARIK ISHTAR,

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:13.611
WILL BE FACING OFF
AGAINST MAI VALENTINE!

00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:14.746

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:16.014
BOTH DUELISTS
MUST REPORT

00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:17.782

ARENA IMMEDIATELY.

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:20.685
WELL, HOW FORTUNATE FOR YOU.

00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:23.421
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,
I WILL BE BACK.

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:29.861
Kaiba:
WHERE'S MARIK?

00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:32.697
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS
BROADCAST IN EVERY ROOM!

00:08:32.697 --> 00:08:35.200
Mai: MAYBE
HE CHICKENED OUT.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.434
Kaiba:
OR MAYBE NOT.

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:40.839
HMM.

[LAUGHING]

00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:46.244
[THINKING] WELL,
SPEAK OF THE FREAK SHOW.

00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:52.984
Mai: IT'S ABOUT TIME!

00:08:52.984 --> 00:08:54.486
THIS WON'T TAKE
TOO LONG.

00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:56.488
[THINKING] YEAH, IT
WON'T TAKE LONG FOR ME

00:08:56.488 --> 00:08:59.524
TO SEIZE THIS LOSER'S
PRIZED EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:02.460
AND THEN USE IT TO WIN
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.095
[LAUGHING]

00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:06.264
PREPARE TO BE
CAST INTO THE SHADOWS!

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:07.832
Roland: ELEVATE
THE PLAYING FIELD!

00:09:10.034 --> 00:09:12.370
MAI VALENTINE,
MARIK ISHTAR,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.505
READY YOUR DECKS!

00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:14.806
THIS DUEL
WILL NOW BEGIN!

00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:22.514
SO, LET'S GO!

00:09:22.514 --> 00:09:23.848
I'M READY TO SHOW YOU

00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:26.384
WHAT REAL
DUELING'S ALL ABOUT!

GOOD LUCK.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.687
THANK YOU!
NOW LADIES FIRST!

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:33.324
HMM, NOT TOO BAD.

00:09:33.324 --> 00:09:35.994
I PLAY DUNAMES
DARK WITCH

00:09:35.994 --> 00:09:37.662
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:40.732
TAKE IT AWAY,
SWEETHEART!

00:09:40.732 --> 00:09:42.000
HMM.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.469
STARTING THINGS OFF
QUICKLY, ARE WE?

00:09:44.469 --> 00:09:45.937
I SEE.

00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:48.306
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT
MY DECK HAS FOR ME--

00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:49.741
RATHER US.

00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:51.276
EXCELLENT...

00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:53.912
NOW, I'LL SUMMON
MY REVIVAL JAM.

00:09:53.912 --> 00:09:56.014
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:01.653
AND THE MAGIC CARD,
JAM BREEDING MACHINE!

00:10:04.422 --> 00:10:06.658
THIS MONSTER-PRODUCING
MACHINE

00:10:06.658 --> 00:10:08.960
WILL CREATE ONE
SLIME TOKEN FOR ME

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.663
WITH EVERY PASSING TURN.

00:10:11.663 --> 00:10:13.998
SO, I'D SUGGEST
YOU ATTACK NOW

00:10:13.998 --> 00:10:17.435
BEFORE MY SLIME CREATURES
FAR OUTNUMBER YOU!

00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:20.171
[THINKING] LET'S SEE
THAT EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:22.040
Joey: AW, MAN!
IT STARTED ALREADY!

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.107
Yugi: MAI!

00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:24.375
Joey: I KNEW WE
SHOULDN'T OF WAITED

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.843
FOR TRISTAN TO GET
OUT OF THE BATHROOM!

00:10:25.843 --> 00:10:27.812
Tea: HEY THERE, MAI!
WE'RE WITH YA!

00:10:27.812 --> 00:10:29.147
Joey: SHOW THIS
CREEP WHO'S FORCE!

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:31.382
Mai: AND JUST WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

00:10:31.382 --> 00:10:32.650
DIDN'T I MAKE IT CLEAR

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.519
THAT I DON'T NEED YOUR
HELP TO WIN THIS DUEL?

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:36.321
WE ALL KNOW THAT, MAI!

00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:38.623
BUT FRIENDS ARE
STILL ALLOWED TO
COME WATCH, RIGHT?

00:10:38.623 --> 00:10:40.325
JUST TO SHOW WE CARE!

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:41.993
LIKE THE TIME MY
GRANDMA CAME TO SEE ME

00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:43.661
PLAY A TREE IN
THE SCHOOL PAGEANT!

00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:45.263
THEN SUIT
YOURSELVES.

00:10:45.263 --> 00:10:47.699
YUGI! WHAT'S
THAT THING!?

00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:49.767
IT'S NOT GOOD!

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:53.004
MARIK USED THESE SAME
PLASMA MONSTERS AGAINST ME!

00:10:53.004 --> 00:10:55.540
AND IT CAN ONLY
MEAN ONE THING!

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.108
I MUST WARN MAI!

00:10:57.108 --> 00:10:59.978
OR SHE'LL BE IN A GREAT
DEAL OF DANGER!

00:10:59.978 --> 00:11:01.579
MY MOVE NOW!

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:03.314
WAIT! BEFORE YOU GO,

00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:05.516
YOU NEED TO KNOW,
REVIVAL--

00:11:05.516 --> 00:11:07.619
YUGI, WERE YOU LISTENING
TO WHAT I SAID?

00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:08.653
BUT THIS IS--

00:11:08.653 --> 00:11:10.822
I SAID I DON'T
NEED YOUR HELP!

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:12.190
SO, I'D APPRECIATE
IT IF YOU COULD

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.125
ALL JUST MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS!

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.160
ARE WE CLEAR?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.395
Tea: I GUESS SO...

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:18.563
[LAUGHS]

00:11:18.563 --> 00:11:20.331
DO IT YOURSELF, EH?

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:22.300
THOSE ARE BRAVE
WORDS FROM SOMEONE

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.168
WITH NO IDEA WHAT
THEY'RE UP AGAINST!

00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:25.737
OH, CLAMP IT.

00:11:25.737 --> 00:11:28.339
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I'M UP AGAINST,

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:31.909
AND EXACTLY WHAT
I'M GONNA DO TO
BEAT YOU AS WELL!

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:35.713
THEN WHY DO I SEE SUCH
FEAR IN YOUR EYES!?

00:11:41.507 --> 00:11:42.575
[MARIK LAUGHS]

00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:44.376
OUR BATTLE
HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN,

00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.011
AND ALREADY YOU
DOUBT YOURSELF!

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:47.980
YOU ARE WRONG AGAIN!

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.648
NOW, MY DARK WITCH,

00:11:49.648 --> 00:11:52.551
ATTACK HIS REVIVAL JAM
WITH SPELLBINDING FLUX!

00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:57.123
THAT'S IT FOR
REVIVAL JAM.

00:11:57.123 --> 00:11:58.390
MMM.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.025
OH, IS IT?

00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:05.331
YOU'D BETTER LOOK AGAIN!

00:12:05.331 --> 00:12:06.465
WHAT?!

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:09.435
REVIVAL JAM IS ABLE TO
REGENERATE ITSELF

00:12:09.435 --> 00:12:11.303
WHENEVER IT'S ATTACKED.

00:12:11.303 --> 00:12:13.205
I HAD NO IDEA...

00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:15.508
THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME.

00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:17.610
PERHAPS YOU
DO NEED HELP.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.677
NOW LET'S SEE.

00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:21.947
I'LL PLAY THIS,
MY POT OF GREED--

00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:23.716
A MAGIC CARD
THAT ALLOWS ME

00:12:23.716 --> 00:12:27.419
TO DRAW TWO MORE
CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:29.555
NOW THEN,
HAVE YOU REALIZED

00:12:29.555 --> 00:12:32.158
THAT THIS DUEL IS FAR MORE
THAN YOU CAN HANDLE?

00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:35.161
OBSERVE AS MY JAM
BREEDING MACHINE

00:12:35.161 --> 00:12:37.930
CREATES THE FIRST OF
MANY SLIME TOKENS!

00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:44.236
AND FINALLY...

00:12:44.236 --> 00:12:46.472
I PLACE THIS FACE
DOWN ON THE FIELD

00:12:46.472 --> 00:12:48.574
TO RENDER YOUR
ATTACKS USELESS!

00:12:48.574 --> 00:12:50.743
HUH? WHAT'S
HE MEAN, SETO?

00:12:50.743 --> 00:12:53.045
MARIK MUST'VE THROWN
DOWN A TRAP CARD

00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:55.447
THAT'S SOMEHOW ABLE TO
BLOCK MAI'S ATTACKS.

00:12:55.447 --> 00:12:57.082
WE'LL SOON FIND OUT.

00:12:57.082 --> 00:12:58.951
[THINKING] THIS IS JUST
WHAT MARIK DID TO ME!

00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:01.554
HE'S PROBABLY USING HIS
JAM BREEDING MACHINE

00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:03.789
TO CREATE ENOUGH
MONSTERS TO SACRIFICE!

00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:06.125
THEN HE'LL SUMMON HIS
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:07.726
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:13:07.726 --> 00:13:09.728

CHECK IT OUT!

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.566
I PLAY THIS--
THE MAGIC CARD,

HARPIE'S
FEATHER DUSTER!

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:19.338
IT BLOWS AWAY ALL YOUR
TRAP AND MAGIC CARDS!

[WIND HOWLING]

00:13:21.574 --> 00:13:22.641
SORRY, MARIK,

00:13:22.641 --> 00:13:23.943
BUT I SAW YOUR
DIRTY LITTLE PLAN,

00:13:23.943 --> 00:13:25.444
SO I SWEPT IT
RIGHT UP!

00:13:25.444 --> 00:13:26.879
YEAH!

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:28.881
[THINKING] MAI SURE
HANDLED THAT FAST,

00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:30.449
BUT SHE'S IN
FOR MUCH WORSE

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:32.518
IF HE SUMMONS HIS
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:34.053
NOW,
MY DARK WITCH!

00:13:34.053 --> 00:13:35.688
THE COAST IS CLEAR,

00:13:35.688 --> 00:13:37.189
SO ATTACK THAT

WITH SPELLBINDING FLUX!

00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:45.831
ALL RIGHT! MAI'S
ALREADY GOT THE LEAD!

00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:47.900
KEEP IT UP, MAI!

BE FULL OF HOPE,

00:13:53.272 --> 00:13:55.708
SO IT WILL BE THAT
MUCH MORE DEVASTATING

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:58.611
WHEN I THRUST EACH OF
YOU INTO THE DARK ABYSS!

00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:00.379
AND NOW, TO
COMPLETE MY TURN

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:02.448
I THINK I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:03.616
AND THAT'LL DO IT.

00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:04.850
VERY WELL.

00:14:07.419 --> 00:14:10.089
I SUMMON MELCHID
THE 4-FACE BEAST.

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:12.825
THEN I SACRIFICE
REVIVAL JAM

00:14:12.825 --> 00:14:14.727
AND MELCHID
THE 4-FACE BEAST

00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:19.331
TO SUMMON THE MASKED
BEAST DES GARDIUS!

00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:21.834
[THINKING] THAT IS ONE
POWERFUL MONSTER...

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:24.103
NOW ATTACK,
MY MASKED BEAST!

00:14:24.103 --> 00:14:26.705
DESTROY HER DARK WITCH!

00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:28.307
WRONG!

00:14:28.307 --> 00:14:31.911
NOW, I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD,

00:14:31.911 --> 00:14:33.312
MIRROR WALL!

00:14:35.614 --> 00:14:38.117
IT ATTACKS YOUR BEAST
WITH ITS OWN REFLECTION,

00:14:38.117 --> 00:14:40.252
CUTTING ITS
POWER IN HALF!

00:14:40.252 --> 00:14:42.788
DARK WITCH, FINISH OFF
HIS MASKED BEAST!

00:14:42.788 --> 00:14:46.392
[ROARS]

00:14:46.392 --> 00:14:50.329
KA-BLAM! MARIK'S LOST
EVEN MORE LIFE POINTS!

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:53.399
HOLD ON. IT'S NOT TIME
TO CELEBRATE YET.

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:56.101
OH!
DARK WITCH!

00:14:56.101 --> 00:14:58.070
WHEN IT'S DESTROYED,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.838
MY MASKED BEAST
LEAVES BEHIND

00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:01.440
THE MASK OF REMNANTS,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.442
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO
RESHUFFLE MY DECK,

00:15:03.442 --> 00:15:05.444
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY...

00:15:05.444 --> 00:15:08.347
I GAIN CONTROL OF
YOUR DARK WITCH.

00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:10.582
NEXT, I THINK
I'LL DO AWAY WITH

00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:12.051
YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE TRAP.

00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:15.354
AS I PLAY THE MAGIC
CARD REMOVE TRAP!

00:15:16.956 --> 00:15:18.290
GOOD RIDDANCE!

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.625
AW, MAN!

00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:21.994
LOOKS LIKE MAI'S IN SOME
SERIOUS TROUBLE OUT THERE!

00:15:21.994 --> 00:15:23.429
SHE'D BETTER COME UP
WITH SOMETHING

00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:25.965
BEFORE MARIK UNLEASHES
THAT EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.367
Joey: HEY, SHE'S
DOING JUST FINE, OK?

00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:30.536
I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT
THE SCOREBOARD, BOZO,

00:15:30.536 --> 00:15:32.037
SHE'S WINNING
THIS WHOLE THING!

00:15:32.037 --> 00:15:33.939
[THINKING]
I GUESS JOEY'S
TRYING TO BE NICE,

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:35.174
BUT TRISTAN'S RIGHT.

00:15:35.174 --> 00:15:37.476
IF MARIK PULLS OUT THAT
WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:15:37.476 --> 00:15:38.477
I'M A GONER.

00:15:38.477 --> 00:15:40.579
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:43.382
OK, MARIK, YOU MAY'VE
GOTTEN A FEW LUCKY SHOTS,

00:15:43.382 --> 00:15:44.516
BUT THAT'S OVER,

00:15:44.516 --> 00:15:45.751
THINGS ARE
ABOUT TO CHANGE!

00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:48.354
INDEED. MUCH MORE
THAN YOU KNOW.

00:15:48.354 --> 00:15:49.722
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:15:49.722 --> 00:15:51.457
AND WHAT'S UP WITH
THAT CREEPY SMILE

00:15:51.457 --> 00:15:53.125
MARIK'S WEARING
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.760
MAI, SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT!

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.096
I SAID I DON'T
NEED YOUR HELP!

00:15:57.096 --> 00:15:59.832
WELL, EXCUSE ME.
THEN I WON'T HELP.

00:15:59.832 --> 00:16:01.700
[THINKING]
OH, YES YOU WILL.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.235
YOU'LL HELP ME.

00:16:03.235 --> 00:16:04.503
ALL OF YOU WILL.

00:16:04.503 --> 00:16:05.637
YOU JUST DON'T
KNOW IT YET.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.809
NOW LISTEN TO ME,
FOOLISH GIRL,

00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:13.645
I'M AFRAID THAT
PRACTICE-TIME IS OVER.

00:16:13.645 --> 00:16:15.247
SO, I'D LIKE TO
TAKE THIS MATCH

00:16:15.247 --> 00:16:17.416
TO THE TRUE HOME
OF DUEL MONSTERS,

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:18.650
THE SHADOW REALM!

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:19.651
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

00:16:19.651 --> 00:16:20.652
OH, NO!

00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:21.920
OH, YES!

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.789
LET THE SHADOW GAME BEGIN!

00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:26.792
[ALL GASPING]

00:16:26.792 --> 00:16:27.893
[MARIK LAUGHS]

00:16:27.893 --> 00:16:29.395
Yugi: THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING!

00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:30.729
Serenity:
I'M SCARED, YOU GUYS!

00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:34.400
WH-WHAT'S
WITH THIS FOG?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.235
THIS IS NOT PART
OF THE GAME!

00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:38.604
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE, MARIK?!

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:45.271
WELCOME TO THE HEART
OF DARKNESS!

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.806
Yugi: IT'S JUST AS I FEARED.

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:48.608
MARIK HAS SUMMONED
THE EVIL POWERS

00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:49.775
OF THE SHADOW REALM!

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.677
OF THE SHADOW WHAT?

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.779
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
WE FLEW INTO A FOG.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.282
THIS IS NO ORDINARY FOG.

00:16:56.282 --> 00:16:58.818
I REMEMBER THIS PLACE!

00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:01.053
[THINKING] SO, THEY'VE
EXPERIENCED THE DANGERS

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:02.922
OF THIS REALM BEFORE.

00:17:02.922 --> 00:17:05.391
WELL THIS TIME, THERE
WILL BE NO ESCAPING!

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:08.160
Yugi: MARIK,
END THIS NOW!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.161
NEVER!

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.529
THE SHADOWS ARE HUNGRY,

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.365
AND THEY WILL BE FED.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.134
IF LITTLE MAI WANTS
TO CONTINUE THIS MATCH,

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:17.436
SHE'LL HAVE TO DO SO
IN MY WORLD--

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:19.705
A WORLD WHERE THERE'S
MUCH MORE TO LOSE

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:22.308
THAN JUST A SIMPLE DUEL!

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:25.011
MAI, THIS DUEL
MUST END NOW!

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:26.779
THERE'S MORE AT STAKE
THAN YOU KNOW!

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.848
FORFEIT THE MATCH!

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:31.684
YUGI, HAVE YOU
COMPLETELY LOST IT?

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:33.619
I'VE WORKED HARD FOR THIS.

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.855
IT'LL TAKE A LOT MORE
THAN SOME CREEPY FOG

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:37.189
TO SCARE ME OFF.

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.792
SO, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT A DUEL TO WIN!

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:40.960
MAI!

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.529
LISTEN, YUGI,
JOEY, EVERYONE,

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.898
I APPRECIATE YOUR
CONCERNS, BUT...

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.500
MY MIND'S MADE UP,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.168
AND I'M GOING TO STAY
IN THIS DUEL,

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:51.671
AND NOTHING CAN
CHANGE THAT!

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:53.639
VERY GOOD,
FOOLISH GIRL.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.341
I KNEW THAT I
COULD COUNT ON YOU

00:17:55.341 --> 00:17:57.977
TO USE THAT STUBBORN
MIND OF YOURS

00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:00.112
WHILE YOU STILL
REMEMBER HOW!

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:02.448
WELL THEN,
THAT'S THAT...

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:03.916
IF THERE'S ONE
THING ABOUT MAI:

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.951
ONCE THE GIRL MAKES
UP HER MIND,

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.720
THERE'S NO WAY
TO UN-MAKE IT!

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.988
THAT'S TRUE.

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:11.857
BUT THIS
TIME IT MIGHT
COST HER BIG.

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.225
YOU READY, MARIK?

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.727
[LAUGHS]

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:16.662
I'M ALWAYS READY
FOR A SHADOW GAME!

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.964
[THINKING] I HOPE MAI KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S UP AGAINST.

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:20.933
ALL THE RULES OF THE GAME
AS SHE KNOWS THEM

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.668
ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE!

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:25.171
ALL RIGHT,
HERE I GO!

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:27.840
I PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.510
AND I SUMMON
THE UNFRIENDLY AMAZON!

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.214
[THINKING]
WHY IS SHE GLOWING?

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.616
CONFUSED, MAI?

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.552
THE ENERGY THAT
SURROUNDS YOUR AMAZON

00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:41.353
IS A SYMBOL OF YOU--

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.956
OR YOUR MIND TO
BE MORE PRECISE.
HUH?

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.558
IF IT GOES OUT,

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:47.560
SO WILL A PORTION
OF YOUR MIND!

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.896
THIS IS THE NATURE
OF THE SHADOW REALM.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.031
DON'T WORRY.

00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:53.699
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IT MUCH BETTER

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:56.869
ONCE YOU'VE EXPERIENCED
MY DARK MAGIC FIRST HAND!

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.771
OH, HOW I LOVE
WATCHING SOMEONE

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:01.507
FEEL THESE SHADOW POWERS
FOR THE FIRST TIME!

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:02.942
[LAUGHS]

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:06.378
[THINKING] THERE
IS SOMETHING VERY
WRONG WITH THIS GUY.

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.114
BUT I CAN'T GET
DISTRACTED.

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:10.149
NOW, MY UNFRIENDLY
AMAZON,

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.819
ATTACK THE DARK WITCH
WITH SOARING SLASH!

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:16.889
[LAUGHS]

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:17.957
VERY GOOD,

00:19:17.957 --> 00:19:20.392
YOU'VE WIPED AWAY SOME
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:23.529
HOWEVER, DARK WITCH
WAS ORIGINALLY
YOUR MONSTER...

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.199
THEREFORE YOU'VE WIPED AWAY
PART OF YOUR MEMORY AS WELL!

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.769
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:32.605
YOU SEE, MAI,
EACH MONSTER WE PLAY

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:34.740
ON THE FIELD CARRIES
WITH IT THE MEMORY

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.409
OF A PERSON WE HOLD
WITHIN IN OUR MIND.

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:39.578
SO, WHEN A MONSTER
IS DESTROYED,

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.847
THE MEMORY OF
A PERSON FROM YOUR LIFE

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:42.848
IS DESTROYED WITH IT!

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.517
THERE'S NO WAY!

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.684
SAY WHAT?

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.586
WHAT ON EARTH IS
MARIK TALKIN' ABOUT?

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:50.022
THAT PSYCHO'S GOTTA
BE OUT OF HIS GOURD!

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.824
THERE'S NO WAY HE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH!

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:54.093
Marik: NOW, LET'S SEE
WHICH ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:56.695
WILL BECOME YOUR
FIRST LOST MEMORY.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.097
NOT, TEA!?

00:19:58.097 --> 00:20:00.833
YES, AND NOW SHE'LL BE
BANISHED FROM YOUR MEMORY!

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:01.901
UHH!

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:03.736
I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU, MARIK!

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:05.404
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.173
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:09.275
IMPOSSIBLE?

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:12.077
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:14.580
WHY DO YOU
THINK I BROUGHT
YOU HERE, MY DEAR?

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.082
FOR, I'M CONTROLLING
THIS KINGDOM

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.717
OF INFINITE BLACKNESS,

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.853
AND BY THE TIME
I'M THROUGH,

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:23.122
YOU'LL BE A MINDLESS
SHELL ALL ALONE

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:25.090
IN A WORLD
FULL OF STRANGERS!

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.029
CAN YOU FEEL THEM

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:32.464
DRIFTING SLOWLY
AWAY FROM YOU?

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.500
DISAPPEARING
INTO THE LIGHT?

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.269
FADING FROM THE CHASMS
OF YOUR MIND?

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:38.938
THE WELLS OF
YOUR HEART?

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:41.841
WAIT! COME BACK!
PLEASE!

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:43.642
NO, THIS CAN'T BE!

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.945
NOW, NOW, DON'T
WORRY, MY DEAR.

00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:49.715
YOU'RE ONLY LOSING ONE
OF THEM FOR NOW.

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:51.617
I CAN'T SEE HER!

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:52.952
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:56.255
NOW, TEA'S NOTHING MORE THAN
A FACELESS PHANTOM TO YOU.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.060
Mai: MY MEMORY'S
GROWING FAINT...

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.128
YO, MAI!
ARE YOU OK?

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:04.396
MAI?!

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:07.066
Marik: OH, YOU'RE
FAR FROM OK!

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.535
I'M AFRAID THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING,

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:11.904
FOR BEHIND EACH
DARK CORNER,

00:21:11.904 --> 00:21:15.140
THE SHADOW REALM HOLDS
ANOTHER FRIGHTENING TWIST--

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.710
LIKE AN ETERNAL NIGHTMARE!

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.713
ONLY THIS IS QUITE REAL.
