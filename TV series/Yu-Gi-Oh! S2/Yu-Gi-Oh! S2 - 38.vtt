IT'S TIME
TO DUEL.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.774
LET'S DO THIS!

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.043
I'LL PLAY
TEMPLE OF THE KINGS.

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.845
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT
BUILDING, MARIK?

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.915
WITHIN THIS 5,000-YEAR-OLD
SANCTUARY LIE

THE GREATEST TREASURES
OF THE KINGS OF EGYPT.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.286
Thinking: THESE FOOLS
WILL NEVER SUSPECT

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.989
THAT I AM THE ONE THEY
FEAR AND DESPISE SO GREATLY!

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.659
AND WHILE I HIDE
SAFELY IN THE SHADOWS,

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.828

COME FORTH, MY BEASTS!

WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

YOU'RE AT THE END
OF YOUR ROPE, MR. WHEELER.

JOEY'S LIFE POINTS
ARE LOW, SO HE'S GOT
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

TO DEFENSE

WELL, WE'LL
JUST SEE.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.191

A SLIM CHANCE, BUT JOEY
MIGHT HAVE LOST HOPE.

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:46.123
JINZO, ATTACK!

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:48.225
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR LIFE
POINTS, ROBA.

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:49.827
[GROANING]

00:07:49.827 --> 00:07:52.163
NOT
GRAVEROBBER!

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:54.198
TIME TO EXTERMINATE
YOUR INSECT QUEEN.

00:07:54.198 --> 00:07:56.901
YEAH! THERE GOES
MY PEST PROBLEM.

00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:58.469
YOUR FISHERMAN'S
HISTORY.

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:00.771
BEST OF LUCK
IN THE FINALS.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.573
THANKS. YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT, MAKO.

00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:04.175
Thinking:
I FOUGHT MY HARDEST

00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:05.910
TO GET WHERE
I AM RIGHT NOW.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.745
AND I NEVER LET ANYONE
GET THE BEST OF ME,

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.680
EVEN WHEN ALL HOPE
SEEMED LOST.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.549
SO WHY SHOULD I
START NOW?

00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:14.785
HEY, MARIK, YOU THINK
I'M GONNA LOSE TO YOU?

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:17.521
WELL, YOU BETTER
GUESS AGAIN, TOUGH GUY.

00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:20.991
I CAME TO THE FINALS
FOR ONE REASON--TO WIN.

00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:23.794
AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:25.629
JOEY WHEELER'S BACK!

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.198
YEAH!
WAY TO GO!

00:08:27.198 --> 00:08:30.468
LISTEN, I DEFEATED
3 OF THE TOUGHEST
DUELISTS OUT THERE

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.536
TO EARN MY WAY
ONTO THIS BLIMP,

00:08:32.536 --> 00:08:34.205
YOU LIGHT-BULB HEAD!

00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:37.208
AND I'M NOT
GONNA LET YOU OR
YOUR SHINY SKULL

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.610
STOP ME
FROM FINISHING
WHAT I STARTED.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.644
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:08:40.644 --> 00:08:41.879
YOU TELL HIM!

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:44.048
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
YOU ROCK!

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:45.916
AND DON'T WORRY.
I'LL WIN THIS.

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.184
LET'S GO!

00:08:47.184 --> 00:08:51.021
IT SEEMS YOU'RE MORE
FOOLISH THAN I THOUGHT.

00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:53.824
TIME FOR YOU
TO LOSE SHAMEFULLY.

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.926
SO MAKE YOUR
FINAL PATHETIC MOVE.

00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:57.962
LET'S GO!
MM-HMM.

00:08:57.962 --> 00:09:00.097
Yami-Yugi:
IT'S TIME TO REMIND JOEY

00:09:00.097 --> 00:09:02.132
OF THE IMPORTANCE
OF HIS VICTORY.

00:09:02.132 --> 00:09:04.535
SAVE THE WORLD.

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:05.903
Thinking: OH, YEAH!

00:09:05.903 --> 00:09:07.671
IF I BEAT MARIK,
HIS PLANS ARE CRUSHED.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:09.907
THE POWER IS
IN YOUR HANDS.

00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:10.975
RIGHT!

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:12.943
YOUR SCHEME
ENDS HERE.

00:09:12.943 --> 00:09:15.846
I PROMISED
YUGI THAT I'D
HELP HIM STOP YOU

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.482
FROM ACHIEVING
WHATEVER SICK
AND TWISTED GOALS

00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:21.218
THAT YOU AND YOUR
RARE HUNTERS
HAVE, MARIK.

00:09:21.218 --> 00:09:23.454
AND I'M GONNA
KEEP THAT PROMISE

00:09:23.454 --> 00:09:26.490
BY KNOCKING YOUR
BALD CRANIUM OUT OF
THE FINALS, GOT IT?

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.658
HERE GOES.

00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:30.461
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:33.063
HOPE YOU'RE READY TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO EVERYTHING.

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:34.198
YOUR
FALSE THREATS

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.533
DON'T
FRIGHTEN ME.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.768
I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.772
THEN I SUMMON

00:09:41.772 --> 00:09:44.108
SWORDSMAN OF LANDSTAR
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:44.108 --> 00:09:46.176
NOW BACK TO YOU,
SUNSHINE.

00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:48.946
Thinking: HIS DETERMINATION
IS SURPRISING.

00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:52.216
HOW CAN HE RETALIATE
WITH ONLY 200 LIFE POINTS?

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:55.653
MY SERPENT SWORDSMEN
WILL EASILY FINISH HIM OFF.

00:09:55.653 --> 00:09:57.788
Marik: WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, YOU
INCOMPETENT BUFFOON?

00:09:57.788 --> 00:09:59.056
ATTACK HIM!

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.624
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED

00:10:00.624 --> 00:10:03.861
YOUR BRIEF EXPERIENCE
AS A BATTLE CITY FINALIST.

00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:08.566
AND NOW, MY EMBODIMENTS OF
APOPHIS, TRIPLE ATTACK!

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.501
NOT SO FAST.

00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:12.503
TIME TO SKIN
YOUR SNAKES.

00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:14.104
SO GO NOW!

00:10:14.104 --> 00:10:16.507
MY FOOLISH
BURIAL MAGIC CARD

00:10:16.507 --> 00:10:20.110
LETS ME PUT ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND INTO
YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.146
AND NEXT I'M GONNA
REVEAL THIS...

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:25.649
MY TRAP CARD,
GRAVEROBBER!

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:28.586
NOW YOU PLAN TO ROB
MY GRAVEYARD?

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.988
WOW. DID YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT
ALL BY YOURSELF

00:10:30.988 --> 00:10:33.457
OR DID SOMEONE HAND
YOU A CHEAT SHEET?

00:10:33.457 --> 00:10:35.893
YES, EINSTEIN,
I'M GONNA ROB
YOUR GRAVE!

00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:38.495
HA HA!

00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:39.763
AND LOOK.

00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:41.899
I'VE TAKEN BACK THE CARD
I JUST PUT IN THERE.

00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:46.470
NOW, REVEAL JINZO!

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:54.011
OH, NO.

00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:56.180
HE'S SUMMONED
AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL
MONSTER TO THE FIELD!

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.848
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:10:57.848 --> 00:10:59.617
I REMEMBERED
YOUR SNAKE
CREATURES WERE

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.518
A SPECIAL BREED
OF MONSTERS

00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:03.520
THAT ALSO HAPPENED
TO BE TRAP CARDS.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.457
YOUR SLIMY REPTILES
HAVE ALL THE STRENGTHS
OF TRAP CARDS,

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.192
BUT THEY HAVE ALL
THE WEAKNESSES, TOO.

00:11:08.192 --> 00:11:09.460
WEAKNESSES?

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.462
JINZO'S SPECIAL
ABILITY

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.197
LETS HIM
DESTROY TRAP CARDS.

00:11:13.197 --> 00:11:16.000
JINZO, WIPE OUT
HIS SERPENTS.

00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:22.573
YOU KNOW, I WON JINZO
IN MY VERY FIRST
BATTLE CITY DUEL

00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:24.141
AGAINST A REAL OPPONENT.

00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.843
YEAH. THAT'S
THE WAY, JOEY.

00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:27.177
GOOD JOB.

00:11:27.177 --> 00:11:29.480
YES. JOEY SEEMS TO BE USING

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.749
WHAT HE'S LEARNED FROM
HIS PAST VICTORIES.

00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:34.451
NOW, THEN,
DO YOU STILL THINK

00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:36.754
I'M AN AMATEUR
OR DID YOU LEARN
YOUR LESSON?

00:11:36.754 --> 00:11:40.057
I'M NOT THROUGH WITH
YOU YET, MR. WHEELER!

00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:46.059
I STILL HAVE
ALL MY LIFE POINTS.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.462
NOT FOR LONG, MARIK.

00:11:48.462 --> 00:11:51.164
SEE, WITH MY MAN
JINZO BY MY SIDE,

00:11:51.164 --> 00:11:54.167
YOU AND YOUR
TRAP CARDS ARE
ANCIENT HISTORY.

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:55.235
OH, YEAH!
HA HA!

00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:56.503
JOEY, YOU GO!

00:11:56.503 --> 00:11:58.038
I KNEW THAT YOU'D
PULL THROUGH.

00:11:58.038 --> 00:11:59.873
NOW SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS.

00:11:59.873 --> 00:12:01.908
Thinking: IF IT WEREN'T
FOR ALL OF MY BATTLE
CITY VICTORIES,

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:03.777
I WOULDN'T BE
HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:12:03.777 --> 00:12:06.179
I WON JINZO BY
DEFEATING ESPA ROBA,

00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:08.815
AND NOW HIS CARD IS
GIVING ME THE STRENGTH
TO BEAT MARIK.

00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:10.817
Thinking: LOOKS LIKE
WHEELER GOT LUCKY.

00:12:10.817 --> 00:12:13.153
PERHAPS HE'LL
SURVIVE THIS DUEL
LONG ENOUGH

00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:16.056
FOR ME TO SEE
MARIK'S EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD AFTER ALL.

00:12:16.056 --> 00:12:17.357
HERE WE GO!

00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:20.961
LOOK OUT! CHECK IT
OUT, BALD WONDER.

00:12:20.961 --> 00:12:23.130
NOW I SUMMON
BATTLE WARRIOR

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.265
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:30.103
BUT WAIT, BECAUSE
THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:12:30.103 --> 00:12:31.772
I ALSO SWITCH

00:12:31.772 --> 00:12:34.174
MY SWORDSMAN
OF LANDSTAR
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.845
AND THEN
THERE'S JINZO.

00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:41.415
ATTACK HIS
LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:45.152
[GROWLING]

00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:47.220
THERE'S MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.223
NOW, BATTLE WARRIOR
AND SWORDSMAN
OF LANDSTAR,

00:12:50.223 --> 00:12:51.958
MOVE IN WITH
A DIRECT ATTACK.

00:12:57.397 --> 00:13:01.001
AWESOME! HE GOT MARIK'S
LIFE POINTS DOWN TO 400.

00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:03.036
IT'S A GOOD THING
I INSPIRED HIM.

00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:04.571
Tristan:
YOU THE MAN, JOEY.

00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:06.039
NOW FINISH HIM OFF.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:07.974
I KNEW IT.
YOU ROCK!

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:10.944
NOW, THEN,
YOU DON'T FEEL
SO TOUGH, DO YOU?

00:13:10.944 --> 00:13:12.813
MAYBE YOU
SHOULD HAVE
PROTECTED YOURSELF

00:13:12.813 --> 00:13:13.880
A LITTLE BETTER.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.349
ATTACK ME ALL YOU WANT.

00:13:16.349 --> 00:13:17.551
YOU CAN'T WIN.

00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:18.852
REMEMBER...

00:13:18.852 --> 00:13:21.922
I STILL POSSESS MY TEMPLE
OF THE KINGS CARD,

00:13:21.922 --> 00:13:24.291
A CARD THAT HAS ANCIENT
POWERS SO STRONG,

00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:26.426
IT CAN'T BE STOPPED.

00:13:26.426 --> 00:13:30.063
JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU
EXPERIENCE ITS
UNPARALLELED FORCE.

00:13:30.063 --> 00:13:32.499
YOUR PALACE
DOESN'T SCARE ME.

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:34.201
I THINK
I'VE ALREADY PROVEN

00:13:34.201 --> 00:13:36.770
THAT JOEY WHEELER
DOESN'T SIT BACK

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.505
AND LET PEOPLE
WALK ALL OVER HIM.

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:40.006
SO BRING IT ON!

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.842
HEAR ME?

00:13:41.842 --> 00:13:44.878
I CAN TAKE WHATEVER
YOU GOT AND DISH IT
RIGHT BACK, BUDDY.

00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:47.814
SO GO AHEAD
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:51.384
WITH GREAT PLEASURE,
FOOLISH BOY.

00:13:51.384 --> 00:13:53.954
Marik: LISTEN
TO ME, ODION!

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:56.456
YOU'VE ALLOWED
JOEY WHEELER
TO COME TOO FAR.

00:13:56.456 --> 00:13:58.125
NOW DESTROY HIM
AT ONCE

00:13:58.125 --> 00:13:59.493
OR FACE SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES.

00:13:59.493 --> 00:14:01.128
YES, MASTER MARIK.

00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:03.897
HE'S WORTHLESS,
YOU FOOL.

00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:05.832
NOW FINISH
HIM OFF!

00:14:05.832 --> 00:14:07.834
NOT TO WORRY, MASTER.

00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:09.769
I WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU.

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:11.538
IN FACT, I'VE
ALREADY FIGURED OUT

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:13.206
A WAY TO RENDER
HIS MONSTERS USELESS.

00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:14.808
LET'S GO,
POTATO HEAD.

00:14:14.808 --> 00:14:16.109
WHAT'S
THE HOLD UP?

00:14:16.109 --> 00:14:17.878
Odion: THIS SHOULD
HOLD YOU UP.

00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:21.381
I PLAY MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:14:27.154 --> 00:14:29.856
HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL,
MARIK?

00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:31.091
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:33.160
MARIK'S SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.896
TRAPS JOEY'S
MONSTERS FOR
3 WHOLE TURNS.

00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:38.832
BUT JOEY
CAN STILL WIN, RIGHT?

00:14:38.832 --> 00:14:41.368
I HOPE SO. BUT NOT
ATTACKING FOR 3
TURNS WON'T HELP.

00:14:41.368 --> 00:14:42.769
THAT'S TRUE, MAI.

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:45.172
BUT JOEY CAN STILL
SACRIFICE HIS MONSTERS

00:14:45.172 --> 00:14:46.773
TO SUMMON
STRONGER ONES,

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:48.441
AND ALTHOUGH HIS JINZO
CAN'T ATTACK,

00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:51.778
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
DOES REMAIN IN EFFECT.

00:14:51.778 --> 00:14:54.414
THAT MEANS MARIK STILL
CAN'T USE HIS TRAP CARDS.

00:14:54.414 --> 00:14:56.183
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:14:56.183 --> 00:14:57.551
GLADLY.

00:14:57.551 --> 00:14:58.985
HERE GOES.

00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:00.954
I MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO ATTACK,

00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:03.123
BUT I CAN
STILL DO THIS.

00:15:03.123 --> 00:15:04.925
I SACRIFICE
MY BATTLE WARRIOR

00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:07.761
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
THE LEGENDARY FISHERMAN.

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:08.828
[YELLS]

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.566
I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS CARD MEANT
TO YOU, MAKO,

00:15:12.566 --> 00:15:15.468
AND I PROMISED YOU
I'D USE IT WELL.

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:17.871
AND BEFORE I END
MY TURN,

00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:20.407
I'LL SWITCH ALL
3 OF MY MONSTERS
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:23.810
PREPARE TO LOSE!

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.779
[LAUGHING SINISTERLY]

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.180
WHAT'S THIS?!

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.849
WHY DO YOU SEEM
SO SHOCKED, ODION?

00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:31.585
IF YOU'RE
POSING AS ME,

00:15:31.585 --> 00:15:34.254
YOU SHOULD HAVE
MY CARD IN
YOUR DECK. RIGHT?

00:15:34.254 --> 00:15:36.790
THAT'S WHY I
SLIPPED IT IN
BEFORE THE DUEL.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.759
BUT, MASTER, THIS
CARD IS TOO DANGEROUS.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:42.362
AND I'M NOT MEANT
TO CONTROL ITS GREAT POWER.

00:15:42.362 --> 00:15:44.864
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
EXPECT ME TO PLAY IT.

00:15:44.864 --> 00:15:46.766
PLEASE RECONSIDER,

00:15:46.766 --> 00:15:47.968
I BEG OF YOU!

00:15:47.968 --> 00:15:49.970
STOP WHIMPERING.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.805
YOU SOUND PITIFUL.

00:15:51.805 --> 00:15:53.506
I COMMAND YOU
TO PLAY THAT CARD.

00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:55.575
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:15:55.575 --> 00:15:57.544
YOU MUST PLACE
IT WITHIN
THE ANCIENT ARK

00:15:57.544 --> 00:15:59.112
ON THE TEMPLE STEPS.

00:15:59.112 --> 00:16:00.680
AND WHEN THE TIME
IS RIGHT,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.849
YOU WILL RELEASE
ITS RAGE!

00:16:02.849 --> 00:16:05.585
HEY, MARIK,
I'M GETTING TIRED
OF WAITING AROUND.

00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:09.356
FIRST I'LL PLACE
THIS CARD FACEDOWN
ON THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:16:10.924 --> 00:16:13.893
NOW PREPARE
YOURSELF, MR. WHEELER,

00:16:13.893 --> 00:16:15.462
FOR THE NEXT CARD
I PLAY

00:16:15.462 --> 00:16:19.766
WILL BE THE FINAL
INSTRUMENT OF
YOUR DESTRUCTION!

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:27.570
DO IT, ODION.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.239
PLAY THE CARD
I ADDED TO YOUR
DECK RIGHT NOW.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.308
AS SOON
AS YOU PLACE IT

00:16:32.308 --> 00:16:35.244
WITHIN
THE SACRED ARK ON
THE TEMPLE STEPS,

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.079
YOU'LL
BE INVINCIBLE.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.081
AND IF YOU REFUSE
TO PLAY IT,

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.817
YOU'LL HAVE
TO ANSWER TO ME.

00:16:41.817 --> 00:16:43.652
THE CHOICE IS
YOURS, ODION.

00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:45.154
DON'T BE A FOOL.

00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:47.089
I MUST OBEY
MASTER MARIK.

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:49.258
IT IS MY SWORN DUTY.

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.694
Tea: SOMETHING
STRANGE IS
GOING ON

00:16:51.694 --> 00:16:53.596
UP THERE, GUYS.
CHECK OUT MARIK.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.331
HE LOOKS REALLY
FREAKED OUT.

00:16:55.331 --> 00:16:57.132
I THINK TEA'S RIGHT.

00:16:57.132 --> 00:16:59.535
EVER SINCE MARIK
DREW HIS LAST CARD,

00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:02.304
HE'S BEEN ACTING
REALLY STRANGE.

00:17:02.304 --> 00:17:04.073
I WONDER IF IT
HAS SOMETHING TO DO

00:17:04.073 --> 00:17:05.774
WITH THAT ANCIENT
TEMPLE BEHIND HIM.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:07.710
WHEN HE FIRST PLAYED
TEMPLE OF THE KINGS,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.244
I HAD A BAD FEELING

00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:11.280
ABOUT THAT BOX AT
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS--

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.849
THE ONE WITH THE EGYPTIAN
SYMBOLS ON IT.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.784
WHAT COULD IT BE?

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.286
FOR SOME WEIRD REASON,

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.421
IT SEEMS FAMILIAR TO ME,
BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY.

00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:21.790
BE CAREFUL, JOEY!

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.460
MAN, THIS IS LIKE
THE LONGEST MOVE
IN HISTORY.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.063
GOOD MOVES TAKE TIME,
BUT HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

00:17:28.063 --> 00:17:30.065
AND NOW I SEAL
THIS CARD

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:33.068
IN THE SACRED
ARK OF THE TEMPLE!

00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:34.703
WHOOP-DE-DO.

00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:36.705
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE JUST DONE

00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:39.341
BY SECURING THIS
ALL-POWERFUL CARD

00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:41.110
WITHIN MY
ANCIENT SANCTUARY.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.445
BY SEALING THIS CARD
OF THE GODS,

00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:45.280
I HAVE ALSO SEALED
YOUR FATE!

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.416
CARD OF THE GODS?!

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:49.118
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:51.286
A WISE MOVE, ODION.

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:53.122
HERE I GO!

00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:55.290
TIME TO BRING BACK
A MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.592
WITH MONSTER REBORN!

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.763
BRING BACK MY
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD!

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.436
AND NOW I SACRIFICE

00:18:07.436 --> 00:18:10.372
MY ALLIGATOR'S SWORD
AND MY SWORDSMAN
OF LANDSTAR

00:18:10.372 --> 00:18:12.307
SO I CAN
SUMMON THIS--

00:18:12.307 --> 00:18:13.676
MY INSECT QUEEN!

00:18:20.382 --> 00:18:23.352
[YELLS]

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.454
I WON THIS CARD

00:18:25.454 --> 00:18:28.157
FROM A FEISTY
LITTLE GERM NAMED
WEEVIL UNDERWOOD.

00:18:28.157 --> 00:18:31.293
EVERY ONE OF
MY BATTLE CITY
VICTORIES

00:18:31.293 --> 00:18:33.095
IS PAYING OFF
RIGHT NOW.

00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:36.565
THOSE DUELS
GOT ME 3 INCREDIBLE
MONSTERS.

00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:40.235
MY TOURNAMENT'S
DONE WONDERS
FOR WHEELER'S DECK.

00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:41.670
LOOK AT THAT.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.472
JOEY WAS ABLE TO SUMMON

00:18:43.472 --> 00:18:46.275
EVERY RARE MONSTER HE
WON IN THE TOURNAMENT
ALL AT ONCE.

00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:48.777
YES, JOEY
HAS COME A LONG
WAY AS A DUELIST

00:18:48.777 --> 00:18:51.246
SINCE THE BATTLE
CITY TOURNAMENT
BEGAN, MAI.

00:18:51.246 --> 00:18:52.781
LOOK OUT, MARIK,

00:18:52.781 --> 00:18:54.583
BECAUSE YOUR SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT

00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:56.285
WILL LOSE THEIR
POWER NEXT TURN.

00:18:56.285 --> 00:18:58.187
AND WHEN THOSE
LIGHTS GO OUT,

00:18:58.187 --> 00:19:00.522
THERE'LL BE
NOTHING HOLDING
MY MONSTERS BACK.

00:19:00.522 --> 00:19:02.458
AND SINCE YOU
HAVE NOTHING
TO PROTECT YOU,

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.459
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:05.461
YOU THINK

00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:07.830
JUST BECAUSE YOU
WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE
A FEW STRONG MONSTERS,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.331
YOU CAN DEFEAT ME.

00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:11.166
YOU'RE SO NAIVE,

00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:15.137
FOR I AM ABOUT
TO SUMMON A BEAST
THAT YOU CAN'T DESTROY.

00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:16.171
WHAT?

00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:17.406
WHILE YOUR MONSTERS

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:20.309
WERE TRAPPED IN MY
SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT,

00:19:20.309 --> 00:19:24.279
I WAS ABLE TO
PREPARE FOR THE ARRIVAL
OF MY ANCIENT CREATURE.

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:26.348
AND THIS ALL-POWERFUL
ENTITY WILL SERVE

00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:30.352
AS THE GUARDIAN
OF THE SACRED TEMPLE
OF THE KINGS,

00:19:30.352 --> 00:19:32.054
PROTECTING
MY ANCIENT SANCTUARY

00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:34.757
AND ALL OF THE SECRETS
THAT LIE WITHIN.

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.725
SAY THAT AGAIN
WITH SMALL WORDS.

00:19:36.725 --> 00:19:39.495
YOU CAN'T WIN
ONCE I PLAY THIS--

00:19:39.495 --> 00:19:41.130
CUP OF SEALED SOUL!

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.501
THEN I REVEAL MY FACEDOWN
CARD--SEAL OF SERKET!

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:48.403
WHEN THESE TWO
MAGIC CARDS ARE PLAYED

00:19:48.403 --> 00:19:50.105
ALONG WITH TEMPLE
OF THE KINGS,

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:51.774
THEY ARE ABLE TO AWAKEN

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:53.742
A GREAT CREATURE FROM
ITS ANCIENT SLUMBER,

00:19:53.742 --> 00:19:57.746
A BEING LIKE NONE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE!

00:19:57.746 --> 00:19:59.181
WHAT IS IT?

00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:00.215
PATIENCE.

00:20:00.215 --> 00:20:01.650
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.352
PLEASE HEAR MY CALL,

00:20:03.352 --> 00:20:05.053
GUARDIAN OF THE TEMPLE.

00:20:05.053 --> 00:20:08.056
NOW, MYSTICAL BEAST
OF SERKET,

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:09.458
I SUMMON THEE!

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:13.495
I GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS, YOU GUYS.

00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:14.797
OH!

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.437
THAT THING'S
TREMENDOUS.

00:20:22.437 --> 00:20:23.806
WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?

00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:27.142
THAT CREATURE
IS MINUTE

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:30.112
COMPARED TO WHAT LURKS
WITHIN MY SACRED TEMPLE.

00:20:30.112 --> 00:20:32.281
THEN TELL ME NOW!

00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:34.683
WHAT MONSTER DID
YOU HIDE INSIDE
THAT ARK, MARIK?

00:20:34.683 --> 00:20:36.718
WITHIN THE SACRED ARK LIES

00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:41.390
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.091
Joey, thinking: WITH
THAT THING OUTSIDE

00:20:43.091 --> 00:20:45.327
AND HIS EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD INSIDE,

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.229
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN WIN!
