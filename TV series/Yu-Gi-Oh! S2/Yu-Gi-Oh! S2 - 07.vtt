00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:40.221
I HOPE YOU
REMEMBERED TO BRING
YOUR OARS THIS TIME.

00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:46.928
Rare Hunter: THEIR RARE CARDS
WILL MAKE FINE ADDITIONS

00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:49.030
TO MY MASTER'S COLLECTION.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.332
THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

00:07:51.332 --> 00:07:53.334
WHICH CARD
SHALL I ACQUIRE FIRST?

00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:56.171
WE'LL SETTLE THIS FEUD LATER
WHEN THE TOURNAMENT BEGINS!

00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.139
FINE.
I WILL BE WAITING.

00:08:01.443 --> 00:08:03.511
YUGI,
I THINK I'LL HEAD OFF.

00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:05.580
REMEMBER NEXT TIME
WE MEET, WE'RE RIVALS.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.115
RIGHT. HA HA!

00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:14.622
Yugi: KAIBA SHOULD BE
ANNOUNCING THE START

00:08:14.622 --> 00:08:17.292
OF THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT
ANY SECOND NOW,

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:19.494
BUT I CAN'T FIND
A TRACE OF JOEY,

00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.429
AND I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:24.666
I HOPE HE SHOWS UP
BEFORE THIS STARTS.

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:26.301
Kaiba: GREETINGS,
DUELISTS.
HUH?

00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:28.002
WELCOME
TO BATTLE CITY.

00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:29.804
THAT SOUNDS LIKE KAIBA.

00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:31.639
WHERE IS HE?

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:33.675
KAIBA?

00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:35.443
HUH?

00:08:35.443 --> 00:08:36.945
WHERE'S HIS VOICE
COMING FROM?

00:08:42.317 --> 00:08:44.285
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:52.060
[GASP]

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.629
[CHUCKLING]

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:56.297
IT'S KAIBA!

00:08:56.297 --> 00:08:59.467
IT'S TIME TO PUT YOUR
DUELING SKILLS TO THE TEST.

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:01.436
I HOPE NONE OF YOU
ENTERED MY TOURNAMENT

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:03.271
LOOKING FOR
FRIENDLY COMPETITION.

00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:06.341
BATTLE CITY'S
GONNA BE AN ALL-OUT WAR.

00:09:13.403 --> 00:09:15.705
BEFORE MY BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT BEGINS,

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:17.874
I THOUGHT I'D LET YOU ALL
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR,

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:20.376
IN CASE YOU WANT
TO BACK OUT NOW.

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:22.946
LET'S BEGIN
WITH MY NEW DUEL DISCS.

00:09:22.946 --> 00:09:26.649
EVERYONE WHO I DECIDED
WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO ENTER
RECEIVED ONE.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.419
WITH IT, YOU CAN
DUEL ANYTIME, ANYWHERE,

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:31.988
AND THEY CONTAIN
A TRACKING CHIP THAT ALLOWS ME

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.057
TO WATCH EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE.

00:09:34.057 --> 00:09:36.426
WOW. ALL THAT
FOR A CARD GAME?

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:41.164
NEXT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOST
IMPORTANT TOURNAMENT RULE.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.999
THE LOSER OF EACH DUEL
IS REQUIRED

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.401
TO FORK OVER THEIR
RAREST CARD TO THE WINNER.

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:47.337
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.439
TO RISK LOSING
YOUR PRECIOUS CARDS,

00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:51.441
THEN I SUGGEST
YOU FORFEIT NOW.

00:09:51.441 --> 00:09:53.543
BRING IT ON, KAIBA.

00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:55.311
SO THE MORE DUELS I WIN,

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.281
THE MORE RARE CARDS
I ACQUIRE FOR MY DECK.

00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:01.618
BY THE SEVEN SEAS,
I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.

00:10:01.618 --> 00:10:04.687
TAKING CARDS AWAY
FROM THESE LOSERS
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:08.091
AND ANYONE WHO'S FOOLISH ENOUGH
CAN CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL

00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:10.593
BECAUSE I'LL ALSO BE COMPETING
IN THIS TOURNAMENT.

00:10:10.593 --> 00:10:12.295
THOUGHT SO.

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:15.765
BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP
BECAUSE I INTEND TO WIN,

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:18.434
AND THERE'S ONE DUELIST
OUT THERE I CAN'T WAIT
TO DEFEAT.

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:20.436
YOU'RE ON, KAIBA.

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:23.139
AND SPEAKING OF WINNING,

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.676
ONLY THE 8 BEST DUELISTS
WILL MAKE IT TO THE FINAL ROUND,

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:29.612
AND THESE FINALS WILL BE HELD
IN A HIDDEN LOCATION.

00:10:29.612 --> 00:10:31.347
THEN HOW
DO WE GET THERE?

00:10:31.347 --> 00:10:33.883
NO ONE WILL SHOW UP
IF THE LOCATION'S HIDDEN!

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.854
IN ORDER TO FIND THE FINALS,
YOU'LL NEED THESE LOCATOR CARDS.

00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:39.489
YOU'VE EACH RECEIVED ONE
WITH YOUR DUEL DISC,

00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:42.392
BUT DON'T GET TOO EXCITED
BECAUSE ONE'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.626
YOU'LL NEED 6 OF THEM

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:45.762
TO MAKE IT
TO THE TOURNAMENT FINALS.

00:10:45.762 --> 00:10:47.297
EVERY TIME YOU WIN A DUEL,

00:10:47.297 --> 00:10:50.099
YOU GET A LOCATOR CARD
FROM YOUR LOSING OPPONENT.

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:51.834
WHEN 6 CARDS
ARE STACKED TOGETHER,

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:53.903
THEY PRODUCE A MAP
OF BATTLE CITY

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.472
AND ACTIVATE A GLOBAL
POSITIONING SATELLITE,

00:10:56.472 --> 00:10:58.574
WHICH WILL TRANSMIT
THE LOCATION TO YOU,

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.311
BUT THE TOURNAMENT FINALS
ARE A LONG TIME AWAY,

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:04.147
AND MOST OF YOU WILL BE
ELIMINATED WAY BEFORE THAT.

00:11:04.147 --> 00:11:06.215
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYTHING I JUST SAID AND MORE

00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:08.651
CAN BE FOUND
IN MY TOURNAMENT RULEBOOK.

00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:10.687
JUST REMEMBER,
ONLY ONE PLAYER CAN WIN

00:11:10.687 --> 00:11:13.790
AND CLAIM THE TITLE
OF NUMBER-ONE DUELIST
IN THE WORLD!

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.792
AND THAT'LL BE ME!

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:17.293
All: THAT'LL BE ME!

00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:20.029
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:22.165
NOW GET READY, DUELISTS.

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:25.401
LET THE TOURNAMENT BEGIN!

00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.770
WOO-HOO!
YEAH!
YEAH!

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.341
WELL, TIME TO FACE MY DESTINY!

00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:33.376
Joey: WHERE ARE YOU,
YA CREEP?

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.214
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.284
HEH. WELL...

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.753
SO MUCH PREY, SO LITTLE TIME.

00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:45.321
WHO SHALL I HUNT FIRST?

00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:46.322
Joey: HEY, FREAK!
HMM?

00:11:46.322 --> 00:11:47.724
I KNEW I'D FIND YA.

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:49.859
HEH! DIDN'T YOU
LEARN YOUR LESSON?

00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:53.529
YEAH. NEVER LET AN OLD CREEP
IN A CAPE SLAP YOU AROUND!

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:55.598
YOU FOOL.

00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:57.467
LISTEN, YOU GOT
MY RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON,

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:01.437
AND I WANT IT BACK,
SOOO IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

SO I CAN WIN BACK
MY RED-EYES?

00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:11.140
HEH.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.375
I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO DUEL YOU.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:14.643
I'VE ALREADY
RELIEVED YOU

00:12:14.643 --> 00:12:17.346
OF YOUR RARE
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON.

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:18.947
MY HUNT FOR YOUR DECK
IS OVER,

MY HUNT FOR YOUR DECK
IS OVER,

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.617
AND MY PREY'S
ALREADY BEEN CAPTURED.

00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:24.286

Joey: THEY CALL THEMSELVES

WHICH TO ME TRANSLATES
INTO "CAPE-WEARIN',
CARD-TAKIN' FREAK-A-ZOIDS,"

00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:50.579
AND THIS ONE
OWES ME A REMATCH

SO I CAN WIN BACK

IN BEING MY NEXT VICTIM.

HIS DARK MAGICIAN,

BUT, YUGE!

00:13:14.636 --> 00:13:17.606
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET BACK YOUR
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:20.075
I PROMISE YOU
I'LL BEAT HIM, JOEY!

SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL,

AS MY FIRST BATTLE CITY
OPPONENT, IF YOU LOSE,

00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:35.824
YOU MUST RETURN JOEY'S
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON!

AND IF YOU WIN
THIS DUEL,

MY DARK MAGICIAN TO YOU.

YOUR DARK MAGICIAN!

IF THAT UGLY BUM TAKES
YOUR MOST VALUABLE CARD.

I'LL HAVE TO RISK
LOSING MY DARK MAGICIAN
EVENTUALLY.

00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:01.650
THIS IS MY FIRST
BATTLE CITY DUEL

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.419
AND THE FIRST STEP
IN FULFILLING
MY DESTINY.

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:06.755

WITH THIS HUNT ALREADY.

00:14:06.755 --> 00:14:09.491
THE SOONER I CAN TAKE
MY PRIZE, THE BETTER.

00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:12.361
I'M READY TO DUEL
WHENEVER YOU ARE,

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:15.798
UH-UH-UH!
DON'T EVEN THINK

00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:18.433
ABOUT REVEALING
MY STRATEGY, JOEY WHEELER.

00:14:18.433 --> 00:14:21.603
IF YOU SAY A WORD
ABOUT HOW I DEFEATED YOU,

00:14:21.603 --> 00:14:24.506
I'LL TEAR YOUR RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON TO SHREDS,

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:27.810
SO I'D GIVE MY MOUTH
A REST IF I WERE YOU

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.013
AND ALLOW ME TO STALK
THE DUELIST KINGDOM CHAMPION

00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:34.850
AND TAKE HIS DARK MAGICIAN
WITHOUT YOUR COMMENTARY.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.951
FINE.

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:38.253

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:28.503
HEY, LOOK. THE OTHER DUELS
ARE COMING IN NOW, TOO!

00:15:28.503 --> 00:15:31.673
OUR SYSTEM IS RECORDING
ALL THE CARDS BEING PLAYED.

00:15:31.673 --> 00:15:35.244
IF ANYONE USES ONE
OF THE TWO REMAINING
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:37.412
WE'LL KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE IT IS!

00:15:37.412 --> 00:15:38.814
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.485
I DRAW FIRST.
NOW GET READY.

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:46.655
[THINKING]
EXCELLENT!

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:48.790
I ALREADY HAVE
TWO PIECES OF EXODIA.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.959
WHEN I ASSEMBLE
ALL 5 PIECES,

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:54.129
I'LL SUMMON THE ALL-POWERFUL
EXODIA THE FORBIDDEN ONE

00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:55.664
AND OBLITERATE YUGI!

00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:57.032
Joey: YUGE,
WATCH OUT FOR--

00:15:57.032 --> 00:15:58.467
Rare Hunter:
SILENCE, WHEELER,

00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:01.837
OR SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR RED-EYES!

00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:06.775
TO START OFF,
I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:16:06.775 --> 00:16:09.544
NEXT, I SUMMON
BETA THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:16:09.544 --> 00:16:10.846
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:13.448 --> 00:16:15.784
CAN YOU HANDLE
MY NEWEST MONSTER?

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:17.519
WHAT IS THAT, BOB?

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.489
IT'S OBVIOUSLY
A BIG YELLOW MAGNET
WITH EYEBALLS.

00:16:20.489 --> 00:16:22.391
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
A DUEL MONSTER.
HUH?

00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:25.761
THE DUEL DISC
RENDERS THE CARDS
IN HOLOGRAPHIC 3-D!

00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:26.862
OH!
OH!

00:16:26.862 --> 00:16:29.698
MY FIRST CARD
WILL BE--

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.700
HEH! JUST WHAT
I SUSPECTED.

00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:34.937
GRACEFUL CHARITY
LETS ME DRAW 3 CARDS...

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:38.840
AND I DISCARD TWO.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.942
[THINKING]
PERFECT.

00:16:39.942 --> 00:16:41.343
THE THIRD PIECE
OF EXODIA.

00:16:41.343 --> 00:16:43.879
ONLY TWO MORE PIECES LEFT!

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:46.949
IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT
WAS IN MY HAND WAITING,

00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:51.086
YOU'D FORFEIT NOW
AND RELINQUISH
YOUR RARE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:16:51.086 --> 00:16:52.354
NEVER!

00:16:52.354 --> 00:16:54.189
I MAY NOT KNOW
WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND,

00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:56.558
BUT MY TRAP CARD
LIGHT OF INTERVENTION

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.061
REVEALS ALL
YOUR HIDDEN MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:01.930
THERE WILL BE
NO SURPRISE ATTACKS
FROM YOU!

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.000
HMM, DOESN'T MATTER.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.935
STONE STATUE
OF THE AZTECS!

00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:08.770
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:12.507 --> 00:17:13.575
Yugi, thinking:
ALL HE'S DONE SO FAR

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.444
IS DRAW CARDS
AND PLAY DEFENSE.

00:17:15.444 --> 00:17:17.879
HE MUST BE WAITING
FOR SOMETHING.

00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:20.716
Yami-Yugi: IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR STONE STATUE
TO CRUMBLE.

00:17:20.716 --> 00:17:24.052
NOW,
BY BATTLE CITY RULES,

00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:25.821
I SACRIFICE MY
WEAKER MAGNET WARRIOR

00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:30.559
TO SUMMON
THE ALMIGHTY BERFOMET!

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:32.594
AND HE IS ABLE
TO BRING FORTH GAZELLE--

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:33.962
THE KING
OF MYTHICAL BEASTS!

00:17:33.962 --> 00:17:35.163
THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:17:35.163 --> 00:17:39.401
NOW I USE POLYMERIZATION
TO FUSE THEM TOGETHER!

00:17:45.307 --> 00:17:46.808
[ROARING]

00:17:46.808 --> 00:17:50.345
FORMING CHIMERA--
THE FLYING MYTHICAL BEAST!

00:17:53.348 --> 00:17:55.984
ON MY NEXT TURN,
MY ALL-POWERFUL CHIMERA

00:17:55.984 --> 00:17:59.721
WILL ERODE YOUR
STONE STATUE INTO
TINY PIECES OF RUBBLE!

00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:01.757
THEN, ACCORDING
TO BATTLE CITY RULES,

00:18:01.757 --> 00:18:03.592
ONCE YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS LEFT
ON THE FIELD,

00:18:03.592 --> 00:18:05.427
I CAN ATTACK YOUR
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:18:05.427 --> 00:18:07.362
[THINKING]
FORGET ABOUT
WHAT'S ON THE FIELD.

00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:08.530
WORRY ABOUT
WHAT'S IN HIS HAND!

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.732
VERY IMPRESSIVE,

00:18:10.732 --> 00:18:13.035
BUT YOU'LL NEED
MORE THAN THAT
TO SCARE OFF THE HUNTER!

00:18:13.035 --> 00:18:14.703
Joey: LISTEN, YUGE,

00:18:14.703 --> 00:18:16.872
THIS GUY'S GOT A PLAN
TO WIPE YOU OUT!

00:18:16.872 --> 00:18:19.207
CHECK OUT THE GRIN
ON THAT UGLY KISSER OF HIS.

00:18:19.207 --> 00:18:21.777
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
THE OLD CREEP DID TO ME.

00:18:21.777 --> 00:18:23.645
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
IN HIS HAND THAT'S GONNA--

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.680
SILENCE, WHEELER!
ONE MORE WORD OUT OF YOU

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.150
AND SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR RED-EYES FOREVER!

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.088
I'LL END MY TURN
BY PLACING THIS CARD
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:18:33.088 --> 00:18:35.023
I PREDICT ANOTHER
GRACEFUL CHARITY.

00:18:35.023 --> 00:18:37.025
HMM.

00:18:37.025 --> 00:18:38.160
IMAGINE THAT.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.294
I WAS CORRECT!

00:18:39.294 --> 00:18:41.496
I DRAW 3 MORE CARDS...

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.665
AND DISCARD TWO.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.967
Yugi, thinking:
HOW DOES HE KNOW WHAT
CARD HE'LL DRAW NEXT?

00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:49.171
[THINKING]
EXCELLENT!

00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.839
I NOW HAVE
4 EXODIA PIECES!

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.974
I ONLY NEED ONE MORE
TO SUMMON THE BEAST

00:18:52.974 --> 00:18:55.377
THAT WILL OBLITERATE YUGI
IN ONE ATTACK!

00:18:55.377 --> 00:18:59.214
HE'S ABOUT TO LOSE
HIS DARK MAGICIAN FOREVER!

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:07.314
Kaiba: THIS DUELIST
IS BATTLING WELL AGAINST YUGI,

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:08.915
BUT WHO IS HE?

00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:10.750
WHAT INFO DO WE HAVE ON HIM?

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.952
Operator:
VERY LITTLE.
HMM?

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:14.154
HE WASN'T LISTED
IN YOUR TOURNAMENT
DATABASE

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.355
UNTIL ABOUT
A WEEK AGO.

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.424
WHAT? HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:19.659
HE MUST HAVE HACKED
INTO THE SYSTEM
AND ADDED HIMSELF.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.894
THAT'S ILLEGAL!

00:19:20.894 --> 00:19:22.829
HE CALLS HIMSELF
A RARE HUNTER.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.731
WE'LL DISQUALIFY HIM!

00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:26.032
RIGHT, SETO?

00:19:26.032 --> 00:19:27.734
WAIT!
HUH?

00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:29.302
HMM. RARE HUNTERS.

00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:30.770
THEY TOOK MY BAIT.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.940
HMM. MOKUBA,
IT'S JUST AS I PLANNED.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.675
HUH?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.914
Rare Hunter: YUGI,
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN
IS AS GOOD AS MINE!

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:44.551
[THINKING]
ONCE I'VE ASSEMBLED
ALL 5 PIECES

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.620
OF THE ALL-POWERFUL EXODIA,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.355
THIS HUNT WILL BE OVER,

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.590
AND WITH THE HELP
OF SOME INVISIBLE INK

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.493
AND MY X-RAY CONTACT LENS,

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:57.297
I'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT CARD
I'LL BE DRAWING NEXT.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:59.432
[LAUGHING]

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:00.600
JUST WHAT I NEED!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.569
IT'S THE FINAL PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE--

00:20:02.569 --> 00:20:05.105
THE LEFT ARM OF EXODIA
THE FORBIDDEN ONE!

00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:07.240
WHEN I DRAW IT
ON MY NEXT TURN,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.209
I'LL SUMMON
MY MOST POWERFUL CREATURE

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.279
AND OBLITERATE YUGI!
HA HA HA!

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:15.282
NOW I'LL STRENGTHEN
MY DEFENSES!

00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:17.784
HMM.
TO PROTECT ME--

00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:20.186
GEAR GOLEM
THE MOVING FORTRESS!

00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:25.292
EVEN YOUR CHIMERA'S
NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO DESTROY IT!

00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:27.994
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO NOW, YUGI?

00:20:27.994 --> 00:20:31.798
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME
IF YOU CAN'T GET BY
MY DEFENSES!

00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:33.967
YOU MAY BE PROTECTING
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:37.170
WITH FORTRESSES
AND STONE WALLS,
RARE HUNTER,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.638
BUT IN ORDER FOR YOU
TO WIN THIS DUEL,

00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:40.540
YOU MUST ATTACK ME
EVENTUALLY,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.142
SO WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:45.178
OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH, YUGI,

00:20:45.178 --> 00:20:47.914
SO GO AHEAD--
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.517
THE HUNTER WILL STRIKE
HIS PREY WHEN THE TIME
IS RIGHT!

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:53.920
HEY, YUGE!
HUH?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.222
HOLD IT! I CAN'T
STAND BY AND WATCH THIS.

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:57.424
NO WAY!

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:00.193
I WON'T LET YOU LOSE
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN FOR ME!

00:21:00.193 --> 00:21:02.562
THAT'S ENOUGH, JOEY!
HUH?

00:21:02.562 --> 00:21:05.966
YOU MUST NOT REVEAL
THE RARE HUNTER'S
STRATEGY.

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:07.167
I WILL DEFEAT HIM.

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:08.902
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, JOEY,

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:10.603
AND I'M FIGHTING
THIS DUEL FOR YOU

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.573
JUST AS YOU
WOULD DO FOR ME.

00:21:13.573 --> 00:21:14.741
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.110
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE TIME WEEVIL

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.679
THREW MY EXODIA CARDS
INTO THE OCEAN?

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:22.549
YOU RISKED
YOUR LIFE TO TRY
TO GET MY CARDS BACK,

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:23.683
NOT JUST BECAUSE
EXODIA

00:21:23.683 --> 00:21:25.618
IS THE MOST POWERFUL
CARD IN THE GAME,

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:29.022
BUT BECAUSE
I WAS A FRIEND IN NEED.

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:31.358
Yugi, thinking:
EXODIA! THAT'S IT!

00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:33.093
THIS RARE HUNTER
IS DRAWING CARDS

00:21:33.093 --> 00:21:36.096
UNTIL HE CAN ASSEMBLE
ALL 5 PIECES OF EXODIA!

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:37.330
Yami-Yugi:
I'M ON TO YOU!

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.733
I KNOW YOUR STRATEGY,
RARE HUNTER!

00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:41.167
HMM?

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:44.437
YOU'RE PLANNING
TO SUMMON EXODIA
THE FORBIDDEN ONE!

00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:45.605
[THINKING]
OHH, NO!

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.540
HOW DOES HE KNOW?

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.575
ALL RIGHT!

00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:50.343
THANK YOU, JOEY.

00:21:50.343 --> 00:21:52.078
YOU ALLOWED ME
TO FIGURE OUT
HIS STRATEGY

00:21:52.078 --> 00:21:53.780
WITHOUT ACTUALLY
TELLING IT TO ME.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.981
AW, YEAH!

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.082
Rare Hunter: HEH HEH.

00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:58.451
JUST BECAUSE YOU
FIGURED OUT MY STRATEGY

00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:01.321
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
STOP ME FROM SUCCEEDING!

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:05.525
EVERYONE KNOWS EXODIA'S
THE MOST POWERFUL CREATURE
IN DUEL MONSTERS!

00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:08.461
HOW WILL YOU STOP
THE UNSTOPPABLE EXODIA?

00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:09.562
TRUE.

00:22:09.562 --> 00:22:11.865
NO ONE HAS EVER
DEFEATED EXODIA,

00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:14.534
BUT IN ORDER
TO WIN BACK JOEY'S
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON,

00:22:14.534 --> 00:22:15.568
I'LL BE THE FIRST.

00:22:15.568 --> 00:22:17.037
GIVE UP, YUGI!

00:22:17.037 --> 00:22:19.406
MY HUNT IS OVER!
