GOTTA...BE...STRONG...

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.440
[THINKING]
JOEY'S GONNA DO IT!

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.841
I <i>KNOW</i> HE IS!

00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:30.876
OUR FRIENDSHIP
IS <i>STRONG,</i>

00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:32.611
AND SO IS HIS <i>WILL!</i>

00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:34.546
MARIK'S
MILLENNIUM ROD'S
GOT <i>NOTHING</i> ON THAT!

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:36.982
HE'S JUST GOTTA
KEEP FIGHTING

00:07:36.982 --> 00:07:38.984
AND BREAK FREE
BEFORE THAT ANCHOR
FALLS INTO THE OCEAN

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:40.318
TAKING US WITH IT!

00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:41.486
COME ON, JOEY...

00:07:41.486 --> 00:07:42.921
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.289
WE CAN BEAT MARIK
AT HIS OWN
TWISTED GAME

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.024
AS SOON AS YOU
WAKE UP!

00:07:46.024 --> 00:07:48.026
MARIK!

00:07:48.026 --> 00:07:49.327
YOU HIDE LIKE
A COWARD,

00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:50.462
BUT WHEREVER
YOU ARE,

00:07:50.462 --> 00:07:52.097
I KNOW YOU
CAN HEAR ME,

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.032
AND I'VE GOT
SOME NEWS FOR YOU!

00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:56.001
THERE <i>WILL</i>
BE A LOSER
IN THIS DUEL,

00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:57.269
BUT IT'S NOT WHO
YOU'RE THINKING!

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.703
IT'S NOT ME!

00:07:58.703 --> 00:08:00.705
...AND IT'S NOT
JOEY, EITHER!

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:03.008
IT'S YOU...MARIK!

00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:05.277
<i>YOU WILL</i> LOSE
THIS DUEL!

00:08:05.277 --> 00:08:06.444
<i>WHAT?</i>

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:07.546
YOU MAY HAVE <i>THOUGHT</i>

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:09.147
YOU COULD FORCE JOEY
TO DESTROY ME

00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:10.549
BY TAKING OVER
HIS MIND,

00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:11.683
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING

00:08:11.683 --> 00:08:13.251
YOU DIDN'T
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:14.553
WHEN YOU MADE
YOUR PLAN!

00:08:14.553 --> 00:08:17.322
THE STRENGTH
OF JOEY'S BOND
WITH HIS FRIENDS!

00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:21.226
TIME MAY BE
RUNNING OUT,
BUT JOEY'S <i>BACK,</i>

00:08:21.226 --> 00:08:23.395
AND <i>WE'RE</i> IN CONTROL
OF THIS DUEL NOW!

00:08:23.395 --> 00:08:25.830
YOUR POWER OVER JOEY
HAS BEEN REMOVED!

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.499
AND I'D SAY...
THAT MEANS...

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:28.500
YOU <i>LOSE!</i>

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.068
YUGE...

00:08:30.068 --> 00:08:31.436
THAT TIMER MAY
RUN OUT,

00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:33.205
BUT SINCE JOEY
IS <i>FREE,</i>

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:34.306
YOU <i>CAN'T</i> BE
CONSIDERED

00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:35.540
THE WINNER
OF THIS DUEL!

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.042
GET IT!?

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:38.743
SINCE YOU'RE NOT
<i>DUELING</i> ANYMORE,

00:08:38.743 --> 00:08:41.213
HOW CAN <i>YOU</i> POSSIBLY
WIN THIS DUEL!?

00:08:41.213 --> 00:08:43.448
[GROANS]

00:08:43.448 --> 00:08:44.849
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:47.085
WHAT DOES YUGI THINK
HE'S DOING?

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:48.286
THAT FOOL!

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:49.354
YUGI!

00:08:49.354 --> 00:08:51.723
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:08:51.723 --> 00:08:54.292
Mai: C'MON GUYS...
END THIS.

00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:56.027
WHAT ARE YA GONNA DO
NOW, MARIK!?

00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:57.729
JUST WAIT IN YOUR
LITTLE HIDEAWAY

00:08:57.729 --> 00:08:59.197
UNTIL YOU LOSE
THIS DUEL?

00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:02.400
THIS IS YOUR
LAST CHANCE
FOR VICTORY!

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.169
SO COME AND GET ME!

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.572
JOEY CAN'T BE
CONTROLLED,
SO IT'S UP TO YOU!

00:09:07.572 --> 00:09:09.608
Marik:
<i>EVERYONE</i> CAN BE CONTROLLED!

00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:13.144
AND ONCE I FORCE JOEY
TO PLAY <i>METEOR OF DESTRUCTION,</i>

00:09:13.144 --> 00:09:14.145
YOU'RE DONE!

00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:15.146
I CAN'T...

00:09:15.146 --> 00:09:16.481
SILENCE!

00:09:16.481 --> 00:09:18.583
NO ONE CAN RESIST
MY MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:21.653
BEHOLD THE FULL POTENTIAL
OF ITS ANCIENT POWERS!

00:09:21.653 --> 00:09:24.756
JOEY WHEELER
NO LONGER EXISTS!

00:09:24.756 --> 00:09:27.359
AAH!

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.094
IT'S OVER, YUGI!!

00:09:29.094 --> 00:09:31.363
I ACTIVATE...

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.164
<i>METEOR OF DESTRUCTION!</i>

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.871
Marik: YOU DARED
TO DISRESPECT MY POWER?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:44.509
LOOKS LIKE YOUR FRIEND
IS WEAKER THAN YOU THOUGHT!

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:45.744
WHO'S LOSING <i>NOW?!</i>

00:09:47.612 --> 00:09:49.247
Joey: YUGI...

00:09:53.285 --> 00:09:55.720
HELP ME PLEAAASE!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.222
AAH!

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:58.623
YOU DID IT!

00:09:58.623 --> 00:09:59.658
WHAT?

00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:01.960
NO! YUGI WAS RIGHT!

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.829
WHEELER'S WILL <i>WAS</i>
TOO POWERFUL TO OVERCOME!

00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:06.598
NOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:10:06.598 --> 00:10:09.534
AAH!

00:10:09.534 --> 00:10:11.102
YUGI!

00:10:11.102 --> 00:10:12.170
[THINKING]
I KNEW JOEY'S HEART

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.672
WAS TOO STRONG
FOR MARIK!

00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:15.740
THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING LEFT TO DO!

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.610
TRAP CARD...
ACTIVATE!

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.680
<i>MYSTICAL REFPANEL</i>
WILL STOP MARIK'S
METEOR!!

00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:27.085
MY TRAP CARD
HAS ABSORBED
THE EFFECTS

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.354
OF MARIK'S
<i>METEOR OF</i>
<i>DESTRUCTION</i> CARD!

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:31.122
NOW MY <i>MYSTICAL</i>
<i>REFPANEL</i>

00:10:31.122 --> 00:10:33.925
CAN REDIRECT
THE METEOR'S ATTACK
WHEREVER I WANT!

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.393
[THINKING]
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:10:35.393 --> 00:10:38.863
I'M NOT GONNA PUT
YOU IN DANGER, JOEY.

00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:40.198
...YUGI.

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:43.268
[THINKING]
YUGI HAS QUITE A PREDICAMENT

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.803
ON HIS HANDS.

00:10:44.803 --> 00:10:46.404
THANKS TO <i>MYSTICAL REFPANEL,</i>

00:10:46.404 --> 00:10:48.840
HE HAS THE POWER TO CONTROL
THE OUTCOME OF THIS DUEL,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.242
LEAVING HIM
WITH A DIFFICULT DECISION...

00:10:51.242 --> 00:10:54.646
HE CAN EITHER DIRECT
THE ATTACK TOWARDS WHEELER,

00:10:54.646 --> 00:10:57.549
OR CHOOSE
TO DESTROY <i>HIMSELF.</i>

00:10:57.549 --> 00:10:59.951
AND IF EITHER OF THEM
TRY TO ESCAPE,

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.187
THEN TEA'S DONE FOR!

00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:04.456
UNLESS <i>MY</i> PLAN WORKS SOON...

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.024
BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:11.229
WHY AM I WEARIN'
YER MILLENNIUM PUZZLE?

00:11:11.229 --> 00:11:14.232
BECAUSE I <i>GAVE</i> IT
TO YOU, JOEY...

00:11:14.232 --> 00:11:16.901
...WHEN I WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU REMEMBER
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:18.069
I'M CONFUSED...

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:20.505
MARIK TRIED TO TURN
YOU AGAINST ME.

00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:22.140
BUT OUR FRIENDSHIP
ENDED UP BEING

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.775
<i>STRONGER</i>
THAN HIS POWERS!

00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:26.778
AND GIVING YOU
MY PUZZLE HELPED
YOU TO BREAK FREE.

00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:28.380
YOU'RE MY
BEST FRIEND, JOEY,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.815
AND NO EVIL MAGIC
CAN TAKE THAT AWAY!

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.017
AND NOW I HAVE
TO PUT AN END
TO THIS DUEL.

00:11:33.017 --> 00:11:34.285
BUT REMEMBER...

00:11:34.285 --> 00:11:36.888
WE DEFEATED MARIK
TOGETHER, JOEY!

00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:43.022
Tea: YOU GUYS BETTER
DO SOMETHING SOON OR...

00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.456
OR WHAT!?

00:11:44.456 --> 00:11:47.159
OR YOU'RE <i>BOTH</i> IN TROUBLE!

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:49.094
[THINKING]
ITS TOO LATE NOW!

00:11:49.094 --> 00:11:50.496
...HUH?

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:56.502
IT'S ONE
OF KAIBA'S

COME FROM?

00:12:04.643 --> 00:12:05.878
I WARNED YOU!

00:12:05.878 --> 00:12:08.113
TIME TO DROP
THE CRATE!

00:12:08.113 --> 00:12:10.516

THERE'S NOT MUCH
TIME LEFT...

IF ONE OF US
DOESN'T WIN,

00:12:53.926 --> 00:12:56.028
WE'LL <i>BOTH</i> BE
PULLED UNDER,

AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA LET THAT

I'M SAYING THAT
I'VE DECIDED TO

THERE'S NO POINT
IN BOTH OF US
GOING DOWN.

00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:08.440
AND IF I <i>LOSE,</i>
YOU'RE <i>SAFE.</i>

MOKUBA'S LITTLE FRIEND,

...AND PREPARE
FOR MY VICTORY
IN THE FINALS!

00:17:33.702 --> 00:17:37.639
Joey: YUGI...

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.240
I'M SORRY, MAN.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.408
IT'S OK.

00:17:40.408 --> 00:17:41.743
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:17:41.743 --> 00:17:44.045
BUT I ALMOST DESTROYED
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.547
YEAH,
BUT IN THE END,

00:17:45.547 --> 00:17:47.415
NOT ONLY
DID YOU <i>SAVE</i> OUR
FRIENDSHIP...

00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:48.650
YOU SAVED <i>ME.</i>

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.452
I HAD NO CHOICE.

00:17:50.452 --> 00:17:52.854
ONCE I REALIZED WHAT
I WAS DOIN' TO YA,

00:17:52.854 --> 00:17:54.723
I HAD TO MAKE IT RIGHT

00:17:54.723 --> 00:17:56.758
OR <i>DO</i> MYSELF <i>IN</i>
TRYIN', YUGI.

00:17:56.758 --> 00:17:58.660
EVER SINCE
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.396
WE'VE ALWAYS KEPT AN EYE
OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

00:18:01.396 --> 00:18:04.366
I WASN'T GONNA LET
SOME RARE HUNTER CREEP
CHANGE THAT.

00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:05.967
EVEN IF...

00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:08.603
...EVEN IF MY BRAIN
<i>WAS</i> TURNED TO MUSH!

00:18:08.603 --> 00:18:10.305
IT'S OK.

00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:13.308
BUT DAT MARIK MADE
A COMPLETE FOOL OUTTA ME!

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:16.578
HOW CAN I SHOW MY FACE
AT DA FINALS NOW!?!

00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:18.480
WILL YOU GET
A GRIP, PLEASE!

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.348
YOU SHOWED SOME REAL
COURAGE OUT THERE, JOEY,

00:18:20.348 --> 00:18:22.250
SO WHO CARES
ABOUT HOW YOU <i>LOOKED!!</i>

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.519
JUST LIKE THE COURAGE YOU
SHOWED AT DUELIST KINGDOM

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:26.254
WHEN YOU DUELED
FOR YOUR SISTER!

00:18:26.254 --> 00:18:27.789
REMEMBER THAT?

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:30.558
WHAT SHE DID TODAY
SHE DID BECAUSE OF <i>YOU!</i>

00:18:30.558 --> 00:18:32.560
YOU'RE HER <i>IDOL,</i> DING-DONG!

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.563
WHAT KIND OF IDOL GETS
TURNED INTO A ZOMBIE

00:18:35.563 --> 00:18:37.899
AND THEN ALMOST DESTROYS
HIS BEST FRIEND?

00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:39.834
TALK ABOUT SETTING
A BAD EXAMPLE!

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:41.903
STOP FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF!

00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:44.139
YOUR SISTER GETS
HER STRENGTH
FROM YOU.

00:18:44.139 --> 00:18:46.808
THAT'S WHY SHE WAITED
'TIL NOW TO TAKE
HER BANDAGES OFF!

00:18:46.808 --> 00:18:50.045
HUH? SERENITY,
YOU CAN SEE NOW!

00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:51.346
MM-HMM.

00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:52.781
I WAS AFRAID AT FIRST,

00:18:52.781 --> 00:18:55.417
BUT HEARING YOU
SAVE YUGI INSPIRED ME.

00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:58.620
AFTER I TOOK MY BANDAGES OFF
AND OPENED MY EYES...

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.423
YOU SHOWED ME
WHAT COURAGE WAS
ALL ABOUT, JOEY...

00:19:01.423 --> 00:19:03.391

00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:04.759

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:07.429
I MADE IT THROUGH
MY OPERATION
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:19:07.429 --> 00:19:10.365
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

00:19:10.365 --> 00:19:13.835
TODAY IT WAS MY TURN
TO BE THERE FOR YOU,

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.172

00:19:22.977 --> 00:19:24.879

00:19:32.587 --> 00:19:34.055

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:48.403
EVEN WHEN THINGS
SEEMED HOPELESS,

00:19:48.403 --> 00:19:50.205
THEY NEVER GAVE UP ON ME!

00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:52.607
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEM,
WHO KNOWS WHERE I'D BE!

00:19:52.607 --> 00:19:57.612
HEY, YUGE, I'M GLAD
DAT MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
IS BACK WHERE IT BELONGS.

00:19:57.612 --> 00:19:58.913
Yugi, thinking:
THAT REMINDS ME...

00:19:58.913 --> 00:20:01.015
I OWE A BIG THANKS
TO <i>YOU</i> TOO, YAMI.

00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:02.383
YOU TRUSTED ME ENOUGH

00:20:02.383 --> 00:20:04.119
TO LET ME HANDLE
THIS ON MY <i>OWN.</i>

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.854
I COULD NEVER HAVE
BROKEN THROUGH TO JOEY

00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:07.822
IF YOU DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN ME.

00:20:07.822 --> 00:20:10.859
YOU AND I MAKE A GREAT TEAM,
BUT IT'S ALSO NICE TO KNOW

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:13.495
THAT I HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO HOLD MY OWN IF I HAVE TO,

00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:16.564
AND YOU HELPED ME FIND
THAT STRENGTH INSIDE MYSELF.

00:20:16.564 --> 00:20:17.899
Tristan:
HEY, ANYONE HUNGRY?

00:20:17.899 --> 00:20:19.100
Joey: I'M STARVIN'!

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.703
COME ON, LET'S GO, MOKUBA.

00:20:21.703 --> 00:20:23.738
Yugi: HEY, KAIBA!

00:20:23.738 --> 00:20:25.340

Tristan: GUESS THAT MEANS
<i>YOU'RE WELCOME.</i>

00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:39.821
Yugi, thinking:
IN ALL THIS INSANITY,

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:41.356
I <i>FORGOT</i> ABOUT THE FINALS!

00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:43.358
THAT COULD BE WHERE MARIK
WILL STRIKE NEXT!

00:20:43.358 --> 00:20:44.993
THIS FIGHT IS FAR FROM OVER,

00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:48.797
AND WHENEVER MARIK COMES BACK,
I'LL BE READY FOR HIM!
