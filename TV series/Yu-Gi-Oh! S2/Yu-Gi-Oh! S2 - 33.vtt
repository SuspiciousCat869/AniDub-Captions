WEBVTT

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.739
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:05.341
Marik: THE BATTLE CITY FINALS
ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN,

00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:08.144
AND EVERYTHING THAT I NEED
TO GAIN INFINITE POWER

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:09.879
WILL BE IN ONE PLACE.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.481
Odion:
THAT'S RIGHT, MARIK.

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.851
THIS IS WHERE I
NEED <i>YOUR</i> HELP, ODION.

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:16.419
I MUST HIDE MY IDENTITY.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.555
EVERYONE SHALL THINK
<i>YOU</i> ARE <i>ME.</i>

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.457
AS FOR MYSELF,

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.827
THOSE FOOLS <i>ALREADY</i>
BELIEVE ME TO BE
A FRIEND NAMED NAMU.

00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:25.862
I'LL GAIN THEIR TRUST,
THEN CRUSH THEM

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:27.897
WITH THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA!

00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:29.966
HEY, LOOK!
THE FIRST 3 FINALISTS--

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.601
JOEY, YUGI AND MAI!

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.269
SOMEONE ELSE IS ARRIVING.

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.305
Yugi: HEY!
THAT'S BAKURA!

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:36.973
BAKURA!

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.542
YOU SHOULD
GET BACK TO
THE HOSPITAL!

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.277
I'M FINE.

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:43.113
Yugi: WHAT ARE
YA DOING WEARING
A DUEL DISC?

00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:45.048
Bakura:
HOW ELSE COULD I
WIN 6 LOCATOR CARDS

00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:46.683
AND ENTER
THE FINALS!?

00:00:46.683 --> 00:00:47.684
[THINKING]
PERFECT.

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:49.652
HE'S HOLDING UP HIS END
OF OUR BARGAIN.

00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:51.888
THE FOOL IS DUELING FOR <i>ME!</i>

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:53.590
IT'S TIME TO ANNOUNCE...

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.825
THAT ALTHOUGH
YOUR LOCATOR CARDS
LED YOU HERE,

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:59.462
THIS IS <i>NOT</i> THE SITE
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:00:59.462 --> 00:01:00.864
LOOK! UP THERE!

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:02.432
IT'S KAIBA'S BLIMP!

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:04.234
SO WE'RE DUELING
IN THE SKY?

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:07.570
YOU GOT IT!
IT'S TIME TO BOARD
KAIBA KRAFT 3

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.876
FOR THE START OF
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:17.213
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:19.282
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:26.756
♪ YU-GI-OH
IS IN THE GAME ♪

00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:51.614
IT'S TIME TO D-D-DUEL!

00:02:13.303 --> 00:02:15.405
Mai: I HAVE TO ADMIT
THE BLIMP IS A NICE TOUCH

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:17.941
AND KAIBA SPARED
NO EXPENSE...

00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.643
BUT I'M READY
TO STOP SCHMOOZING
AND START DUELING!

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.146
WELL, I WISH YOU
THE BEST OF LUCK
IN THE FINALS, MAI.

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:24.814
WHO NEEDS <i>LUCK!?</i>

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.850
Joey: I CAN'T BELIEVE
KAIBA SERVED UP
FANCY CHOW LIKE <i>DIS</i>

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.284
AND MADE IT
"ALL YOU CAN EAT."

00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:30.186
HE'S GONNA BE SORRY
BY DA TIME <i>I'M</i> THROUGH!

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.421
HUH?

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:32.455
[THINKING]
IT'S MARIK!

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:33.690
I CAN'T STAND
DAT GUY!

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.425
DAT MIND-CONTROLLING
MENACE

00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:37.293
IS GONNA GET WHAT'S
COMIN' TO 'IM.

00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.596
JUST WAIT TILL
HE HAS TO DUEL ME!

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.431
HUH?

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.266
SORRY, MY BAD.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.601
THAT'S
QUITE ALL RIGHT.

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.236
<i>EVERYONE</i> SEEMS
ON EDGE.

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:48.271
YEAH, PRE-FINAL JITTERS.

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.007
BY DA WAY, HOW'D YOU
QUALIFY SO FAST, ANYWAY?

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:54.010
WELL, I WON ALL 6
LOCATOR CARDS
AT ONCE.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.446
HUH? NO WAY, BAKURA!

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:58.047
YOU WON <i>6</i> CARDS
IN <i>ONE</i> DUEL!?

00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.382
IT CAN'T BE!

00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:00.683
Bakura:
IT WAS SIMPLE.

00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:03.219
I BATTLED BONZ
AND HIS GANG OF
ZOMBIE DUELISTS

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.587
IN THE CEMETERY.

00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:06.656
WHEN I DEFEATED THEM
USING SOME GHOSTS
OF MY OWN,

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:09.993
I GOT THEM TO GIVE UP
ALL THEIR LOCATOR CARDS.

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:11.094
BUT HOW!?

00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:12.595
WELL...
LET'S JUST SAY

00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:15.932
I DIDN'T GIVE
THOSE FELLOWS
MUCH CHOICE.

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:17.600
YOU...FORCED...THEM?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.768
SORT OF.

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:20.069
[THINKING]
DUELIN' BONZ
IN A CEMETERY

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.905
AND FORCIN' HIM
TO GIVE UP <i>EVERYTHING...</i>

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:23.306
DAT'S CREEPY.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:24.641
HEH. SEE YA LATER.

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.577
RIGHT. CHEERIO
AND GOOD LUCK
IN YOUR FIRST DUEL.

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:30.113
[THINKING]
IT'LL BE GOOD LUCK
IF I DON'T HAVE TO DUEL <i>HIM!</i>

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:32.415
Tea: YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU JUST SAW
A ZOMBIE, JOEY.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:33.683
NAH, IT'S JUST
THE SHRIMP--

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:35.385
I THINK IT'S BEEN
SITTING OUT TOO LONG.

00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:36.986
JUST DON'T
THROW UP ON ME.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:39.055
HEY,
WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?

00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:41.457
WHEN ARE WE GONNA FIND OUT
WHO WE DUEL, KAIBA?

00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:43.459
HMM. YOU'RE
IN QUITE A RUSH

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.694
JUST TO LOSE,
WHEELER.

00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:47.130
LET'S BEGIN THIS...NOW.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.197
Fuguta: SORRY, MR. KAIBA,

00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:50.133
BUT ONLY 7 FINALISTS
ARE PRESENT.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:51.567
SHALL I BRING UP
THE EIGHTH ONE?

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:53.136
YES. NOW!

00:03:53.136 --> 00:03:54.137
LET'S GO.

00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:00.643
HUH?
WHAT'S THAT THING?

00:04:07.517 --> 00:04:09.285
Roland:
FINALISTS AND GUESTS,

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:10.853
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
PLEASE?

00:04:10.853 --> 00:04:13.323
NOW, THE FIRST TWO DUELISTS
FOR ROUND ONE

00:04:13.323 --> 00:04:15.258
WILL BE CHOSEN BY LOTTERY.

00:04:15.258 --> 00:04:16.292
Mai: WHAT'S
THE JACKPOT?

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:17.493
TO GUARANTEE FAIRNESS,

00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:19.128
EACH PAIR OF OPPONENTS
WILL BE SELECTED

00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:20.863
COMPLETELY AT RANDOM.

00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:23.299
YOU'VE ALL BEEN ASSIGNED
A NUMBER FROM 1 THROUGH 8.

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:26.235
THE SELECTOR WILL NOW CHOOSE
THE FIRST TWO NUMBERS.

00:04:26.235 --> 00:04:28.471
THE <i>SECOND</i> PAIR OF NUMBERS
WILL NOT BE DRAWN

00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:30.707
UNTIL A WINNER IS DECLARED
IN THE <i>FIRST</i> DUEL.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:32.809
THUS YOU WILL NOT KNOW
YOUR OPPONENT'S IDENTITY

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.211
UNTIL JUST BEFORE YOU DUEL.

00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:37.780
I'M FIGHTING THE URGE
TO YELL OUT "BINGO!"

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.215
GO AHEAD,
<i>I'LL</i> LAUGH.

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:41.451
Roland: ALL 8 BALLS ARE OF
EQUAL SIZE AND WEIGHT.

00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:44.787
THE SELECTOR PRODUCES RESULTS
THAT ARE 100% RANDOM.

00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:47.023
DOES EVERYONE REMEMBER
HIS OR HER NUMBER?

00:04:57.633 --> 00:04:59.268
Ishizu: ENTER.

00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:00.770
I BEG YOUR PARDON,
MA'AM.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.938
WHAT IS IT?

00:05:01.938 --> 00:05:04.540
MR. KAIBA HAS REQUESTED
YOUR PRESENCE AT ONCE.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.142
IN ORDER TO WATCH
THE FINALISTS

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:08.211
BEING PAIRED OFF
FOR THE FIRST DUEL...

00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:09.278
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:10.413
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:12.315
THEN MY PRESENCE
IS NOT REQUIRED.

00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:14.017
SOME THINGS
CANNOT BE EXPLAINED,

00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:15.585
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
WITH CERTAINTY

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:17.653
THAT I WILL NOT BE CHOSEN
FOR THE FIRST DUEL.

00:05:17.653 --> 00:05:18.788
HUH?

00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:20.223
[THINKING]
BUT I KNOW WHO <i>WILL...</i>

00:05:20.223 --> 00:05:21.791
AND THE FATE
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:23.926
DEPENDS UPON HIS VICTORY.

00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:31.092
WE SHALL NOW BEGIN SELECTING
THE FIRST TWO DUELISTS

00:05:31.092 --> 00:05:33.128
FOR THE FINALS, ROUND ONE!

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:35.130
I'LL ENGAGE THE MACHINE.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.699
RANDOM SELECT!

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.334
REMEMBER,
IF YOUR NUMBER IS CHOSEN,

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:43.438
YOU'LL BE PARTICIPATING
IN THE FIRST DUEL OF
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS!

00:05:43.438 --> 00:05:45.373
AND THE FIRST DUELIST IS...

00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:48.109
NUMBER 6!

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:49.210
BAKURA!

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:52.547
ME? I DUEL FIRST?

00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:53.915
Tristan: YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, MAN?

00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:55.016
HA HA HA!

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:56.084
Tea: YEAH, BAKURA,

00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:57.852
YOU SHOULD REALLY BE
IN BED RESTING!

00:05:57.852 --> 00:05:59.788
YOU JUST GOT
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL,
REMEMBER!?

00:05:59.788 --> 00:06:01.156
Tristan:
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE WALKING,

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:02.857
LET ALONE DUELING.

00:06:02.857 --> 00:06:04.659
[THINKING]
SOMETHIN'S FISHY
ON DIS BLIMP,

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.261
AND IT'S NOT
THE BAKED SALMON.

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:07.729
NO WAY HE HEALED DAT FAST!

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.931
OH, DON'T WORRY,
I'M FINE...

00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:13.434
BEING THE FIRST DUELIST CHOSEN
JUST TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:16.337
STAND BY...
WHILE WE CHOOSE
THE NEXT DUELIST.

00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:18.740
PLEASE NOTE THE SELECTION
PROCESS IS FINAL.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.608
WHEN THE SECOND DUELIST
IS CHOSEN,

00:06:20.608 --> 00:06:22.977
BOTH PARTICIPANTS
MUST PROCEED DIRECTLY
TO THE ARENA.

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:28.016
Roland: BAKURA'S OPPONENT
IN THE FIRST DUEL IS...

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:31.152
DUELIST NUMBER 3,
YUGI MOTO.

00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:33.721
THE FIRST DUEL OF
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:36.825
WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY
IN THE STRATOS DUELING ARENA.

00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:38.626
Bakura: I GUESS
I'M BATTLING YUGI!

00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:39.761
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:41.262
[THINKING]
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:42.430
[THINKING]
INTERESTING.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.032
I WONDER HOW BAKURA
WILL FARE

00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:46.568
AGAINST YUGI'S
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:48.703
WHEW! GLAD IT'S YUGE
AND NOT ME.

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:50.071
Roland: THIS DUEL
WILL BE PLAYED

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:53.241
IN ACCORDANCE WITH
BATTLE CITY RULES
AND REGULATIONS.

00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.311
THE LOSER WILL RELINQUISH
HIS RAREST CARD TO THE WINNER

00:06:56.311 --> 00:06:58.780
AS WELL AS BE EXPELLED
FROM THE FINALS.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.748
THE WINNER WILL ADVANCE
TO ROUND TWO.

00:07:00.748 --> 00:07:02.250
Marik, thinking:
WHEN THE PHARAOH LOSES,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.786
HE'LL HAND
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:06.888
TO THE DUELIST
THEY <i>THINK</i> IS BAKURA.

00:07:06.888 --> 00:07:08.857
SOON AFTER,
IT WILL BE <i>MINE!</i>

00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:10.425
[THINKING]
MY NECKLACE TELLS ME

00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:12.861
THE PHARAOH WILL STRUGGLE
IN THIS DUEL.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.932
[THINKING]
VICTORY WILL BRING ME
ONE STEP CLOSER

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:21.369
TO OBTAINING ALL 7
MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:24.606
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS
ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:27.242
THE ARENA IS LOCATED
IN THE UPPER DECK!

00:07:27.242 --> 00:07:30.144
Joey: WHOA!
HOW MANY DECKS
ARE ON THIS THING?

00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:31.679
Roland:
DUELISTS 6 AND 3,
FOLLOW ME.

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:33.648
THOSE NOT DUELING ARE
WELCOME TO OBSERVE.

00:07:33.648 --> 00:07:35.049
TAKE THE CENTRAL
ELEVATOR

00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:36.551
TO THE STRATOS
LEVEL.

00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.186
AWESOME.
I'M <i>THERE.</i>

00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:43.892
Yugi, thinking:
I KNOW THAT'S <i>NOT</i> BAKURA!

00:07:43.892 --> 00:07:46.094
IT'S THE EVIL SPIRIT OF
THE MILLENNIUM RING,

00:07:46.094 --> 00:07:48.997
AND I BET HE'S <i>STILL</i> AFTER
THE 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:51.165
THIS DUEL'S GONNA BE TOUGHER
THAN EVERYONE THINKS!

00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:10.718
I WELCOME YOU TO
THE STRATOS DUELING ARENA.

00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:15.623
I MUST WIN THIS.

00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:18.559
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
DEPENDS ON IT.

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:20.461
Roland: DUELISTS,
TAKE YOUR MARKS.

00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:22.764
ELEVATE THE PLAYING FIELD!

00:08:27.268 --> 00:08:28.569
Tristan: OH!

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:30.571
Joey: WHOA,
DUELIN' UP
HERE'S INSANE!

00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:31.673
Serenity:
AND FREEZING.

00:08:31.673 --> 00:08:32.740
OH, LOOK,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.810
HERE COMES THE MASTER
OF CEREMONIES NOW.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.412
ALL RIGHT, I'LL MAKE
THIS SPEECH QUICK

00:08:37.412 --> 00:08:39.514
SO WE CAN BEGIN THIS DUEL.

00:08:39.514 --> 00:08:41.249
KAIBA KRAFT 3
IS NOW CRUISING

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.318
AT AN ALTITUDE OF
4,000 FEET.

00:08:43.318 --> 00:08:45.453
THE STRONG WINDS
AND COLD AIR

00:08:45.453 --> 00:08:47.488
WILL TEST YOUR STRENGTH
AND STAMINA.

00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:50.358
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE IT,
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.

00:08:50.358 --> 00:08:52.760
YEAH! I <i>DIG</i>
THIS LITTLE TWIST!

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.262
I HAVE TO ADMIT IT:

00:08:54.262 --> 00:08:56.197
KAIBA <i>DOES</i> KNOW
HOW TO THROW
A TOURNAMENT.

00:08:56.197 --> 00:08:58.466
Bakura: ARE YOU
PREPARED TO LOSE IT ALL?

00:08:58.466 --> 00:08:59.634
Yami-Yugi:
I WON'T LOSE!

00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:01.469
BEFORE WE
BEGIN THIS DUEL,

00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:03.771
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHO YOU <i>REALLY</i> ARE

00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:05.173
AND STOP THIS CHARADE?

00:09:05.173 --> 00:09:06.774
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:06.774 --> 00:09:08.876
ALL RIGHT, HAVE IT
YOUR WAY, THEN,

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:11.279
BUT I THINK I <i>KNOW</i>
WHO YOU ARE.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:16.150
IT <i>IS</i> YOU!

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.353
THE SPIRIT OF
THE MILLENNIUM RING!

00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:19.821
HEY, LOOK AT BAKURA!

00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:20.888
AW, MAN!

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.690
HE'S WEARIN' DAT
MILLENNIUM RING AGAIN!

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.559
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:26.494
I GOT RID OF IT
AT DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:29.097
Tristan, voice-over:
I TOSSED THAT THING

00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:30.565
INTO THE DEEPEST PART
OF THE WOODS,

00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:32.100
MILES FROM ANYWHERE!

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.701
I DON'T KNOW HOW
BAKURA GOT IT BACK,

00:09:33.701 --> 00:09:36.804
BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT
A GOOD THING!

00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:38.740
SO WHY ALL THE FUSS?

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.708
WHAT'S AROUND
BAKURA'S NECK?

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:41.843
NAMU...

00:09:41.843 --> 00:09:43.311
IT'S KINDA HARD
TO EXPLAIN,

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:45.046
BUT THAT'S NOT
REALLY BAKURA.

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:46.314
YOU LOST ME.

00:09:46.314 --> 00:09:48.049
YA SEE,
YUGI AND BAKURA

00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:51.319
BOTH HAVE THESE
REAL OLD OBJECTS
DAT HAVE MAGIC POWERS...

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:52.620
YUGI'S ITEM IS GOOD,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.789
BUT BAKURA'S ITEM
IS BAD.

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:57.258
Tea: 'CAUSE AN EVIL SPIRIT
LIVES INSIDE IT.

00:09:57.258 --> 00:10:01.095
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THERE'S AN EVIL SPIRIT
UP THERE DUELING YUGI?

00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:03.398
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

00:10:03.398 --> 00:10:05.833
YEAH, I DIDN'T
BELIEVE IT
AT FIRST EITHER.

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.368
I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T
DRAG YUGE

00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:08.970
TO DA SHADOW REALM AGAIN.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.738
DAT'S NOT A PLACE
YA WANNA BE.

00:10:10.738 --> 00:10:11.906
[THINKING]
YOU FOOLS!

00:10:11.906 --> 00:10:14.308
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THAT I'M REALLY <i>MARIK</i>

00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:16.377
AND THAT THE EVIL SPIRIT
UP THERE

00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:17.912
IS WORKING FOR <i>ME!</i>

00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:19.080
HA HA HA!

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.314
WELL, THEN...

00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:22.950
NOW THAT THE INTRODUCTIONS
ARE OVER AND DONE WITH,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.952
WHY DON'T WE
BEGIN THIS DUEL?

00:10:24.952 --> 00:10:27.555
FIRST, TELL ME
WHY YOU'VE ENTERED
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.857
AND WHAT IT IS
YOU HOPE TO GAIN!

00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:32.026
IS IT ABOUT
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS?

00:10:32.026 --> 00:10:34.328
HUH. PERHAPS.

00:10:34.328 --> 00:10:36.164
[THINKING]
HOW AMUSING.

00:10:36.164 --> 00:10:39.133
HE KNOWS I DESIRE
THE 7 MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:42.203
BUT HE HAS NO IDEA
<i>HOW</i> I INTEND TO OBTAIN THEM.

00:10:42.203 --> 00:10:44.806
FIRST I'LL WIN
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:10:44.806 --> 00:10:47.975
AND DELIVER IT TO MARIK
IN EXCHANGE FOR
THE MILLENNIUM ROD.

00:10:47.975 --> 00:10:51.779
THEN SEIZING YUGI'S PUZZLE
WILL BE A SIMPLE TASK.

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:53.614
HA HA HA!

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:54.949
YUGI...

00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:56.284
PERHAPS THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE

00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:58.920
THAT I'M PLANNING
TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOU...

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.122
BESIDES YOUR
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:11:01.122 --> 00:11:02.590
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT!?

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.126
YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS,
DON'T YOU?

00:11:05.126 --> 00:11:08.863
THERE IS SO MUCH
ABOUT THIS TOURNAMENT
THAT YOU ARE UNAWARE OF,

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:11.432
SO MANY SECRETS
BEING KEPT FROM YOU.

00:11:11.432 --> 00:11:12.633
FOR INSTANCE,

00:11:12.633 --> 00:11:14.969
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
I AM WORKING ALONE?

00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:16.737
AND ARE YOU SURE THAT
ONE OF THE PEOPLE

00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:18.372
YOU BELIEVE TO BE
YOUR FRIEND

00:11:18.372 --> 00:11:21.342
ISN'T REALLY
YOUR GREATEST ENEMY?

00:11:21.342 --> 00:11:22.410
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.178
LIES ARE A PART
OF YOUR GAME!

00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:26.681
BUT THEY WON'T HELP YOU
IN THIS DUEL!

00:11:26.681 --> 00:11:28.382
Marik, thinking:
LISTEN TO ME YOU FOOL!

00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:30.885
YOU'RE GIVING HIM
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:32.286
IF YOU WANT THE ITEMS,

00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:35.156
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THIS
BY MY RULES,

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:36.624
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:40.228
YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE OVER YOUR MIND
AND DUEL HIM MYSELF!

00:11:40.228 --> 00:11:42.330
Yami-Bakura, thinking:
IF YOU COULD HAVE
DEFEATED HIM ON YOUR OWN,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.565
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT
BY NOW, MARIK.

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:47.034
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES!

00:11:47.034 --> 00:11:48.236
AND NOW!

00:11:48.236 --> 00:11:50.471
THE FIRST DUEL OF
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:51.806
WILL BEGIN!

00:11:51.806 --> 00:11:53.174
IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:57.011
FINISH THIS
EVIL SPIRIT, YUGE!

00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:59.814
COME ON, YUGI,
WE'RE WITH YOU!

00:11:59.814 --> 00:12:01.349
[THINKING]
LET'S SEE IF YUGI
HAS WHAT IT TAKES

00:12:01.349 --> 00:12:03.751
TO USE HIS
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:12:03.751 --> 00:12:05.052
[THINKING]
AND SO,

00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:08.589
THE BATTLE THAT WILL DECIDE
THE FUTURE OF MANKIND BEGINS.

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:10.725
PLEASE TRIUMPH, MY PHARAOH.

00:12:12.126 --> 00:12:13.261
JUST KNOW...

00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:14.862
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU DESIRE,

00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:15.997
YOU <i>WILL</i> FAIL.

00:12:15.997 --> 00:12:17.198
NOT QUITE.

00:12:17.198 --> 00:12:19.133
IT IS <i>YOU</i> WHO SHALL LOSE...

00:12:19.133 --> 00:12:20.868
<i>EVERYTHING</i> YOU HAVE!!

00:12:26.273 --> 00:12:27.274
Yami-Bakura:
YUGI, I CAN ASSURE YOU

00:12:27.274 --> 00:12:28.976
THAT THE FIRST DUEL
OF THE FINALS

00:12:28.976 --> 00:12:30.677
WILL ALSO BE YOUR LAST!

00:12:30.677 --> 00:12:32.813
I SHALL BEGIN WITH THIS!

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:38.345
THE PORTRAIT'S SECRET
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:40.447
THAT'LL DO FOR NOW.

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:41.815
Yugi, thinking:
HE PLAYED A REALLY
WEAK MONSTER

00:12:41.815 --> 00:12:42.949
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:44.985
THAT'S NOT
A SMART MOVE AT ALL.

00:12:44.985 --> 00:12:47.054
HE MUST BE
UP TO SOMETHING.
BUT WHAT?

00:12:47.054 --> 00:12:50.424
I DON'T GET IT--
THAT MONSTER'S
NO CHALLENGE AT ALL.

00:12:50.424 --> 00:12:52.726
DISMANTLE DAT POSSESSED
PICTURE FRAME!

00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:55.028
IS THAT REALLY
ALL YOU'VE GOT?

00:12:55.028 --> 00:12:57.064
THEN NOOOOOW
I'LL SUMMON GAZELLE,

00:12:57.064 --> 00:12:58.932
THE KING OF
MYTHICAL BEASTS!

00:12:58.932 --> 00:13:00.667
[ROAR]

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.136
ATTACK
HIS MONSTER NOW!

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:11.978
NOW I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:13:11.978 --> 00:13:13.847
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY AGAIN?

00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:16.049
FINE. NOW
I SHALL PLAY...

00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:20.821
THE GROSS GHOST
OF FLED DREAMS IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:26.760
YAH! DAT'S FOUL!

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.396
ATTACK MY MONSTER
IF YOU DARE.

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:31.631
YOUR GHOST IS NO MATCH
FOR MY GAZELLE,

00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:33.567
AND WITH NO TRAP
OR MAGIC CARDS,

00:13:33.567 --> 00:13:35.602
YOU CAN'T STOP
MY ATTACK.

00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:36.603
Yugi, thinking:
HE MUST <i>WANT</i> ME
TO DESTROY IT

00:13:36.603 --> 00:13:38.004
FOR SOME REASON.

00:13:38.004 --> 00:13:39.773
I JUST HAVE
TO WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS

00:13:39.773 --> 00:13:41.508
BEFORE HE FINISHES
HIS STRATEGY.

00:13:41.508 --> 00:13:42.709
[THINKING]
COME ON, YUGI...

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:44.377
TAKE MY BAIT.

00:13:44.377 --> 00:13:47.147
IT'S TIME TO EXTINGUISH
YOUR GHOST,

00:13:47.147 --> 00:13:48.682
LEAVING YOUR LIFE POINTS
WIDE OPEN,

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:50.984
AND I'LL DO IT
WITH THIS!

00:13:50.984 --> 00:13:52.586
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR!?

00:13:52.586 --> 00:13:53.620
NOTHING!

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.156
I SUMMON GAMMA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:58.458
ATTACK
HIS GHOST NOW!

00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:05.465
NOW, KING OF
MYTHICAL BEASTS,

00:14:05.465 --> 00:14:06.833
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:14:09.402 --> 00:14:10.771
UNH!

00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:12.139
UNH!

00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:14.775
COME ON!

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:15.976
CRUSH THIS GUY,
YUGI!

00:14:15.976 --> 00:14:18.111
HE'S NOT EVEN
FIGHTING BACK!

00:14:18.111 --> 00:14:19.946
YUGI'S WIPED OUT
HALF HIS LIFE POINTS,

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:21.782
AND THE DUEL
JUST STARTED.

00:14:21.782 --> 00:14:22.883
[THINKING]
WHAT'S HE DOING!?

00:14:22.883 --> 00:14:24.918
I WANT THAT
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:14:24.918 --> 00:14:25.952
ALL RIGHT, YUGI,

00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:28.155
PERHAPS I'VE MADE THINGS
TOO EASY FOR YOU.

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:29.256
NOT ANYMORE!

00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:30.490
THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.159
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:33.727
AS YOU WISH.

00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:35.462
I SUMMON
THE HEADLESS KNIGHT,

00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:37.063
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:37.063 --> 00:14:39.399
I'M AFRAID I DON'T
SEE YOUR MONSTER.

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:42.169
PERHAPS THAT'S
BECAUSE HE'S A SPIRIT...

00:14:42.169 --> 00:14:45.305
HE HIDES IN THE SHADOWS
UNTIL THE TIME IS RIGHT.

00:14:45.305 --> 00:14:46.940
HA HA HA!

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.108
HMM.

00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:52.445
THIS SPIRIT
MAY BE STRONGER

00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:54.314
THAN YOUR LAST
TWO MONSTERS,

00:14:54.314 --> 00:14:56.149
BUT IT'S STILL
WEAKER THAN MINE!

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.018
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
ATTACK IT?

00:14:58.018 --> 00:14:59.019
[THINKING]
IF YUGI ATTACKS,

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:00.620
BAKURA'S PLAN MAY SUCCEED,

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.589
BUT YUGI HAS NO OTHER CHOICE.

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:03.623
TAKE THIS!

00:15:03.623 --> 00:15:06.760
GAMMA THE MAGNET
WARRIOR, ATTACK!

00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:12.933
GRR!

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:15.802
NOW, GAZELLE,
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:16.803
UNH!

00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:24.811
NOW YOU'VE LOST MOST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:15:24.811 --> 00:15:27.447
Yugi, thinking:
I CAN WIN THIS DUEL
WITH ONE MORE ATTACK!

00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:29.783
UNLESS HIS STRATEGY
KICKS IN NOW,
HE'S FINISHED.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:32.252
SOMETHING STRANGE
IS GOING ON
IN THIS DUEL.

00:15:32.252 --> 00:15:34.287
Joey: YEAH. DIS
SEEMS TOO EASY!

00:15:34.287 --> 00:15:36.556
OR YUGI'S FIGHTING
THE WORLD'S WORST
DUELIST.

00:15:36.556 --> 00:15:37.858
WELL, EITHER WAY,

00:15:37.858 --> 00:15:40.026
YUGI'S GONNA
WIN THIS THING
IN HIS NEXT TURN.

00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:41.695
TIME TO MAKE
YOUR FINAL MOVE!

00:15:41.695 --> 00:15:44.564
HA HA HA!

00:15:44.564 --> 00:15:45.899
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.371
HA HA HA!

00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:52.906
IT'S TIME!

00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:56.142
YOU'VE DONE EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED YOU TO DO.

00:15:56.142 --> 00:15:58.745
NOW YOUR DESTRUCTION
BEGINS!

00:15:58.745 --> 00:16:00.313
IT'S OVER!

00:16:00.313 --> 00:16:02.515
Joey: OVA?
YEAH, FOR <i>HIM!</i>

00:16:02.515 --> 00:16:03.783
YUGI'S GOT
THIS CLOWN SET UP

00:16:03.783 --> 00:16:05.385
LIKE A BALLOON
ON A DARTBOARD!

00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:06.853
IT'S A BLUFF.

00:16:06.853 --> 00:16:09.389
IT <i>HAS</i> TO BE--
HE'S GOT NO MONSTERS LEFT!

00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:12.459
AND HE'S ALREADY DOWN
TO LESS THAN 500
LIFE POINTS.

00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:15.128
[THINKING]
THERE'D BE NO POINT
IN BLUFFING NOW.

00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:17.330
BAKURA <i>MUST</i> HAVE
SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE--

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.899
A PLAN TO TURN THE TABLES.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.001
Yami-Bakura:
I HOLD A CARD
IN MY HAND

00:16:21.001 --> 00:16:24.804
WITH DARK POWERS BEYOND
YOUR WILDEST IMAGINATION.

00:16:24.804 --> 00:16:28.108
BUT FIRST, BEFORE I COULD
PLAY THIS ALL-POWERFUL CARD,

00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:30.443
I NEEDED A BIT
OF ASSISTANCE.

00:16:30.443 --> 00:16:33.146
THANKS FOR HELPING <i>ME</i>
DESTROY <i>YOU.</i>

00:16:33.146 --> 00:16:35.749
3 OF MY MONSTERS
NEEDED TO BE DESTROYED

00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:38.652
BEFORE I COULD
BRING FORTH
MY DARK DESTRUCTOR.

00:16:38.652 --> 00:16:40.587
YOU MADE THAT POSSIBLE!

00:16:40.587 --> 00:16:43.823
NOW I SUMMON THE BEAST
THAT WILL CAUSE YOUR DEMISE...

00:16:43.823 --> 00:16:46.126
DARK NECROFEAR!

00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:47.494
[GRUNTS]

00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:53.867
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT
TO EXPERIENCE!

00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:01.708
Yami-Yugi:
I KNEW YOU WERE
PLANNING SOMETHING!

00:17:02.776 --> 00:17:04.210
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.712
YOU STILL FELL
INTO MY TRAP,

00:17:05.712 --> 00:17:08.281
AND NOW YOU'RE
ABOUT TO PAY
THE ULTIMATE PRICE!

00:17:08.281 --> 00:17:09.883
HA HA HA!

00:17:13.978 --> 00:17:14.979
THIS IS IT--
YOU'RE FINISHED, YUGI!

00:17:14.979 --> 00:17:16.514
WHAT IS IT?!

00:17:16.514 --> 00:17:18.783
THAT MONSTER'S
CREEPIN' ME OUT!

00:17:18.783 --> 00:17:20.084
ME, TOO, TRISTAN.

00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:21.286
AND IF HE WAS
WILLIN' TA LOSE

00:17:21.286 --> 00:17:22.287
ALL A DOSE
LIFE POINTS

00:17:22.287 --> 00:17:23.521
TO BRING IT OUT...

00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:25.256
IT MUST BE POWERFUL.

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:27.625
DARK NECROFEAR IS
ONE OF THE MOST
DESTRUCTIVE CARDS

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:28.760
IN MY DECK.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.461
YOU'LL NEVER STOP IT.

00:17:30.461 --> 00:17:33.131
I KNOW A CARD
IN YUGI'S DECK THAT <i>CAN--</i>

00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:34.899
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:17:34.899 --> 00:17:37.669
THE MIGHTY SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON.

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:39.370
IT ALL DEPENDS
ON WHETHER OR NOT

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.639
YUGI HAS THE COURAGE
TO USE IT.

00:17:41.639 --> 00:17:44.509
Yami-Bakura:
STARE INTO THE FACE
OF DEFEAT!

00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:45.610
YOU SEE,

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.012
NOT ONLY IS
MY MONSTER STRONG...

00:17:48.012 --> 00:17:49.514
POSSESSING
MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:17:49.514 --> 00:17:50.949
THAN EITHER
OF <i>YOUR</i> MONSTERS...

00:17:50.949 --> 00:17:54.285
BUT IT ALSO POSSESSES
A DARK MAGIC HIDDEN WITHIN,

00:17:54.285 --> 00:17:56.955
WAITING TO ACTIVATE
AND DESTROY YOU!

00:17:56.955 --> 00:17:58.022
Yami-Yugi: YOUR MONSTER
MAY BE POWERFUL,

00:17:58.022 --> 00:17:59.657
BUT IT'S NOT UNBEATABLE!

00:18:00.858 --> 00:18:02.226
[THINKING]
THIS DARK NECROFEAR

00:18:02.226 --> 00:18:04.395
MUST POSSESS
INCREDIBLE POWERS

00:18:04.395 --> 00:18:07.799
IF BAKURA RISKED
LOSING THE FINALS
JUST TO SUMMON IT.

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:09.033
HE LED YUGI
THROUGH THIS DUEL

00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:10.935
LIKE A DOG ON A LEASH,

00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:13.805
AND NOW BAKURA HAS HIM
EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTS HIM.

00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:16.074
SO, WHAT WILL YOU
DO NOW, YUGI?

00:18:17.508 --> 00:18:19.110
I'M NOT READY
TO ATTACK YET,

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.280
SO I WILL END MY TURN.

00:18:23.448 --> 00:18:25.450
Yugi, thinking:
WHY DIDN'T HE ATTACK ME?

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.485
HIS MONSTER COULD
EASILY DESTROY

00:18:27.485 --> 00:18:29.153
MY MAGNET WARRIOR
OR MY GAZELLE

00:18:29.153 --> 00:18:31.356
AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGE
MY LIFE POINTS!

00:18:31.356 --> 00:18:33.491
IS HE WORRIED ABOUT
MY FACEDOWN CARD,

00:18:33.491 --> 00:18:34.993
OR IS IT
SOMETHING ELSE?

00:18:34.993 --> 00:18:35.994
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:18:35.994 --> 00:18:37.362
WHEN I'M READY!

00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:38.663
YOU WERE
FOOLISH ENOUGH
NOT TO ATTACK ME

00:18:38.663 --> 00:18:39.998
WHEN YOU
HAD THE CHANCE.

00:18:39.998 --> 00:18:41.666
NOW YOU
SHALL PAY THE PRICE!

00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:43.067
AS I DRAW...

00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:44.669
THIS!

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:45.703
Yugi, thinking:
AWESOME.

00:18:45.703 --> 00:18:47.672
THIS CARD WILL DESTROY
HIS DARK NECROFEAR,

00:18:47.672 --> 00:18:48.673
ALLOWING ME
TO WIPE OUT

00:18:48.673 --> 00:18:50.441
THE REST OF
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:18:50.441 --> 00:18:52.477
IT'S TIME
TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:18:52.477 --> 00:18:53.911
Yami-Yugi:
I SACRIFICE GAZELLE,

00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:56.180
THE KING OF
MYTHICAL BEASTS...

00:18:57.515 --> 00:19:01.185
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:19:09.093 --> 00:19:12.130
FOOL. I'M AFRAID
YOUR MAGICAL FAIRY
IS TOO WEAK

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.965
TO DESTROY MY MONSTER.

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:16.501
HA HA HA!
THAT'S TRUE.

00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:17.602
BUT APPARENTLY
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN

00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:20.004
ABOUT MY FACEDOWN
CARD.

00:19:20.004 --> 00:19:21.839
IT LOOKS LIKE
<i>YOU'RE</i> THE FOOL!

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:25.009
BEHOLD MY
MAGIC FORMULA CARD!

00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:27.879
NOOOO!

00:19:29.047 --> 00:19:30.615
YES!

00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:33.351
MAGIC FORMULA RAISES
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL'S
ATTACK POWER

00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:35.953
BY 500 POINTS...

00:19:35.953 --> 00:19:39.257
MAKING HER
MORE POWERFUL THAN
YOUR NECROFEAR!

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:40.958
YEAH! ATTABOY!

00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.227
PUT THAT BIG CREEP
6 FEET UNDER!

00:19:43.227 --> 00:19:46.230
AND NOW ATTACK
HIS NECROFEAR...

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.000
WITH DARK BURNING
ATTACK!!

00:19:52.003 --> 00:19:53.671
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:55.039
THANKS. ONCE AGAIN,

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:57.842
YOU'VE DONE EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED, YUGI.

00:19:57.842 --> 00:19:59.477
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT I'VE MANIPULATED

00:19:59.477 --> 00:20:01.979
EVERY MOVE YOU'VE MADE
SO FAR!?

00:20:01.979 --> 00:20:04.382
INCLUDING DESTROYING
DARK NECROFEAR!

00:20:04.382 --> 00:20:06.751
SO I CAN PLAY THIS!

00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:10.254
HUH?
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:12.290
WATCH AS THE ENTIRE
PLAYING FIELD

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.625
IS ENGULFED IN
A SHROUD OF DARK MAGIC

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:16.594
KNOWN AS DARK SANCTUARY.

00:20:16.594 --> 00:20:18.663
HA HA HA!

00:20:18.663 --> 00:20:21.666
HA HA HA!

00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:22.900
Joey: AAH!

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.102
IT'S THE EVIL
EYES!

00:20:24.102 --> 00:20:25.203
I DON'T LIKE THIS!

00:20:25.203 --> 00:20:27.105
Yami-Bakura:
LOOK AROUND YOU!

00:20:27.105 --> 00:20:30.408
THERE'S NO ESCAPING
THE MAGIC OF DARK SANCTUARY!

00:20:30.408 --> 00:20:31.909
WELL DONE!

00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:34.212
EVERYTHING HAD TO GO
JUST RIGHT FOR THIS TO WORK,

00:20:34.212 --> 00:20:36.347
AND YOU PLAYED YOUR PART
PERFECTLY!

00:20:36.347 --> 00:20:37.849
NOW WHAT?

00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:39.250
JUST WAIT.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.520
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE JUST
HELPED ME TO UNLEASH!

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.423
PREPARE TO EXPERIENCE
AN EVIL

00:20:45.423 --> 00:20:46.791
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE!
