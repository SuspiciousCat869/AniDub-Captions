00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.885
WHEN YOUR LIFE-POINTS
REACH ZERO,

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:15.221
THE SURFACE BELOW YOU
WILL BE DESTROYED,

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.492
OPENING UP A VORTEX
THAT LEADS DIRECTLY
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:21.761
AAH!
AAH!

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.798
AND ACCORDING TO
BATTLE CITY RULES--

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.033
<i>YOUR</i> RULES--

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.136
WHEN WE WIN, WE TAKE YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:32.505
READY?! HA HA HA!

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:33.873
HA HA HA!

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.074
HA HA HA!

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.310
LOOKS LIKE I'VE
LEFT YOU SPEECHLESS.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.412
I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR YOU TO FINISH.

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:40.913
DO I HAVE
YOUR GUARANTEE

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.249
THAT MY BROTHER'S
ALL RIGHT?

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:46.219
Lumis: YES,
BUT I WOULDN'T COUNT
ON SEEING HIM AGAIN.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.987
Umbra: ONCE YOU'RE
IN THE SHADOW REALM...

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.422
THERE ARE NOVISITORS!

00:14:49.422 --> 00:14:51.691
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:53.326
IT LOOKS AS IF
YOU'VE JUST MADE

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:55.995
YOUR SECOND MISTAKE
TODAY, RARE HUNTER.

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:58.097
THE FIRST WAS
KIDNAPPING MY BROTHER,

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:00.333
AND THE SECOND
WAS CHALLENGING ME!

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:02.168
Lumis: WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT, KAIBA!

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:04.103
[BEEP]

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:06.539
AND I <i>WILL</i> RESCUE
MY FRIENDS!

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:07.673
VERY TOUCHING.

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:09.876
BUT WE DUEL
FOR OUR MASTER, MARIK,

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.611
AND LOSING
IS NOT AN OPTION!

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:13.546
OUR DECKS WERE
SPECIALLY ASSEMBLED

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:15.915
TO TAKE DOWN
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.483
AND THAT'S
JUST WHAT WE'LL DO!

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.919
AND ONCE WE DELIVER THEM
TO MASTER MARIK,

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.889
HE'LL POSSESS ALL THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:23.890
Lumis: IN THE MEANTIME,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.358
YOU'LL BE SPENDING
ALL OF ETERNITY

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.859
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.762
SO IF YOU'RE READY,
LET'S DUEL!

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:36.903
Lumis: ARE YOU READY
TO DUEL?!

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:39.005
I TRUST YOU KNOW
THE RULES.

00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:42.341
YES. THIS DUEL
IS TWO AGAINST TWO.

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.143
EACH PLAYER TAKES
A SEPARATE TURN,

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.779
BUT PLAYERS
ON THE SAME TEAM
MUST WORK TOGETHER

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.948
TO DEFEAT
THE OPPOSINGTEAM.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.349
AND I'LL BEGIN!

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.951
VERY WELL,
RARE HUNTER.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.120
I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.988
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.191
MAKE YOUR MOVE
IF YOU DARE.

00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:00.993
IT'LL ONLY BRING YOU CLOSER
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.395
WRONG!

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:07.567
I'LL SUMMON BETA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:09.802
MY MONSTER WILL PROTECT
MY LIFE-POINTS

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.038
FROM YOUR ATTACKS,
RARE HUNTERS!

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.907
Yugi, thinking:
NO ONE CAN ATTACK

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:17.443
UNTIL EACH DUELIST
HAS DRAWN AT LEAST ONCE.

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:20.413
HOPEFULLY BY THEN,
I CAN PICK UP ON THEIR STRATEGY.

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:22.849
OBSERVE!

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:27.153
I SUMMON SHINING ABYSS
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.421
HA HA HA!

00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:31.190
NOW IT'S TIME TO SHOW YOU
HOW WE DUEL TOGETHER.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.125
A TEAM STRATEGY!!

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.460
THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI!

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.029
ACTIVATE MASK
OF BRUTALITY!

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:39.432
THANK YOU, LUMIS.

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:42.435
YOUR MASK
WILL BE A PERFECT FIT
FOR MY MONSTER!

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.979
Lumis: NOT ONLY THAT, UMBRA,

00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:55.014
BUT IT WILL BOOST
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK POWER

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.415
BY A THOUSANDPOINTS!

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:59.418
WHAT? THESE RARE HUNTERS
ALREADY HAVE A MONSTER
ON THE FIELD

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.821
WITH TWENTY SIX HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.823
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND IT WILL STAY
THAT WAY

00:17:03.823 --> 00:17:06.259
AS LONG
AS WE EACH GIVE UP
1,000 LIFE-POINTS

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:09.795
FOR EVERY TURN
WE PLAN TO USE
MASK OF BRUTALITY.

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.764
AHH, BUT NOW
WE WON'T HAVE TO!

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:12.865
OBSERVE

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:16.469
AS I ACTIVATE A MAGIC CARD
CALLED MASKED DOLL!

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.976
MY MASKED DOLL WILL ABSORB
ANY AND ALL NEGATIVE EFFECTS

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.912
CAUSED BY MY MAGIC CARD.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:28.047
HEH HEH HEH! NICE WORK.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.316
NOW OUR LIFE-POINTS
WILL REMAIN UNTOUCHED

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.184
BY OUR MASK
OF BRUTALITY!

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:33.953
YOU FOOLS
ARE NO MATCH FOR US!

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:35.922
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.891
AND OUR TAG-TEAM STRATEGY
WILL DESTROY YOU!

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.259
I DOUBT IT.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.261
<i>WE</i> CAN PLAY
OFF THE STRENGTHS
OF EACH OTHER'S CARDS

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.264
AND WORK AS A TEAM
AS WELL AS YOU CAN,
RARE HUNTERS!

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:46.699
HMM. NO, THANKS.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:47.700
HUH?

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.502
TEAMWORK
IS FOR BOY SCOUTS

00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:51.470
AND NURSERY SCHOOLS,
YUGI.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.805
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.173
LET'S GET ONE THING
STRAIGHT:

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.207
I CAN WIN THIS DUEL

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.743
AND SAVE MY BROTHER
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.078
I'M THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DUELIST,

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.880
AND WHEN I WIN
THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.248
I'LL PROVE IT.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.183
AND NOW, STAND BACK!

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.184
[GRUNTS]

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:08.287
I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN...

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.724
AND THEN...

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:15.127
I'LL SUMMON VORSE RAIDER,
THE MAN-BEAST.

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:19.665
[GROWL]

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:22.535
AND I PLACE MY MONSTER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:26.138
Yugi, thinking:
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.740
HIS MONSTER IS WEAKER
THAN THEIRS.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.409
AND IF WE DON'T
HAVE A TEAM STRATEGY,
WE'LL NEVER WIN!

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.577
Kaiba, thinking:
EXCELLENT.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:34.880
I'VE GOT AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL
MONSTER READY TO GO.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.183
NEXT TURN I'LL SACRIFICE
MY VORSE RAIDER

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.851
AND SUMMON IT TO THE FIELD.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.052
TEAMWORK.

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.488
WELL, WE'VE EACH
TAKEN ONE TURN.

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:45.458
NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE
WHOSE STRATEGY IS SUPERIOR.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.827
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THE ANSWER
TO THAT IS OBVIOUS.

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:48.961
Lumis: I AGREE.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.630
DUE TO OUR TEAM STRATEGY,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.299
WEHAVE THE MOST POWERFUL
MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.369
MIGHT I REMIND YOU OUR DECKS
WERE SPECIFICALLY CREATED

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:59.672
TO WORK TOGETHER
TO DEFEAT YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:02.608
Yami-Yugi: THIS DUEL
HAS JUST BEGUN,
RARE HUNTERS!

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:03.709
Yugi, thinking:
WE HAFTA WIN!

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:05.745
THE SAFETY OF MY FRIENDS
DEPENDS ON IT!

00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:07.947
BUT UNLESS KAIBA AGREES
TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM,

00:19:07.947 --> 00:19:08.981
WE'RE DOOMED!

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.050
IF HE KEEPS UP
THIS SELFISH ATTITUDE,

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.118
WE'LL LOSE THIS DUEL

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:14.387
AND BE TRANSPORTED
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:17.323
AND MARIK WILL HAVE
ALL THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.225
PLUS, WHO KNOWS WHAT
WILL HAPPEN TO THE GANG

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:20.926
UNDER MARIK'S CONTROL.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:23.162
WE'VE GOT TO DEFEAT
THESE RARE HUNTERS.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:26.999
