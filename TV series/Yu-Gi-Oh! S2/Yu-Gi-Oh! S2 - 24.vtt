Mokuba: COME ON,
LET'S GO, TEA!

00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:06.563
NOW'S THE CHANCE!

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:07.631
Tea: I'LL STAY!

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:09.599
YOU GO AND FIND YOUR
BROTHER AND YUGI!

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.034
HEY, YOU!

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:13.303
GO!
I'M GOING!

00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:14.971
Man: RISE AND SHINE.

00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:16.406
HEY!

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.241
KEEP YOUR GRUBBY PAWS
OFF OF ME, WILL YOU!

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.745
IF YOU TOUCH ME,
YOU'LL BE SORRY!

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:25.081
WITH JOEY WHEELER

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.451
LITTLE YUGI'S EGYPTIAN GOD
CARD IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

KAIBA AND I MAKE
A POWERFUL TEAM,

00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:32.489
AND YOU TWO RARE
HUNTERS ARE NO MATCH

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.724
FOR THE COMBINED
STRENGTH OF OUR DECKS!

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:38.195
I SUMMON
DES GARDIUS!

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:40.597
AND NOW THAT DES GARDIUS
HAS BEEN UNLEASHED...

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:41.898
THERE'S NO STOPPING IT!

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:44.668
SO, FORGET ABOUT
RESCUING YOUR FRIENDS...

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:50.140

TO FEEL THE FURY OF
MY ULTIMATE CREATURE,

DES GARDIUS,
BUT WHICH ONE?

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:58.241
IF I ATTACK YOU, YUGI,

00:01:58.241 --> 00:01:59.376
MY BEAST WILL WIPE OUT

THE REST OF YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:02.479
AND IF I CHOOSE YOU, KAIBA,

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.980
YOUR BLUE EYES WILL BE A MEAL

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.082

WHEN YOUR LIFE
POINTS REACH ZERO.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:13.089
YOUR SHADOW BOX WILL DESTROY
THE SURFACE BELOW YOU

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.424
AND SEND YOU
PLUNGING INTO

00:02:14.424 --> 00:02:16.826

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.628

RARE HUNTERS

00:02:20.163 --> 00:02:22.198
AND SERVE
MASTER MARIK!

00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:24.801
NOW THE TIME HAS COME
FOR ME TO DECIDE

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:26.803
WHICH ONE OF YOU
PATHETIC NITWITS

00:02:26.803 --> 00:02:28.638
TO ATTACK WITH
DES GARDIUS!

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:30.073
WHO WILL IT BE?

00:02:30.073 --> 00:02:31.808
DO YOU GIVE UP?

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:35.245
I CHOOSE YOU,
YUGI MOTO!

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:36.579
WAIT!

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.348
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE A TEAM, LUMIS!

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:40.984
THAT MEANS WE BOTH GET
A SAY IN THIS DECISION!

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.853
WHILE I AGREE WE
HAVE TO DESTROY YUGI,

00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:46.556
LEAVING KAIBA'S BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON ON THE FIELD

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.458
WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY
FOOLISH MISTAKE!

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:51.361
NO! IT'S MY MOVE,
AND I CHOOSE YUGI!

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.330
Kaiba: I KNEW IT!

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.332
I WAS WONDERING
WHETHER YOU WOULD

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:58.034
HAVE THE GUTS TO CHALLENGE
MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:59.202
AND NOW I KNOW.

00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:00.637
KNOW WHAT?

00:03:00.637 --> 00:03:02.806
THAT YOU'RE ALL
TALK AND NO ACTION.

00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:05.942
ONLY A COWARD WOULD
TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT,

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:07.744
INSTEAD OF FLEXING
HIS MUSCLES

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:10.447
AND ATTACKING
MY MONSTER.

00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:12.982
[THINKING] KAIBA MUST
BE TRYING TO SAVE ME.

00:03:12.982 --> 00:03:14.384
HE KNOWS
WITHOUT MY HELP

00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:16.252
HE'LL LOSE THIS
DUEL FOR SURE!

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:18.455
[THINKING] MAYBE
KAIBA'S RIGHT.

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:20.657
ATTACKING YUGI FIRST
COULD BE A MISTAKE.

00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:22.192
HIS MONSTERS ARE WEAK,

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:24.194
AND I CAN DESTROY
THEM AT ANY TIME.

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:26.996
WHY WASTE MY CREATURE'S
FIRST ATTACK?

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:29.099
[ALOUD] ALL RIGHT, THERE'S
BEEN A CHANGE IN PLANS!

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.268
DES GARDIUS, DESTROY
KAIBA'S BLUE EYES!

00:03:37.173 --> 00:03:39.142
[LAUGHING]

00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:41.144
GUESS YOU WERE
WRONG, KAIBA!

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:45.582
NO ONE CALLS ME A COWARD
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!

00:03:45.582 --> 00:03:48.752
[THINKING] YUGI BETTER NOT
MAKE ME REGRET SAVING HIM!

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:50.854
DESTROY THEM, YUGI!

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:52.389
YES!

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.058
Umbra: REMEMBER, THANKS
TO MASK OF THE ACCURSED

00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:56.259
AND MASK OF DISPEL

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.428
YOU LOSE ANOTHER
1,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:02.198
FINE, THIS DUEL IS
ALMOST OVER ANYWAY!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.936
YOU'LL REGRET NOT
ATTACKING ME!

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:10.206
WHEN I PLAY THE CARD IN
MY HAND AND DESTROY YOU!

00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:11.975
WHAT? IT CAN'T BE!

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.677
ATTACKING BLUE-EYES
WAS A BIG MISTAKE

00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:16.012
'CAUSE NOW YUGI
HAS SOMETHING

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:17.847
EVEN WORSE IN
STORE FOR YOU!

00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:19.149
IT'S A LIE!

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.317
YOU CAN'T SUMMON
HIGH POWER MONSTERS

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:22.852
BECAUSE OF OUR
TRAP CARD.

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.854
YOUR TRAP CARD
ONLY PREVENTS US

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:26.423
FROM SACRIFICING...

00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:28.258
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY WAY

00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:30.427
TO SUMMON POWERFUL
MONSTERS, UMBRA!

00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:32.262
SO, I PLAY THIS!

00:04:32.262 --> 00:04:34.964
GAMMA, THE MAGNET
WARRIOR!

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:37.801
AND NOW THAT I HAVE

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.937
3 MAGNET WARRIORS ON
THE FIELD AT THE SAME TIME

00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:44.073
I CAN ACTIVATE
THEIR SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:04:44.073 --> 00:04:45.442
MONSTER TRANSFORM!

00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:47.911
Both: TRANSFORM? WHAT?

00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:48.978
Yugi: YES!

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.314
ALL 3 CREATURES
WILL NOW TRANSFORM

00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:53.416
INTO ONE MIGHTY WARRIOR

00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:55.452
WITH TRIPLE
THE ATTACK STRENGTH!

00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:06.696
WHAT IS THAT?

00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:10.633
Yugi: BEHOLD VALKYRION,
THE MAGNA WARRIOR!

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:12.569
CONSIDER THIS
ATTACK PAYBACK

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.704
FOR DESTROYING MY
BLUE EYES, LUMIS!

00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:16.239
FINE, KAIBA!

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.241
Kaiba: YUGI'S
VALKYRION HAS

00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:21.244
200 MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN YOUR DES GARDIUS!

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:23.413
SO, WITH ONE SWING
OF IT'S SWORD

00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:26.583
IT CAN COMPLETELY
ANNIHILATE YOUR
MASKED BEAST!

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:28.251
TOUGH BREAK, LUMIS!

00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:29.619
YUGI!

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.087
IT'S TIME TO
TAKE OUR REVENGE

00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:32.922
FOR MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:05:32.922 --> 00:05:35.024
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:37.393
I'VE BEEN PATIENT
LONG ENOUGH!

00:05:37.393 --> 00:05:39.429
STOP STALLING
AND ATTACK THEM!

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:41.331
NOW PROVE YOU'RE
NOT SCARED

00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:42.632
AND AVENGE
THE DESTRUCTION

00:05:42.632 --> 00:05:45.101
OF MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:46.903
[THINKING] IT'S TRUE THAT
IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE,

00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:48.771
MY MAGNA WARRIOR
COULD EASILY DEFEAT

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:49.839
THEIR DES GARDIUS.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.174
AND THEY DON'T
SEEM TO HAVE

00:05:51.174 --> 00:05:53.510
ANY HIDDEN TRAP
CARDS ON THE FIELD...

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.646
BUT LUMIS AND UMBRA DON'T
SEEM NERVOUS AT ALL!

00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:57.647
Kaiba:
DO IT, YUGI!

00:05:57.647 --> 00:06:00.250
DESTROY THEIR
MONSTER NOW!

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.118
Lumis: GO AHEAD,
YUGI, MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:06:02.118 --> 00:06:04.587
[THINKING] COULD THEIR
MASKED MONSTER DES GARDIUS

00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:05.855
HAVE A HIDDEN ABILITY

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:07.557
THAT MIGHT
BLOCK MY ATTACK?

00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:10.059
[THINKING] AS SOON AS THAT
FOOL ATTACKS MY MONSTER,

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.761
HE'LL BE IN
FOR A SURPRISE...

00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:15.331
AND A ONE-WAY TRIP TO
THE DREADED SHADOW REALM!

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:21.330
Kaiba: MAKE
YOUR MOVE, YUGI!

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.332
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR!?

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:25.567
I GAVE UP MY
BLUE EYES FOR YOU,

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.302
AND LET YOU SUMMON
YOUR MONSTER,

00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:28.604
AND THIS IS
THE THANKS I GET?

00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:30.305
NOW, DESTROY
THEIR MONSTER

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.341
SO I CAN MOVE
ONE STEP CLOSER

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:34.042
TO FINDING MY
LITTLE BROTHER!

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:36.778
AND DO IT RIGHT NOW
OR YOU'LL BE SORRY!

00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:40.949
Yugi: I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:06:42.451 --> 00:06:45.487
KAIBA, IF YOU EVER WANT
TO SEE MOKUBA AGAIN,

00:06:45.487 --> 00:06:47.389
WE HAVE TO DUEL
INTELLIGENTLY!

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.858
ANGER WILL ONLY
CLOUD YOUR REASON!

00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:51.026
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:06:51.026 --> 00:06:53.662
YOU MUST TRY TO PUT
YOUR FRUSTRATION ASIDE

00:06:53.662 --> 00:06:55.631
AND TRUST IN THE HEART
OF THE CARDS.

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:56.765
UNLESS YOU DO,

00:06:56.765 --> 00:06:58.166
YOU'LL BE PLAYING
RIGHT INTO THE HANDS

00:06:58.166 --> 00:06:59.401
OF THE RARE HUNTERS!

00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:00.969
THAT'S NONSENSE!

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.738
WE HAVE TO
CRUSH THEM NOW!

00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:04.640
YOU'RE LOSING
FOCUS, KAIBA!

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.174
IF YOU WANT TO WIN,

00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:07.676
YOU MUST BELIEVE
IN YOUR DECK.

00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:09.444
[THINKING] HEART
OF THE CARDS--

00:07:09.444 --> 00:07:10.679
WHO NEEDS IT!?

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:12.581
THE ONLY WAY TO
WIN THIS DUEL

00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:14.683
IS TO PLAY MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:16.518
OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR!

00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:17.719
BUT IN ORDER
TO SUMMON IT

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:20.455
I NEED TO SACRIFICE
3 MONSTERS...

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:23.592
AND AS LONG AS THEIR
MASK OF RESTRICT IS IN PLAY,

00:07:23.592 --> 00:07:26.828
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
SACRIFICE ANYTHING--

00:07:26.828 --> 00:07:28.130
THAT'S IT!

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.831
ITS RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME!

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:32.301
A WAY TO SUMMON MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.636
EVEN WITH THEIR
MASK ON THE FIELD!

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:36.471
BUT IT CAN ONLY
WORK IF YUGI'S

00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.707
WILLING TO GIVE
UP HIS MONSTER

00:07:38.707 --> 00:07:41.810
I GAVE UP MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON TO HELP HIM,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.146
SO IT'S ONLY FAIR
HE MAKES A SACRIFICE.

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:47.115
I DON'T LIKE DEPENDING
ON ANYONE BUT MYSELF,

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:48.517
BUT I'LL DO WHAT
I HAVE TO DO

00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:50.986
TO SAVE MY BROTHER!

00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:53.121
YUGI, WE CAN WIN.

00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:55.157
RIGHT.

00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:58.126
VALKYRION
THE MAGNA WARRIOR,

00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:00.562
ATTACK THEIR
MONSTER NOW!

00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:05.000
HE TOOK MY BAIT,
AND NOW HE'LL REGRET IT!

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.902
[GROANS]

00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:10.806
IT'S GONE.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:13.008
Lumis: YOU MAY HAVE
DESTROYED MY BEAST, YUGI!

00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:16.345
BUT YOU'VE ALSO ACTIVATED
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:18.246
WHAT SPECIAL
ABILITY?

00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:20.916
WHEN DES GARDIUS IS
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:22.784
IT LEAVES BEHIND 3 MASKS,

00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:26.188
WHICH COMBINE TO FORM A NEW,
MORE POWERFUL MASK--

00:08:26.188 --> 00:08:28.323
THE MASK OF REMNANTS!

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:31.893
[LAUGHS]

00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:34.029
AS REVENGE FOR YOUR ATTACK,

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:35.931
THIS MASK ALLOWS
ME TO CONTROL

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.633
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
AS IF IT WERE MY OWN!

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:40.902
AND SINCE YOU ONLY
HAVE ONE MONSTER,

00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:43.338
IT'S A GOOD THING
ITS ONE SIZE FITS ALL!

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:51.913
[LAUGHS]

00:08:51.913 --> 00:08:55.584
VALKYRION THE MAGNA WARRIOR
BELONGS TO ME NOW,

00:08:55.584 --> 00:08:57.119
AND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE!

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:59.521
EXCELLENT WORK!
THANK YOU!

00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:01.356
YOU'RE THROUGH,
YUGI!

00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:02.724
YOUR DEFENSES
ARE GONE

00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:04.259
AND THE SHADOW
REALM AWAITS!

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:06.828
DESTROY YUGI ON
THIS TURN, UMBRA,

00:09:06.828 --> 00:09:09.064
THEN I'LL TAKE
OUT KAIBA MYSELF.

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:10.165
WITH PLEASURE.

00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:11.833
I'LL MAKE SURE KAIBA

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.569
NEVER SEES HIS RUNT
OF A BROTHER AGAIN

00:09:14.569 --> 00:09:17.873
WHEN I SEND HIM TO JOIN
YUGI IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:19.441
LET'S DO IT.

00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:20.809
PERFECT!

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:22.177
FAREWELL, YUGI.

00:09:23.678 --> 00:09:25.747
I ACTIVATE
MASQUERADE!

00:09:28.216 --> 00:09:30.085
WITH THIS MAGIC
CARD IN PLAY,

00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:32.454
I'M ABLE TO CONTROL
ONE OF LUMIS' MONSTERS

00:09:32.454 --> 00:09:33.889
AS IF IT WERE
MY MONSTER!

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:36.358
SO, MY MAGNA WARRIOR,

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:39.961
ATTACK AND DESTROY YOUR
FORMER MASTER, YUGI!

00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.163
Both: GOOD-BYE!

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:42.998
DON'T CELEBRATE
JUST YET.

00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:43.999
HUH?

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.636
REVEAL MY FACE
DOWN CARD!

00:09:47.636 --> 00:09:48.703
DIFFUSION!

00:09:48.703 --> 00:09:49.838
IT WILL BREAK DOWN
YOUR MONSTER

00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:51.673
INTO ITS
3 SEPARATE PARTS

00:09:51.673 --> 00:09:52.908
AND DESTROY
YOUR MASK!

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:54.109
OH, NO!

00:09:54.109 --> 00:09:55.343
OUR ATTACK
JUST FAILED!

00:09:55.343 --> 00:09:57.012
ARE YOU SHOCKED?

00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:58.480
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE NO MATCH

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.049
FOR OUR COMBINED
SKILLS, RARE HUNTERS!

00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:03.985
IT'S MY TURN.

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:06.054
BEHOLD MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:10:06.054 --> 00:10:07.389
NOT QUITE!

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:09.791
AS LONG AS MY
MASK OF RESTRICT
IS IN EFFECT

00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:11.059
YOU CAN'T
SUMMON IT!

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:13.695
YOU WOULD HAVE TO
SACRIFICE 3 MONSTERS

00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:15.130
AND MY MASK
PREVENTS THAT!

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.531
Kaiba: WRONG!

00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:20.101
YOUR MASK ONLY STOPS ME FROM
SACRIFICING MY OWN MONSTERS.

00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:21.970
BUT I PLAN TO SACRIFICE

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.941
YOUR MONSTERS INSTEAD,
LUMIS, WITH THIS CARD!

00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:29.277
NOW I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
SOUL EXCHANGE,

00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:32.214
WHICH LET ME SACRIFICE
YOUR 3 MAGNET WARRIORS!

00:10:34.282 --> 00:10:36.351
DON'T LET THEM
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:39.254
DO SOMETHING, LUMIS!

00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:40.856
WE'RE FINISHED!

00:10:40.856 --> 00:10:43.325
IF KAIBA SUMMONS
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,

00:10:43.325 --> 00:10:45.527
WE'LL HAVE NO HOPE
OF WINNING THIS DUEL!

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:46.828
WE MUST STOP HIM

00:10:46.828 --> 00:10:48.864
OR MARIK WILL
BE FURIOUS!

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.765
[BOOM]

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.806
I WARNED YOU
TWO CLOWNS!

00:10:57.806 --> 00:10:59.708
[SCREAMS]

00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:06.848
THIS IS FOR MY
LITTLE BROTHER!

00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:10.952
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:11:10.952 --> 00:11:14.222
WINING MY EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD THIS ENTIRE DUEL!

00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:17.559
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO EXPERIENCE ITS POWER!

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.461
[LAUGHS]

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:22.397
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,

00:11:22.397 --> 00:11:25.500
ARISE AND WREAK
YOUR ULTIMATE REVENGE!

00:11:32.798 --> 00:11:36.002
Kaiba: ITS PAYBACK TIME
FOR KIDNAPPING MOKUBA!

00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:39.472
SO, PREPARE TO FEEL
A FORCE LIKE NO OTHER!

00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:41.941
AND NOW IT'S TIME!

00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:45.378
OBELISK, ATTACK UMBRA'S
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:11:45.378 --> 00:11:47.213
[SCREAMING]

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:53.920
[GASPS]

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.054
UMBRA! NO!

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:05.031
[GROANING]

00:12:05.031 --> 00:12:06.699
HEY, UMBRA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:08.134
HE'S FINE FOR NOW,

00:12:08.134 --> 00:12:09.969
BUT THANKS TO MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:12:09.969 --> 00:12:11.737
HIS LIFE POINTS
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

00:12:11.737 --> 00:12:14.106
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'VE FALLEN VICTIM

00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:16.008
TO YOUR OWN TRAP,
RARE HUNTERS!

00:12:16.008 --> 00:12:17.210
[BOTH GASP]

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.178
WHEN MY LIFE POINT
COUNTER REACHES ZERO,

00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:20.446
I'LL PLUNGE INTO
THE SHADOW REALM!

00:12:22.915 --> 00:12:24.584
NO!
UMBRA!

00:12:24.584 --> 00:12:26.485
[SCREAMING]

00:12:39.765 --> 00:12:42.835
UMBRA, COME BACK,
PLEASE!

00:12:42.835 --> 00:12:44.937
YOU CAN'T
LEAVE ME HERE!

00:12:44.937 --> 00:12:46.906
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

00:12:46.906 --> 00:12:49.909
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DUELING
ALONE NOW, DOESN'T IT?

00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:53.512
THE ODDS ARE CERTAINLY
AGAINST YOU, LUMIS.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:56.682
AND YOU'RE POWERLESS AGAINST
OUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:12:56.682 --> 00:12:59.685
IF YOU WANT TO AVOID
ANY FURTHER DANGER,

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:01.354
THEN YOU HAD
BETTER SURRENDER!

00:13:03.623 --> 00:13:05.658
DON'T LET HIM
OFF THE HOOK YET,

00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:07.960
MY MONSTER IS JUST
GETTING WARMED UP...

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.296
AND LUMIS NEEDS TO PAY
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE!

00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:12.898
HE DISRESPECTED
MY FAMILY!

00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:14.300
STOP, KAIBA!

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.802
REVENGE ISN'T GOING TO
HELP YOU FIND MOKUBA!

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:19.305
PERHAPS IF WE ALLOW
HIM TO SURRENDER

00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:21.841
HE'LL TELL US WHERE
THEY'RE HIDING THE PRISONERS.

00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:23.876
YUGI, WISE UP!

00:13:23.876 --> 00:13:25.711
WE MUST DESTROY
HIM RIGHT NOW!

00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:27.313
[SCREAMS]

00:13:27.313 --> 00:13:28.714
NO, MASTER!

00:13:28.714 --> 00:13:30.116
PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY!

00:13:30.116 --> 00:13:31.617
WE TRIED OUR BEST!

00:13:31.617 --> 00:13:33.119
WHAT NOW?

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:34.620
MASTER,
PLEASE DON'T...

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.923
NO, MARIK,
I'M SORRY!

00:13:37.923 --> 00:13:39.225
[SCREAMS]

00:13:39.225 --> 00:13:42.194
[LAUGHS]

00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:45.298
I SEE THAT YOU HAVE
DEFEATED MY RARE HUNTERS.

00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:46.699
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:48.134
THEY DID THEIR JOB.

00:13:48.134 --> 00:13:51.003
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY FRIENDS, MARIK?!

00:13:51.003 --> 00:13:52.505
[LAUGHS]

00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:55.041
THIS RARE HUNTER'S
GONE MAD.

00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:56.075
NO.

00:13:56.075 --> 00:13:57.810
THIS RARE HUNTER
IS UNDER THE CONTROL

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.412
OF A MAN NAMED MARIK!

00:13:59.412 --> 00:14:01.480
THAT IS
RIDICULOUS, YUGI!

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.183
MARIK'S POWER
IS VERY REAL!

00:14:04.183 --> 00:14:06.986
AND HE'S THE ONE
HOLDING MOKUBA CAPTIVE.

00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:09.522
WELL, TELL ME WHERE
THIS SO-CALLED
MARIK IS HIDING!

00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:11.490
[LAUGHS]

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.659
WOULDN'T YOU
LIKE TO KNOW, KAIBA!

00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:15.661
WELL, I'LL GIVE
YOU A HINT.

00:14:15.661 --> 00:14:18.597
I'M CLOSER THAN
YOU THINK I AM!

00:14:18.597 --> 00:14:20.966
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED
THE SPECIAL DUEL

00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:22.301
I SET UP FOR YOU.

00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:24.270
YOU FARED BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.671
BUT DON'T THINK
JUST BECAUSE

00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:27.139
YOU BEAT MY
RARE HUNTERS

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:29.342
THAT YOU'LL BE RESCUING
YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY

00:14:29.342 --> 00:14:30.943
ANYTIME SOON.

00:14:30.943 --> 00:14:32.945
YOU SEE, I'VE
BEEN PREPARING

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:35.214
FOR THE NEXT
PHASE OF MY PLAN.

00:14:35.214 --> 00:14:37.650
AND I'VE BEEN STUDYING
EACH OF YOUR DECKS

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.386
THROUGH THE EYES
OF MY RARE HUNTERS.

00:14:40.386 --> 00:14:43.289
AS FOR YOUR EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD, KAIBA,

00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:44.990
OBELISK PALES
IN COMPARISON

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.193
TO MY WINGED DRAGON
OF RA CARD!

00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:49.729
I'M AFRAID THERE'S
NO WAY IT CAN STOP ME.

00:14:49.729 --> 00:14:51.731
AND ONCE I DEFEAT YOU,

00:14:51.731 --> 00:14:53.499
OBELISK WILL BE
IN MY DECK!

00:14:53.499 --> 00:14:56.001
AND I HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN YOU, YUGI.

00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:57.670
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.939
AND MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
WILL BE MINE AS WELL!

00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:02.341
AND SINCE MY
RARE HUNTERS FAILED,

00:15:02.341 --> 00:15:04.043
I'VE COME UP WITH
THE PERFECT PLAN

00:15:04.043 --> 00:15:05.644
TO DEFEAT YOU ONCE
AND FOR ALL!

00:15:05.644 --> 00:15:08.781
BY PLAYING UPON
YOUR GREATEST WEAKNESS--

00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:11.550
YOUR LOYALTY TO YOUR
PATHETIC FRIENDS.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.651
DON'T WORRY;

00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:14.820
THEY'RE SAFE AND SOUND
RIGHT HERE WITH ME.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.023
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
ON YOUR SIDE ANYMORE.

00:15:18.023 --> 00:15:19.925
IT SEEMS THEIR ALLEGIANCE
NOW LIES WITH ME!

00:15:19.925 --> 00:15:23.629
IT'S FUNNY HOW OUR FRIENDS
ARE SO QUICK TO TURN.

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:25.564
I'M THE ONE YOU
WANT, MARIK,

00:15:25.564 --> 00:15:26.999
SO LEAVE MY
FRIENDS ALONE!

00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:28.167
TOO LATE!

00:15:28.167 --> 00:15:30.669
I'M AFRAID THOSE FOOLS
BELONG TO ME NOW, YUGI!

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:32.671
YOU'RE A COWARD.

00:15:32.671 --> 00:15:34.573
WHY DON'T YOU
FACE ME ALREADY

00:15:34.573 --> 00:15:37.576
INSTEAD OF HIDING
BEHIND YOUR MIND SLAVES?

00:15:37.576 --> 00:15:40.780
BUT CONTROLLING PEOPLES'
MINDS IS SO MUCH MORE FUN!

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.748
AND THANKS TO
MY MILLENNIUM ROD,

00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:46.085
YUGI'S CLOSEST FRIENDS ARE
ALREADY MY MIND SLAVES!

00:15:46.085 --> 00:15:47.920
ONCE I TURN THEM
AGAINST HIM,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.090
YUGI WILL SURRENDER
EVERYTHING HE HAS TO ME!

00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:58.192
LEAVE MY FRIENDS
ALONE, MARIK!

00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.960
AND TELL ME
WHERE THEY ARE!

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.962
Kaiba: LOOK, I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE...

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.765
BUT YOU BETTER TELL
ME WHERE MOKUBA IS!

00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:06.433
I WON THIS BATTLE...

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.102
SO RELEASE MY
LITTLE BROTHER

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:10.571
JUST LIKE YOU SAID
YOU WOULD RIGHT NOW!

00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:12.039
YOU TRUST ME?

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:13.674
WHAT A FOOL!

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:15.009
LET HIM GO!!

00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:16.210
Yugi: STOP!

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.578
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR ENERGY, KAIBA.

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:19.246
HE OBVIOUSLY
HAS NO INTENSION

00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:21.348
OF HELPING US FIND
MOKUBA AND THE OTHERS.

00:16:21.348 --> 00:16:23.884
VERY PERCEPTIVE!

00:16:23.884 --> 00:16:25.786
[LAUGHING]

00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:28.756
HE'S GONE.

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.224
ALL RIGHT THEN...

00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:31.325
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.560
TRACK THEM DOWN
ON OUR OWN, KAIBA.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.763
MAYBE YOUR SATELLITE
SYSTEM CAN HELP.

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:38.198
LOOK, YUGI,
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:41.135
I THINK THIS RARE HUNTER
OWES US SOMETHING.

00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:48.275
THIS WAS AN OFFICIAL
BATTLE CITY DUEL.

00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:49.944
THAT MEANS
THE LOSERS HAVE TO

00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:52.713
GIVE UP ONE LOCATOR CARD
EACH TO THE WINNERS.

00:16:52.713 --> 00:16:54.815
THERE'S ONE FOR
EACH OF US.

00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:57.418
THAT MEANS WE
BOTH HAVE 6.

00:16:57.418 --> 00:16:59.119
WE'RE EACH
GUARANTEED A SPOT

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.155
IN THE BATTLE CITY
FINALS NOW.

00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:02.856
KAIBA, HOW CAN
YOU BEGIN TO

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:03.891
THINK ABOUT
THE TOURNAMENT

00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:05.859
AFTER WHAT
MARIK JUST SAID?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.661
WE HAVE TO
FIND MY FRIENDS

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:10.798
AND YOUR BROTHER
RIGHT NOW!

00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:12.833
I'M WELL AWARE
OF THAT, YUGI!

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:14.868
THEN HELP ME
THINK OF A PLAN!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.003
EVERY SECOND COUNTS!

00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:16.971
HUH?

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.544
Yugi: ISN'T THAT ONE OF
YOUR HELICOPTERS, KAIBA?

00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.346
IT'S ME!

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:26.780
IT'S MOKUBA!

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.615
HE ESCAPED!

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:34.455
TELL ME, ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:17:34.455 --> 00:17:36.623
MM-HMM, BUT I HAD
TO LEAVE TEA BEHIND.

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:38.258
IS TEA OK?

00:17:38.258 --> 00:17:40.361
AND WHAT ABOUT
JOEY AND TRISTAN?

00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:43.330
WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT JOEY OR TRISTAN,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.366
BUT UP UNTIL
SHE HELPED ME ESCAPE

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.768
FROM THE RARE HUNTERS,
TEA WAS DOING ALL RIGHT.

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:49.169
WE GOTTA
GO BACK THERE!

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:51.071
GET IN
THE CHOPPER, NOW.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.639
SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR FRIEND TEA

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:53.907
SAVED MOKUBA'S LIFE,

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.709
AND AS MUCH AS I
HATE GETTING INVOLVED,

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.945
I HATE OWING SOMEONE
A FAVOR EVEN MORE.

00:17:57.945 --> 00:17:59.613
THANK YOU.

00:17:59.613 --> 00:18:01.682
IT'S FINALLY HERE.

00:18:01.682 --> 00:18:02.883
Woman over P.A.:
THIS IS JEFFERSON STATION.

00:18:02.883 --> 00:18:06.954
TAKE ALL OF YOUR BELONGINGS
AND WATCH YOUR STEP.

00:18:06.954 --> 00:18:09.490
I NEED SOMETHING
TO GO, QUICKLY, PLEASE!

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.392
IT'LL HELP IF YOU TELL
ME WHAT YOU'D LIKE!

00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:14.061
UMM, I DON'T KNOW, JUST
GIVE ME ONE OF EVERYTHING!

00:18:14.061 --> 00:18:15.129
WHA?

00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:16.730
COME ON, LESS YAKKING
AND MORE PACKING,

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.831
I GOT A TRAIN
TO CATCH!

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:20.300
Woman over P.A.: ALL ABOARD!

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.137
STEP IN AND STAND CLEAR
OF THE CLOSING DOORS.

00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:26.240
NEXT STOP: TOWN OF DOMINO!"

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.108
OH, NO,
WHERE'S TRISTAN?

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.843
I HOPE HE DIDN'T
MISS THE TRAIN!

00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:31.745
GUESS WHOSE BACK?

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:32.813
HOPE YOU LIKE FOOD,

00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:34.348
'CAUSE I JUST
BROUGHT BACK PLENTY!

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:36.617
HOW 'BOUT A CHEESEBURGER
AND FRENCH FRIES?

00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:38.185
COME ON,
BURRITO SUPREME?

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:39.253
MACARONI AND CHEESE?

00:18:39.253 --> 00:18:40.387
SUSHI? WHAT?

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.024
[BURPS]

00:18:44.024 --> 00:18:45.325
EXCUSE ME.

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:47.161
TRISTAN?

00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:48.829
WHAT IS IT,
SERENITY?

00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:51.065
WELL, I'M STILL NERVOUS
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN

00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.966
WHEN I TAKE
MY BANDAGES OFF.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.468
I KNOW THAT
THE DOCTOR SAID

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:55.803
I CAN TAKE THEM
OFF TONIGHT,

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:57.738
BUT I'M WORRIED
THE OPERATION DIDN'T WORK.

00:18:57.738 --> 00:19:00.808
NAH, YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE, SERENITY!

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:03.744
YOU GOTTA HAVE A LITTLE
FAITH, THAT'S ALL.

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:06.447
I KNOW, BUT I WANT TO
SEE SO BADLY, TRISTAN,

00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:08.182
AND THERE'S A PART OF ME
THAT'S TOO FRIGHTENED

00:19:08.182 --> 00:19:10.217
TO FACE THIS ALONE.

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:11.652
I BET YOU THINK

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.687
I'M JUST ACTING LIKE
A SCARED LITTLE BABY.

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:16.056
COME ON, WE ALL
GET SCARED SOMETIMES,

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:17.157
BUT IF YOU THINK
ABOUT IT,

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.959
THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO
FREAK US OUT THE MOST

00:19:18.959 --> 00:19:21.095
ARE USUALLY NO BIG DEAL
AT ALL, SERENITY!

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:23.197
YEAH, AND I THINK
I'LL FEEL BETTER

00:19:23.197 --> 00:19:25.566
ONCE WE GET TO
BATTLE CITY AND FIND JOEY

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:27.935
BECAUSE I NEED HIM TO
GIVE ME THE COURAGE

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:30.337
AND THE STRENGTH TO FACE
THE UNKNOWN ONE MORE TIME,

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.539
LIKE HE DID WHEN I FIRST
WENT TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:33.874
AND I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING,

00:19:33.874 --> 00:19:35.776
I THINK JOEY NEEDS
YOU RIGHT NOW

00:19:35.776 --> 00:19:37.978
JUST AS MUCH AS
YOU NEED HIM.
HUH?

00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:40.013
YOU'LL GIVE HIM
THE COURAGE HE NEEDS

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.415
TO WIN THE FINALS!

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:44.084
AH! THAT'S
SO PERFECT!

00:19:44.084 --> 00:19:45.619
WE'LL INSPIRE
EACH OTHER,

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:48.088
AND TOGETHER WE'LL BOTH
OVERCOME OUR DOUBTS!

00:19:48.088 --> 00:19:50.190
THANKS FOR LISTENING
TO ME, TRISTAN!

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.259
I CAN'T WAIT TILL WE
GET TO BATTLE CITY!

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.027
NO SWEAT!
DON'T MENTION IT!

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.032
IS OUR SATELLITE
TRACKING SYSTEM WORKING?

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.601
YES!

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:03.103
I'M PICKING UP A WEAK SIGNAL
FROM JOEY'S DUEL DISK.

00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:04.538
IT'S COMING FROM
THE SAME SPOT

00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:06.940
WHERE THOSE RARE HUNTERS
WERE KEEPING ME AND TEA!

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.376
WE SHOULD BE THERE
IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES!

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.111
[THINKING] JOEY
AND TEA BETTER BE OK.

00:20:11.111 --> 00:20:12.946
HANG IN THERE GUYS!

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:14.281
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO SAVE YOU!
