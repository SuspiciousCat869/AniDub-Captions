GOOD MORNING,
MR. MUTO!

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:07.730
AH, TEA.
GOOD MORNING.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.998
YUGI'S UPSTAIRS
GETTING READY.

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:11.200
I'LL CALL HIM FOR YOU.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.268
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

00:01:13.268 --> 00:01:15.204
AH, NO THANKS,
WE'RE ALREADY LATE.

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.806
YUGI! TEA'S HERE!

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:19.708
Yugi: I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE, GRANDPA.

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:22.511
THIS NEW CHAIN OUTTA KEEP
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE SAFE.

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:26.682
SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE WANTS
THEIR HANDS ON IT, LATELY.

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:29.385
AND WE'RE GOING
TO NEED IT NOW
MORE THAN EVER.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:30.786
WE ARE?

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:32.287
WH-WHATTA YA MEAN
BY THAT?

00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:34.857
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
CONNECTS US, YUGI.

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:37.393
AND I SENSE FATE
HAS MORE IN STORE FOR US.

00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:38.861
OH...

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.863
WELL, WE'RE
IN THIS TOGETHER
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:41.930
GOOD.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.265
I WISH I KNEW MORE,

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.535
BUT OUR FUTURE
IS STILL UNCLEAR TO ME.

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:47.603
WELL...

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:48.804
I'LL HELP YOU
FIGURE IT OUT.

00:01:48.804 --> 00:01:50.339
ABOUT TIME, YUGI.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:51.440
SORRY, TEA.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.741
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR THE BIG GAME.

00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.610
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.945
AHHH, I WAS TALKING
TO THE SPIRIT

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:58.113
OF THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE.

00:01:58.113 --> 00:01:59.381
HE SEEMS
KINDA WORRIED.

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:00.516
ABOUT WHAT?

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.317
ABOUT THE FUTURE,
I THINK.

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:05.454
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT OUR DESTINY
BEING UNCLEAR.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:07.456
EVER SINCE WE DEFEATED
PEGASUS TOGETHER,

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:09.958
THE SPIRIT'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FATE...

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.562
LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING
MORE HE HAS TO DO.

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:14.997
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:17.099
HE DOESN'T REALLY
KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT HIMSELF...

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.001
LIKE WHERE HE CAME FROM,
WHY HE'S HERE...

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.103
BUT I'M BABBLING
AND WE'RE LATE.

00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:22.237
WE SHOULD GO.

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:23.839
RIGHT.
THE SOCCER GAME.

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.908
WE DEFINITELY
DON'T WANNA MISS IT.

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:27.109
SEE YA, MR. MUTO!

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.277
BYE, GRANDPA!
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:29.311
ENJOY YOURSELVES,
YOU TWO.

00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:31.447
IF THE GAME ENDS EARLY,

00:02:31.447 --> 00:02:33.549
FEEL FREE TO COME BACK
AND HELP ME SWEEP!

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.052
Tea: SO, WHO DO YOU
THINK IS GONNA WIN?

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:38.921
WIN? WIN WHAT?

00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:40.289
EARTH TO YUGI.

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.291
THE SOCCER GAME.
AT SCHOOL.

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:43.959
OH. I DUNNO.
UHHH...

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.295
YOU DON'T REALLY
CARE MUCH ABOUT
SPORTS, DO YOU?

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:47.796
Man: FUTURES TOLD.

00:02:47.796 --> 00:02:49.398
FATES UNFOLD.

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.166
STEP UP, BOY,

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.368
AND I'LL REVEAL
THE SECRETS
OF YOUR FUTURE.

00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:54.536
YUGI?

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:55.737
HUH?

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:57.606
CAN YOU REALLY SEE
INTO THE FUTURE?

00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:58.674
YES.

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:00.042
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
YUGI?

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:02.110
TEA, MAYBE THIS
FORTUNE TELLER

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.412
CAN HELP ME FIGURE
OUT THE FATE

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:04.813
OF THE SPIRIT
INSIDE THE PUZZLE.

00:03:04.813 --> 00:03:05.981
HMM.

00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:10.452
OK, BUT WE REALLY DON'T
HAVE THAT MUCH TIME.

00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:12.921
BOY, IN ORDER TO TELL
YOUR FUTURE,

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:15.324
I MUST HOLD
A PERSONAL ITEM.

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.391
REALLY?

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.193
YOUR NECKLACE
WILL DO NICELY.

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:19.294
MY WHAT? NO.

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:20.929
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T.

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.698
THEN I CAN'T TELL
YOUR FORTUNE.

00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:23.966
YEAH, BUT--

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:27.269
I NEED IT IN ORDER
TO PROPERLY READ YOUR AURA,

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.104
TO SEE WHAT FATE
HAS IN STORE FOR YOU.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:33.408
YOU DO WANT TO KNOW,
DON'T YOU?

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:35.410
YOUR FATE?

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.282
OKAY, BUT ONLY
FOR A SECOND.

00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:42.251
YUGI, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.519
HMMM.

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.020
SOMETHING'S COMING TO ME.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.957
I SEE THAT THIS MILLENNIUM
ITEM NOW BELONGS TO ME!

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:51.159
MY MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE!

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.128
AAH!

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:55.564
COME BACK HERE!

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.033
HE'S GETTING AWAY.
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:03:58.033 --> 00:03:59.434
I'LL FOLLOW HIM
THIS WAY.

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:00.969
YOU TRY TO CUT HIM OFF
AROUND THE CORNER!

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.971
YOU GOT IT, YUGI!

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.207
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS, YOU CREEP!

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:07.075
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HANDED HIM MY PUZZLE!

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:09.011
HUH?

00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.445
ARROWS?

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:11.647
THAT THIEF WANTS ME
TO FOLLOW HIM!

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:14.216
[SIGH]

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:16.585
THIS MUST BE A TRAP,
BUT WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:20.088
[SIGH]

00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:23.392
I CAN'T LOSE THE SPIRIT
OF THE PUZZLE.

00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:24.793
I WON'T!

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:33.496
Tea: THERE'S NO SIGN OF THAT
FORTUNE TELLER ANYWHERE!

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:34.697
I HOPE YUGI'S OK.

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:39.335
HEY? TEA?
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.604
OH, BAKURA!

00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:43.339
SOMEONE STOLE YUGI'S
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.707
NO!
WHERE IS YUGI?

00:04:44.707 --> 00:04:46.609
IN THE ALLEY.

00:04:46.609 --> 00:04:48.611
WE SPLIT UP
TO CATCH THE GUY!

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.480
WELL THEN, DON'T
LET ME DETAIN YOU.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.748
KEEP LOOKING AND
I'LL GET SOME HELP.

00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:54.050
RIGHT!
THANKS, BAKURA!

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.487
NO ONE SHALL HAVE
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE BUT ME!

00:04:57.487 --> 00:04:58.788
I WANT ITS POWER.

00:05:01.424 --> 00:05:05.028
AND I'LL TRACK IT DOWN
WITH MY MILLENNIUM RING!

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:07.931
SHOW ME THE WAY!

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.300
TRACE THE ITEM'S
MYSTICAL ENERGIES!

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.205
AND LEAD ME
TO THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:05:15.205 --> 00:05:17.941
IF I CONTROL ALL
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:20.944
I WILL CONTROL
POWER UNIMAGINABLE!

00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:25.115
AND I WILL MAKE CERTAIN
THAT NOBODY STANDS IN MY WAY.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.586
HMM.

00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:32.122
WHICH WAY, RING?

00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:36.493
AH, YES, YUGI AND HIS MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE ARE VERY CLOSE.

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:38.061
VERY CLOSE.

00:05:41.698 --> 00:05:42.932
SORRY, TEA,

00:05:42.932 --> 00:05:44.934
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU
AND YOUR SNIVELING FRIENDS

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:47.804
INTERFERING
WITH MY DESTINY.

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:52.709
Yugi:
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:54.043
WHOEVER THAT GUY WAS,

00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:57.547
HE'S LEADING ME
LIKE A RAT THROUGH A MAZE.

00:05:57.547 --> 00:06:01.217
BUT WHY WOULD A THIEF WANT
HIS VICTIM TO FOLLOW HIM?

00:06:01.217 --> 00:06:03.186
WHAT'S HE REALLY AFTER?

00:06:03.186 --> 00:06:05.255
THE LAST ARROW.

00:06:11.094 --> 00:06:12.228
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
IS HERE.

00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:14.631
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE APART
I CAN SENSE IT.

00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.767
BUT I DON'T SEE IT.

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:20.036
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE!

00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:21.237
HA HA HA!

00:06:21.237 --> 00:06:23.039
CONGRATULATIONS,
LITTLE YUGI.

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.174
YOU FOUND ME.

00:06:24.174 --> 00:06:26.576
OR SHOULD I SAY
I FOUND YOU?

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:28.211
AND THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:30.213
GIVE IT BACK TO ME!

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:32.115
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
THAT EASY FOR YOU.

00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:33.583
IF YOU WANT
YOUR PUZZLE BACK,

00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:35.084
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT ME
FOR IT.

00:06:35.084 --> 00:06:36.786
THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI.

00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:38.521
YOU AND I
ARE GOING TO DUEL.

00:06:38.521 --> 00:06:39.856
[SIGH]

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:43.326
AND THE WINNER GETS TO KEEP
YOUR MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:45.762
A DUELING ARENA!

00:06:45.762 --> 00:06:47.330
ARE YOU UP
TO THE CHALLENGE, YUGI?

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.167
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU A LONG TIME!

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:53.303
WHO ARE YOU?

00:06:53.303 --> 00:06:55.872
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH MY MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE?

00:06:55.872 --> 00:06:59.209
I DESIRE THE POWER
YOUR ITEM CONTAINS WITHIN.

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:01.844
BUT ACCORDING TO THE RULES
OF ITS ANCIENT MAGIC...

00:07:01.844 --> 00:07:06.049
I HAVE TO WIN IT
FROM YOU IN A DUEL.

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:07.617
AS FOR WHO I AM,

00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:09.586
LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I'M THE ONE

00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:12.689
WHO SHALL CONTROL YOUR DESTINY
AS I HAVE CONTROLLED OTHERS,

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:17.160
AND THAT I AM NOT
UNFAMILIAR WITH THE POWER
OF A MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.131
INDEED, I UNDERSTAND MORE
ABOUT THEIR HIDDEN MYSTERIES
THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.500
TAKE YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.937
THERE ARE ANCIENT SECRETS
BURIED WITHIN IT
OF WHICH YOU--

00:07:27.937 --> 00:07:30.039
AND EVEN THE SPIRIT
THAT INHABITS IT--

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:31.274
ARE UNAWARE.

00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:34.143
THAT'S WHY I WILL ADD IT
TO MY COLLECTION.

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:36.613
I WON'T DUEL YOU
FOR MY MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE.

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:38.281
IT ALREADY
BELONGS TO ME!

00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:40.883
IT'S IN MY POSSESSION NOW,
LITTLE YUGI!

00:07:40.883 --> 00:07:41.951
ALL RIGHT.

00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:43.720
THEN I ACCEPT
YOUR CHALLENGE.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.921
OF COURSE YOU DO.

00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:46.522
IF I HAVE TO DUEL,

00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:48.925
I'LL NEED THE SPIRIT
OF THE PUZZLE
TO HELP ME.

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:51.094
MAYBE I CAN STILL
CONNECT WITH HIM.

00:07:51.094 --> 00:07:53.796
Spirit: I CAN BARELY
HEAR YOU, YUGI.

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:55.698
OUR BOND IS WEAK.

00:07:55.698 --> 00:07:58.201
IT'S HARD TO
MAINTAIN CONTACT.

00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:01.070
I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU WITH THIS DUEL.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.506
YOU'LL HAVE
TO FIGHT HIM ALONE!

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:04.540
ALONE?!

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.576
BUT I'VE NEVER FOUGHT
A DUEL WITHOUT YOU!

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:08.878
AND IF I'M DEFEATED
I LL LOSE YOU FOREVER!

00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:10.280
YOU CAN DEFEAT HIM!

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.048
JUST TRUST YOURSELF
AND YOUR DECK,

00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:13.182
AND YOU'LL FIND THE WAY.

00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:14.617
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:08:14.617 --> 00:08:16.552
I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE IN
THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:08:16.552 --> 00:08:18.388
BE VERY CAREFUL, YUGI.

00:08:18.388 --> 00:08:21.124
I SENSE A GREAT EVIL.

00:08:21.124 --> 00:08:22.792
SPIRIT!

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:39.175
PREPARE TO LOSE
YOUR PRECIOUS PUZZLE.

00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:41.110
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.514
REMEMBER, YUGI,
I HAVE SEEN YOUR FUTURE--

00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:47.083
FORETOLD YOUR FATE.

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:49.686
AND THIS DUEL--
WILL BE YOUR LAST!

00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:57.522
[Yugi, thinking]
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS DUELIST

00:08:57.522 --> 00:08:59.123
AND NOW I HAVE
TO FACE HIM ALONE!

00:08:59.123 --> 00:09:00.558
FOR THE HIGHEST
STAKES EVER!

00:09:00.558 --> 00:09:02.894
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE GANG TO BACK ME UP!

00:09:02.894 --> 00:09:04.195
WELL, HERE GOES.

00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:06.197
IT'S TIME TO DUEL.

00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:12.136
I PLACE THE CELTIC
GUARDIAN ON THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:13.938
I'VE MADE MY PLAY,
NOW YOU MAKE YOURS!

00:09:13.938 --> 00:09:16.641
I PLACE MY MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.710
WHAT'S THE MATTER,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.345
DON'T YOU HAVE
THE COURAGE
TO FACE ME HEAD ON?

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:25.081
I DON'T NEED TO.

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:27.217
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BETTER
GO ON THE OFFENSIVE

00:09:27.217 --> 00:09:29.920
IF YOU HOPE TO WIN BACK
YOUR PUZZLE!

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.388
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:33.957
I ATTACK WITH MY
CELTIC GUARDIAN.

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:37.394
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO DO, YUGI!

00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:42.365
YOUR ATTACK HAS ACTIVATED
THE POWER OF MY CYBER JAR!

00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:45.836
THIS MACHINE CARD DESTROYS
EVERY MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:47.971
HA HA HA!

00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:54.911
AND IT ALSO REQUIRES US
TO DRAW FIVE NEW CARDS.

00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:59.282
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT
UP YOUR PATHETIC SLEEVE
THIS TIME, LITTLE YUGI.

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:01.251
[THINKING]
TIME FOR A NEW STRATEGY.

00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:03.553
I'M PLACING MY MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:05.589
AND I'M PLACING MINE
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:10.527
MEET MECHANICAL CHASER
AND GROUND ATTACKER BUGROTH!

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.729
[THINKING]
MORE MACHINE CARDS?!

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:14.564
WAIT,
THIS SEEMS FAMILIAR.

00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:16.233
THERE'S ONLY
ONE PLAYER I KNOW

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:18.902
WHOSE DECK IS FILLED
WITH MACHINE CARDS.

00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:21.638
SHOW YOURSELF,
BANDIT KEITH!

00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:25.842
[THINKING]
I WAS RIGHT!

00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:28.845
BUT WHY WOULD BANDIT
KEITH DISGUISE HIMSELF

00:10:28.845 --> 00:10:31.081
AND STEAL MY
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE?

00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:33.416
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM
WAS WHEN HE BATTLED JOEY

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:34.985
IN THE DUELIST
KINGDOM TOURNAMENT.

00:10:34.985 --> 00:10:37.220
HE BROKE THE RULES,
BUT JOEY BEAT HIM.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.389
WHEN PEGASUS FOUND OUT
KEITH WAS CHEATING,

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:40.991
HE EJECTED HIM
FROM THE ISLAND.

00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:43.126
WE NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:44.794
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:46.897
I'M NOT BANDIT KEITH.

00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:50.767
I ONLY SPEAK THROUGH HIM
SINCE HE'S BECOME MY
MIND-CONTROLLED SLAVE!

00:10:50.767 --> 00:10:53.069
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HOW CAN THIS BE?

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.738
TELL ME!

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:58.408
AFTER BANDIT KEITH
WAS EJECTED BY PEGASUS
FROM DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:02.012
HE FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE
AGAINST THE HARSH
OCEAN WATERS.

00:11:02.012 --> 00:11:04.080
HELP!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.715
MY FOLLOWERS AND I
WERE ON THE WAY

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:08.385
TO RETRIEVE SOME
VERY SPECIAL ITEMS

00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:10.754
WHEN WE FISHED HIM OUT
OF THE SEA.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:13.456
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR NEW MINDS TO CONTROL

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:17.394
AND BANDIT KEITH SEEMED
LIKE THE PERFECT PUPPET
TO DO MY BIDDING.

00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:21.231
AND AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT,
HE LED ME RIGHT TO YOU,

00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:25.468
THE BOY WHO POSSESSES THE
LEGENDARY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:28.204
IS IT ALL SINKING IN NOW,
LITTLE YUGI?

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:31.241
NOW THAT I HAVE FOUND YOU
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

00:11:31.241 --> 00:11:33.810
I WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO MAKE YOUR PUZZLE,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.646
AND ALL OF THE ANCIENT POWERS
IT POSSESSES WITHIN IT,
MY OWN!

00:11:39.582 --> 00:11:41.084
Bandit Keith:
HELP... ME....

00:11:41.084 --> 00:11:43.486
YOU'LL NEVER FREE
YOURSELF, KEITH!

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.188
LET THE DUEL CONTINUE!

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:49.793
I PLAY MACHINE KING
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.996
MY NEW MONSTER GETS
AN EXTRA 100 ATTACK POINTS

00:11:52.996 --> 00:11:54.631
FOR EVERY MACHINE
THAT'S ON THE FIELD!

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.867
THAT'S 300 MORE POINTS!

00:12:00.403 --> 00:12:03.073
MACHINE KING,
ATTACK WITH JET PUNCH!

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:11.181
YOU MAY AS WELL
GIVE UP NOW!

00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:13.350
IT'S NOT OVER YET!

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.785
I PLAY ANOTHER CARD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:17.687 --> 00:12:22.726
YOUR DEFENSES ARE USELESS
AGAINST MY MECHANICAL ARMY.

00:12:22.726 --> 00:12:25.996
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
I'M ADDING THIS MACHINE
TO MY TROOP.

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:29.966
MEGA SONIC EYE!

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:33.069
IT ADDS ANOTHER
100 ATTACK POINTS
TO MACHINE KING,

00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:37.307
MAKING HIM
EVEN MORE DEADLY!

00:12:37.307 --> 00:12:39.642
MACHINE KING, ATTACK NOW!

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.949
NO! MY STONE SOLDIER!

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:47.183
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.452
ALL YOUR DEFENSES
ARE GONE!

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:51.554
GIVE UP YET?

00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:54.958
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
OF THE POWER YOU'RE
UP AGAINST, LITTLE YUGI.

00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.427
[THINKING] NO MATTER
WHO THIS GUY IS,

00:12:57.427 --> 00:12:58.928
I CAN'T LET HIM WIN.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:01.631
BUT HOW CAN I DEFEAT HIM
WITHOUT THE SPIRIT...

00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.899
AND MY FRIENDS?

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:05.735
Tea: C'MON, GUYS.
HURRY!

00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:06.836
YUGI MAY BE
IN TROUBLE!

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:08.772
Boy: JUST POINT
THE WAY, TEA.

00:13:08.772 --> 00:13:11.708
WE'RE RIGHT
BEHIND YA!

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.743
YEAH, ANY CREEP
PICKS ON OUR BUDDY

00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:15.011
HAS TO DEAL
WITH US ALL!

00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.179
YOU SAID IT!

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:18.581
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE!

00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.916
JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.985
YOU VOLUNTEERED TO HELP
AT THE SOCCER GAME.

00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:24.454
I KNOW, COACH,
BUT WE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:25.555
UHH...

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.057
TEA'S CAT
HAS GOTTEN SICK.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.358
WE NEED TO TAKE IT
TO THE VET.

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:29.559
PLEASE.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.994
WE NEED TO HELP
FLUFFY!

00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:32.362
POOR FLUFFY!

00:13:32.362 --> 00:13:34.831
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOUR
LITTLE KITTY WAS SICK!

00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:37.267
OF COURSE YOU CAN GO!

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:38.568
Both: HEH.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.769
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU, COACH!

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:43.206
SAVE THAT
LITTLE KITTY!

00:13:43.206 --> 00:13:44.808
HE'S REALLY
A SOFTY AT HEART!

00:13:44.808 --> 00:13:47.343
IT WASN'T COOL
TO MISLEAD
COACH MORTY.

00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:49.312
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
WE HAD TO, TEA.

00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:51.014
YEAH. YUGI NEEDS US!

00:13:51.014 --> 00:13:52.582
I HOPE WE
CAN FIND HIM.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.018
COME ON, YUGI.
STOP STALLING.

00:13:55.018 --> 00:13:57.353
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO ADMIT DEFEAT.

00:13:57.353 --> 00:13:59.255
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP!

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.890
FOOLISH BOY.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.059
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S UP AGAINST.

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.662
HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.499
I HAVE TOO MUCH AT STAKE
IN THIS GAME.

00:14:09.499 --> 00:14:10.600
SO TAKE THIS!

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.505
I PLAY CURSE OF DRAGON.

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:17.073
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:20.677
AND I PLAY GAIA,
THE FIERCE KNIGHT.

00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:22.078
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:24.414
I ALSO USE MY
POLYMERIZATION CARD

00:14:24.414 --> 00:14:26.082
TO COMBINE
THESE TWO MONSTERS

00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:30.286
IN ORDER TO CREATE GAIA,
THE DRAGON CHAMPION!

00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:35.391
THIS MONSTER CAN TAKE
YOUR MACHINES APART!

00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:37.894
DRAGON CHAMPION,
ATTACK MECHANICAL CHASER

00:14:37.894 --> 00:14:39.963
WITH DOUBLE
DRAGON LANCE!

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.401
WITH MECHANICAL
CHASER GONE,

00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:47.337
YOUR MACHINE KING
LOSES 100 ATTACK POINTS

00:14:47.337 --> 00:14:50.106
AND YOU LOSE
750 LIFE POINTS!

00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:51.741
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:55.512
BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO
WHEN I PUT MY WEAKER
MONSTERS IN DEFENSE MODE

00:14:55.512 --> 00:14:59.382
TO PROTECT THEM
FROM YOUR DRAGON
CHAMPION'S ATTACKS

00:14:59.382 --> 00:15:02.552
AND THEN PLAY MACHINE
CONVERSION FACTORY,

00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:05.788
A MAGIC CARD THAT ADDS
300 ATTACK AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:07.457
TO ALL OF MY
MACHINE CARDS?

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:11.628
OH NO!

00:15:11.628 --> 00:15:13.930
YOU'VE RAISED
MACHINE KING'S POWER
EVEN MORE!

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.000
THAT'S RIGHT,
ENOUGH TO OVERPOWER
YOUR DRAGON CHAMPION!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.034
MACHINE KING, ATTACK!

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.839
YOUR OFFENSIVE
IS OVER, YUGI;

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.841
YOUR CHAMPION DESTROYED.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.912
I'VE MADE KEITH'S
MACHINE MONSTERS' ATTACK
STRENGTH OVERWHELMING!

00:15:28.912 --> 00:15:30.747
SO WHY DON'T YOU
STOP RESISTING

00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:32.649
AND JUST HAND OVER
YOUR PUZZLE TO ME?

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:36.052
IT'S THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION
TO OUR GAME ANYWAY.

00:15:36.052 --> 00:15:37.554
[THINKING]
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

00:15:37.554 --> 00:15:40.490
I HAVE TO STOP HIM
SOMEHOW. BUT HOW?

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.991
HE'S ASSEMBLED AN ARMY

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:46.930
OF THE MOST RARE
AND POWERFUL MACHINES
IN DUEL MONSTERS!

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.031
WAIT!

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:51.901
THE SUMMONED SKULL.
THIS GIVES ME AN IDEA.

00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:53.903
BUT FIRST I'LL HAVE
TO PLAY A MAGIC CARD.

00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:57.006
YOUR MACHINES MIGHT BE
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
I'VE SEEN.

00:15:57.006 --> 00:15:58.474
BUT THEY'RE STILL MADE
OUT OF METAL!

00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:01.077
SO I PLAY MAKIU!

00:16:01.077 --> 00:16:03.913
YOU THINK A LITTLE MIST'LL
DESTROY MY MACHINES?!

00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:05.648
IT WON'T DESTROY THEM,

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:08.117
BUT IT WILL CAUSE THEM
TO RUST AND LOWER
THEIR POINTS.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.623
AND THE MIST TURNS
YOUR MACHINE MONSTERS

00:16:13.623 --> 00:16:16.726
INTO ONE GIGANTIC
LIGHTNING ROD!

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.263
WHICH MAKES THEM
THE PERFECT TARGET
FOR MY SUMMONED SKULL!

00:16:20.263 --> 00:16:24.801
SUMMONED SKULL,
USE YOUR LIGHTNING
STRIKE ON MACHINE KING!

00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.835
NOW!

00:16:33.142 --> 00:16:35.511
ANY MORE MACHINES
FOR THE JUNK HEAP?

00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:37.313
YOU LITTLE...

00:16:37.313 --> 00:16:38.581
THE BOY IS GOOD.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.917
HE PLAYS MUCH BETTER
THAN I HAD EXPECTED

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.286
WITHOUT THE SPIRIT
OF THE PUZZLE TO AID HIM.

00:16:43.286 --> 00:16:46.456
BUT HE HAS NO IDEA
OF THE POWER HE'S
UP AGAINST.

00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:49.492
MY DECK IS FULL
OF RARE MONSTERS,

00:16:49.492 --> 00:16:51.094
THE LIKES OF WHICH
HE'S NEVER SEEN,

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.696
AND WHEN I'M
THROUGH WITH YUGI,

00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:55.498
HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
WILL BE MINE!

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.796
SO, THEY WENT RUNNIN'
DOWN THIS ALLEY?

00:17:01.796 --> 00:17:03.064
Tea: UH-HUH.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.866
HMM. THESE ARROWS.

00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:07.802
HEY, YA THINK YUGI
TACKED THESE THINGS
UP HERE FOR US?

00:17:07.802 --> 00:17:10.305
I DON'T THINK HE HAD
THE TIME, JOEY.

00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:12.173
HEY, GUYS!
LOOK AT THAT!

00:17:12.173 --> 00:17:14.442
Tea: OH, NO.

00:17:14.442 --> 00:17:16.911
HOW ARE WE
GONNA FIND HIM?!

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.279
Yugi: NOW YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S STALLING.

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.547
ARE YOU GONNA DRAW
OR WHAT?

00:17:22.951 --> 00:17:25.453
I'VE PICKED THE GRACEFUL
CHARITY CARD.

00:17:25.453 --> 00:17:27.455
BY PLACING THIS CARD
ON THE TABLE,

00:17:27.455 --> 00:17:30.458
I'M ABLE TO DRAW 3
NEW CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:35.463
AND I'M CONFIDENT
THAT THEY'LL BE EXACTLY
THE CARDS I NEED

00:17:35.463 --> 00:17:37.832
TO END THIS DUEL
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:17:37.832 --> 00:17:40.668
HA HA HA!

00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:47.442
YOU'RE FINISHED,
LITTLE YUGI.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.711
I'VE DRAWN THE ULTRA-RARE
ZERA RITUAL CARD!

00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:53.748
IT'S USED TO SUMMON
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
MONSTERS IN THE GAME!

00:17:56.918 --> 00:17:58.453
WHOA...

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.855
I'VE NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF THE ZERA
RITUAL CARD BEFORE!

00:18:00.855 --> 00:18:02.624
BUT I'VE GOT
A SNEAKING SUSPICION

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.292
THAT I'M ABOUT TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT IT

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.527
THAN I REALLY
WANT TO KNOW.

00:18:05.527 --> 00:18:07.629
HOW PERCEPTIVE.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.898
FOR ONCE I PUT
ZERA RITUAL INTO PLAY,

00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:11.199
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:18:11.199 --> 00:18:12.700
MAYBE.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.370
BUT ACTIVATING
A RITUAL CARD TAKES
MORE THAN JUST TALK...

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.972
YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE
THE RIGHT MONSTER CARD
IN YOUR HAND,

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.541
AND WHAT ARE
THE ODDS OF THAT?

00:18:21.576 --> 00:18:23.078
WHAT?! NO WAY!

00:18:23.078 --> 00:18:26.247
MAYBE YOU
FINALLY UNDERSTAND

00:18:26.247 --> 00:18:30.118
THE POWER YOU ARE
UP AGAINST, YUGI.

00:18:30.118 --> 00:18:33.888
NOW ZERA RITUAL SACRIFICES
MY TWO REMAINING MONSTERS

00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:36.791
IN ORDER TO BRING FORTH
THE GREATEST OF MY CREATURES.

00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:39.227
BEHOLD THE INSTRUMENT
OF YOUR DESTRUCTION,

00:18:39.227 --> 00:18:42.464
ONE OF THE STRONGEST BEASTS
IN DUEL MONSTERS.

00:18:42.464 --> 00:18:45.500
BEHOLD ZERA THE MANT!

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.168
[ROAR]

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.736
OUR BATTLE ENDS HERE.

00:18:48.736 --> 00:18:50.972
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

00:18:50.972 --> 00:18:53.174
ZERA, ATTACK NOW!

00:18:58.046 --> 00:19:00.482
ZERA OBLITERATED
MY SUMMONED SKULL!

00:19:00.482 --> 00:19:02.250
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.886
YOU'LL NEVER GET MY
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

00:19:07.422 --> 00:19:10.225
[THINKING]
SO, MY MILLENNIUM RING
HAS LED ME HERE.

00:19:10.225 --> 00:19:12.227
THE PUZZLE MUST BE INSIDE.

00:19:12.227 --> 00:19:13.561
HMMM...

00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:16.131
I ALSO SENSE A DARK PRESENCE
FROM THE SHADOW REALM.

00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:18.099
SEIZING CONTROL
OF THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:20.568
MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTING
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:19:20.568 --> 00:19:22.403
Tea: YUGI!

00:19:22.403 --> 00:19:23.538
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:24.906
YUGI!

00:19:24.906 --> 00:19:26.141
YUGI!

00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:28.409
SAY SOMETHING,
BUDDY!

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:29.410
WHERE IS HE?

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.778
HA HA HA!

00:19:30.778 --> 00:19:32.280
YOU'RE FINISHED,
LITTLE YUGI!

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.216
WITH BANDIT KEITH
UNDER MY MIND-CONTROL,

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.851
YOU'LL NEVER WIN THIS DUEL!

00:19:36.851 --> 00:19:40.221
Bandit Keith:
HELP... HELP....

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.957
[GRUNTING]

00:19:42.957 --> 00:19:45.293
KEITH, YOUR RESISTANCE
IS FUTILE!

00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:48.963
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO END THIS
DUEL AND TAKE WHAT'S MINE!

00:19:48.963 --> 00:19:50.465
[THNKING]
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:52.367
I HAVE NOTHING TO FIGHT
HIS MONSTER WITH.

00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:55.236
IF ONLY I COULD CALL ON
THE SPIRIT AND ASK
FOR HIS HELP,

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.172
BUT WE'VE LOST CONTACT!

00:19:57.172 --> 00:20:00.542
[THINKING]
I THINK YUGI'S FINALLY
FIGURED OUT IT'S HOPELESS.

00:20:00.542 --> 00:20:03.378
HE WILL FALL AGAINST
MY SUPERIOR MONSTERS,

00:20:03.378 --> 00:20:06.848
AND THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
WILL BE IN MY CONTROL!
