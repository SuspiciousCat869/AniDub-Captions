00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.303
Yami-Yugi:
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.573
BREEDING MACHINE,
CREATE THE FINAL
SLIME TOKEN!

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.877
NOW I HAVE ENOUGH MONSTERS
FOR MY ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.045
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.981
Man: MR. KAIBA,
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.049
WAS PLAYED EXACTLY
FIVE MINUTES AGO!

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.351
WE'LL FLY YOU TO IT!

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.920
I SUMMON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.656
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
MY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.491
SLIFER WILL
AUTOMATICALLY ATTACK

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.893
EVERY MONSTER
YOU SUMMON

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.895
WITH ITS SECOND
SET OF JAWS.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:31.498
AND FROM NOW ON
<i>THIS</i> MAGIC CARD
WILL ALSO BE IN PLAY.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.535
INFINITE CARDS
LETS ME EXCEED
THE SIX-CARD LIMIT

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.638
AND HOLD AS MANY CARDS
AS I WISH IN MY HAND!

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.240
SINCE SLIFER GETS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.842
FOR EVERY CARD
IN MY HAND,

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.879
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL CONTINUE
TO GROW STRONGER.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.483
EVERY MONSTER HAS
A WEAKNESS, MARIK,
AND I'LL FIND YOURS!

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.723
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:31.024
IT'S TIME

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.508
♪ YU-GI-OH! ♪

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:54.915
Kaiba: YUGI! PROVE
THAT YOU'RE WORTHY
OF YOUR REPUTATION

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.850
AND TAKE DOWN
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.219
UNLESS YOU DON'T
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.755
MAYBE YOUR DUELIST KINGDOM
CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.091
WAS JUST A FLUKE!

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.026
I WILL
DEFEAT HIM, KAIBA...

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.227
I ASSURE YOU!

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.895
MARIK, IT'S OVER!

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.065
HA! MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS UNSTOPPABLE!

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.867
AH!

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:17.004
AND <i>YOU'RE</i>
MY NEXT VICTIM, KAIBA.

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:18.605
HA HA HA!

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.475
ONCE SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
ANNIHILATES YUGI

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:24.544
I'M COMING AFTER
<i>YOUR</i> EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:28.482
SAVE YOUR BREATH.
YOUR EMPTY THREATS
DON'T SCARE ME.

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.917
THEY WILL IN TIME,
FOOL!

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.854
<i>THIS</i> DUEL ISN'T
OVER YET, MARIK!

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.722
Yugi, thinking:
I'VE GOT TO FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO DEFEAT

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.391
HIS EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD,

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.559
BUT IT HAS 10,000
ATTACK POINTS.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.728
NONE OF MY MONSTERS
EVEN COME CLOSE
TO THAT!

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.831
PLUS, IT GROWS
STRONGER WITH
EVERY CARD HE DRAWS.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.634
BUT IT MUST HAVE
<i>SOME</i> WEAKNESS,
AND I'LL FIND IT!

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.636
I DRAW...

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.572
Yugi, thinking:
HMM...MONSTER REBORN
COULD COME IN HANDY.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.308
Yami-Yugi: I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:59.046
AND I SUMMON
BIG SHIELD GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:06.286
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.587
THAT BY SUMMONING
A MONSTER

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.223
YOU ACTIVATE MY
DRAGON'S SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.858
LET ME REMIND YOU

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.894
BY BLASTING YOUR MONSTER!

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.967
THIS SURGE OF ENERGY
FROM MY DRAGON'S
SECOND MOUTH

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.170
WILL DRAIN YOUR
BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.805
OF 2,000
DEFENSE POINTS!

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.541
YUGI WON'T LAST
MUCHLONGER!

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.943
HE BETTER LAST
LONG ENOUGH
FOR ME TO LEARN

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.878
SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON'S
WEAKNESS

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.113
SOICAN
DEFEAT IT LATER

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:35.248
AND ADD IT
TO MY COLLECTION.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.850
HOW'S HE GONNA
DO THAT?

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.785
THAT DRAGON'S POWER
KEEPS GROWING!

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.220
WAIT! CHECK IT OUT!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.522
YUGI'S MONSTER
SURVIVED THE ATTACK!

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.657
BARELY!

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:47.027
Marik: YOUR BIG SHIELD
HAS BEEN CUT DOWN TO SIZE,

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:49.229
AND MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL CONTINUE

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.032
TO AUTOMATICALLY
DEVASTATE YOUR MONSTERS

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.800
AS SOON AS THEY'RE
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD!

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.669
HA HA HA!

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.071
JUST ONE MORE ATTACK,
AND YOUR ONLY DEFENSE

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.272
WILL BE DEMOLISHED,

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.975
LEAVING NOTHING
IN BETWEEN YOU AND SLIFER!

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.745
WHERE'S YOUR FAITH
IN THE CARDS NOW, PHARAOH!?

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.546
NOW OBSERVE

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.515
WHILE I DRAW!

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:11.651
AND AS YOU KNOW,
SLIFER GETS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.620
FOR EVERY CARD
IN MY HAND.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.489
I COUNT 11...

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.925
GIVING MY DRAGON
11,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.961
HA HA HA!

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.831
WOW! 11,000 POINTS?!

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.600
THAT'S ALREADY MORE
THAN <i>THREE TIMES</i>

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.603
THE ATTACK STRENGTH
OF YOUR BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON, SETO!

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.905
AND IT'LL
ONLY GET STRONGER!

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.274
YUGI'S OPPONENT HAS
INFINITE CARDS
IN PLAY,

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.344
ALLOWING HIM TO
HOLD AS MANY CARDS
AS HE WANTS.

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:39.546
AH, AND THE MORE CARDS
IN HIS HAND,

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:42.048
THE MORE ATTACK POINTS
HIS DRAGON HAS.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.950
THAT MEANS THERE'S
NO LIMIT TO HOW STRONG

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.787
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
CAN GROW!

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.121
[THINKING]
OR IS THERE?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.690
WAIT, SLIFER'S
POWER DEPENDS ON
HOW MANY CARDS

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.993
THE PLAYER HAS
IN HIS ENTIRE DECK!

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:53.994
HMM.

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.329
THAT'S IT!

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.766
SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON
HAS ONE FATAL FLAW.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.002
NOW LET'S SEE
IF YUGI IS
DUELIST ENOUGH

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:03.970
TO FIGURE IT OUT!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.406
NOW, MY SKY DRAGON,
ATTACK!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.209
ERADICATE HIS SHIELD,
THE ONLY THING THAT STANDS

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.411
IN THE WAY
OF HIS DESTRUCTION!

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.282
SOON THAT PUZZLE
<i>AND THE WORLD</i>
WILL BE <i>MINE!</i>

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:19.286
[THINKING]
I KNOW EXACTLY

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.888
HOW TO DEFEAT THIS
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:23.657
BUT LET'S SEE IF
<i>YUGI'S</i> SMART ENOUGH
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.359
Marik:
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
DEFENSELESS, PHARAOH!

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.328
THE NEXT TIME
MY SKY DRAGON ATTACKS...

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.663
YOU'LL BE FINISHED!

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.765
IT'S UNDEFEATABLE,
YOU FOOL!

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.800
Yugi, thinking:
I CAN'T LET MARIK
WIN MY PUZZLE!

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.136
BUT I'VE NEVER
FACED ANYTHING
SO POWERFUL!

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:37.437
AND THE MORE
CARDS HE DRAWS,

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:38.672
THE STRONGER
IT GETS!

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.140
Yami-Yugi, thinking:
YES!

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.209
AND <i>THAT'S</i> HOW
I'LL DEFEAT IT!

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.811
I WILL MAKE SLIFER
DESTROY ITSELF!

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.346
ABOUT TIME!

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.447
WHAT'S HE <i>MEAN?</i>

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.282
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN?!

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.986
AH...IT'S
A SIMPLE MATTER
OF COMMON SENSE.

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.288
IF ALL OF
<i>MY</i> MONSTERS
ARE TOO WEAK...

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.225
THEN I MUST USE
<i>YOUR</i> MONSTER
TO DESTROY ITSELF!

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:03.063
HAVEN'T YOU REALIZED YET
THAT AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
CANNOT BE CONTROLLED?

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:05.932
IT'S MUCH TOO POWERFUL,
PHARAOH!

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.467
WE'LL SEE!
HUH?

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.002
PERHAPS YOU DON'T
HAVE AS MUCH
KNOWLEDGE

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:12.372
ABOUT THE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
AS YOU THINK YOU DO!

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.542
HOW DARE YOU
CHALLENGE MY WISDOM
OF THE ANCIENT WAYS.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.743
I KNOW ALL!

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.478
WE'LL FIND OUT
HOW MUCH YOU KNOW

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.913
SOON ENOUGH, MARIK!

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:23.850
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU <i>TRY</i>
TO TURN SLIFER AGAINST ME!

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.352
[THINKING]
WHAT'S YUGI
TALKING ABOUT?

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:27.187
I MEAN, SURE,
HE'S A GREAT DUELIST,

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:30.123
BUT HOW CAN HE MAKE
THAT EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
DESTROY ITSELF?

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.492
THAT DRAGON SEEMS
WAY TOOSTRONGTO CONTROL.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.793
IT SOUNDS CRAZY TO ME.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:34.928
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:36.730
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE,
MOKUBA.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.698
THE DRAGON'S
GREATEST STRENGTH

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:41.134
IS ALSO ITS
GREATEST WEAKNESS.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:44.004
SETO, I <i>STILL</i> DON'T GET
WHAT'S GOING ON!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.942
TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:51.378
I PROMISE IT WILL BE
YOUR LAST!

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.213
HA HA HA!

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:54.247
IS THAT SO!?

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.882
WE'LL SEE, MARIK!

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:58.084
Yugi, thinking:
IF I DON'T DRAW
THE RIGHT CARD NOW,

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.920
HIS SKY DRAGON
<i>WILL</i> CRUSH ME!

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.856
BUT I KNOW THE HEART
OF THE CARDS
WILL GUIDE ME!

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.091
NOW!

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.726
PERFECT!

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.099
WELL, WHAT IS IT?!

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.202
JUST WHAT I NEED
TO TAKE YOU DOWN!

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:19.172
[THINKING]
LOOKS LIKE YUGI
GOT HIS CARD. MMM.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.041
BUT THAT'S ONLY
HALF THE BATTLE.

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:23.443
THIS STRATEGY
REQUIRES
PERFECT TIMING.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.145
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:26.446
TIME TO LOSE!

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.915
I REVEAL
MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.583
MONSTER REBORN!

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.519
WHAT GOOD WILL <i>THAT</i> DO?

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.020
THIS MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.623
TO BRING BACK
ONE MONSTER
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.993
AND I CHOOSE
TO RESURRECT

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:42.429
MY MIGHTY
BUSTER BLADER!

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:43.430
RETURN!

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.640
WHAT? MY DRAGON'S
ALREADY DESTROYED
THAT MONSTER ONCE.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.142
PLUS, SUMMONING IT
TO DEFEND YOUR
LIFE POINTS

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.311
WILL ONLY DELAY
YOUR ULTIMATE DEFEAT!

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.213
IT'S NOT DEFENDING.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.682
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK,
MARIK!

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.652
BUSTER BLADER
HAS BEEN SUMMONED
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.458
[THINKING]
WHAT A THOUGHTLESS MOVE.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.593
WITH HIS BUSTER BLADER
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:16.796
MY DRAGON'S BLAST
WILL NOT ONLY
ANNIHILATE HIS MONSTER,

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.032
IT'LL WIPE OUT THE REST
OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:20.567
WINNING HIS
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:23.003
WAS A SIMPLER TASK
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.373
I KNOW I CAN'T WIN
BY JUST <i>DEFENDING</i>
MY POINTS.

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.508
THAT'S WHY
I'M RISKING
THIS ENTIRE DUEL

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.444
ON ONE FINAL
SWORD ATTACK
BY BUSTER BLADER!

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.380
YOU'RE MOREOF A FOOL
THAN I THOUGHT!

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.714
HA HA HA!

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:36.349
YOU'VE LEFT YOURSELF
WIDE OPEN

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.952
FOR MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
TO DEFEAT YOU!

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:42.288
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
ABOUT MY FIVE-CARD
COMBINATION THAT MAKES

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:45.658
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
COMPLETELY INDESTRUCTIBLE?

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:48.261
PERHAPS YOU NEED
A REMINDER, PHARAOH.

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.764
FIRST, MY CARD
OF SAFE RETURN

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:54.834
ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
THREE CARDS WHENEVER
A MONSTER IS REVIVED.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.203
SINCE YOU RESURRECTED
BUSTER BLADER

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.506
I CAN NOW DRAW
THREE MORE CARDS
FROM MY DECK

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.841
TO INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF CARDS
IN MY HAND!

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:03.743
YES, AND THE MORE
CARDS YOU HOLD,

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:05.779
THE STRONGER
YOUR DRAGON BECOMES.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.480
RIGHT!

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.317
SO SLIFER GAINS
3,000 ADDITIONAL
ATTACK POINTS,

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:15.055
GIVING IT A TOTAL
OF 14,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.390
HA HA HA!

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.826
14,000 ATTACK POINTS?!

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:20.827
THAT'S NUTS!

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:22.295
AND THEN...

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.432
YOU FORGOT THAT BRINGING
BUSTER BLADER BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:28.268
ACTIVATES SLIFER'S
SECOND MOUTH!

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:33.139
BLASTING 2,000 ATTACK POINTS
AWAY FROM YOUR MONSTER!

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.474
BUSTER BLADER'S
STRONG ENOUGH

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:36.009
TO SURVIVE
YOUR ATTACK!

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:38.178
[GROANS]

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:41.581
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE END FOR YOU, PHARAOH!

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.284
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
HAS WEAKENED YOUR MONSTER

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:48.788
INTO THE PATHETIC MESS
BARELY STANDING BEFORE YOU!

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:52.292
MY NEXT ATTACK WILL
FINISH YOU OFF FOREVER!

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.396
YOUR BUSTER BLADER

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:58.131
MAY HAVE SURVIVED
THAT BLAST,

00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.232
BUT IT'S STILL
NO MATCH

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:01.000
FOR MY EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.969
YOUR REIGN AS PHARAOH
IS ALMOST OVER,

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.871
SO PREPARE TO SURRENDER
YOUR PUZZLE!

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:09.142
IN MY NEXT TURN,
YOUR MONSTER
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:10.844
WILL BE COMPLETELY
WIPED OUT!

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.045
I'M AFRAID THAT THERE

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:14.614
ISN'T GOING TO <i>BE</i>
A NEXT TURN FOR YOU!

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.550
ONCE BUSTER BLADER
ATTACKS YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.419
<i>YOU'LL</i> BE DEFEATED,
MARIK!

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:21.321
NOW WATCH AS
MY PLAN TO SLAY

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:25.558
YOUR SO-CALLED
INDESTRUCTIBLE
DRAGON BEGINS!

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.559
[GASPS]

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.927
[THINKING]
HAS YUGI LOST IT?

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:32.132
HIS BUSTER BLADER
WON'T EVEN SCRATCH
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.566
[THINKING]
IF YUGI'S PLAN
WORKS,

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:37.270
MY SUSPICIONS ABOUT
HOW TO DEFEAT SLIFER
WILL BE CONFIRMED!

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.706
TIME FOR ME TO WIN
THIS DUEL RIGHT NOW.

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.642
I'M READY FOR
YOUR PATHETIC ATTACK!

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.977
[THINKING]
THIS IS IT.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.578
<i>SOMEONE'S</i> ABOUT
TO <i>LOSE</i> THIS DUEL.

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:48.348
BUSTER BLADER,
ATTACK SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON

00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:50.383
WITH YOUR
POWERFUL BLADE!

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:56.022
WATCHING YOUR PUNY WARRIOR
TRY TO TAKE DOWN

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.158
MY UNSTOPPABLE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.759
IS ACTUALLY QUITE AMUSING.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.529
[ROARS]

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.831
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
THAT MY SKY DRAGON

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.799
IS PROTECTED
BY MY ULTIMATE DEFENDER,

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:09.102
THE SHAPE-SHIFTING
REVIVAL JAM?!

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.477
YOUR ATTACK'S
BEEN BLOCKED,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.580
AND MY REVIVAL JAM
WILL REFORM ITSELF NOW.

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:24.817
AFTER THAT, I CAN DRAW
YET ANOTHER 3 CARDS,

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.687
AND SLIFER'S POWER
WILL GROW EVEN GREATER,

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.523
PREPARING ITSELF
TO DESTROY YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.660
WITH A FORCE
MORE INTENSE THAN
ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.595
I'M AFRAID THAT
IT'S STILL MY TURN,

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.263
BUT BEFORE I MAKE
MY NEXT MOVE

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.899
I NEED REVIVAL JAM
TO REVIVE.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.000
OBSERVE!

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:45.271
AND NOW
THE STAGE IS SET
FOR THIS CARD.

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:50.210
THE MAGIC CARD
BRAIN CONTROL!

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.478
NOW I'LL CONTROL
YOUR MONSTER!

00:11:56.349 --> 00:11:58.618
I THINK I GET
YUGI'S PLAN!

00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:00.386
HE MUST WANT TO USE
BRAIN CONTROL

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.121
TO TAKE OVER
THE DRAGON'S MIND,

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:05.124
BUT I <i>STILL</i> THINK
SLIFER'S WAY TOO STRONG
TO BE CONTROLLED!

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.659
HA HA HA!

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.595
IT'S NOT QUITE
THAT SIMPLE.

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.430
SORRY, YAMI.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.298
I'M AFRAID
<i>ALL</i> MAGIC CARDS

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.633
ARE COMPLETELY
INEFFECTIVE

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:16.970
AGAINST EGYPTIAN
GOD MONSTERS!

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.040
AND NOW YOU'LL PAY
THE PRICE FOR MAKING
SUCH A FOOLISH MISTAKE!

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:26.346
[ROARS]

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:27.981
DON'T BE SO SURE.

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.216
WHO TOLD YOU I WAS
AFTER YOUR DRAGON?

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.351
YOU'RE NOT?

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.219
NO, MARIK, THERE'S
ANOTHER MONSTER

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:34.854
ON YOUR FIELD
I'M AFTER,

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:36.756
AND I'LL
CONTROL <i>HIM!</i>

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:41.194
MY BRAIN
CONTROL CARD

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:44.097
WILL SEIZE
YOUR REVIVAL JAM!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:48.101
WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO
WITH MY REVIVAL JAM CARD?

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.871
IT CAN'T HURT MY DRAGON,
SO IT'S OF NO USE TO YOU!

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.339
YOU STILL
DON'T GET IT.

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.874
SINCE REVIVAL JAM
REFORMED,

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:56.943
DRAW YOUR THREE
NEW CARDS, MARIK!

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.779
I WILL, WHICH RAISES
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.948
ANOTHER 3,000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:06.185
WITH EVERY CARD I DRAW,
MY MONSTER WILL GET
EVEN STRONGER!

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.756
ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:13.393
THAT BRINGS SLIFER'S
ATTACK POINTS TO 17,000!

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.997
AND NOW, PHARAOH,
THE TIME FOR ME
TO DESTROY YOU

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.599
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.801
SLIFER, WIPE OUT
HIS BUSTER BLADER

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.603
<i>AND</i> HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:25.772
HOLD ON, MARIK!

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:27.640
YOUR SKY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.941
MEANS
ITS SECOND MOUTH

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.777
HAS TO ATTACK
ANY NEW MONSTER

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:32.779
THAT APPEARS
ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:33.980
OHH!

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:38.251
THAT MEANS
BEFORE YOU
CAN DESTROY ME

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:40.953
YOUR MONSTER
MUST ATTACK
MYREVIVAL JAM!

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:48.695
YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:52.365
REVIVAL JAM
REVIVES ITSELF AGAIN.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.538
AND EACH TIME
A MONSTER REGENERATES,

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:00.406
YOU HAVE TO DRAW
THREE MORE CARDS

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:01.974
FROM YOUR
DUELING DECK!

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.013
Marik, thinking:
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.716
WHENEVER REVIVAL JAM
REAPPEARS ON THE FIELD,

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:11.984
MY DRAGON
AUTOMATICALLY ATTACKS IT.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.287
AND SINCE YAMI
CONTROLS REVIVAL JAM,

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:17.023
IT WILL REVIVE ITSELF
ON HIS SIDE OF THE FIELD,

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.225
WHICH MAKES ME DRAW
THREE NEW CARDS.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.928
THEN MY DRAGON
WILL ATTACK AGAIN.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:25.765
EACH EVENT TRIGGERS THE NEXT
IN A NEVER-ENDING CYCLE!

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:29.135
FIRST ATTACK...

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:31.704
THEN REGENERATE...

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.239
THEN DRAW!

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:37.176
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL CONTINUE

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.878
TO GROW STRONGER
WITH EACH CYCLE

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.080
AS I DRAW MORE CARDS,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.416
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE I'M TRAPPED!

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:45.184
GRR! AAH!

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.686
THERE'S NO WAY OUT!

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:47.720
THAT'S RIGHT, MARIK.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.288
ONCE YOU RUN OUT
OF CARDS TO DRAW,

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.524
YOU WILL
AUTOMATICALLY
LOSE THIS DUEL!

00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:54.861
NO! THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING!

00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:59.365
AS POWERFUL AS
YOUR EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD IS,

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.100
NO MONSTER IS
WITHOUT WEAKNESS,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.668
AND THE SKY DRAGON'S
FLAW LIES

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.871
WITHIN ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:06.939
ITS SECOND MOUTH
ATTACK!

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:15.415
I HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER MY EGYPTIAN
GOD MONSTER!

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.717
AS LONG AS YAMI'S
BRAIN CONTROL
IS IN EFFECT,

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:20.286
MY DRAGON WILL KEEP
ATTACKING REVIVAL JAM

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:23.890
AND MY MIND-SLAVE WILL
KEEP DRAWING CARDS UNTIL...

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.825
NO!

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:28.261
I TURNED <i>YOUR</i> DRAGON
AGAINST YOU,

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.062
CAUSING YOU TO
USE UP ALL THE CARDS

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.497
IN YOUR
DUELING DECK!

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:34.200
NO! OHH!

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.703
THAT MEANS I WIN!

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:38.805
IT'S OVER!

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.940
GRR!

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.742
IT CAN'T BE!

00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:43.776
HOW COULD I LOSE

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.679
WITH AN EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD IN MY DECK?

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.681
YOU'LL PAY, YAMI!

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.050
YOU MAY HAVE
DEFEATED <i>SLIFER,</i>

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:56.055
BUT I HOLD <i>ANOTHER</i>
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD--
A MUCH MORE <i>POWERFUL</i> ONE!

00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:01.561
SO SAVOR THIS VICTORY
WHILE YOU CAN,

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:04.230
FOR IT WILL BE YOUR LAST!

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.536
YUGI WON THE DUEL!

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.638
WHAT A TOTALLY
AWESOME COMEBACK!

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.242
HAND OVER
YOUR EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD TO YUGI,

00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:17.677
TOURNAMENT RULES!

00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:20.246
C'MON,
SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:21.981
I MEAN, NO ONE
LIKES TO LOSE,

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.549
BUT RULES ARE RULES,
YA KNOW?

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.152
HEY, DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF, MISTER.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.221
IT'S JUST A GAME.

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.823
OH, <i>THERE</i> IT IS.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.726
SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON'S
AWESOME.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:36.028
I WISH SETO AND I
COULD KEEP IT.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:39.131
BUT AS COMMISSIONER
OF THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT,

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.467
I HAVE TO HAND
THIS CARD OVER
TO YOU, YUGI,

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.069
AND YOU EARNED IT!

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.806
AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.375
YOU GET HIS
LOCATOR CARD ALSO.

00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:52.512
JUST DON'T GET
TOO ATTACHED

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.081
'CAUSE MY BROTHER'S
GOT HIS EYE
ON THAT DRAGON TOO.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.082
SO WATCH OUT!

00:16:56.082 --> 00:16:58.618
I MUST BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS.

00:16:58.618 --> 00:16:59.952
YUGI...

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.053
HMPH?

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:02.889
SO YOU FIGURED OUT
HOW TO DEFEAT

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.624
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:17:04.624 --> 00:17:06.025
WELL DONE.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:09.295
IT'S A REAL SHAME
YOU WON'T HAVE IT
FOR TOO LONG.

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:11.030
WHY NOT?

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.331
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE GOING TO

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.767
DUEL FOR IT
RIGHT NOW!

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.603
THEN, WHEN I DEFEAT YOU,
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.572
WILL BE WHERE IT BELONGS...

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.073
IN <i>MY</i> DECK!

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:23.175
YOU SEE, I'M ALREADY
IN POSSESSION

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.677
OF ONE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:27.246
AND I PLAN TO WIN
THE OTHERS.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.081
NOW IT'S TIME TO DUEL.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:30.983
ONCE I WIN SLIFER
FROM YOU,

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.785
I'LL ONLY NEED ONE MORE.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.755
THEN <i>I'LL</i> BE THE NUMBER ONE
DUELIST IN THE WORLD!

00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:38.691
GRR!

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.127
HA HA HA!
SILLY FOOLS!

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:42.461
AH!
HMM.

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:43.496
I'VE HAD ENOUGH

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.464
OF YOUR MIND TRICKS,
MARIK.

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.600
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO SHOW YOURSELF!

00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:50.369
NOT TO WORRY, PHARAOH,

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:53.005
YOU'LL MEET ME
SOONER THAN YOU THINK.

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:56.242
I'M ON MY WAY
TO BATTLE CITY
AS WE SPEAK.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.412
ONCE I'M THERE,
THE NEXT PHASE
OF MY PLAN BEGINS.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.915
I ASSURE YOU THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH
WILL BE MINE!

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.384
MY LOYAL MIND SERVANTS
ARE PREPARING

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.353
FOR MY ARRIVAL
RIGHT NOW.

00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:09.288
WHERE ARE THEY,
MARIK?

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:13.960
I HAVE RARE HUNTERS
EVERYWHERE IN BATTLE CITY.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.095
AND I CAN SEE ALL!

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.631
I SEE THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
THAT WILL BE MINE.

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:22.068
I SEE A DEFENSELESS CITY
WAITING TO BE CONQUERED.

00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:25.671
AND I SEE POTENTIAL
MIND-SLAVES IN EVERY CROWD.

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:28.007
I'M ALWAYS SEARCHING
FOR NEW SERVANTS

00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:30.643
TO ADD TO MY ARMY
OF RARE HUNTERS.

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:32.478
I WONDER WHO
WILL BE NEXT.

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:34.146
Joey: AH, MAN,
I WAS DIS CLOSE

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.182
TA KICKIN' KAIBA'S BUTT
IN A DUEL!

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:37.950
SO WHY DID YOU LOOK
SO RELIEVED

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.119
WHEN HE HAD TO
SUDDENLY TAKE OFF?

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.288
WHAT!? I'M NOT AFRAID
A DAT PUNK!

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.590
OH, RIGHT.
[LAUGHS]

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.891
Marik:
SO TELL ME, PHARAOH,

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:49.028
WHICH OF YOUR FRIENDS WOULD
MAKE THE BEST MIND-SLAVE?

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.263
TEA? JOEY, PERHAPS?

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.699
YOU LEAVE
THEM ALONE.
UNDERSTAND?!

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.134
I'M WARNING YOU!

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.004
WELL, IT APPEARS I'VE HIT
YOUR SENSITIVE SPOT,

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:00.039
HAVEN'T I, PHARAOH?

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.874
PERHAPS I CAN USE
YOUR <i>FRIENDS</i>

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:04.944
TO GET WHAT I WANT FROM <i>YOU,</i>
NAMELY YOUR PUZZLE...

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:07.546
AND THE EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD YOU'VE WON.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:10.082
I TOLD YOU,
LEAVE MY FRIENDS
OUT OF THIS!

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:12.118
OR ELSE YOU'LL WHAT?

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:14.053
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
MEANINGLESS TO ME.

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:16.422
BESIDES, I HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.257
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
TO GAIN!

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:19.692
HA HA HA!

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.060
DO <i>NOT</i> TEST ME!

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.862
IF ANY HARM
BEFALLS MY FRIENDS,

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.797
YOU <i>WILL</i>
REGRET IT, MARIK.

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.065
THEY DID
<i>NOTHING</i> TO YOU,

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:28.434
SO YOU SETTLE
YOUR SCORE WITH <i>ME!</i>

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.839
JUST AS MY DRAGON'S
ONE WEAKNESS DESTROYED <i>IT,</i>

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.443
YOUR LOYALTY
TO YOUR FRIENDS
WILL SOON DESTROY <i>YOU.</i>

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:38.744
[GROAN]
[GASP]

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:39.912
MARIK! NO!

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:41.747
I MUST SAVE THEM!

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.782
[GROANS]

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:44.750
HEY, GET BACK
HERE RIGHT NOW!

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:50.122
OUR DUEL WILL
HAVE TO WAIT, KAIBA.

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.525
MY FRIENDS ARE
IN GREAT DANGER,

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.460
AND THEIR SAFETY IS
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.462
THAN ANYTHING
IN THIS WORLD!

00:19:58.431 --> 00:19:59.465
GOOD LUCK.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:00.966
RUNNING AWAY
FROM A CHALLENGE

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.668
IS AGAINST
TOURNAMENT RULES.

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:10.242
Marik, thinking:
FINALLY I HAVE ARRIVED!

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:13.045
I MAY HAVE LOST ONE
OF MY TWO EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.181
TO YAMI, BUT NO MATTER.

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:17.850
WITH THE POWER
OF THE MILLENNIUM ROD IN MY HAND

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.686
AND HIS PRECIOUS FRIENDS
AT MY DISPOSAL,

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.888
I'LL GET
EVERYTHING I DESIRE.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.257
HA HA HA!

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:26.959
Yugi, thinking:
I GOTTA FIND MY FRIENDS

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.894
BEFORE MARIK GETS TO THEM!

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:38.871
[THINKING]
THIS TIME THE PHARAOH'S
IN A BATTLE HE <i>CAN'T</i> WIN.

00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:41.607
SOON THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
HE TOOK FROM ME

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:44.777
AND HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
WILL BE MINE.

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.011
THEN <i>I'LL</i> BE PHARAOH,

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.881
AND THE WORLD WILL
COWER AT MY FEET!
