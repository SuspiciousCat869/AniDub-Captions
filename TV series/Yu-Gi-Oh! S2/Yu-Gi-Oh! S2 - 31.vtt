GIMME ONE GOOD REASON WHY
I SHOULD MARRY THIS CLOWN.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.468
BECAUSE IF YOU
DON'T MARRY HIM,

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.203
I WON'T BE ABLE

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.604

AND IF I WIN, YOU'LL
COME BACK TO HOLLYWOOD
WITH ME AND BECOME MY BRIDE.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.383
YOU DON'T STAND

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.851
MAI, WAIT!

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:18.785

TO THE FINALS,

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:21.688
DON'T DUEL
THIS GUY!

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.089
HATE TO BRING
THIS UP...

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:24.758
BUT JEAN CLAUDE MAGNUM

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.459
HAS SOME SERIOUS
KUNG FU SKILLS.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:28.328
IT WOULDN'T BE WISE
TO GET HIM MAD.

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:29.863
DON'T SWEAT IT, GUYS.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.632
MAI'LL WIN IN NO TIME,
AND WE'LL STILL MAKE
THE FINALS.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:34.267
YEAH YOU SHOULD
DUEL 'IM, MAI!

I SHOULD MARRY HIM!

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.707
AH, I DIDN'T SAY
TO WIN!

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.876
JUST DO ME A FAVOR,
AND LET MR. NINJA

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:44.744
BORROW YOUR DUEL DISK,
A'RIGHT?

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.112
WHAAAAT!!!??

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.647
NOT NECESSARY.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:49.549
HA! HMM!

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:51.551
HE'S GOT A DUEL DISK!

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.019
Yugi: BUT DUEL DISKS

TO BE ISSUED

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:54.788
TO HIGH-RANKED
DUELISTS!

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.792
WHO SAYS I'M NOT
HIGH-RANKED, SHORTY?

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.128
THE FACT IS, I'VE WON
FIVE LOCATOR CARDS.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:05.031
DOES THAT MEAN
IF MAI LOSES THIS DUEL

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.766
SHE'LL LOSE
A LOCATOR CARD

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.101
AND HER SLOT
IN THE FINALS?

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.269
WHY, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.204
I'LL TAKE HER PLACE
IN THE FINALS

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.672
NOT TO MENTION
HER HAND IN MARRIAGE.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.374
Yugi: YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ACCEPT

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:15.809
THIS GUY'S
CHALLENGE.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.744
IT'S NOT
WORTH RISKING
THE FINALS FOR!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.212
YUGI'S RIGHT, MAI.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.547
NO WAY.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.649
I WANNA SHOW
MISTER HOLLYWOOD NINJA BOY

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.285
THAT I'M NOT JUST
SOME PRIZE TO BE WON.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.520
Magnum: THEN PREPARE
TO LOSE THIS DUEL!

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.891
BUT WIN A HUSBAND
WHO'S A STAR!

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:37.392
Yugi: I CAN'T BELIEVE
MAI'S RISKING HER SPOT

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.165
IN THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.501
JUST TO SHOW UP
JEAN CLAUDE MAGNUM!

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.236
Magnum:
REMEMBER, DOLL-FACE,

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.938
WHEN I WIN,

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.474
NOW LET'S DUEL!

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.142

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.051

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.254
NOW FEAST YOUR EYES

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.590
ON MY NINJA COMMANDER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.258
Tristan: THERE'S TWO!

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.128
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY
JUST SOME HOLLYWOOD
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:09.129
HA HA HA!

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.997
IT'S CALLED
MULTIPLICITY, KID,

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.833
AND AS LONG AS I KEEP
MY NINJA COMMANDER
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:17.037
I CAN SUMMON
NINJA SOLDIER KATANA
TO THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:19.940
DON'T SOUND
SO CONFIDENT,
YOU B-MOVIE HACK,

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.342
YOUR MONSTERS
ARE JUST LIKE
YOUR MOVIES:

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:24.611
SECOND-RATE
AND NOT AROUND
FOR VERY LONG!

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.212
TOUCHÉ.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.715
BAD REVIEWS AREN'T
ALWAYS EASY TO HEAR.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.517
AND NOW!

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.919
LET'S SEE HOW YOUR
NINJAS LIKE THIS!

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.022
MY AMAZON
<i>SWORD WOMAN!</i>

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.391
SLICE AND DICE HIS
NINJA SOLDIER

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:40.760
WITH YOUR
AMAZON SLASH ATTACK!

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.663
UNH!

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.834
Duke Devlin:
THIS GUY'S NOT LIKE
HE IS IN THE MOVIES.

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.202
JEAN CLAUDE DUELS
LIKE AN AMATEUR,

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:52.205
AND NOT ONLY THAT,
HE'S MUCH SHORTER
THAN HE LOOKS ON-SCREEN!

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:54.040
I SEE THAT YOU
HAVEN'T CHANGED

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:57.110
YOUR AGGRESSIVE
STYLE OF DUELING,
MY LITTLE SWEET PEA...

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.380
YOU'RE STILL
AS CHARMING AS EVER.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:04.017
I PLAY ANOTHER
<i>NINJA COMMANDER</i>
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.324
AND JUST LIKE BEFORE,
I'LL USE HIS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.760
TO SUMMON ANOTHER
NINJA SOLDIER
TO THE FIELD!

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.163
YOUR DUELING'S
JUST ONE BAD SEQUEL
AFTER ANOTHER.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.966
THAT ATTITUDE
ONLY MAKES ME
LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.601
UGH.

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.169
I THINK THAT MAI'S
REALLY COOL,

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:24.504
DON'T YOU, JOEY?

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.538
SHE'S SO TOUGH.

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:26.973
I'D LOVE TO BE
LIKE THAT.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.008
YOU SERIOUS?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.577
YEAH, SHE DOESN'T LET
ANYONE PUSH HER AROUND.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.545
I GUESS!
IF YOU THINK IT'S COOL

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.347
TO HAVE A REALLY
LOUD MOUTH,

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.549
A MEAN DISPOSITION,
AND TO WALK AROUND

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.152
ACTIN' LIKE YOU'RE
THE GREATEST THING
SINCE CHEESE FRIES...

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.954
SURE, I GUESS YOU COULD
SAY MAI'S COOL.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.455
I WOULDN'T, THOUGH.

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:44.624
Magnum: SUGARPLUM?
WERE YOU DAY-DREAMING
ABOUT OUR WEDDING?

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.293
I'D RATHER
EAT WORMS, ROMEO.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:48.962
NOW,
AMAZON SWORD WOMAN,

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.331
ATTACK HIS
NINJA COMMANDER!

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:53.299
AAH!

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:56.636
I'M AFRAID
THAT YOU'VE WALKED

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.171
RIGHT INTO THE TRAP
I SET, DARLING.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:08:59.939
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.541
YOUR MISTAKE.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:03.543
NOW THAT YOU'VE SENT
MY NINJA COMMANDER

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.545
AND MY NINJA SOLDIER
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.647
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
SACRIFICE ONE MORE NINJA,

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.315
AND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE!!

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:10.984
NINJA SOLDIER, BA-BYE.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:12.652
YOUR JOB'S DONE.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:16.356
IT'S TIME TO BRING OUT
THE REAL STAR!

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:20.126
I SUMMON
NINJA MASTER SHOGUN!

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:22.629
[GROWLING]

WHAT A SURPRISE...
MORE NINJAS!

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:33.006
EVER THINK
ABOUT TRYING
A DIFFERENT ROLE?

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.741
YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHIN' YET.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.843
WHEN MY NINJA MASTER'S
IN ATTACK MODE

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:38.645
HE CAN SUMMON
TWO MORE NINJAS,

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.647
SO MEET
NINJA COMMANDO KABUKI

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.816
AND ANOTHER
NINJA SOLDIER.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.057
AND IN ANOTHER PLOT TWIST
MY KABUKI NINJA

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.860
CAN ALSO SUMMON
A MONSTER TO THE FIELD.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:58.665
SO HEEEEEEEERE'S

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.439
Serenity: JOEY, DOES THIS
MEAN MAI'S IN TROUBLE?

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:07.807
NAH. IT'LL TAKE
A LOT MORE

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:09.809
THAN A BUNCH
OF SECOND-RATE NINJAS

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.010
TO STOP A DUELIST
LIKE MAI.

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:12.145

AAH!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:26.793
AAH!

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.861

[GASPING]

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.637
THAT'S ROUGH.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.305
OHH!

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.407
Magnum: SORRY,

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:43.176

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.611
BUT HEY...
WHEN I DEFEAT YOU,

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:48.148
AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE
A HUSBAND WHO'S
A BATTLE CITY FINALIST!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.083
YOU COULD BRAG
ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.253
REALLY? YOU'RE
SO SENSITIVE, JEAN.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.921
STOP FLIRTIN', MAI,

THERE'S TOO MUCH
ON DA LINE OVA HERE!

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.159
IF THIS KEEPS UP,
SHE'LL HAVE TO

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.493
AND FORFEIT

IN THE BATTLE CITY
FINALS!

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:04.797

DESTROY THE ONES YOU LOVE!

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.478
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN

00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:19.846
FOR ATTACK, MY DEAR!

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.648

UNLEASH NINJA SMOKE BALL!

LADYBIRD'S GOTTA TAKE

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.980
Tristan:

AND IT'S
BACK TO YOU.

NO HARD FEELINGS?
ALRIGHT!

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.890
IT LOOKS LIKE

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.025
SOONER THAN I'D EXPECTED!

00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:09.629
YOU'LL BE LIMPING

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:12.365
ARE YOU BITTER BECAUSE

GREAT KITE OF NINJA...

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:27.880
HOVERING OVERHEAD,

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:30.617
FROM ALL OF YOUR MONSTER
ATTACKS AND MAGIC CARDS!

00:12:31.284 --> 00:12:32.285
OH, NO!

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.387
MY KITE ALSO ALLOWS
MY NINJA TO BYPASS

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.457
ANY OF YOUR MONSTERS
AND ATTACK YOUR
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:42.061
AS LONG AS I SACRIFICE ONE
OF MY OWN MONSTERS FIRST!

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.964
SO NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
MY NINJA SOLDIER...

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:46.666
AND ATTACK
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.435

NOW WE CAN START
PLANNING OUR HONEYMOON

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.814
I WOULDN'T PICK YOUR

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.117
MAI'S GONNA

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:06.152
AND THEN
SHE'LL HAVE TO
MARRY THIS JERK!

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:07.920
NO! WE CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:13:08.588 --> 00:13:10.189
HEY, YUGE, CAN MAI
TURN THIS AROUND?

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:13.026
MM-HMM. IF SHE PLAYS
HARPIE'S FEATHER DUSTER

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:17.230
IT WOULD CANCEL OUT
ALL ACTIVE MAGIC CARDS
ON THE PLAYING FIELD!

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:21.134
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
HARPIE'S FEATHER DUSTER
IN YOUR HAND, DO YA?

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.403
DON'T YOU THINK

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.705
IN DAT CASE,
WHAT DO YA THINK
I SHOULD WEAR

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:27.573

00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:32.545
[THINKING]
NOW THERE'S
A MAGIC CARD

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.646
THAT'LL HELP!

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.515
LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH, SHALL WE?

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.183
TIME IS MONEY.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.818
AND THE FINALS AWAIT.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.155
YUGE, WE NEED A PLAN
BEFORE DAT FLYIN' NINJA
ATTACKS AGAIN.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.057
MAI SHOULD FOCUS
ON DESTROYING

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.591
THE NINJAS
ON THE GROUND FIRST.

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.427
REMEMBER, HE HAS
TO SACRIFICE THEM

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.095
TO ATTACK
HER LIFE POINTS,

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.698
BUT IF SHE WIPES
THEM OUT FIRST,
SHE'LL BE SAFE.

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:52.899
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.702
HEY, MAI, I GOT SOME GREAT
NINJA-DESTROYING ADVICE!

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:57.670

ON MY OWN!

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.405
WELL, EXCUSE ME.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.407
I WAS ONLY TRYING

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.612

OR I'LL STICK YOUR
DUEL DISK IN IT!

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:10.583
