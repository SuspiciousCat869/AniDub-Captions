[HONOKA gasps]

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.607
[PIXIE]
We are drawn to strong,

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.193
highly pure beliefs
and processes,

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:14.364
and we form our "ego" using
those thoughts as the core.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.032
[TATSUYA]
Highly pure...

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.827
So, do you mean thoughts
rooted in single desires?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.370
[PIXIE]
That is correct.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.539
I believe that,
in your language,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.751
the concept most closely related
to it would be... prayer.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.461
I'd do anything for you.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:31.381
[HONOKA yelps]

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.634
[PIXIE]
I wish to be useful to you.

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:36.803
I wish to serve you.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.097
[PIXIE, HONOKA]
I wish to be yours.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.350
[HONOKA] I wish to offer
everything to you.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.351
[PIXIE]
That...

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:46.604
...is the unfiltered
prayer that awakened me.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.650
And right now, the desire
to become only yours,

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.736
Is the emotion that
comprises my core.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.948
Consequently, I am
subordinate to you.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.201
[HONOKA]

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.787
I admit, I'm surprised
you all have an ego,

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.999
and even more so that all of
you are fully passive beings.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.625
Because what that means is,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.003
you didn't come to this
world of free will.

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:11.504
Do I have that right?

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:15.592
We originate as simple beings
that exist in this world.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:18.011
We are given "wishes"
by our host.

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.971
That hits rather
close to home.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.807
Anyway, would I be
correct in assuming...

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.475
...that you'll follow
my instructions?

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.769
[PIXIE]
Yes. That is my wish.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.104
[TATSUYA]
Hm.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.107
Fine, then. You will
obey my orders.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.693
Henceforth, I forbid you
to use psychic powers

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.486
without my permission.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.156
Your expressions change
by telekinesis, right?

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.909
That stops, also.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.870
As you command, Sir. I am yours.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.923
It never once occurred
to me that monster...

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.883
...could possess a robot, too.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.053
It's probably because
it was a humanoid type.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.138
Strange vessel to choose...

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.687
Hey, Miyuki You have piano

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:11.773
[MIYUKI] Yes.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.316

Then when class is done,

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.318
I'll come pick you up as usual.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.821
Okay! I'll be waiting for
you when I'm finished.

[TATSUYA grunts]

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.731
[TATSUYA]
There are five of them...

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.650
And it's looks like...

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.152
...they're surveillance
from another faction?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.076
They're all in position, Ma'am.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.995
Sirius, do you copy?

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:09.622
The Stardust unit is
in place and waiting.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.124

Excellent.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.671
First the Stardust unit will
attempt to capture the target

without incident.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.382
If that proves impossible,

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:21.801
they will lure him to the
park where you are.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.304
After that, I defer
to your judgment.

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:25.805

What a fitting name.

I don't believe you're

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:18.222
Ah, Tatsuya. Good evening.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.765
Is everything alright?

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:23.144
I'm sorry. I know it's late,
Mister Hayama.

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:26.606
What I'm calling for is, I just
came under small armed attack.

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.024
It was the USNA.

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:29.066
I see.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.277
After fighting off
the first upsurge,

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.405
I engaged the Stars commander,
known as Angie Sirius...

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:35.906
...and I won.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:39.201
I also managed to take
down the reserve team,

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.786
backed up the data
they recorded,

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:43.247
then deleted everything
else they had left.

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:57.345
[TATSUYA] Subsequently, I healed
all of Sirius's wounds

00:18:57.386 --> 00:19:01.682
and erased any and all signs
or evidence of our battle.

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:04.143
While making contact
with the first wave,

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:07.188
I noticed other observers,
not with the USNA army.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:09.982
Well, that sheds a bit
more light on it.

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:12.401
They must have been
with Section Three, then.

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.111
Section Three...

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.572
So that unit‐was a Saegusa hire.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:20.576
Yes. Mr. Koichi, the current
leader of the Saegusa family,

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.578
seems to have shown
some interest.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.914
I expect he is
investigating the parasites

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.166
or is trying to capture one.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.876
Well, that's annoying.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.754
We'll tide the USNA
over for the moment.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:32.630
In the meantime,

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:36.092
please send me the backed‐up
data as soon as possible.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.969
Without an excuse to
make Section Three act,

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.640
Mr. Kouichi should back out
for the time being as well.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.517
That sounds good. Thank you.

No, I will do no such thing!

I can tell you did
by the blood on you!

Also, it wasn't a
one‐on‐one, was it?

There's no need
for you to panic.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.094
You of all people should know.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.222
Nobody can leave any injuries
on me if I don't let them.

You're right, of course.
