00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.394
[TATSUYA]
Magic.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.146
At the start of the
21st century,

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.732
it was systemized as
an actual technology.

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:26.735
[TATSUYA] Those who
possess superior abilities

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.738
are known as
magic technicians, or magicians,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.491
and are placed under the
watch of various nations.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.452
[TATSUYA]
Among them,

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.496
magicians with the power
to repel an army.

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.915
and destroy a major
city in one strike,

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.584
were labeled
Strategic‐Class magicians.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.461
They became symbolic
of a military force

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:47.172
that influences world affairs.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:51.593
[MIYUKI]
Then came October 31st, 2095.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.805
Unofficial Strategic‐Class magic
wiped out a naval base

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:58.183
and a fleet on the southern tip
of the Korean peninsula.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.103
That day became known
as Scorched Halloween.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.814
The world was shaken
by the debut of a new

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.024
Strategic‐Class magician.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.765
[ANGIE]
Halt!

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.643
It's over,
Lieutenant Alfred Fomalhaut.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:44.771
You might as well give up,
you know there's no escaping.

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.402
[ANGIE] What the hell
happened to you, Freddie?

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:53.280
You were given the
First‐Class Star code.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.408
What on earth would make
you desert the unit?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.826
You've also been
accused of committing

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.537
a series of grisly
murders in this town.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.790
Using your pyrokinesis, no less!

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.168
You didn't really
do that, though, did you?

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.756
Please, Freddie! Answer me!

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.594
[gasps]

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:19.931
[ANGIE]
Pyrokinesis!

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.444
Lieutenant Alfred Fomalhaut.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.447
By the power vested in
me as the Star's Commander...

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.575
...Under USNA Army
Criminal Law...

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:40.702
...I hereby execute you!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.087
[gasps]

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.642
[TATSUYA] Does everyone here
have a drink in their hand?

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.519
When they said there was
going to be a farewell party,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.271
I'll admit, this isn't
really what I had in mind.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.649
But at least they
prepared a cake.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.359
So, why don't we make toast?

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.201
Merry Christmas, guys.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:22.911
[ALL]
Merry Christmas!

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.663
[ERIKA, MIZUKI]
Cheers to us!

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.747
Cheers to us!

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.623
Yeah.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:27.541
[HONOKA sighs]

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.084
[HONOKA, SHIZUKU giggle]

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.797
[HONOKA]
I still can't believe it.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.800
You're going to study abroad
in America, Shizuku?

00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:39.302
It kinda seems like it
came out of nowhere.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.388
Sorry. I know it's last minute,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.349
but my father wouldn't let me
talk about it until now.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.935
I'm honestly surprised you're
even allowed to go at all.

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:49.438
I mean, they usually don't
give magicians permission

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.731
to travel abroad.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.108
[SHIZUKU] Right. But they're
letting me go anyway.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.276
According to my father,

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.779
the reason is due to it being
a foreign exchange program.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.866
[TATSUYA] When do you leave?
And how long are you gone?

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.659
At the beginning
of the New Year.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:03.744
It'll be for three months.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.621
Oh wow! You'll be gone
for a while, then.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.250
So... where in America
are you going?

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.251
Here you go.

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:11.626
[LEO]
Mm?

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.669
[SHIZUKU]
Berkeley.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.463
[MIZUKI]
Oh, not Boston?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.215
[SHIZUKU] I guess the East
Coast is unstable these days.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.425
That's right.

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.719
There's some uproar over
the "Humanist" thing.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.221
It's been a pretty hot topic
in the news as of late.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.514
First there were witch hunts,

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.099
and now there are
"magician hunts"?

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:30.103
They say history repeats itself,
but this is ridiculous.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.897
By the way, Shizuku.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.524
Do you know who's going to
be taking your place here?

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:39.154
All I heard is she's
a girl about my age.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.589
[LINA sighs]

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.469
[LINA exhales]

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.222
‐‐[knocking]
‐‐[LINA] Hm?

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.473
[LINA]
Come in.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:11.019
Excuse me, Commander.
Are you thirsty?

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.938
I brought milk tea.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.189
Ben!

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.151
How wonderful, thank you.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.111
You are more than welcome.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.824
By the way, Commander.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.117
Is everything ready
for your departure?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.828
[LINA]
Yes, pretty much.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.664
[CANOPUS] Good. Make sure you
use this time to forget about

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.333
your duties for a little
while and enjoy yourself.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.586
It's not a vacation.
I'll be on a special mission.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.298
I'm anxious, actually.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.342
I've been assigned to
locate the suspected

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.928
Strategic‐Class magician.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.557
I don't really do
undercover work, so why me?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.059
I know my age
matches the profile...

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.311
But still...
There are so many others

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.355
who've gone through
specialized training.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.607
It'll be fine.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.819
If the target really is
whom we suspect it is,

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.154
we're talking about a
Strategic‐Class magician

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.407
who's responsible for
Scorched Halloween,

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.951
and is more dangerous
than a nuclear missile.

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:11.329
So I can see why HQ
would prioritize someone

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.581
with more fighting strength

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:16.459
over someone with spy training
when choosing their candidate.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.004
Yeah, I get that, but it
still feels weird...

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.047
Well, think about
it this way, then.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.592
The Commander's main duty
is earning the trust

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.469
of the suspect and trying
to throw them off balance.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.390
[LINA] Yeah... That definitely
makes more sense.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:34.227
Since my spycraft is pretty much
on the same level as an amateur.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.855
[CANOPUS] And that's why I think
it's even more imperative that

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.941
you make a point of enjoying
yourself while you're there.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.526
You're likely to
get any suspects

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.905
to let their guard down, too.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.448
Yes, you make a good point.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.742
I appreciate your
insight on this.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.624
Ben, I'm leaving you to watch
the fort while I'm away.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.334
There are deserters who
are still awaiting

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.169
well‐deserved punishment.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.588
And tracking them down
would normally be my duty,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.758
so I hate having to
make you do it, but...

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.927
...you're the only one
here that I truly trust

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.262
to take command
in my absence.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.973
You can fully depend
on me, Commander.

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.477
I know you're not
leaving yet, but fly safe.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:25.070
[MIYUKI] We understand,
Aunt Maya. Thank you.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.446
We'll speak later.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.074
Yes, of course...
And, Tatsuya?

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:29.950
[TATSUYA]
Yes , Ma'am?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.703
USNA's military
magician organization, Stars,

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.790
is currently searching for
the Strategic‐Class magician

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.209
who recklessly released
Material Burst.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.460
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.380
[MAYA giggles]

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.049
[MAYA]
So watch your back, Tatsuya.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.801
Yes, I understand.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.679
And with that said,
Happy New Year, you two.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:17.622
Oh wow! Miyuki looks amazing,
doesn't she?!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.666
Hey, Happy New Year, Tatsuya!

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.084
You look great!

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.544
That really suits you.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.796
Happy New Year to you, as well.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.881
That's flattering
on you, Honoka.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.427
Man, Tatsuya, you were
born to wear that.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.179
It's giving you some real
gangster boss vibes.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.514
I look like Yakuza?

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.432
[HONOKA, MIZUKI giggle]

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:39.436
[LEO] Hm? Wait a sec.
Who is this guy?

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.605
This is the head priest
of Kyucho‐Ji Temple.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.066
He's highly skilled in ninjutsu,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.986
the famous
Master Yakumo Kokonoe.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.113
He's my martial arts teacher.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.198
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.245
[GROUP chatters]

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.126
[YAKUMO] Hey, Tatsuya,
do you know who that is?

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.252
[TATSUYA]
No idea.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.879
[YAKUMO] Maybe she's
a foreigner who thinks

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.964
what you're wearing is unusual.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.220
What's wrong, Brother?

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.598
Is something over there
catching your eye?

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.351
Oh, she's pretty.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.605
[TATSUYA] Not nearly as
pretty as you, though.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.024
I don't think so.
I'm not going to let you

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.859
keep throwing me off
the scent like that.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.070
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.614
I really believe that
you're more beautiful.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.992
And besides, that's not why
I'm looking at her, anyway.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.453
[MIYUKI giggles]

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.414
[MIYUKI gasps] Is there
something suspect about her?

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.041
[HONOKA, MIZUKI, LEO]
Hm?

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.376
[LINA gasps]

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.714
[ALL gasp]

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.595
I suppose you could say that.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.223
I mean, that outfit
is rather peculiar.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.649
[MIYUKI] Indeed.
But that's not all, is it?

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.713
[LINA sighs]

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.132
[SILVIA]
Welcome home!

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.509
[LINA]
Silvie, you're back already?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.514
[SILVIA gasps]

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.349
[LINA]
What's the matter?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.644
[SILVIA] Lina, why are
you dressed like that?

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.855
Oh, it's a Kimono.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.606
In my attempt to
not stand out,

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.692
I did a little bit of
research on appropriate

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.153
Japanese attire for
visiting a shrine.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.904
It took longer than I thought.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.240
Does it look good on me?

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.618
Before I answer that question,
I have to ask you something.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.787
Oh, of course. What is it?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.331
When you were at the Shrine,
did you see any other girls

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.751
wearing outfits
similar to yours?

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:12.881
Huh. Now that you mention it,
I don't recall seeing anyone.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.257
[SILVIA sighs]

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.426
[SILVIA] Listen up!
I'm gonna be honest here!

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.887
That getup was a
stupid thing to wear!

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:19.637
Huh?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.681
[SILVIA gasps]
Don't be shocked!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.433
[SILVIA] The only place you
might see clothes like that

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.686
is in fanservicey
animation or comics!

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.147
Where did you even get
the idea to wear that?!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:32.775
I bet everyone was gawking
at you in that gaudy thing.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.194
Come to think of it,

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:37.530
I did notice the target gave a
little smirk in my direction.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.324
[SILVIA]
Commander.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.035
Let's scratch the rest of
your schedule for today.

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.579
Instead, I'm going
to carefully explain

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.164
modern Japanese fashion trends

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.458
and how you're supposed
to be following them.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.418
And I'll do it in a way...

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.129
...you can get it through
your thick skull.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.757
Okay.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.188
[ERIKA]
Hm...

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.649
[MIYUKI] Hi, everyone.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.027
[MIZUKI gasps]

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.404
That's the magical girl
from the shrine.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.574
Tatsuya, I'll introduce you.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.327
This is Angelina Kudou Shields.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.703
She's the exchange student,

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.206
and she'll be in Class A
with us from now on.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.251
Uh, Honoka, if you don't mind,
I'd feel more comfortable

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.795
if you introduced me
to everyone, and not just him.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:37.423
Huh...? Ah! I'm so sorry!

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.300
Well, that's our Honoka for you.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:42.553
She never changes, does she?

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.430
Why don't we start over.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:48.559
This is Angelina. She arrived
here recently from America.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.897
But, please, just call me Lina.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:55.984
[ALL]
It's nice to meet you.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.777
Nice to meet you, Lina.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:01.489
Are you by any chance related to
His Excellency Kudou?

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.284
I heard his younger
brother traveled to America,

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.120
and remained there to build
a life and raise a family.

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.248
Goodness, you're very
well‐informed.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.625
That happened quite
a long time ago.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.963
But, my maternal grandfather was
General Kudou's younger brother.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.882
It seems that link... is a
large part of the reason

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.385
I'm being allowed
to study here, now.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.852
Miyuki, are you ready to start?!

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.520
I'm ready when you are.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.689
You can do the countdown, Lina.

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:42.697
[LINA]
Three... two... one...

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.490
Go!

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.742
[grunts]

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.076
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.915
[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.670
[LINA gasps]

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.589
Aw! I lost again!

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.884
[MIYUKI] Heh. Looks like
I'm ahead by two, Lina.

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.011
[AUDIENCE chatters]

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.013
They were tied just
a little while ago.

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.557
If you looked closely,
the exchange student's casting

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.768
appeared to be slightly faster.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:16.564
Yes. But Miyuki's Interference
was far superior to hers,

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:20.151
and she took control of the
spell before it was complete.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:23.696
Was she prioritizing speed,
or power?

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.074
Instead of winning through
the use of ability,

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.659
I'd say she won
by pure strategy.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.745
Miyuki! One more time!

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:31.913
[chuckles]

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.332
I'm definitely
gonna win this one!

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:40.713
[MIYUKI] Brother, do you think
Lina is...

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:44.092
Yeah. She's likely Angie Sirius.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.887
The esteemed Commander
of Stars, USNA militaries.

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.306
The most powerful
magical force.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:51.682
The question is‐‐

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.185
Wait, based on what
I've heard about her,

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.563
she's considered to be
USNA's secret weapon.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.649
So why send her here?

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.526
Yes, exactly.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:04.070
After watching her for a week,

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:07.949
I can tell Lina isn't
cut out to be a spy.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.452
I'd guess the real spy
was acting independently.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:16.165
But Sirius is too important
to use as a simple decoy.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:19.335
No, assuming Lina is Sirius...

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.338
...a spy mission is
merely incidental.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.382
The real mission
is something else.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.384
A mission so important,

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.554
that USNA would send
Sirius overseas.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.722
What could it possibly be?

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.683
[TATSUYA]
I don't know.

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:37.311
I have no idea what
USNA is thinking.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.646
[LINA]
I'm back!

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.524
Hey there, Lina...
welcome home.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.818
Wow, Mia!
You decided to drop by?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.902
[MICHAELA]
Yes!

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:48.156
Pardon the intrusion... Major.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:51.659
[LINA sighs]
Don't worry about it. Sit down!

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.203
Silvie, get us some tea, please.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.955
[SILVIA]
Milk tea, right?

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.790
Would you like
another cup too, Mia?

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.751
U‐Uh, yes...
Thank you very much.

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.300
Now, about that
Strategic‐Class magician.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.635
Did you manage to
find anything, Silvie?

00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:12.805
I went through the entire
public database for a while,

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:16.893
but unfortunately I wasn't able
to find any new information.

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:19.020
Really? Nothing?

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.521
How about you, Mia?

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.607
You're undercover at
the magic University.

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.358
Have you heard anything?

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.944
No, I've still come up short.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.321
I'm sorry.

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.323
And how about you, Lina?

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:33.284
Have you gotten friendly
with the target at all?

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:37.288
Yes. I believe it's fair to
say we're on good terms.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.957
But I've learned
nothing of value, yet.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.920
And I have a feeling my cover
will be blown before that.

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.755
Wait, did something happen?

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.798
Uh‐huh. In fact...

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.092
[TATSUYA]
By the way, Lina...

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.093
[LINA]
Yes?

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.304
When it comes to the
name Angelina,

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.056
don't people go by "Angie"?

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.474
Or am I mistaken?

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.768
[gasps]

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.144
Oh, no. You're right.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.270
But the thing is...

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.648
...back in grade school there
was a girl named Angela

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:04.690
in my class,

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.777
but everyone would always
just call her Angie instead.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.071
And that's why you chose
to start going by "Lina"

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.782
as opposed to "Angie"?
How interesting?

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:14.784
[MICHAELA gasps]

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:17.036
Perhaps it was a coincidence?

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.748
I have no idea. I really don't.

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.293
H‐Heh. Oh, it's fine.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:27.004
I mean he's just a
high school student.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.881
Even if he does suspect me,

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.676
there is no way I'll
let him trip me up.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.526
[TATSUYA]
Lina...

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.695
Didn't expect you to be here.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.155
[LINA] You're in Course 2,
right, Tatsuya?

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.532
That's correct.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.242
[LINA] I was wondering
why your uniform

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.036
was different from
everyone else's in Class A.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.496
Miyuki explained it to me,

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.331
though she seemed kind
of annoyed about it.

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:03.541
[LINA giggles]

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.127
But then, when I asked
Honoka afterwards,

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.087
she said that you
easily rose to the top

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.256
of your first year class.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:15.261
That said, why do you pretend
to be an irregular student?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.597
That, I'm not
pretending at all.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.349
I really am an
irregular student.

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:22.685
The practical exam
grades three qualities:

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.771
your speed, your scope,
and of course, your strength.

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:26.897
However, in a battle,

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.733
victory and defeat aren't
ruled by the merits

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.151
of those things alone.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.861
As far as practical exams go,

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:35.406
I'm a poor student,
but I'm a great fighter.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:39.035
Aptitude for exams versus actual
combat are very different.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:42.663
I have to say,
I agree with that opinion.

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.541
Instead of being just
a talented student,

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:49.378
I'd like to become a magician
who's also useful in combat.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.672
[TATSUYA] Sounds like
your eager for a fight.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.760
You catch on quickly.
I'm impressed.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.181
[LINA grunts]

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.771
[TATSUYA grunts]

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.606
[gasps]

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.191
That was reckless.

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.818
[LINA grunts]
I figured you could dodge it.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.488
[TATSUYA] Are you planning
to explain all this?

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:19.742
Yes, but only if...
you let me go, first.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:23.037
In case you can't tell,
this hurts.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:26.165
[LINA grunts]
Jeez, that'll leave a mark.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.584
Excuse me, you tried to
put a hole in my face.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.920
I think it's only natural
for you to get a little pain

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.463
in exchange for that.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.465
I don't know why you're
being such a baby.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.718
A clump of Psion Particles
is hardly lethal.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.597
At worst, you'd only hallucinate
that you got shot with a gun.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.265
And you don't think
I was justified

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:45.976
in getting a little
rough blocking it?

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.562
[LINA sighs]
Fine, have it your way.

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.564
You win, I surrender!

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.319
[LINA] Please forgive
my rudeness, Tatsuya.

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.946
I'm very sorry.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:02.993
Forget it. And you can
stop being so polite.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.370
Behaving like you're high class

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.747
doesn't seem like
the real you, Lina.

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.333
Are you insinuating that
I'm not "high class"?!

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.543
[TATSUYA]
Doesn't fit your nature.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.378
[LINA grunts]
That's not true!

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.423
I was once personally invited
to tea with the president,

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:16.757
I'll have you know!

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:17.591
Oh, yeah?

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:18.384
[LINA gasps]

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:21.262
Only a few magicians ever
get to meet the president,

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:24.348
and you're one of them!

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.808
Well... whatever.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:26.767
[LINA]
Hm?

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:29.645
You were trying to
test out my skill, Lina.

00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:31.522
That's what it was, right?

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:35.192
Um, y‐yes.
It was simple curiosity.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.195
Very well. Then let's
consider it satisfied.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.240
And don't ever try to
test me again. Got it?

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.076
Aren't you going to ask?

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:44.952
About what?

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.871
Are you joking?

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.123
About who I
really am, obviously.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.833
You were gonna ask, weren't you?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.001
Yeah, I don't care.

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.461
[LINA gasps]

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.920
There are some things...

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:57.798
...that I find you're
better off not knowing about.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:01.427
[LINA grunts]

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.680
You're the biggest jerk
I've ever met, Tatsuya.

00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:15.441
[SILVIA]
Lina! Wake up!

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.650
[LINA gasps]

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.779
We have an emergency!
Go talk to Major Canopus!

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.822
[LINA]
Ben, what's going on?

00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:22.490
[CANOPUS]
Last month,

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.117
we found out the location
of the deserters.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.244
What the hell?
Are you kidding me?!

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.454
Where are they?!

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:29.663
[CANOPUS]
Japan.

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:30.539
Huh?

00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.833
[CANOPUS] We believe they
made landfall in Yokohama

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:35.127
and are currently
lying low in Tokyo.

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:39.924
But.. why Japan? And why
in Tokyo, specifically?!

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.218
[CANOPUS] HQ has decided
the best course of action

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:45.221
at this time is to send an
additional pursuit team.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:47.515
[LINA] Does the Japanese
government know about this?

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:50.684
[CANOPUS]
No, it's a covert operation.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.437
Commander, I'm going to relay
the orders you've recieved

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.439
from HQ.

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:58.567
"The mission previously
given to Major Angie Sirius.

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.528
is now her second priority.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:04.198
Her current primary objective
is to track down the fugitives."

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.665
[exhales]

00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:19.088
Understood, Ben. Please relay
that to headquarters.

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:21.507
[CANOPUS] Roger that.
Be careful, Commander.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.967
Over and out.

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:42.069
