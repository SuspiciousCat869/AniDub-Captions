Hey, sis, remind me.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.167
The job starts
tomorrow evening, right?

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.752
Yes, that's correct.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.045
I guess we should
be on the lookout

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:47.923
starting at about five o'clock.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.217
The enemy we'll be up
against goes by the name,

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:51.969
"the New Breed Front."

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.346
Our role is to prevent
terrorist attacks,

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.975
And scope out the enemy
organization to obtain any info.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.269
[AYAKO]
No, that's wrong, Fumiya.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.729
Did you read our
orders carefully?

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.731
Our job is to obtain intel.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.942
We need to locate
their headquarters,

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:10.404
as well as any source of
funding they may have.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.864
There's nothing about
terrorist attacks.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.867
That may be, but we can't
sit back and do nothing.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.414
[AYAKO] Fumiya, our emotions
can't override our priorities.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.374
In order to gather information,

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.585
we're going to detain
the terrorists.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.921
And if that prevents an attack
by default, it's all good.

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.633
But, see, if we prioritize the
prevention of terrorist attacks,

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:36.179
and kill them all, that would
mean we failed in our mission.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.140
Shut up, I know already.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.517
You say that, but do you really?

Among the Yotsuba families,

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.314
the Kuroba Family is in charge
of gathering intelligence.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:50.193
In other words, Fumiya, we worry
about missions, not justice.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.863
[FUMIYA] I said I know.
You don't have to lecture me.

Oh no, thank you.
I'm glad you invited us.

Mm‐hm. She said it sounded lame.

That's very Erika.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.913
But all that aside,

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.459
the view from the top floor
here is utterly breathtaking.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.336
[TATSUYA]
Tokyo Offshore Tower.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.255
Japan's first hyperbuilding.

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:19.384
360 floors above ground,
and 36 floors underground.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.344
I heard the Sky Lounge
on the top floor

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.431
is an impressive
2,000 meters high,

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:27.058
but I never could've
imagined this.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.643
Still, To be honest,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.729
being at this height
makes me a tad nervous.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.647
If there was an earthquake
or some accident,

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.274
would the building collapse?

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:36.401
Not a chance.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.779
This building is supported
by four gigantic pillars

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.073
under gyroscopic force
of the flywheels,

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.160
which have been installed on
the 36th underground floor,

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.995
then on every sixtieth floor,

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.164
starting with the
first one underground.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.083
[SHIZUKU] And the flywheels
wouldn't stop working,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.835
even during a power outage?

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.086
[TATSUYA]
If that happens,

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.963
the magicians who are
stationed underground

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.341
will activate the flywheels.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.052
They also reduce friction from
the vibration control dampers

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.553
supporting the pillars,

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:07.224
and enhance the base
isolation efficacy.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.059
So they're actively
involving magicians

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.103
in their safety measures?
Isn't that unusual?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.063
Yeah.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:16.441
So unusual, in fact,
it's practically unheard of.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.701
Sorry about this.

What a nice surprise.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.755
I had no idea the two
of you would be guests

at this grand affair.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:43.552
Yes. Our friend was kind
enough to invite us.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.680
And are you here on behalf
of our aunt, Mr. Hayama?

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.015
Yes. Madam requested
that I be here

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.810
to keep a focused
eye on everything.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.521
Does my aunt have concerns
about this party?

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.898
Is it something we
should worry about?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.442
It's because this is the first
time in history that any

building in Japan has used
magicians in this manner.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.407
Madam has expressed
legitimate apprehension

that something could

That's very kind of you.
I do appreciate it.

I'll talk it over
with my brother,

[MIYUKI]

Sakurai, here, is in fact the
niece of one Honami Sakurai,

who served as Madam Maya's
personal attendant.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.607
I believe she could be of highly
valuable service to you as well,

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.234
so I would simply ask
you to keep her in mind,

as the need truly could
arise at any time.

If I ever find I need
help with something,

then I'll already know
to count on you.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.498
I am most honored and
humbled by those words.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.250
And please, never hesitate
to ask anything of me.

But unfortunately, I think
we best be on our way.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.155
[FUMIYA] I have a visual
on two suspects.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.420
[FUMIYA] They're dressed in
power company work uniforms

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.716
of the submarine power cables.

But more importantly, what do
you wanna do about them?

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.812
[FUMIYA]
What do you think we should do?

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.731
As the family head ordered,

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.901
we're to detain agents
of the New Breed Front.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.403
But unless we can find a
way to apprehend them,

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.198
we won't know if they're
part of that group or not.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.493
The issue is, when do we
actually pull that off?

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.702
[FUMIYA]
When?

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:41.039
[AYAKO] If they try to tamper
with or damage the power cables,

do we catch them before
or after they're done?

on which would be best.

...they're plotting a
terrorist attack, aren't they?

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.229
It's only natural
we try to stop them.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.856
[FUMIYA grunts]
That's what I believe.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:10.985
If we were police officers,
that would make perfect sense.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.446
But frame it in terms
of our objective.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.532
If we simply wait until
they've dropped their guard

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.283
after completing their task,

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.619
wouldn't that be
the most efficient?

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:22.205
Jump in too early when
they're on edge and alert,

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.748
and we risk being
counterattacked

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.585
and failing our mission.
Do you understand?

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.419
Yeah, I get it.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.713

that possibility.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:31.881
But still...

Those terrorist bastards...

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.718
I won't let them get
away with this!

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.056
While that sounded a little
too macho for your disguise,

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.892
I want you to know that I do
agree with what you're saying.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.813
Your sense of justice may
be cheap, but it has some charm.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.357
What do you mean by "cheap"?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.777
[AYAKO] Well, then, I think
it's time we get to work.

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:53.653
Shall we?

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.904
[grunts]

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.964
First up, I'll use
Perfect Diffusion.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.843
Right after, I'll propel you
in using Mock Teleportation.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.344
Got that?

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.721
[FUMIYA]
Mm‐hm.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.188
You ready to go, Yami?

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.983
Go ahead. Fly me in.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.624
[FUMIYA]
Magicians...

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:51.461
But it looks like they haven't
noticed Perfect Diffusion yet.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.756
[FUMIYA chuckles] Seems like
Ayako's skills are improving.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.678
Here I go.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.600
[groans]

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.435
Hey! What happened?!

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.521
[groans]

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.653
[AYAKO]
Direct Pain...

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.863
There's less leakage
of residual Psions

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.824
than on our mission
three months ago.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.827
My brother's outdone
himself once again.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:29.707
[AYAKO] Fumiya is the offense,
and I'm the backup.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:33.044
It's important that the enemy
doesn't notice the backup.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.255
But the attacker's role
is to subdue the enemy

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.840
in a short amount of time.

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.511
You've become such a
dependable brother, Fumiya.

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:45.056
[AYAKO giggles] Though your
appearance says otherwise.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:58.861
Hey, Sis.
I'm all finished, here.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.240
Excellent work. I'll be
on my way shortly.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.491
[gasps]

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.744
Yami, no!

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:11.457
[FUMIYA gasps]
Sis!

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.709
Come on!

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.174
Did you see that?

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.051
Yeah. Going in?

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.970
[FUMIYA]
Mm‐hm. Sure am.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.558
[MAGICIAN C, D groan]

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.228
[FUMIYA gasps]

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.149
[AYAKO]
Wow, I'm impressed, Yami.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.608
[FUMIYA]
What can I say?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.493
It doesn't look like there are
any backup troops hiding here.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.078
I'm thinkin' you're right, Sis.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.620
[AYAKO]
Mm!

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.749
I don't any magicians watchin'
us, so guess we're in the clear.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.083
There you go again!

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.210
When you're a lady,
you don't drop your G's!

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.339
Oh, come on, stop givin'
me a hard time.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.217
[MAN A] Lady Yoru, Lady Yami.
Are you safe?

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.094
Safe and sound.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.388
And we've captured
two prisoners.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.058
You are aware of our
current location, yes?

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.393
[MAN A]
Affirmative. We have it.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.562
Shall we pick you up?

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.189
If you get close
enough to see us,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.066
then that should
be sufficient.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:19.901
[MAN A]
As you wish, Lady Yoru.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.114
[FUMIYA]
There we go.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:37.585
[gasps]

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.837
[TATSUYA]
What is this Psion wave?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.507
Wait. Is Fumiya
fighting someone?

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.054
[TATSUYA]
Ayako's there, too.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:51.432
It seems they've managed to
capture the enemy already.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.643
Skillfully executed.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.895
The enemy is "New Breed Front."

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.815
They're magician supremacists.

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:00.400
Excuse me, Brother.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.403
You look a bit lost in thought,
is something bothering you?

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.239
[SHIZUKU, HONOKA sigh]

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.701
No, I was just awed by the
caliber of guests at this party.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.416
Well, Yami,
mission accomplished.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:18.793
Okay. Prisoners incoming.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:19.961
[MAN A]
Roger that.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.051
[MAN A]
Two prisoners, confirmed.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.470
You're clear to
come aboard, Miss.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:30.721
Right.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.898
Excellent job, Miss.
Welcome back.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.483
Thank you very much.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.485
And you as well, Sir.
Great work.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:45.153
[LEADER A]
You idiot!

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:46.362
[ALL gasp]

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:49.198
It's "miss," not "sir"!
Get it right, dammit.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.701
He put aside his pride
to dress in that outfit!

00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:53.786
[LEADER A]
Show some respect, would you?!

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.454
‐‐[slap]
‐‐[MAN B grunts]

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.746
[FUMIYA groans]

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.373
So, sir‐‐I mean "miss"!

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.500
Apologies. It won't
happen again.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.585
Just stop already!

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.211
You're making it
worse than they did!

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.755
This doesn't have anything
to do with my pride.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.090
It's a disguise.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.968
Yes, of course. And it's
absolutely brilliant.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.220
Even we would never suspect
it was you under there,

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.096
Master Fumiya.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.931
And don't use my real name!

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.683
That makes the whole
thing pointless!

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:16.851
[AYAKO]
That's enough!

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.978
All of you just
need to calm down.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.814
We're wasting time here,
so let's get a move on.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.900
[MEN]
Right!

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:26.444
[AYAKO sighs] Yami, please try
to keep your cool.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.737
You got that?

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.197
[FUMIYA grunts]

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:41.876
Well, Shizuku, Honoka.
Congratulations to you both!

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.712
Yeah, congrats! Big Sis, Honoka.

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.047
Very well done.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.632
Both of you have
excellent grades.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.592
That's sincerely wonderful.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.219
That's so kind, thank you.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.720
Thanks a lot, Dad.

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.597
Oh, by the way, Honoka.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.557
I hear you've got a
crush on someone.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.100
Do you?

00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.352
[HONOKA gasps]

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:02.605
Oh! We'll have to take that
as a yes, then, won't we?

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.148
So tell us, what's he like?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.901
Please don't ask that,
Mr. Kitayama!

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.906
[MIYUKI]
Hey, Brother...

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.617
So, earlier. What were you
really thinking about?

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.160
Just be honest.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.456
It was Fumiya and Ayako.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:23.251
They were fighting radicalized
magicians near this building.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:24.252
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:28.214
So then, that must be why
Mr. Hayama is here.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.924
[TATSUYA]
It seems pretty likely.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:33.761
[TATSUYA] Miyuki, are you
familiar with a group

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.513
called the "New Breed Front"?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.764
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.891
Is that the one
consisting of magicians

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.894
who are standing up against
anti‐magic prejudice?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.354
That's right.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:46.691
These extremists claim magicians
are elite and they're trying

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.694
to build a society where
they reign supreme.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.738
They'll do almost anything
to liberate their comrades.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.824
Even resort to armed conflict.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.826
A force to be reckoned with.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.744
Do you know what
they're planning, Brother?

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.330
What could they even
want with this place?

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:04.959
I couldn't begin to imagine what
the New Breed Front's goal is.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:10.214
But for now, Fumiya and Ayako
have prevented the power cables

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.718
that provide electricity to
this tower from being sabotaged.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:18.055
I'm just hoping that's
where it actually ends.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.640
Yes, I agree.

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.616
[MAGICIAN E sighs]

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:40.119
Hey, boss. The power
supply is still on.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.331
[KOU] Damn. It seems they
failed to cut the cable.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.879
Alright, then. We move
right on to plan B.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.218
After incapacitating
all the security guards

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.220
and magicians on this floor,

00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.680
we'll commandeer
the control room

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:01.807
on the 34th underground floor.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.977
After that, we'll disconnect
the power to the flywheels,

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:08.189
and contain the control center
on the first underground floor.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.903
Until then, I want all you
to use your magic sparingly.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.321
[MAGICIANS]
Roger, that!

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.700
[KOU]
Everyone ready?

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:48.104
[KOU] Is there anyone left
on the bottom floor?

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.355
[MAGICIAN H grunts]

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.531
[MAGICIAN H]
No, nobody.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.575
It's empty, as our
prior info stated.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.119
[KOU]
Then we proceed as planned,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.955
and take over the 34th floor.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:06.872
[MAGICIANS]
Roger!

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:11.877
[PARTYGOERS chatter]

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.759
[PARTYGOERS gasp, shout]

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.220
[SHIZUKU, HONOKA gasp]

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.263
The lights dimmed.

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.682
What do you think
could have caused it?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:25.975
It's probably them.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.226
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.814
[SHIZUKU] The postural
stabilizing flywheels

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.107
have stopped moving?

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.360
Huh? Then the building...
Is it gonna...?

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:37.862
No, don't worry.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.239
The walls and pillars
aren't damaged,

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:42.700
so it won't collapse right away.

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.786
[KOU] Your attention.
We are the New Breed Front.

00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:48.247
Our objective is the sovereignty
of magicians' rights.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:52.752
[PARTYGOERS murmur]

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:57.173
[KOU] We intend no harm on any
of you, nor loss of human life.

00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.508
All we want, is for
you to bear witness

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.344
to what will happen
here tonight.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.848
They hijacked the control center
on the first underground floor.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.683
There should've been
security guards,

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:09.351
but they must have
taken them out.

Deep within this building,

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:15.775
magicians are being
enslaved and used for labor.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.777
Did he say "enslaved"?

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.987
I heard that they were
well taken care of.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.906
[KOU] And should disaster
happen to strike

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:25.868
on the 35th underground floor,
they're unable to escape.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.578
It's almost as if they're forced

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.706
to be buried alive
in such a scenario.

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.667
As a group seeking to restore
the rights of magicians

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.754
and as members of a
civilized society,

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.714
we cannot allow
these archaic rites

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:41.258
of human sacrifice to continue!

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.344
Even if they were
trapped inside,

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.303
as far as I know,

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:47.515
the underground can
convert to a safe shelter.

As a sign of protest,

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:52.686
we will detonate a bomb in
here one hour from now.

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.773
This is your warning
to evacuate immediately.

we would prefer to avoid

a mass casualty event,

Therefore, we hope you
make the far wiser choice

to become witnesses
to history.

nothing would happen

was too much for
me to try asking for.
