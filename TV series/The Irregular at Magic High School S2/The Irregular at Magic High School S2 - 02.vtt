Mm‐hm.

Instead of the organ trade,

why are they only taking that
ten percent of the blood?

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:28.458
Murder probably isn't
the intention.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.794
It's more likely they want
to keep the victims alive,

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.963
and use them as
plasma factories.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.965

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.738
[LEO] Mm... I saw them,
but I wouldn't say 'clearly'.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.823
[LEO] They wore a
hat pulled down low,

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.158
and a white mask.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.912
Also a long coat,
and under that, full body armor.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:47.498
So on looks and body type,
I'm useless.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.835
Although... I have a weird
feeling it was a woman.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:54.047
Wait. A woman matched you
swing for swing in a fistfight?

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:54.839
Are you serious?

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.300
Excuse me, but women
are strong as hell.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.220
Even an elementary school
girl could strangle a big man

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.388
to death if she
drugged him first.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.890
Yeah, that's true.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:04.891
But, still.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:09.103
Let's consider the possibility
that she wasn't a normal human.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.565
Are you saying you
know something about it?

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:13.733
[MIKIHIKO]
Hm...

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.612
I think Leo may have had an
encounter with a Parasite.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:23.076
What are you talking about?
You mean like a worm?

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:26.746
Paranormal Parasite.
A supernatural predator.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.249
Or just Parasite, for short.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.127
A ghost, evil spirit,
djinn, demon.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.630
Known all over the
world by various names,

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.882
in multiple incarnations.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.385
But essentially, they're all
evil beings that latch onto

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:43.096
humans and turn
them into something else.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.598
[TATSUYA] Is that what the
"vampire" really is?

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.393
[MIKIHIKO]
Leo.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.811
Uh, huh?

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.188
Do you mind if I take a look
at your ethereal body?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.648
It'll only take a moment.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.066
What's that?

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.776
[MIKIHIKO]
It's your spirit energy.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.404
The embodiment of life force.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.489
The monsters that
eat human flesh,

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.242
absorb spirit energy through
the blood and meat,

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:08.329
and that nourishes the creature.
That's the theory.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:11.207
It's common knowledge that
vampires drink blood to survive,

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:13.626
but I'm curious if it's
actually the spirit energy

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.212
they absorb with
it that they need.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:20.383
Yes. Although, if we're
talking non‐physical creatures,

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.136
all they should need is
just the spirit energy.

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:26.222
Ah, I see. So it wouldn't
be crazy to have vampires

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.975
that only live off
of spirit energy.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.519
If Leo lets me examine
his ethreal body,

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.188
I should be able to see
what was done to him.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.107
If I'm being honest,

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.026
right from the beginning,
I never thought these

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.403
vampire attacks were just
a series of bizarre,

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.738
random murders.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.865
That's what my intuition
as a practitioner

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.825
of Ancient Magic told me.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:48.828
It's just... that until now,
I had no proof.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.664
So I chose not to bring
the Parasites up before.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.001
But because of my reticence,
Leo was attacked.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.878
[LEO]
I'm in.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.213
Let's do it, Mikihiko.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.882
Are you sure?

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.634
Yeah! Scrutinize me
all you like.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.433
[MIKIHIKO grunts]

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.684
[LEO]
Hm.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.521
[LEO]
Did you find anything?

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.939
Uh, Leo?

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.734
Are you... an actual human?

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:21.819
Well, jeez.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.238
That's an interesting
conclusion to draw.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.115
Oh, all I mean by that is,

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.326
if a normal person lost
that much energy,

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:32.163
there's zero question they would
be totally comatose right now.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.123
But the fact that you
can sit up and talk,

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.666
enthusiastically even,

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.378
indicates an impressively
high level of fortitude.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.421
[LEO]
Mm. Not to brag,

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.674
but my body's made of
some pretty strong stuff.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.803
So... we're saying I lost
my strength last night

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.222
because the masked woman
leeched my spirit energy

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:52.141
when we fought.
Is that the gest of it?

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.143
I think so.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.895
However...

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.398
if she could absorb it
merely by touching you,

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:01.692
she shouldn't have
needed your blood.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.737
So why did this Parasite go
to the trouble of draining it,

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.365
when that was both
extra time and risk?

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:17.125
So is Leo going to be all right?

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.918
I'm worried about him.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.422
I hope he'll be able
to recover quickly.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:23.756
Mikihiko.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:24.715
[MIKIHIKO]
Mm?

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.968
I forgot to ask
you this before.

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.429
But are these Parasites
really that common?

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.014
Given what we know,
that doesn't track.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.226
No. You're right.
They seldom appear.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.979
But we're still fairly
certain about the verdict.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.899
That this demon is responsible
for the vampire murders, right?

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.192
[MIKIHIKO]
I believe so.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.903
Do you think it's a coincidence?

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:49.198
Indeed, historically, the closer
to the modern age you go,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.785
the frequency of demon sightings
decreases a great deal.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:56.164
It's a stretch to assume these
murders are just scattershot.

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.166
They're dripping with purpose.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:05.214
[ERIKA] Well, I know the truth
about this crazy situation.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:06.466
[LEO breathes deeply]

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.551
[ERIKA]
You're a real trooper, you know.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:14.307
Heh. A genuine compliment
from you. I'll take it.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.188
[ERIKA]
And I meant it. Honestly.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.071
[ERIKA]
Hey, Bro!

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.198
[TOSHIKAZU]
Hm?

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:33.701
[ERIKA] You were listening
to all that, weren't you?

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.704
Yes, and it was fascinating,
every word of it.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:41.751
So, if Yoshida's second son's
hypothesis is correct, then...

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.044
...what happens now?

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:46.339
In this situation, being right
or wrong doesn't matter.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.299
Even if it's only
for a short time,

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.177
anyone who steps through the
Chiba gate is one of ours.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.054
And I'm the one who
taught the basics

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:54.931
of that specific technique.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:56.682
We're talking my disciple here,

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.851
so I can't stand around
and do nothing.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.354
That's a reason
without any romance.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:03.314
It doesn't need romance.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.901
I don't know if this vampire
is a man or woman,

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.695
but if it wants a fight,
I'll give it one.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.160
Report, please,
and try to make it fast.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.120
Yes... of course.

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:20.623
So, right after cornering
Demos Second,

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:25.127
we then used a Cast Jammer
to block off his CAD.

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:29.215
But... it didn't work on him.
He withstood it easily.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:34.595
[gasps] Are you saying that
the Caster Jammer was broken?

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.640
[Q]
No, it operated normally.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.434
However, Demos Second told us...

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:44.772
...that he no longer had a
need for his C. A. D. anymore.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.608
He doesn't need CAD anymore...

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:49.902
So what you're telling me,

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.405
is that Sergeant Sullivan
became psychic?

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.156
That's affirmative, Ma'am.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.326
[ANGIE] But his Psionic wave
properties didn't change, right?

00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.619
If it had shifted,

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.414
I'm positive that both of us
what have noticed it.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.083
While I was pursuing
Sergeant Sullivan...

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.628
...I encountered someone who
appeared to be his partner.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.547
Were you not able to
measure that person's

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.674
Psionic wave properties?

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.843
I'm sorry, Ma'am. We tried.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:15.928
The only Psionic waves
we could recognize

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.556
were those of
Demos Second, and yours.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.266
Is that so?

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.770
[ANGIE]
From this day forward,

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.565
when we're tracking down a
fugitive, if you can help it,

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.276
try to refrain from
engaging with them.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.404
I will be the one to
deal with that part.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.989
[BOTH]
Ma'am, yes ma'am.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.952
[ANGIE] The chasers
weren't able to identify

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.204
"White Mask's" Psion waves.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.706
[SILVIA]
Is that so?

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:47.084
It seems the fugitives have all
gained various new abilities.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.678
I really wish I could
just stay like that.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.847
It's easier to maintain Parade,

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.600
than it is to outright
hide my magic use.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.687
[LINA]
All that aside,

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:09.732
I wonder why they're
attacking Japanese citizens.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.235
[SILVIA]
I do too.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:15.029
[LINA]
They're being pursued.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.907
Wouldn't you think that they'd
want to play it carefully,

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.576
and stay underground
as much as possible?

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:24.080
I don't have the answer
to that. But, still...

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.874
[LINA]
But still... what?

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.752
I have a feeling it might be
related to the unusual power

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:30.961
they've gained.

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.672
[LINA]
Unusual...

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.465
You mean that vampire power

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.426
drawing blood without
leaving a wound?

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:41.514
Well, "vampire" might not be
the exact word I'd use, but...

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.187
[SILVIA]
Hm?

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.272
[SILVIA] Lina?
I'm going to draw the curt‐‐

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:54.860
You mind if I ask
what you're doing?

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.362
[LINA gasps]
Oh, this is just...

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:57.196
[SILVIA sighs]

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:03.285
[MAYUMI] The vampire
has attacked a student

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.787
at this school.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.082
First year Class E's
Leonhard Saijo.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.418
[KATSUTO]
Yes, I've heard.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.045
[MAYUMI] As far as my family
has been able to determine,

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:16.424
the vampire has left 24
victims in its wake so far,

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.759
and that includes Saijo.

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.721
[KATSUTO] That's three times
what the media has reported.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:25.224
And were all of them in Tokyo
as well as the suburbs?

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:29.395
Just the Tokyo metro area,
concentrated in the city center.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.356
So, the police don't know
who all the victims are.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.444
However, the Saegusa
family does...

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:37.528
[gasps]

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.865
[KATSUTO] Does that mean one of
the victims is related to you?

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.576
[MAYUMI]
Hm! Well, you're half‐right.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:46.162
The victims that the
police don't know about

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:49.415
are all magicians who've
been assisting us.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.208
Apparently, all the others...

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.085
...were already
practicing magicians,

00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:56.630
or had magic potential
to be cultivated.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.550
Then, are you saying the
killer is going around

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.469
hunting magicians?

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:06.015
Jumonji, please.
You're scaring me.

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.100
[KATSUTO gasps]
Sorry.

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:12.480
[MAYUMI] But anyway, yes,
I think it's safe for us to say

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:16.192
it's magicians the vampire
is targeting specifically.

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:19.111
If the killer has the power
to harm Saegusa magicians,

00:21:19.153 --> 00:21:21.071
then it's most likely
an super soldier

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.991
or another magician doing it.

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:27.912
Furthermore, odds are the
killer is a foreigner.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.080
Have there been any suspicious
foreigners who have

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.708
entered the country around
the time the killings started?

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.418
Good question.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.129
There are quite a few overseas
student magicians as well as

00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:40.216
magic technicians from the
USNA in Japan right now.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.968
We have one exchange student

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.929
currently here at
our school, too.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:50.351
Tell me, Jumonji. Do you
think she's suspicious?

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:54.104
She's definitely suspicious,
but I doubt she's the killer.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.899
I do feel like she might
be involved somehow.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.611
But for now, I think it's safe
to put her on the back burner.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.367
Oh, and Jumonji,
my father, or rather,

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:11.747
Koichi Saegusa, the head of the
Saegusa family, sends a message.

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.583
The Saegusa family
wishes to have an alliance

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:16.293
with the Jumonji family.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.005
[KATSUTO grunts]

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:23.467
After our discussion here,
I have concluded...

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:26.971
...my family cannot
avoid this, either.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.430
We'll cooperate.
