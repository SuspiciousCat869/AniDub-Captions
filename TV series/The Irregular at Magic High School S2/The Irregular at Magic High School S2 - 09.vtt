00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.105
[ALL]
Uh...

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.191
Tatsuya, well, uh,
actually we...

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:50.942
[TATSUYA]
What?

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.153
Are you gonna tell me you
let the parasites escape?

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.320
[ALL gasp]

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.613
[TATSUYA sighs]

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.074
I'm not going to get mad
about something like that,

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:58.992
so don't worry.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.452
We can't do anything
about them now, anyway.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.204
No, wait, that's
not it, Tatsuya!

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.875
That's right! They totally
didn't escape from us!

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.668
Well, I mean, they did, I guess.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.753
But it wasn't what you think...

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.592
Someone just swooped
right in and grabbed 'em.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:18.094
Really? Someone was
strong enough to do that?

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.847
It may sound like we're
acting like sore losers,

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:21.973
but to be honest,

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.350
they weren't that strong
in terms of ability.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:27.103
But they came fully armed,
and ready to fight.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.897
Their suits shocked me
when I punched them.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.398
I've never seen that before.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.651
Every time I hit one,
powder flew out everywhere.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.152
Damn it.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.155
I knew I should have brought
a weapon with longer range.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:39.908
Is that so?

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.536
And then they took the parasites
away on this gigantic airship.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:45.413
I'm mad just thinking about it!

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.791
Well, at any rate, you're lucky
nothing worse happened.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.753
Wait, Tatsuya, are you saying
you know who they were?

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:52.712
I do.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.715
If they used specialized gear
and a stealth equipped airship,

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:59.010
there's only one answer as to
which entity is behind all that.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.304
It has the Japan Ground
Defense Force's

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.348
counterintelligence
Section Three.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.059
Then, if we know who we're up
against now, don't we also

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.519
have a good idea where
they've taken the parasites?

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.314
[TATSUYA] We won't know that
until we know what they want.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.815
[ERIKA, MIKIHIKO sigh]

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.525
Yeah that's right...

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.194
They're a government outfit,

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.696
so they can probably have all
the bases they would need.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.990
Well, I'm sure they
have a specific budget.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.785
They can't just have,
like, a hundred of them.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.663
Regardless, they're likely
hidden all over the place,

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.332
so even a thorough search
wouldn't uncover them.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.502
I mean, we don't really
have to worry much.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:35.672
We just have to make sure
nobody can barge in this time.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.174
So we'll just have
to set a trap.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.425
[ALL gasp]

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.225
[AYAKO] Miss Balance.
Good morning to you.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.811
I apologize for calling
so early, Colonel.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.396
Oh, it's you again.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:54.232
Did you have something important
you wanted to share with me?

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.358
Indeed.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.237
Yesterday evening, the JGDF
counterintelligence department's

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.490
Section Three apprehended
multiple parasites.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:06.035
We discovered one of them is a
magician who was previously part

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.663
of the USNA military forces.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.874
Which means the parasites
have begun moving again?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.127
[AYAKO] It's possible that
after the parasites' vessels

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:17.297
were destroyed, they shortly
found new hosts.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:20.091
Here are the ones that
are currently in custody.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.929
Three parasites have now
been taken prisoner.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.056
This one is the only one of
them we have been able to

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.516
identify thus far.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.269
But if you wish, we would be
more than happy to tell you

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.938
where they are being held.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.691
Yes, please do, Miss Kuroba.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.027
Very well, consider it done.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.239
[BALANCE sighs]

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.959
[TATSUYA] That's about it.
I think that airship belonged to

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.128
Counterintelligence
Section Three.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.965
And it's rumored to have
ties to the Saegusa family.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:04.052
If you're considering using the
parasites for military purposes,

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.303
it's risky.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.389
We don't know how to
destroy them for sure.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.100
So, I think we should
seal them for now.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.353
Counterintelligence
Section Three?

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.230
Despite being a Saegusa,
I had no idea,

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.649
so I'm fairly surprised
you know about it.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.610
I would appreciate it
if you didn't ask

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.571
what my information source is.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.948
[MAYUMI] Well, you probably
have enough on your own plate,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.159
so I won't.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.035
But tell me.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:31.162
Why didn't you mention
that you were going out

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.206
to capture the parasites?

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:36.084
[TATSUYA] Because I figured
the more people I brought along,

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:39.003
the more it would
arouse their suspicion.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.130
Oh!

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.341
I suppose that
does make sense.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.428
Anyway, as for the
reason you came here,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.598
I assume you want me to explain
all this to my father.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.476
And convince the bureau to give
the parasites they snatched

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.186
back to Erika and the others?

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:58.022
[TATSUYA] I won't tell you to
make them give them back,

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.524
but once you've
verified the reason

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.317
they took the parasites aways,

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:04.028
if they're attempting anything
other than sealing them,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.155
I'd like you to warn them off.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.199
Tell them, if word gets
out that the bureau is

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.909
exploiting the parasites,

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.413
and also, if magicians
suffer because of it,

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:18.000
they'll be the ones responsible
for paying for the damages.

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.002
That's quite an
unsettling thought.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:22.964
Considering what's been
happening in the USNA,

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:27.009
I believe the threat is
completely warranted.

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.261
[MAYUMI grunts]

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.890
Then it's settled.
I'll go talk to my father.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.560
But I unfortunately
can't promise any results,

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.395
so try not to
expect too much.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.897
Because unlike one
Katsuto Jumonji,

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:43.317
I don't exactly have
free reign over my family.

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.694
[TATSUYA]
I appreciate it.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.955
[phone rings]

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.124
[TATSUYA]
Oh, it's Saegusa...

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.375
[gasps]

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.607
What is this?

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.957
[TATSUYA]
Lina...

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.209
[gasps]

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.386
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:55.681
[TATSUYA sighs] They make
her do such cruel things.

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.226
Brother, wait.
It couldn't be...

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.436
Was that Lina?

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.812
Probably.

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:04.524
[TATSUYA]
A homicidal act,

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.902
with no consideration
for the "contents" within.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.531
The goal was only to burn
the "containers" to cinders.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.115
An execution.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.329
[TATSUYA] Assassination is
lonely, joyless work.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.250
[TATSUYA] Unless one's
personality is attracted to it,

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.211
it's far too heavy
for a teenage girl.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:28.256
So heavy she can't
possibly sustain it.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:30.341
Little by little,
it will crush her soul.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.803
And Lina doesn't have the
affinity to be an assassin.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.937
Hello. Can you
hear me out there?

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.397
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.190
Relax, Miyuki.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.693
This room has no
mics or cameras.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.778
He has no way of
seeing or hearing us,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.697
so it's a one‐sided
conversation.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.323
[RAY]
Hope you guys don't mind!

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.701
I'll start with an introduction.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.204
Pleased to meet you, my name
is Raymond Sage Clark.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.582
I'm one of the Seven Sages.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.417
[TATSUYA]
The Seven Sages...

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:09.088
I heard about you from
Tia‐‐no, I'm sorry‐‐

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.340
I meant to say Shizuku.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:12.967
It's an honor, Tatsuya.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.468
Oh, I see.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.221
This guy must be
Shizuku's info source.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.432
[RAY]
I'll cut right to the chase.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:21.142
I'm the one who
told Angie Sirius

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.728
about Counterintelligence
Section Three.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.772
But apparently, she somehow
already learned of it

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:29.025
before I informed her.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.401
Regardless of that,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.321
I wanted to make sure
you were in the loop, too.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.364
I think you'll find what
I'm about to tell you

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.033
highly beneficial.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.994
The magician boycott movement
raging in the States right now,

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.164
and the ones gaining
traction in Japan...

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.957
...were set up by
one of us Sages.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:47.376
And that would be
Gide Sage Hague.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.836
Wait, what?

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.881
[RAY] Gide Hague,
better known as, Gu Jie.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.966
A stateless former
Chinese citizen,

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:56.719
and head of international
terrorist cell, Blanche.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.721
He's the boss of Hajime Tsukasa,

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:02.350
the head of Blanche's Japanese
branch, whom you caught.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.061
And also a senior member
of Richard Sun's group,

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:07.813
the previous leader of the
international crime syndicate,

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.315
No‐Head Dragon.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.942
In No‐Head Dragon,
they called Gu Jie

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.695
"the Black Elder",
or "the Great Hague."

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.156
Oh, and I should
probably clarify.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.158
Just because he's one
of the Seven Sages,

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.869
doesn't mean I'm in
conspiracy with him.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:25.289
Seven Sages isn't the name
of a single group, you see.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.291
It refers to the seven operators

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.169
with access privileges
to Hlidskjalf.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.171
Hlidskjalf, huh?

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.299
I'd heard about it once, but I
thought it was only a rumor.

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.551
So does it really exist, then?

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.345
[RAY]
Allow me to explain.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.514
It's one of the additional
expansion systems

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:45.017
for Echelon III, the global
monitoring system.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.187
However, since it uses a
backdoor in Echelon III,

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.439
perhaps it's more accurate
to call it a hacking device

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:53.359
embedded within the main system.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.320
Anyway, Hlidskjalf collects
information from

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.446
throughout the world,

00:19:57.488 --> 00:20:01.617
and gives information along with
search matches to the operators.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.744
The system itself
determines which people

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.996
are most qualified
to be the operators,

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:09.375
and we have found no logic
as to its decision protocol.

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.336
Apparently, it's by
random selection.

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.296
[TATSUYA]
This is completely insane.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.507
[RAY] And wielding it comes
with very extensive risks

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.759
to those who use it as well.

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.721
The operator's search
history is recorded.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.432
In fact, scanning search
history records is how

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.475
I found out... about Gide Hague.

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:28.227
[TATSUYA] Then wouldn't
that mean Gide Hague

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.604
knows Raymond Clark's
identity, as well?

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.316
[RAY] When Blanche's Japanese
branch went underground

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:37.361
and No‐Head Dragon lost its
Japanese headquarters,

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:41.490
Hague lost access to all their
methods to influence Japan.

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:42.825
He was the one who arranged

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.453
the parasites' invasion
of Japan, too.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.038
His objective is to rebuild
his spy base there

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.417
by taking advantage of
the chaos it's created.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.587
I have now deciphered,
that his goal is to eliminate

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:58.215
any and all magic...
through social methods.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.718
If he succeeds,
the Great Asian Alliance,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.179
which is generally
behind the magic curve,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.474
will quickly see its military
might overpower Japan's.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:09.143
To reign over a world
devoid of magic.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.686
I believe that's what Hague,

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.314
and the people behind him,
are truly pursuing.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.691
Some of this seems
like a bit of a stretch,

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.694
but as a whole, I admit
it does make a lot of sense.

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:21.781
And I assure you,
that is not what I want.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:24.450
This may seem romantic,
so you can laugh at me,

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.786
but I think magic is a way
toward helping humans

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.621
progress as a species.
