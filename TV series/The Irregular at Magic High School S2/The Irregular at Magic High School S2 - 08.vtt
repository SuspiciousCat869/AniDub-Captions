Early this morning,

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:20.521
the JMDF secured a small
Navy‐affiliated USNA vessel

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.148
in Japan's offshore territory.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.068
Apparently, it had begun
drifting because it sustained

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.153
a stalled engine,
but a high‐ranking

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.532
military attache at the
USNA's Tokyo embassy

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:35.452
was aboard the ship, so the
JMDF is currently verifying

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.955
all the facts with
the USNA military.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.959
At least we know it didn't
run afoul of bad weather.

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.003
Maybe the issue first stemmed
from their power source.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.215
With how far automation's come,
a simple human error

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:50.968
wouldn't have caused them
to lose their steering.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.096
Yes, good point.
That makes a lot of sense.

It's a country's regular army.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.939
Even assuming our aunt
issued a direct order,

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:06.358
this was too rash a response.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.362
Which clearly means, by the
time I finally contacted her,

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.115
their forces were
already locked in position.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.660
Well, I'm going to
put on my uniform.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.037

Aunt Maya already called to
tell me the news earlier.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.467
And yet,

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.722
I pretended to be completely
ignorant of the situation.

take to keep him at my side.

'Cause if it's decided that
I can do my job independently,

as leader of the Yotsuba,

he might leave me, and one of
my worst fears will be realized.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:01.455
Eventually, I'm going to have to
get married to someone, as well.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:04.583
They'll expect me
to have children.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.629
All of that... is required for
a Yotsuba leader candidate.

[PIXIE]
What do you require of me?

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.005
I have very specific
questions for you

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.299
about all the
vampire incidents.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.845
Now, first off, regarding the
victims' massive blood loss.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.598
Were the parasites
responsible for that?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.807
[PIXIE]
Yes.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.352
[TATSUYA] Hm... Why was blood
from a living person needed?

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.397
[PIXIE] Blood loss was
in fact not our intent,

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.067
merely a side effect of
mistaken propagation.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.946
Said propagation process
initiates by severing one part

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:43.825
of ourselves and fusing
it into a recipient.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.578
The separate body spreads
through the blood vessels

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.830
while absorbing
Psions and Pushions

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.540
present in the bloodstream.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.667
It permeates the recipient's
physical body,

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.669
by supplanting their
blood with itself.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.506
[TATSUYA] Wait. That means
you're bodies of information.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.716
You don't have actual mass.

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:03.053
What happens to the blood
plasma once it's exchanged?

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.848
[PIXIE] It is used, to modify
their body during assimilation.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.892
Should assimilation fail,

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.353
the separate body is
subsequently released

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.356
from the host form
as pure vitality.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.399
[TATSUYA]
So that's how it works...

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.152
[PIXIE] Should permeation
of the body succeed,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:22.322
we can control its
ethereal form.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:25.575
An interplay between both
physical and data bodies

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.203
The same basic rule of magic.

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.789
[PIXIE] If we can access and
merge with the recipient's

mental hub through
their ethereal body,

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.293
our propagation succeeds.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.505

Before you inhabited that body,

With a common objective
in your sights.

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:36.738
Our esteemed leader,
Maya Yotsuba,

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.450
has concerns over your grossly
excessive interference.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.578
She said that since our nations
are allied with one another,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.955
she did not want to turn
this affair into a trigger

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.707
for any sort of conflict.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.709
I see. Is that a warning?

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:52.337
Will you pull the trigger
if we don't withdraw?

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.550
[AYAKO giggles]

00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.511
Colonel, how did you
sleep last night?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.721
did you have trouble?

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:02.764
[gasps]

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:05.141
What the‐‐ Wait, that was you?!

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.893
Why, whatever do you mean?

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.062
Respectfully, Colonel,
you don't look well,

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.356
so I was offering my
concern for your health.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:15.443
I assure you that I did not
mean to offend you in any way.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.402
Now, please.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:19.739
Allow your nerves to settle
so we can discuss this.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.033
[AYAKO] If at all possible,
our purest intention

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.370
is to build a friendly working
relationship with you.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.830
Just how friendly
are we talking?

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:28.915
Surely by this point,

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:32.835
you're well aware of the
great power Yotsuba holds.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.754
And in the same respect,

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:38.258
we are fully informed
of your power as well.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.218
Our leader says that if
you would soon arrange

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.720
to withdraw from
this incident, Colonel,

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:47.141
she promises certain gratitude
is owed to you, personally.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.894
She cannot make
that any clearer.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.896
If there is an opportunity
in the future,

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.857
we would be willing
and able to assist you.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.576
Yes, fine.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.459
[MEMBER A] Observation target
approaching the city.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.586
Sister and two others with him.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.381
Running photo verification
ID before the train.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.343
That's a classmate of theirs.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.261
Peculiar taste,

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.680
bringing his sister along
on a date like that.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.515
Who's the other one?

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.476
[MEMBER A] Ah, her.
She's not actually human.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:34.147
It seems to be a type P‐94
Humanoid Home Helper.

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.773
They're pretty far
from home right now,

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.775
so where could he
be bringing it?

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.526
Hey, Chief,

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:42.322
the train the target's riding
on just now changed course.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:45.867
[CHIEF A]
Akasaka... No‐‐Aoyama?

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.037
Station operatives in police
uniform along Aoyama Road!

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.205
If the target group
tries to use magic,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.458
pretend to arrest them
and bring 'em in!

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.880
[gasps]

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.257
Brother, what's wrong?
You hear something?

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.176
Someone is spying on us.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.647
[TATSUYA]
I'm pretty positive it's...

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.858
...Counterintelligence
Section Three.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.110
[gasps]
Hm!

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.990
‐‐[beeping]
‐‐[AGENTS gasp]

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.825
Wh‐What kind of
signal is this?

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.786
[AGENTS gasp, shout]

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.037
[grunts]

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.833
Hey, Tatsuya!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.086
You don't have to worry about
those guys watching us,

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.546
because I just put
them all to sleep!

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.840
[TATSUYA]
Hm! Nice work, Honoka.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.093
I'm sure they've got some
friends right behind them,

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.761
so let's get out of here.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.224
[HONOKA giggles]

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:58.106
[FUJIBAYASHI sighs]
What a troublesome young lady...

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.608
[KUDOU]
But what remarkable skill, too,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.152
taking down four foes at once.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.864
Her name is Honoka Mitsui,
if I'm not mistaken?

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.368
[FUJIBAYASHI]
That's right, Grandfather.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.869
Intriguing.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.413
Taking into consideration

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:17.250
her family name and
specialty magic type,

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:21.712
I wonder if she's part of the
Elements bloodline of light.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:31.264
[PIXIE] Master, three parasites
are approaching us.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.099
[TATSUYA]
So they did show up.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.230
[grunts]

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:50.324
Tatsuya Shiba,
we would like to talk.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:53.161
[TATSUYA] To make things easier,
what should I call you?

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.997
Marte.

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.416
[TATSUYA]
Alright, Mister Marte.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.668
What do you want?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.713
Well, you see, we demons
have no further intent

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.507
to engage in any hostile
actions toward you,

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.384
the magicians of Japan.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.887
In exchange for promising
to end hostilities

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.890
towards you and your friends,

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:18.352
we demand that you turn that
robot over to us immediately.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.520
[TATSUYA]
Hmph.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.523
Perhaps you should try
being a little more polite.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.400
I'm afraid I can't
agree to that.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.944
If you want me to
hand it over to you,

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.031
then you need to give me a
good enough reason to do so.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.909
I didn't think explanation
was necessary.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.119
In fact, there's really
no reason for you all

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.580
to act in that robot's defense.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:40.208
I think we're the ones
who get to decide that.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:43.794
Our comrade is currently
imprisoned inside

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.714
this automaton, and we
desire they be released.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.217
Are they not allowed
a robot as a host?

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.219
Our mutual connections
are much stronger

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.721
and more powerful than
those of you humans.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.265
Is the fact that we only want
to retrieve our comrade,

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.518
a living creature,
one with infinite purpose,

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:01.354
out of an ultimately cold
and lifeless vessel

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.897
something that's
difficult for you

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.315
to get through
that head of yours?

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.817
No, I understand you.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.778
But how will you do it?

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.863
We will destroy the machine.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.990
Should the current host
be lost in process,

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:17.078
we can easily move to a new
one without making a fuss.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.412
Ah, well, then.

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:21.582
That's his offer, Pixie.
What say you?

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.292
Do you wish to be
released from this body

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.169
and given to them?

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.504
[PIXIE]
No, I don't!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.381
I am me, no one else.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:32.260
My wish is to belong only
to you henceforth, Master.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.262
That is who I am!

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:37.306
I have no interest anymore
in what original form

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.850
I took prior to
inhabiting this husk,

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.228
even less so where I
first received the wish

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.397
that constituted my core!

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:48.651
Please! I do not want
to stop being me!

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.864
Well, that's what she says.
Guess that's it, Brother.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.241
Definitely.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.910
Anyway, I'll wager you're
intuitive enough

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.204
to figure out what our
answer will be already,

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.373
but before I spell
it out for you,

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.709
I have a few more questions.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.335
You have proven
to be more foolish

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:08.588
than we assumed, Tatsuya Shiba.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.464
How disappointing.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.507
Fine, then.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.468
Ask your trivial questions,
if you must.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.430
Earlier, you said you
had no intention

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.725
of engaging in hostilities
against magicians, correct?

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.852
So, why wasn't it
against people,

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:25.688
instead of against magicians?

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.898
If we had accepted
your request,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.193
you demons wouldn't show
aggression toward us.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:34.030
How would you act toward
non‐magician people?

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.658
[TATSUYA]
After you destroy Pixie's body,

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.911
what vessel would you
force her to inhabit next?

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.872
Answer me.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.540
[chuckles]

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.417
You possess only
superficial cunning,

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.128
that requires no
actual intellect.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:49.837
[HONOKA, MIYUKI gasp]

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.298
[MARTE] We're saying we renounce
our rancor towards you.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.217
Is that alone not a
satisfactory offer?

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.553
We demons are
incompatible with humans,

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.890
tantamount to how magicians are
different from other people.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.517
[MARTE]
Am I wrong? Try and prove it.

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.644
Really?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.438
My host was a
magician as well.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.232
And that is why I understand

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:13.694
the appalling way humans
dare to treat magicians.

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.155
To humans, they're nothing
more than tools,

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.949
lab rats and objects.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:22.536
A magician's wishes are
too trifling for humans.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.332
These people think of nothing
more than using you

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:30.252
and then discarding you,
yet you continue to help them.

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.004
Surely you must have
your own wishes,

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.256
your own goals, your own
hopes and purpose.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.758
Don't you, Shiba?

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.259
[TATSUYA grunts]

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:40.012
[TATSUYA] You're even more
predictable than I thought.

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:40.763
[MARTE]
Hm?

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:44.642
[TATSUYA] For someone who
just treated me like an idiot,

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.186
you're pretty dumb, huh?

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.979
[MARTE growls]

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.066
[TATSUYA] Okay, you say you
won't harm magicians anymore.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.984
That's fine. It really is.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.363
But, you've already hurt many
of my magician friends,

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.365
some of them quite severely.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:02.451
So why should I believe you
won't hurt any more of them

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:05.121
when you haven't yet uttered
a single word of apology
