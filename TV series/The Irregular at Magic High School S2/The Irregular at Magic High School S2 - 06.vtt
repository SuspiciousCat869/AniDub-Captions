00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.030
Ah, so you noticed!
Good eye, Lina.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.157
I had always thought Valentine's
chocolate‐giving

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.409
was a custom exclusive to Japan.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.119
[LINA]
No, not at all.

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.747
But giving chocolates on
that day is a famous part

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:41.998
of Japanese culture.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.500
Is that so?

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.293
Who will you give
your chocolates to?

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.837
[LINA] Even you're asking
me that, Miyuki?

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.340
I hadn't planned on giving
chocolate to anyone.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:51.841
Not even the "friend" one?

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.594
[LINA] If I had to choose who
to give individual gifts to,

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.013
it would only lead to
all sorts of problems.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.933
[MIYUKI] That's too bad.
Being so popular must be hard.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.184
[LINA grunts]

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.479
Well you know, you're amazingly
popular yourself, Miyuki.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.231
Who gets your chocolate?

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.358
Will Tatsuya get the real thing?

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.527
What exactly are
you saying, Lina?

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.571
Brother and I are
just siblings, nothing more.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.490
It would be strange
for me, as his sister,

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.117
to give him
homemade chocolates.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.409
Oh, uh...

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:23.164
[MAYUMI hums]

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.583
[IZUMI, KASUMI gasp]

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.418
This is weird, Izumi.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.171
I have no idea what she's doing.
What do you think?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.882
Well, it looks like she's
making chocolates,

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:35.552
but there's something
a little off to me...

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.845
Hey, Kasumi...

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.889
About the chocolate that
sis is using to bake...

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.724
[KASUMI]
Oh, yeah, wow!

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.854
It's the 95 percent cocoa,
zero percent sugar kind.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.522
[KASUMI]
And that bag...

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:51.109
[IZUMI]
It says... espresso powder.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.445
[MAYUMI giggles]

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.989
[KASUMI]
That's not normal.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.449
I wonder if something
bad happened to her.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:03.496
[MAYUMI continues giggling]

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.211
[HONOKA pants]

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.797
[HONOKA]
Hey, Tatsuya! Good morning!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.382
Good morning, Honoka.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.049
[MIYUKI]
Good morning.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.968
And Good morning, Miyuki.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.349
[whimpers]

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.104
[HONOKA gasps]

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.026
[HONOKA gasps]

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.738
Um, Tatsuya, could I...?

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:37.614
Could I...

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:41.409
...maybe have a moment of
your time, if that's okay?!

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.161
Of course.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.038
I think I'll go on ahead.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:48.374
I'll just see you in class when
you get there, alright, Brother?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.502
Now's your chance. Good luck!

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.754
[HONOKA gasps]

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.220
[gasps]
Um, for you!

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.639
[HONOKA] ...for you...
for you... for you...

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.808
[gasps]

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.727
Wow, Honoka. Thank you.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.985
Oh, Tatsuya! What's this?

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.112
[TATSUYA]
A little something in return.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.822
It's independent of next month,

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.158
so you can expect
something then, too.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.329
[HONOKA] I, um...
Is this...? No, I can't...

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:29.832
Oh, my... uh, Tatsuya,
may I open it, or...?

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.542
Yes, of course.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.253
[gasps]

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:41.803
[HONOKA gasps] Thank you!
They're just beautiful!

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.972
I'm going to treasure
them forever!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.624
[LEO]
Yo, Tatsuya!

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:12.875
Heh!

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.464
The day just got started,
but you look pretty beat.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.258
And you seem like
a brand new man,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.093
even though you just
got out of the hospital.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.594
Of course!

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.597
Morning. Back to your old
self again, huh, Leo?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.558
This is your first
official day back?

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.893
Glad to see you recovered
faster than we thought.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:34.522
Sure did! Thanks for coming to
visit me so often, by the way.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.985
[MIZUKI]
Valentine's Day chocolate.

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.695
I got one for each of you!

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:41.779
Oh, thanks!

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.948
Very much appreciated.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.241
How nice of you...

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.660
[ERIKA] I heard you got out
of the hospital early, Leo.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.454
Was it so you could
get chocolate?

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.039
No, of course it wasn't!

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.790
Guess I hit the
nail on the head!

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:53.458
[LEO growls]

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.001
Morning, Erika.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.711
You're a little late today.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.087
Good Morning, Tatsuya.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:01.341
February 14th is an
awful day every year.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:04.844
And it's because we've got so
many men around in our dojo.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.679
That does seem like
a lot of work.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.724
[ERIKA] It totally is!
And it's so annoying.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:13.269
We can strike this holiday from
the calendar for all I care.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.271
Miki, you must have it good.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.230
[gasps]

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.233
Your students. A lot of them
are girls, aren't they?

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.361
You must get your pick of
the litter every year.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:23.696
Wait, Yoshida... is that true?

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.406
No, it's not true at all!

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.325
Besides, if I were
that flip and frivolous,

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.786
I could never get any
real training done!

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.705
You're not getting
away with that, Miki.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.208
So, tell me, just what
about our dojo are you

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.542
trying to say is frivolous?

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:40.546
Uh... I didn't mean
"frivolous" exactly...

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.340
[ERIKA]
Then, what did you mean?!

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.591
Uh...

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.719
[LEO chuckles]

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.560
[EIMI]
Oh, look! There he is!

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.145
Subaru, over here!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.230
Hey, Shiba! Wait!

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.565
[SUBARU]
Hey, Eimi, don't run!

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.861
Would you please
accept this gift?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.740
Satomi. This is a
bit dramatic, even for you.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:08.741
What is this?

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.076
This, uh, yes‐‐right.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.494
It's a gesture of gratitude.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.328
[EIMI giggles]

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.831
From freshman girls...
at Nine School.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.791
[EIMI] Actually, from everybody
on the team,

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.626
except for Miyuki and Honoka.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.212
[SUBARU] They most likely wish
to give you gifts personally.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.840
If we stepped out of line,
they'd probably get mad.

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:24.924
Well, thank you.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.592
[SUBARU] It doesn't
totally replace them,

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.178
but this includes
Shizuku's part as well.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.305
Make sure you call or text her
later to say you received it.

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:32.682
[EIMI]
Bye!

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.737
[gasps]

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.239
[HATTORI groans]

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.200
Oh, Tatsuya.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.452
You're on patrol?

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.494
Yes...

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.954
[MAYUMI]
By the way, Tatsuya.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.748
Now that you're here, do you
have a brief moment to chat?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.876
[TATSUYA]
That's fine, but first...

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.172
I need... water...

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.423
[HATTORI grunts]

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.594
[grunts]

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.513
Shiba, I appreciate it.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.558
Pres‐‐or rather, Miss Saegusa.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.059
I'll be taking my leave now.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.770
[HATTORI grunts]

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:24.317
Tell me, Saegusa, what on
Earth just happened to Hattori?

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.318
[MAYUMI]
Never mind him.

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:26.569
Here!

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:30.656
[TATSUYA]
Is it... Is it coffee?

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:32.992
No, don't be silly.
It's chocolate.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.578
[TATSUYA]
Well... thank you.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.207
[MAYUMI]
Come on. Won't you try some?

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.541
[TATSUYA]
Right now, you mean?

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.377
Yep! I'd like to know
what you think of them.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:45.505
[sighs]

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.925
In that case, I have something
I'd like to talk to you about.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:50.301
Could we go somewhere else?

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.969
Oh, so you want privacy?

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.221
[TATSUYA]
Yes.

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.391
Come with me, then.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.104
[MAYUMI] Let me guess, you want
to discuss the parasite?

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.648
[TATSUYA]
Yes.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.651
It hasn't really been mentioned
by the media lately.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.028
Does that mean the
damage was mitigated?

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.948
It seems to be that way
on the surface, yes.

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.616
But, the number of missing
persons this year

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.160
is quite high compared
to past ones,

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.037
So it seems like the
criminals are getting better

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.789
at kidnapping people.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.457
Maybe our taking one down...

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.543
...has put them more
on their guard.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.211
[TATSUYA]
I would imagine.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.255
It could also be that
they possess a kind of

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.382
co‐perception between them.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.592
Co... per... ception?

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:34.887
[TATSUYA] It's a shortened form
of common sensual perception.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.015
A type of ESP identical
twins often share.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:41.310
[MAYUMI] In other words,
if one sees or hears something,

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:44.564
the entire group is actually
privy to the experience?

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.483
Yes, but it's just
speculation for now.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.653
I hate having so little
insight about this.

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.239
Many situations are

What's the matter?

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.371
[MAYUMI] I'm a little concerned
by the fact that I had no clue

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.666
what the phrase "common
sensual perception" meant.

Oh, no! That won't be on
the entrance exams, will it?

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:10.464
Well, actually... ESP is treated

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:13.634
as a separate academic field
from the magic sciences,

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.094

I believe our surveillance

It's low‐orbit, but it's an

I saw Tatsuya Shiba's eyes

look directly to here
from inside the monitor.

You're overthinking it.

It's better than letting
your mind wander,
