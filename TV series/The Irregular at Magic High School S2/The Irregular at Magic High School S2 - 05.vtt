Uh‐oh, what now?

Putting it simply,
the experiment

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:49.206
was to artificially create
a very small black hole,

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.751
and effectively harness
the energy from it.

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:56.171
Is that what extradimensional
theory means?

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:59.508
Actually taking energy
from other dimensions?

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.427
[TATSUYA] No, extradimensional
theory isn't related

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.388
to the process of
harnessing the energy.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.766
Rather, what the
idea posits, is:

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.018
Our universe is
like a thin film of

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.770
three‐dimensional space,

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.564
bound within a
higher‐dimensional world,

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.024
where the only force
that can surmount

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.194
the dimensional
walls is gravity.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.445
Put another way,

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.948
because gravity leaks a
large portion of its energy

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.407
into other dimensions,

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.618
we can only observe
it in this dimension

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.579

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:55.146
of being able to refute the
law of energy conservation,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.064
don't you?

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.234
They call that proposition the
First Paradox of Modern Magic,

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:00.694
if memory serves.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.863
But that prop'sition, um...

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.908
...the propersition itself was
conclud'd to be imcomplete.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.411

wasn't finished?

[TATSUYA]
Uh... Yes.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.623
Regarding that
aforementioned law,

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.876
it's crucial to remember
that in a closed system,

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.671
the total amount of
energy remains the same.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.799
If you did observe a variation
in said energy total,

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.384
it would mean one of two things:

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.469
You've either made an
observational error,

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.180
or that the system
wasn't closed.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.308
This world, in which
we observe magic,

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.560
clearly isn't a closed system.

00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:36.354
That seems related to the
extradimensional theory

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.647
you explained before.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.024
[SHIZUKU]
I get it.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.526
So that means the
energy magic needs

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:45.071
is supplied from a
whole 'nother dimension?

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.448
[TATSUYA]
As of late, a growing number

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.534
of magical researchers
endorse that notion.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.037
I happen to agree.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:56.499
I'm about to offer a hypothesis
that has no backup proof, but...

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.962
...I think gravity
affects other dimensions.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:04.215
Wouldn't that mean it supports
the walls between them, too?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.717
So perhaps...

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.096
[TATSUYA]
...magic is also drawing energy

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:13.808
from a different dimension,
but without breaking that wall.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.397
However, if you generate
a micro black hole

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.609
using calculated energy based
on the extradimensional theory,

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:25.612
gravity acting across
the dimensional wall,

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:29.240
would then be erased by the
generation of the black hole.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.785
When that happens, for the
instant the black hole

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:35.830
is created, perhaps the
dimensional wall would waver.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:40.877
And if the dimensional wall were
to waver, what would happen?

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.630
Magical energy you
can't control with magic

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:47.592
programs will leak through?
That's kinda scary...

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:55.016
When the wall behaves that way,
information bodies of

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.185
magical energy formed
in that other dimension

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.980
could potentially invade
our world at some point.

But it does seem like
he's one step ahead.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.329
[ERIKA chuckles]

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:39.996
[MIKIHIKO laughs]

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.790
[ERIKA]
Ah. Miki!

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.469
[LINA gasps]

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.553
[gasps]

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.930
[MIZUKI gasps]

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.181
[ERIKA, MIKIHIKO gasp]

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.893
[MIZUKI]
What is this?

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:06.564
I've never once seen...
such an aura before.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:07.816
[MIKIHIKO grunts]

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.446
Mizuki, you should
be okay now.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.240
Put your glasses back on.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.953
I felt an evil presence...

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:20.829
[ERIKA, MIKIHIKO gasp]

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.164
You mean a parasite's
in the school?!

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.874
But why would it come here?!

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.669
[ERIKA] It's got guts,
I'll give it that!

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.628
[MIKIHIKO gasps]

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.255
Miki, where is it?!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.507
Hey, just calm down alright?

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.093
First, let's get our CADs.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.720
After that, we should
contact the upperclassmen.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.098
[ERIKA grunts]
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.475
Mizuki, you wait
in the classroom.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.352
[MIZUKI grunts]

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.728
I'm going, too.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.897
Sorry, what?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:51.276
[MIZUKI] I have this feeling
I'm supposed to go with you.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.445
I don't know why, but I need to.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.030
[ERIKA gasps]

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.158
[MIKIHIKO]
Okay.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.285
But don't leave
my side, got that?

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.661
Miki?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.997
[MIKIHIKO] It'll be easier to
deal with it if we're together,

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.541
than if it attacks her alone.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:10.128
Besides, remember her eyes.
They can help us!

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.005
[ERIKA gasps]

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.090
[ERIKA softly chuckles]

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.091
[ERIKA]
Okay, then, Miki.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.093
It's up to you to take
responsibility for her

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.596
and make sure she's protected,
understand?

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.098
You don't have to tell me that.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.349
[MIZUKI gasps]

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.687
Let's go. We got this.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.690
[MIZUKI]
Mm!

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:33.985
[MIZUKI]
Right!

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.449
[LINA] A parasite's here.
I can sense it!

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.576
Mia's by the side entrance!

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.500
Wait, what...?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.379
Are you kidding me?

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.381
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki, what's wrong?

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.509
I just felt an unpleasant wave.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.553
Like something grazed
against my skin...

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:01.262
[HONOKA whimpers]

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.014
An unpleasant wave?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.557
Was it Psionic?

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.392
Or a Pushion wave?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.144
I don't know.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:11.147
That said, if it somehow
got by you, Brother,

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.691
then it's probably... a Pushion.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.693
[TATSUYA]
Could it be... a parasite?

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.820
[phone rings]

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:18.780
Yes.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.698
[MAYUMI]
Tatsuya, it's terrible!

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.202
[TATSUYA] Saegusa, do you
know the exact location?

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.496
[MAYUMI] I'm glad I
don't have to explain.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.665
The signal is moving
from the side entrance

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.751
toward the lab building's
service entrance for materials.

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.586
Maximillian employees
were scheduled

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.589
to do a demo for a new
measuring device just today.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.259
Roger that.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:50.186
Honoka, sorry, but I'm
going with my brother.

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.522
Tatsuya! Miyuki!

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:55.650
It's not cool you're
leaving me here alone!

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.750
That's Lina!

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:18.006
Oh! Mia!

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.882
Commander...

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.509
[TATSUYA]
Who is she?

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.683
[TATSUYA]
Wait, that's...

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.688
[LINA]
Huh? What's wrong?

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.107
[MIA]
Oh, it's nothing, don't worry.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.108
She that?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.485
She swattered away
spirits no normal magician

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.238
should have known
were around them.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.241
No question.
She's definitely a parasite.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.659
[grunts]

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.036
[ERIKA]
Lina...

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:51.122
Looks like this makes
her an accomplice, then.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:54.000
I can throw up a sound‐and‐
vision‐blocking barrier.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.085
It won't fool machines, but...

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.463
Don't worry, I'll do
something about that.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:13:59.422
[ERIKA grunts, gasps]

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.466
[MIKIHIKO]
Erika, not yet.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.134
Yeah, I know.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.728
Here I go.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.066
[MIA, LINA gasp]

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.694
[MIYUKI]
Wow! Is that a barrier?

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:25.656
I have to say, Mikihiko's good.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:29.410
Its effects are visual
and auditory deprivation.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.663
It won't prevent the actual
object from moving, though.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.835
What's going on?!
We're surrounded!

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:39.587
[LINA gasps]

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.880
[ERIKA shouts]

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.507
Watch out!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.758
[MIA gasps]

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:44.759
[ERIKA growls]

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.010
Erika?!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.013
[grunts]

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.264
[ERIKA gasps]

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.684
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.063
[ERIKA gasps]

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.773
[gasps]

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.650
[LINA]
Katsuto Jumonji?!

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.653
Mia!

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.447
[MIA gasps]

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.116
[grunts]

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.826
[ERIKA, LINA gasp]

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.953
[LINA]
She blocked it bare‐handed!

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.789
And that swing was
really powerful...

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:16.416
Mia?

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:18.376
[SILVIA]
Lina, can you hear me?

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:19.669
Silvie?

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.671
[SILVIA] Thank goodness,
I got through to you!

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.507
I've finally discovered
who "White Mask" is!

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.300
It was actually Mia!

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:29.429
Michaela Hongou was our
target this whole time!

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.222
[gasps]

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.807
[LINA]
Mia!

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.143
You were the one behind
the white mask?!

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.439
[gasps]

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.315
Oh, now you wanna fight?!

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.446
[MIA gasps]

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:47.572
[ERIKA]
Heh!

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.823
[gasps]

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.035
[shouts]

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.003
Healing Magic?!
That wound closed itself!

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:05.131
I was right. Looks like
you're a genuine monster.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.508
[MIYUKI] In that case,
why don't I do this?

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:10.928
[MIA gasps]

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.265
[ERIKA]
Aw, man...

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.184
That wasn't very satisfying.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.393
Miyuki...

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.563
Look Lina, she may
be your acquaintance,

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.398
but we'll be
taking her now.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:26.611
[grunts]
Fine.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.446
[ERIKA]
Wait, not so fast.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:31.699
You can't just take her away.
We need a moment.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.868
If this is the girl
who hurt Leo,

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.413
then I'm not giving her up to
anyone else, not even you.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:39.790
That's fine.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.710
As long as you're willing to
share what you come up with.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.629
[KATSUTO]
I'll contact you about it.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:50.051
[TATSUYA] Thank you, Jumonji.
I really appreciate that.

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:51.177
[MIKIHIKO gasps]

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.428
[MIKIHIKO]
Look out!

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:55.306
[KATSUTO grunts]

00:16:58.768 --> 00:16:59.727
[ERIKA gasps]

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.604
Well, she's clearly
still frozen,

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:05.149
so she can't be conscious
in there, let alone use magic.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.025
Is that...?!

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.860
Self‐destruct!

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.028
[KATSUTO, TATSUYA]
Get down!

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.156
[ALL gasp]

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.166
Ball lightning, now?!

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.376
[LINA grunts]

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:30.925
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.104
[TATSUYA]
I'm looking around,

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.147
but I don't see a
caster anywhere.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.538
[TATSUYA]
It must be the parasite!

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.250
[MIKIHIKO]
That's strange...

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.627
Why isn't it trying to
run away from here?

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:10.006
[KATSUTO] What are your
thoughts on it, Shiba?

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.507
I don't know whether
it's deliberate

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.010
or instinctive behavior,

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.971
but it seems to have a good
reason for keeping us here.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.431
[ERIKA pants]

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:20.558
Hey, Lina, you got anything?

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.019
A parasites' purpose is to
possess human‐beings

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.061
and alter them.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.479
[gasps]

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.148
Searching for a
host is apparently

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.941
their behavioral principle.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:31.110
It's a self‐preservation
instinct.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.361
[TATSUYA]
In other words,

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:35.406
it's actively looking for
the next person to possess?

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:37.867
Probably.

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.368
So, how does it work?

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.620
That's a good question.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.955
That's what I'd
like to know, too.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.081
[TATSUYA]
Useless...

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.084
[LINA gasps]
What did you just say?!

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.087
This isn't good.
It's after Erika.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.797
[gasps]

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.341
[MIKIHIKO] Did it detect
that she doesn't have any

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:55.593
way to resist it?

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.595
If I at least knew
where it is now,

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.889
then I could
do something, but...

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:04.101
[MIZUKI] Yoshida,
please undo the barrier.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.605
[MIKIHIKO gasps]
Wait a minute, what are you‐‐

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.024
I might be able to
figure out where it is.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.275
[gasps]

00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:14.153
Forget about it.
It'll be too risky.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.279
With its energy released,

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.531
who knows what will happen
when you look at it?

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.743
Worst‐case, you could
go blind, or maybe worse.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.995
When I first decided
to be a magician,

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.247
I was prepared for
all of the risks.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.541
Erika's in danger, isn't she?

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.878
So, If I can't help
her out right now,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.131
then I don't have any
reason to be here!

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.883
[gasps]

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.134
Okay.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.971
[MIZUKI gasps]

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.682
[MIKIHIKO]
Put this around your neck.

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:43.432
[MIZUKI]
Huh?

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:44.934
If you feel like
you are in danger,

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.186
you can use it to
cover your eyes.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:50.439
It should be far more
effective than your glasses.

00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:54.151
[gasps]

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.237
Uh, is this right?

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.655
Promise me.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.281
Don't do anything reckless.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.868
Erika would never want
such a huge sacrifice

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.911
made for her.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.830
By you, or anyone.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.667
[MIZUKI]
Mm. I promise.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.252
[MIKIHIKO]
Mm.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.962
Here I go.

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.213
Ready!

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:18.926
[grunts]

[gasps]

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:33.983
[MIZUKI] There it is!
That's the parasite!

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:34.942
[gasps]

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.193
[MIZUKI]
Look up!

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:39.780
[MIZUKI]
About two meters above Erika!

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:43.325
It's one meter to the right,
and fifty centimeters behind.

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:46.412
There's a point of contact there
that the monster is using!

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.080
[MIKIHIKO]
Anti‐demon spell!

[TATSUYA]
Mikihiko's Spirit Magic.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.382
[TATSUYA] I could only
get a vague impression

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:02.887
of the parasite before,
but now it's crystal clear.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.889
Has itts existence in
the physical dimension

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.558
been strengthened because
Mizuki identified it?

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:12.480
[TATSUYA] Because if so, then
she's in serious danger now!

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.194
[gasps]
It's coming!

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:18.986
[MIKIHIKO]
Really?!

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.112
Where is it?!

[MIKIHIKO gasps]

[MIKIHIKO]
Tatsuya...!

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.684
[TATSUYA]
It got away.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.978
[KATSUTO]
We must've at least injured it.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.104
But it's fine.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.399
We should just be thankful
none of us got hurt this time.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:01.904
[TATSUYA]
If I'd used Gram Demolition,

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:05.574
then the parasite would've
been blown away.

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:08.536
But I didn't, and it escaped.

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.079
I knew that all too well.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:14.333
[TATSUYA] From the perspective
of combat objective completion,

00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:16.001
the best takeaway from this,

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.796
is that we only barely
managed not to lose anything.

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:24.468
[TATSUYA]
What an absolute disgrace...
