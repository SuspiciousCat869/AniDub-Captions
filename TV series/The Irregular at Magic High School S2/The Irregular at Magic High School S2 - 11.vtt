00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:31.357
Understand?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.775
[gasps]

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.861
[MIYUKI]
I know that one day,

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:39.115
you'll choose to accept the
help that Brother offered you.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:42.660
You'll join together with him,
making an amazing team.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.414
And that's when our
real competition begins.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.291
[MIYUKI chuckles]

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:51.294
That's why... I won't
say goodbye to you.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.672
So I guess I'll say,
"see you soon."

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.924
[LINA sighs]

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.176
I still don't understand
any of this cryptic stuff

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.970
you guys have been
talking about, but...

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:04.015
...I have a funny feeling
that sometime soon, I will.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:07.018
And I believe you're
gonna be right.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.144
Okay.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.438
Miyuki, Tatsuya?

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.067
[LINA]
Until we meet again.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.737
Yeah. Till then.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.822
[chuckles]

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:23.076
I look forward to that day
with great anticipation.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.628
[footsteps]

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.610

[SOLDIER F gurgles]

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.060
Your thoughts on her, milady?

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.233
Yes. Let's go with this one.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:02.235
As you wish, Madam.

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.125
[giggles]

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.462
[TATSUYA chuckles]

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.758
[TATSUYA]
You're in good spirits today.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:30.847
It's just that... it suits
you so well, Brother.

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.349
[TATSUYA]
Oh, you mean the new uniform?

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:34.517
Uh‐huh!

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.603
It's almost as if they designed
it with only you in mind.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.980
No‐‐It's so perfect,

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.150
I'm positive they made
it specifically for you.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.901
Don't exaggerate.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.279
I'm not exaggerating! I mean it!

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.322
How could you accuse
me of such a thing?

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.116
You're why the new
Magic Engineering course

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.826
was even created!

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.454
Y'know, you're calling
it a brand new design,

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:57.039
but the only change they
made was adding an emblem.

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.667
That's what's so great about it!

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.627
[TATSUYA chuckles]
Is that so?

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:02.920
[MIYUKI]
Mm‐hm!

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.175
[PRINCIPAL]
Starting today,

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.678
the new second and third‐year
students will officially be...

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.236
[HONOKA]
I meant to tell you.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.988
The souvenir chocolate
you gave me?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.032
It was really delicious,
thank you!

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.992
Oh, good. Glad to hear it.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.036
[HONOKA, SHIZUKU]
Huh?

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:36.913
Good morning, girls.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.706
Miyuki! Good morning!

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:39.957
Morning.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:45.296
Hey, are we still
on for tomorrow?

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:47.465
If you mean for
the party, yes.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.841
I was still planning on going.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.344
And my brother will be coming
along with me, as well.

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:53.429
Really? Thanks, Miyuki.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.639
[MIYUKI]
Thank <i>you</i>.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.099
[HONOKA gasps]
I can't wait, it'll be fun!

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.293
[ANNOUNCER A]
Last stop. This is Shinigawa.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.462
Thank you for riding
with us today.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:31.676
[AYAKO] Tokyo is still as
crowded as ever, huh, Fumiya?

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:34.220
[FUMIYA]
Yeah, you're right, Sis.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.597
Should we wait for the
crowd to thin out some?

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:39.517
No need. Let's just
get to the hotel.

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:47.525
[FUMIYA] Still, it's strange,
this came outta nowhere.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.278
Seriously? A job
in Tokyo, right now?

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.488
I mean, c'mon. Dad should
know the Fourth High

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.532
entrance ceremony is
the day after tomorrow.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.533
[giggles]

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.451
But when you first
learned of this job,

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:58.953
you were so pleased
to hear about it,

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.413
don't you remember?

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.122
You were like,

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:03.958
"Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get
to see Tatsuya there."

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.419
Hey, shut up! I‐I don't
care about that at all!

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.336
Really?

00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:10.047
You're not excited by the
prospect of meeting him?

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.549
No, I'm not!

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:15.678
Uh...! Well, to tell the truth,
I would love to see Tatsuya.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.306
But it's not like that's
specifically why I'm here.

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.434
[AYAKO laughs]

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:23.019
[groans]

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.398
[knocking]

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.649
[MAYA]
Enter.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.194
Pardon me, Madam.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.363
I have brought the
young girl here.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:36.741
Go on.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.368
[MINAMI gasps]
Yes, sir. Right away.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:47.668
[MAYA] Minami, lift up your
head and look at me.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.420
[MINAMI]
Yes, of course, ma'am.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:57.720
I'm making a formal request of
you to do magician work for me.

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:02.600
I see. May I inquire
the details?

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.896
Are you at all familiar with
the Tokyo Offshore Tower?

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:08.689
Yes, I'm aware of it.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.069
[MAYA]
Tokyo Offshore Tower.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.281
It was erected in Tokyo Bay,
and stands 2000 meters high.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:21.952
With 360 floors aboveground
and 36 floors underground,

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.246
it's Japan's first
"hyper‐building".

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:27.041
Tomorrow night, there will
be a party on the top floor

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.585
to celebrate the completion
of its construction.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.546
However, I have obtained
information that a radical

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:36.133
magic supremacist group
is targeting the event.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.344
They call themselves
the New Breed Front.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.137
Perhaps you're
familiar with them?

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.473
A group called
The New Breed Front?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.391
No, Ma'am.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.893
I deeply apologize
for my ignorance.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.814
[MAYA] They're an extremist
group who formed

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.234
in response to the humanists
boycotting against magicians.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:55.194
They claim that
those who use magic

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.530
are the most evolved
form of humans

00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:01.033
and will eventually
control the future.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:04.286
Apparently, it seems their
main objective is to free other

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:08.374
magicians from becoming
subservient to the old humanity.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.129
And this very same group
is plotting to launch

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.798
an attack on the
party tomorrow night?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.509
I can't say for sure that the
New Breed Front's target

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.262
is specifically the party venue.

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:24.223
But nevertheless, we are more
that certain the time of the

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:29.061
party coincides with their plan
to attack Tokyo Offshore Tower.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.187
And not only that,

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:34.358
they've been adding Extras
to their ranks, so be careful.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.569
I'm sorry, ma'am, but "Extras"?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.030
[MAYA] Yes. I take it you
don't know what they are yet.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:42.533
It refers to families that
have been disgraced

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.619
and subsequently stripped
of their "numbers."

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.164
The reasons are various
but include treason

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:51.041
and the failure to
demonstrate their abilities.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.669
I understand.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.379
But I'm still not
entirely certain

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.840
what it is you would
like me to do.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:01.093
I will have someone else stand
guard outside the building.

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:04.930
So, Minami, I want you to
accompany Mr. Hayama,

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.308
and the two of you will
stand by at the party.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:10.519
If the situation suddenly
demands urgent attention,

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:13.105
you will follow
Mr. Hayama's instructions.

00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:15.065
Am I clear?

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.400
Yes.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:22.990
Pardon. I just have one more
thing I'd like to ask, if I may.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.910
Yes, what is it?

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.203
[MINAMI]
Once I'm at the party,

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:30.080
what should I actually
be doing there?

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.167
I don't have any experience
being a party hostess,

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.419
so if possible, I would like
to receive a rundown

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:37.713
about my duties beforehand.

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:41.175
[laughs]

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.259
Madam?

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.929
[MAYA] I apologize.
I don't mean to laugh.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.308
Oh, no! There's no reason
for you to apologize, Madam.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.560
It seems you may have
slightly misunderstood

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:53.604
my intentions, Minami.

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.564
You will actually be
attending the party

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:58.234
as Mr. Hayama's Bodyguard.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.069
I already have your invitation.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.987
[gasps]

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:04.156
Certainly. I would be honored.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:06.742
I'll also have a dress you
can put on ready for you

00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.036
at a hotel in the metro area.

00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.247
And you can do your
own makeup, yes?

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.415
[MINAMI]
Yes, absolutely.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:17.127
Outstanding, then.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.463
I'm sorry for springing
this job on you

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:22.466
the day before the
entrance ceremony.

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:23.384
[MINAMI grunts]

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:25.511
If it's an order
