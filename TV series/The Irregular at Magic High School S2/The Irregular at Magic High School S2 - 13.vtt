[STAFF MEMBER A]
Excuse me, everyone!

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.400
The elevators have
been switched over

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.902
to an independent power source,

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:29.530
so they won't stop working
due to the power outage.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.448
Exit in orderly fashion!

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.034
We have an emergency
elevator one floor below.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.036
Please use that as well.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.874
Brother, tell me.
What are we going to do?

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:45.629
[PARTYGOERS shouting]

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.881
Shizuku, you should
leave with Honoka.

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.633
And take your parents with you.

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.469
Miyuki and I have
something to do here.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.597
Oh, and take these.
Put them in a safe place.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:56.890
What is it?

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:58.267
[TATSUYA]
A flight device.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.269
It has a low battery capacity,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.146
so use it only if
absolutely necessary.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.648
Okay, got it.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.525
What about you two?

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.027
Miyuki and I already made
preliminary preparations

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.487
just in case.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:14.408
Tatsuya, please be careful.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.577
You too, Miyuki. Stay safe.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.747

[TATSUYA]
Mr. Hayama.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.355
Be honest. How much do you know
about what's going on here?

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.691
I was made aware of
information beforehand

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:11.858
that the New Breed Front

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.860
had been plotting
something for tonight.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.697
However, I was not privy
to specific details

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.115
beyond that knowledge.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.117
So then you're saying
that the family

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.452
couldn't just ignore
the situation at hand?

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:23.995
[HAYAMA]
I suppose that's true.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.080
If at all possible,

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:28.709
I would like to prevent this
building's destruction, but...

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.586
Tatsuya, what if you protect it?

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.297
Well, I could try to.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.466
Is it all right
with you, Miyuki?

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.844
Yes, Brother. Of course it is.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.722
But I would like to
go along as well.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.100
So, it's settled then.
We're gonna help you.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.144
That is most gracious of you.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.440
[HAYAMA]
Please take Sakurai along, too.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.984
You should know she has
been specially trained

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.945
to be your personal
attendant, Miss Miyuki.

00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:59.364
She is still a bit
inexperienced, true,

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.116
but I believe she
will ultimately prove

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:03.910
extremely helpful to you.

We'll head downstairs too.

the elevator, do you?

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.709
Would you mind telling me
what the situation is?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.504
There are some cops, who are
being shot at from a boat.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.382
The officers returned fire,
now it's a gunfight.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.093
It seems the enemy is more
organized than I thought.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.475
[TATSUYA] Five terrorists
have completely commandeered

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.935
the control center.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.065
[TATSUYA]
Nobody between the second

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.693
and 34th underground floors.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.905

Nobody on the 36th floor.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.994
The 35 on the 35th floor,
are completely knocked out,

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.246
or they're in a
half‐conscious state.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.123
Oh, Visual Magic?

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.750
No, but similar.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.877
Only five members of
the New Breed Front

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.755
have penetrated the building
and taken control of it?

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.882
That's surprisingly few.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:07.510
Indeed. but it's possible
that some of the 35 people

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.013
are actually terrorists as well.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.181
Yes, that's true.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.059
I could tell If I had
direct contact with them,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.187
but I can't be certain simply
by using "sight" alone.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:19.689
[MIYUKI]
But I wonder...

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.107
Will the terrorists
keep their word

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.735
and give people
enough time to escape?

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.820
If all those civilians
are caught up

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.614
in the building's destruction,

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.449
they'll lose the
support of magicians,

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.701
and the general public, too.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:34.204
If they're reasonable
enough to comprehend that,

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.248
then they'll wait until
everyone is evacuated.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.963

That was... an earthquake.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.896

elevator stuck here?

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.607
Try not to panic,
it'll start again soon.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.443
[TATSUYA]
This is bad...

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.987
What is it now?

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.697
[TATSUYA]
It registered level 4.0.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.825
Without a manual override,
the elevator won't operate.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:12.659
[MIYUKI, MINAMI gasp]

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.202
But, Honoka and Shizuku...!

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.788
They're both still on
the elevator, aren't they?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:25.296
[TATSUYA] They're stuck between
the 180th and 181st floors.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.050
They could get to
the 180th floor,

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.553
which is the one that's
currently closest to them.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.431
But it's still almost a
thousand meters from the ground.

Can't we do something?!

If we can get to that
underground control center,

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:44.107
then I think I'll be able to
restart the elevator remotely.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.819
Except... there are terrorists
in the control center.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.530
I know. But there
isn't any other way.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:56.327
If we find them,
we'll negotiate.

Hello, my name's Tatsuya Shiba.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.589
I need access to
the control room

so I can attempt to
restart the elevator.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.178
The earthquake just
now made it stall.

telling the truth, here?

It's your call, Sir.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.059
We have confirmed
the stalled elevator

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.769
on one of the higher floors.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.523
But sorry, I can't allow you
access to the control center.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.608
We'll take care of it ourselves.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.610
You say you'll
take care of it,

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.446
however, do you even have
someone with the technical skill

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.907
to remotely restart
the elevator?

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.700
This is an urgent matter.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.411
I can release the lock
in five minutes flat.

that you might be our enemy,

I'm afraid I can't permit you
to enter the control center.

And why not?

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.547
Because you're using
the center's equipment

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:31.965

He's an extra from "Third"?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:56.567
[MIYUKI gasps]
The Third Research Institute?

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.485
From what I've heard,

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.363
the focus of their research is
how to control multiple types

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:04.284
of magic when all are
simultaneously activated.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.537
So is it possible that while
he was fighting us up here,

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:09.455
he was releasing
magic underground

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.624
to destroy the building
at the same time?

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.627
It seems he actually wasn't
the one using magic,

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.921
but influenced someone
else to use it.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.881
What do you mean by that?

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.800
Are you saying he was
controlling someone else's

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.261
zone of magic operations?

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.138
[TATSUYA]
Not controlling it.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.308
The other person was
in accord, and attuned to him.

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:30.476
There's a Sensory
Interference Magic spell

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.811
that can be used to
guide a magician

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:35.606
into hypnosis and
make them use magic.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.526
That's the type of magic
he used. Remarkable.

Yes.

We're going to the

Right.

Oh, um, Brother.
The elevator, though?

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:53.374
[TATSUYA] Sadly, we'll have
to put that off.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.376
At the moment, our top
priority is keeping

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.712
the building from collapsing.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:58.963

[grunts]

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.316
[TATSUYA] By only restoring
one of the pillars,

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:44.193
it's not enough.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:47.572
The other three are still
bearing the load, and failing.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.031
At this rate...

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.537
[TATSUYA]
No good.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.788
Even if I cast Regrowth,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.124
the same thing
would happen again.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.959
What I would need to
do is cast "Regrowth"

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:03.754
on all four of these 2000 meter
high pillars simultaneously

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.757
in order to fully restore them.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.510
Unfortunately, that would
be equivalent to casting

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.846
Regrowth on this
entire building.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.474
Would my brain be able to
withstand such a vast ocean

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.392

[MINAMI gasps]

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.573
[TATSUYA] The building
will collapse any minute.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:34.452
For Miyuki's sake... should we
try to escape right now?

[TATSUYA gasps]

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.539
Now what, Brother?

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.834
[TATSUYA]
That's right.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:45.671
There are two things I can
never betray, no matter what.

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:46.964
The first...

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.967
...is the vow I swore to
protect Miyuki to the end.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.514
[TATSUYA]
And the second...

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.600

faith Miyuki has in me.

[MINAMI] Tatsuya...
has extraordinary power.

Was this the work of a human?

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:56.510
Should humans truly
be allowed to possess

from the life‐threatening

[HAYAMA] I am ashamed
of myself, Madam.

Tell me.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.962
Did you give Tatsuya the
background on this incident,

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.630
or did you remain nebulous?

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.508

No, I didn't tell him anything.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.385
He didn't press you further?

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.219
No.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.263
After he was able to
regain his strength

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.265
and turned the
terrorists over to us,

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.851
he simply walked away
and escorted Miyuki home

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.310
without asking for more.

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.812

Not one question?

Correct.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:35.276
[HAYAMA] However, and this is
merely speculation on my part,

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:38.988
I suspect Tatsuya is already
keenly aware of everything.

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.614
Yes, he could be.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.366
By the way, I almost forgot.

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:44.285
What is Minami doing now?

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.370
[HAYAMA] Miss Sakurai is

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:51.751
Did you give that thing to her,
as previously requested, Hayama?

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.462
Yes. She has it now.

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:58.257

Of course. You can count on me.
