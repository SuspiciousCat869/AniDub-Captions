[grunts]

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.008
Alright both of you,
that's enough!

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.512
[LINA, MIYUKI gasp]

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:15.193
Brother, no! What have
you done?! Why now?!

[LINA gasps]

[YAKUMO] Come now, come now.
Tatsuya, dear boy.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.037
You're the one who
suggested this duel,

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.707
so why would you go and
break it up like that?

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.626
If I hadn't stepped
in when I did,

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.087
The hard "no killing" rule
definitely would have

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.130
been broken by now.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.258
I'll go ahead and take the loss.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.092
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.468
[LINA]
At the rate we were going,

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.637
you would have ended
up winning, anyway.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:46.641
As I promised, I'll answer
anything you ask me.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:47.934
However...

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.769
What do you mean, "however"?

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.521
[LINA]
My answers will be yes or no.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:54.107
If I can't answer a question
that way, then I won't.

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:55.358
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.944
You changed the terms by
spoiling our match,

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.737
so I hope you don't
mind me changing

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.865
a small condition
as well, Ta‐tsu‐ya!

A‐Ah! I'm totally done for!

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.642
I don't think I can keep
this going anymore!

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.602
I'm turning in the
Sirius code name.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.439
Why are you freaking out?
You've been executing your duty

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.733
as a member of
Sirius wonderfully.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:41.779

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.037
How are you feeling now?
You good?

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.789
Uh‐huh.
Sorry about that, Silvie.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.541
Don't worry, it's all right.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.418
Everyone needs to
vent sometimes,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.378
if they don't they'll
just explode.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:04.260
By the way, Silvie, have we
heard anything from HQ?

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.471
[SILVIA] We don't have any
instructions from them yet,

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.599
but I would like to brief
you on several reports.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.477
First, regarding the
four wounded last night.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.855
One was disabled and will
probably be relieved of duty.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.775
Based on that, they'll have
to be replaced,

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.611
but the Stars can't afford to
dispatch any more personnel

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:23.613
to Japan. It's too risky.

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.239
I see.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.617
Apparently, the General
Staff Office wants to send

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:29.494
Stardust reinforcements.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.871
Are they gonna send us
more chasers, then?

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.748
No, soldiers.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.085
[sighs] Stardust has a
lot of muscle behind it.

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.044
Even with their power,

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.838
it might not be enough to
deal with this situation,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.965
But we have no choice.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:45.718
As for the inquiry into
the Strategic‐Class magician

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.470
who caused Scorched Halloween,

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.515
the other team hasn't gotten
any noteworthy results yet.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.810
The other team...

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.603
That's Mia's group, right?

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.106
Come to think of it,

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.650
I haven't had the chance
to see Mia recently.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.777
Oh right, you haven't heard
that she'll be going to

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.529
First High tomorrow for work.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.115
She'll be bringing in a
provision of CAD adjustment

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:08.574
instruments with her, too.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.160
Huh? That's my high school!

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.453
[laughs]

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.705
[SILVIA] She's got nothing
scheduled for her afternoon,

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.416
so why not go meet
her for lunch?

[SHIZUKU]
Huh?

[gasps]

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.271
[SHIZUKU]
Hello, Ray.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:41.149
That dress is
absolutely stunning!

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.610
You look even more
charming than usual.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.279
Really?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.281
You look charming as well.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:51.659
I'm honored to receive
a complement from you.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.287
But, uh, Tia.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:57.540
About what you asked
me for earlier...

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:58.791
[SHIZUKU grunts]

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.086
[RAY] First, the rumors
of a "Parasite" appearing

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.629
turned out to be true.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:05.214
The cause is yet unknown,

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:08.301
but I did find some information
that seems to be related.

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:09.552
Tell me, please.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.928
Of course.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.723
This is under a high‐level
information freeze,

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.475
but last November, in Dallas,

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.728
they did an experiment based
on extradimensional theory

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:22.106
to generate and evaporate
micro black holes.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.567
You'll have to explain
what that means.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:28.196
[RAY] Sorry, but even I don't
understand how it works.

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.865
That's fine. Continue.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.493
I'm not sure on the details
of the experiment,

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:35.411
but the Parasites'
appearance was observed

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.623
right after they wrapped it up.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.542
So you think the experiment
and the Parasites' appearance

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:44.962
are causally related.
Do I understand that right?

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.631
[RAY]
Mm.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.050
I'm certain the black
hole experiment

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:52.136
was, in fact, the catalyst that
triggered the Parasites.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.316
[ERIKA] It's unusual for Tatsuya
to summon us on our day off,

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.151
so this must be important.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.277
I guess so.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.695
[knocking]

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.656
[door clatters]

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.574
You two?

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:17.078
[MIKIHIKO] It's Saegusa...
and Jumonji!

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.163
Yoshida and Chiba?

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.249
Did Shiba call you
both here too?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.959
Uh, yes, he did.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:28.339
Ah, good. It looks
like we're all here.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.342
[MAYUMI] Tatsuya, why did
you ask us all to come

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.594
for a formal meeting
on a Sunday?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.137
I wanted to tell
you something about

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:37.265
capturing the Parasite
we've been chasing.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.183
And, trust me,
you want to know this.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.435
[MAYUMI, ERIKA, MIHIKO gasp]

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.771
[KATSUTO]
Let's hear it.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:47.024
Last night, I fired off a
synthetic molecule device

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.861
into the Parasite that transmits
a specific pattern of radio wave

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.738
every three hours.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.366
The transmitter will last
for three days at most.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.618
Its radio wave
output is weak,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.745
but the roadside cameras'
surveillance antennae

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:03.207
that find and control illegal
radio waves... can receive it.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.460
Wait a second, Tatsuya.
Last night? Where?

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.796
Not to mention,
how'd you find them?

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.507
These have the exact radio
wave frequency and pattern

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.884
recorded on them.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:18.139
So you want us to use this to
find where the Parasite is?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.641
Why bother giving these to us?

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:24.395
[TATSUYA] About the identity of
the Parasite we're chasing.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.773
It's apparently a magician on
the run from the USNA Army.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:28.941
[MAYUMI, ERIKA gasp]

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.901
[TATSUYA]
And they're not the only one.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.571
We know there to be at
least two deserters,

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.741
and, in fact, there could
even be as many as ten.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.702
Ten people actually dared
to leave the Stars?

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:40.995
[TATSUYA]
No, Erika.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.122
I never said they were with
them in the first place.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.832
[ERIKA, MIKIHIKO gasp]

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:45.833
Is this true?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:50.338
[KATSUTO] The Stars, are a unit
of rare, exceptional magicians.

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:53.966
Who were handpicked from the
rest of the USNA Army Corps.

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:56.969
But I was under the oppression
that military magicians

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.972
were under highly strict
control in every country.

00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:03.309
Has USNA's military discipline
become more laxed?

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.062
Actually, it's likely
the opposite.

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:07.229
[MIKIHIKO]
What do you mean?

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.023
It would mean the
Parasites' influence

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.108
outweighed the military's.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.612
A Parasite is able to
change a human, correct?

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:18.115
If that change is mental,
as well as physical,

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:22.703
it wouldn't be that odd for a
host's belief system to change.

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.748
Yeah, that's true. Good point.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.251
Okay, so why did the
Parasites leave the Army then?

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.961
[TATSUYA] We won't know
that until we catch

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.463
and question them.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.214
[MIKIHIKO grunts]

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.340
[ERIKA]
Alright...

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.175
What do you want from us?

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.386
[TATSUYA] I have no specific
directives for you.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.512
[MAYUMI, ERICA]
Huh?

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:42.056
These monsters injured
a good friend of mine,

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.141
so I'm going after them.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.644
At the same time,
I'm not really obsessed

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.605
with personally making
them regret their actions.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.774
If the Clans Council
takes responsibility for

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:54.527
dealing with it,
I won't complain.

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:57.196
Of course, I don't mind
if the Chiba family

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:59.573

you come all this way.

I figured giving these
to you directly was best.

Well done, Shiba.

[MIYUKI] Brother, are you okay?
Is something bothering you?

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.820
I'm fine.

It's about Lina, isn't it.

You got me.

Guess I can't hide
anything from you, can I?

She was suspicious
from the very beginning.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.250
I could tell she was
plotting something.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.294
But I decided to let her go,

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.504
because my own life was
already complex enough

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:57.715
and I didn't want to
make any more waves.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.551
And as a result,
I was slow to react.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.261
I mean, I get it.

action right away,

I can't help but get distracted
by thinking about what's happen.

[MIYUKI] Brother...
you've become very kind.

this coming from?

Oh, don't get me wrong,

you've always been
a nice person.

Sorry. Would you mind
clarifying that?

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:37.963
What I'm saying is,

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.840
the Parasites harmed
your friend Saijo,

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.510
and there's no way you
can let that go now.

00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:45.805
Not only that, you didn't
want to get rough with Lina.

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:50.351
Because she's your friend,
even if that's problematic.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:54.522
And that... makes me
really happy.

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:57.024
You can feel concern
and compassion

for other people
besides just me.

I know it may seem your
emotions are lacking,

00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:07.201

human than you think they are.
