[YAKUMO, TATSUYA grunting]

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.046
[TATSUYA]
Is he to the right?

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.257
Or the left?

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.508
[gasps]

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:54.596
[TATSUYA grunts]

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:55.764
[YAKUMO chuckles]

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.611
[YAKUMO]
You sure had me on the ropes.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:36.490
Master, what was that?

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.368
Well, I didn't think you would
break my "Cocoon Water Mirage",

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.745
so I wanted to test your
boundaries just a little more.

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:45.999
That move. It wasn't one
of your usual illusion arts.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.335
Ah, you caught that.
Impressive!

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.671
That odd ability of
yours to read a spell

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.798
with nothing more
than the merest glance

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.467
is a true threat
to any opponent.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.219
But, you must be vigilant,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.846
because there is a way
to use it against you.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.849
Was it the illusion you
just used a minute ago?

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.811
Cocoon Water Mirage
was a spell designed

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.773
to deceive the eyes of beings
that are not of this world.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:11.942
Hold on, I'm sorry,

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:16.279
but would you mind explaining
what you mean by that, Master?

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.031
What I'm trying to tell you is

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.283
it's not only humans
we're up against.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.245
As a matter of fact,
fighting supernatural things

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.706
isn't even as rare
as you would think.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.376
Yea, but my friend who's
an Ancient Magic user,

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.586
told me that encountering
real demons

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.214
actually <i>was</i> an
extremely rare thing.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.174
[YAKUMO] It may
surprise you to know

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.845
you've already had one or
two experiences yourself.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.391
The magic you modern magicians
like to refer to as "SB magic".

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.934
What does it use as a medium?

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.644
Think about it...

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:48.603
[gasps]

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.273
[YAKUMO]
I think you understand.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:55.235
The things you refer to as
"spiritual beings" or "spirits"

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.113
fit into that category I
just described to you as

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.198
"not of this world".

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.784
So, you're saying these spirits
that aren't more than bodies

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.745
of independent information,

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.455
that have been detached
from phenomena

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.457
are "not of this world", right?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.128
To be more precise, they might
be best described by what

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.421
is most obvious,

00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:17.674
which is they are
"things without life or flesh."

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:21.553
Master, forgive me, but can I
ask you one more question?

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.180
Please, go right ahead.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.182
According to Modern Magic,

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.351
spirits are classified as
independent information bodies

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.978
derived from natural phenomena.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.855
[YAKUMO]
Mm‐hm.

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:34.649
[TATSUYA] Then, if Parasites
can feed off a person's

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.319
ethereal body and change
the person's properties,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.988
what information bodies
would they be based on?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.907
[YAKUMO]
A good question.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.617
I don't know the origin
of these wraiths

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.993
or what you call "Parasites,"

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.870
but I'll tell you
what I do know.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.623
Their purpose is to interfere
with people's minds,

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.708
so it stands to reason
they'd have to be

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.336
based spirit phenomena.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.421
That means they're
information organisms

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.632
first originating in the mind?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.509
[YAKUMO]
Just as spirits originating

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.010
in physical phenomena

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:05.263
drift through a shadow world
back‐to‐back with this one,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.683
the aforementioned wraiths
originating in mental phenomena,

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.894
indeed might come
from the shadow world,

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:13.104
back‐to‐back with
our mental world.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.190
It's a fascinating paradox.

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:18.527
But, that's just my own
unadulterated theory.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:27.494
[yawns]

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.457
[HONOKA] Hey, Shizuku,
sorry to call out like this.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.292
[SHIZUKU]
That's okay. What's up?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.419
I actually did this for Tatsuya.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.879
He had something he
wanted to ask you

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.673
and said it was important.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.049
I'll put him on.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.427
I'm really sorry to
call you so late.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.721
I was just going to send
you an email at first,

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.308
but it's easier to make myself
clear talking face‐to‐face.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.353
No problem.
It's only eight PM here.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.397
Now, what did you want?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.233
Right, so... from what
Honoka mentioned,

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:01.653
seems a vampire is making a
mess of things there, too.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.574
If you can, I'd like you to fill
me in on any details you have.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.701
In America, most people
just treat it

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.411
like a creepy urban legend.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.789
Or, at least, the media doesn't
even bother to cover it.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.291
Why? What happened?

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:18.003
A vampire, or something a
lot like it, attacked Leo.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.005
He was attacked?

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:24.301
Yeah... No need to worry.
He'll recover in no time.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.512
Leo was able to drive off
the vampire by himself.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:31.266
However, he happened to get
hit by their strange ability,

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:34.019
and is now recuperating
in the hospital.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.937
Thank goodness.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.899
In any case, it all
makes sense now.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.776
That's why you wanted to know
what's happening over here.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:42.986
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.405
But don't feel like you
have to investigate.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.240
Just ask around a little bit.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.534
[SHIZUKU] It sounds like you
think America holds some clues

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.411
about this situation.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.455
I mean, that's the
huntch I have.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.249
But to be completely honest,
I believe the criminal

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.044
behind the vampire incident
came from America.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.712
[MIYUKI, HONOKA gasp]

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.088
So make me a promise.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.215
Stay away from anything
that might be dangerous.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.592
I mean it.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:08.637
Please, Shizuku, don't try
to take any chances.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.514
'Kay. I'll play it safe.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.476
Just be patient and
don't expect too much.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.414
[ERIKA]
Miki, which way?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.386
[ERIKA]
This way, huh?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.141
I dunno about this.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.810
I really think it'd be
better to team up with

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.770
Jumonji and Saegusa.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.109

Head to the next corner,
then make a right!

Roger that! Thanks.

off so he can't get away.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.092

Leo didn't have any
physical wounds.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.695

[gasps]

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.496
[gasps]
That's Tatsuya?

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.003
[gasps]

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.255

[TATSUYA gasps]

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:54.107
[TATSUYA] I have the data
of the colors and contours,

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.442
but all other
information is missing.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.029
[TATSUYA]
What is this?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.199
[ERIKA]
Huh?

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.621
[TATSUYA]
She escaped...

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:29.809
[ANGIE]
Were you able to retrieve

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.686
Sergeant Sullivan's body?

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.480
Yes, Ma'am. We are in
possession of it.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:35.982
[ANGIE] And have you
determined the identity

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.735
of the other one
I was pursuing?

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.486
Unfortunately, we have not.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.989
We successfully extracted
the Psi‐wave pattern,

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.242
but I'm afraid it didn't match
any of the data we have.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.786
They're not a fugitive, then?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.539
I mean, it's either that
or the Psi‐wave patterns

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.915
have been altered.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.668
[SILVIA] If I had to guess,
it would be the latter.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.211
Understood.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:00.214
Go ahead and keep tracing
the pattern we picked up.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.799
Yes, of course, ma'am.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.803
[ANGIE grunts]

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.807
[LINA] Nobody told me
Erika was that strong!

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.477
And not only that, but Tatsuya
used some weird tech

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.646
or magic that can
disable my spells!

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:18.608
Are all high schoolers
in Japan like that?!

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.906
[TATSUYA]
Good evening, Aunt.

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.909
I apologize for calling so late.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.494
Don't worry, it's fine.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.789
Although, it's unusual for you
to be calling out of the blue

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.791
at all, Tatsuya.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.877
Actually, there's one thing
I'd like to ask you.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:42.256
As well as a request I wish
to make. Do you mind?

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.134
No, of course not, ask away.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:49.639
Thank you.
Then, if I may ask you this;

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.642
Aunt Maya, would you
mind telling me

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.977
how the Kudou Family's
Parade spell works?

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.813
You must know something.

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.064
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:03.069
[MAYA]
Oh my, as you may know...

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.572
...Parade is the Kudou
Family's secret technique.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.033
What makes you think someone
like me woud know anything

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.952
about its mysteries,

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:12.578
From what I've been told,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.249
you studied under General
Kudou for a while, Aunt Maya.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.251
Maybe you at least
know the gist,

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:21.045
even if you don't know
the whole magic sequence.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.050
Is the anti‐magic
spell Parade...

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.761
...something that takes
your own Edios appearance,

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.555
copies and alters it,

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.515
so that then you can
project it onto yourself

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:35.143
to temporarily change your
physical appearance,

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.812
while also substituting
any magical interference

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.772
aims with their own
disguised Eidos,

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.608
which would prevent magic
effects used on your real body?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.737
That's essentially how the
technique works, right?

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.239
Oh, come now, Tatsuya,

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.367
I certainly thought you of
all people would know...

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.871
.. that transformation magic
is basically impossible.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:56.914
[TATSUYA] If you only want
to alter your appearance,

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.833
there's Light
Interference‐Type Magic.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.043
But it's not true
transformation.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:04.839
The issue here is if that's
actually what was used,

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:08.342
I would've been able to
easily see right through it.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.887
Brother, wait! You don't mean
there was someone who could

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.181
keep their identity
secret from you?

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.849
[TATSUYA]
That isn't all.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.310
It also caused my Mist
Dispersion to miss...

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.603
...by a fair amount.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.062
[MIYUKI]
How?!

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:25.359
But even if Mist Dispersion
didn't work at that time,

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.571
I would think Trident should
have been no problem.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.824
Aunt Maya, it appears the
case you've assigned to us

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.035
is more than two
of us can handle.

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.497
Therefore, I would like
request some reinforcements.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.042
Very well, it's done.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.711
My goodness, things seem
to be shifting well past

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.005
the scope of our expectations.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:49.717
I give you permission
to contact Major Kazama.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.386
[TATSUYA]
Thank you very much.

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.764
Oh, that reminds me, Tatsuya.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:57.975
I do recall hearing something
reagrding the Old Master

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.978
and the Parade spell that
you may find interesting.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.065
His younger brother was
more skilled at using it.

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.283
I know that you're very busy,

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.786
so I apologize for
asking you here.

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:17.912
Not at all.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.165
But now that I'm here,
what is it I can do for you?

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:21.832
[KATSUTO]
Did you know,

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.377
based upon the Ten Master
Clans' decision,

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.255
both the Saegusa Family
and Jumonji Family

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:30.341
are cooperating to investigate
the vampire murders?

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.678
I've heard something
to the effect, yes.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.930
Good, I'll get right
to the point, then.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:39.934
Tatsuya, we need you.
Will you help us?

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.519
You two are aware...

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.771
...that Leohard Saijo
from 1‐E was attacked

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.356
the other day, right?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.819
If you know what the
hell's going on, spill it?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.322
And trust me, I'm not the
only one who wants answers.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.158
Finding the criminal
and handing them over...

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.120
...won't simply end this
and make us feel safe.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.456
Is there one perpetrator,
or perhaps a group of them?

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.875
Is crime this
personally motivated?

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.502
Or is it a disease?

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:08.838
Until we have these
important answers,

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:10.923
we can't write it off
as "case closed."

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.010
[TATSUYA]
This whole situation.

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.345
How much do you two
really know about it?

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:19.098
And how exactly do you
plan on solving it?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.975
Unless you offer
that information,

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.144
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:28.149
I will tell you everything
we know in sordid detail,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.402
but only if you make
a promise to help us.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:35.031
[TATSUYA] Fine, it's a deal.
I'll cooperate.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.283
Then is it safe to assume
that this also means

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.286
you would be willing to
join our search team?

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.456
I mean, if that's how you want
to interpret it, be my guest.

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:46.042
[MAYUMI]
Mm! Very well, then.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.377
Alright. Then I'll tell you
what we already know

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.880
at this point,
though it's not much.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.347
[TATSUYA] I see. Sounds like
ther are a lot more vampire

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.432
victims than we thought.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.602
Indeed. In fact, we believe
we're dealing with

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.604
a multitude of vampires.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.357
So there is a
lot of them, huh?

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.983
This is bad news.

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:14.987
The police... have been helping
us track down the vampires.

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.697
They've given us
their extended range

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.116
special investigation team.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.451
We've made some decent headway,

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.871
but there's a third faction
interfering with our efforts.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.040
Be careful of them, too.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.835
Got it. So what part am I
playing in all of this?

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:32.922
Jumanji and I are simply
asking you to accompany us.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.256
Starting tonight, if possible.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:37.677
Negative. Shiba's better
off working this alone.

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:41.555
If you find clues or evidence,
report them back to us.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.265
Yes, I understand.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.985
[TATSUYA]
Major Kazama's a life savior.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.863
Him giving us the use the
stratospheric security camera

00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:59.323
is a big help.

[MIYUKI]
Huh?

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:10.459
Brother, please wait.
Are you really going?

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:20.636
Just be good and wait here
patiently for me, you got that?

[MIYUKI sighs]

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:27.643
Yes, of course, I will await
your return later tonight.

00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.103
Don't worry, Miyuki.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:33.190
Because soon enough, I'm going
to need your assistance.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.943
And when I do...

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.319
I know.

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:40.072
Then we can finally be together.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:42.992
That's a promise, Brother.
I mean it.
