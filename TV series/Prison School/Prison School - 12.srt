1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,625
[GAKUTO] You mean the one they
caught wasn't Lady Chiyo?

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,791
[SHINGO]
Yeah. I recognized the voice.

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,458
It was definitely Anzu.

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,875
She's the one the Vice
President was yelling at.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,875
So what was Anzu
caught doing?

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,666
I thought your
"girlfriend" was a spy

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,125
for the Underground
Student Council.

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,375
But think! If she was
here working for them,

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,083
why would the Vice President
have apprehended her?

10
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,625
Anzu's detainment indicates
another intent.

11
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,333
If that's right,
what does it mean?

12
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,625
Was she caught
trying to help us?

13
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,958
[MEIKO]
Out with it, Anzu!

14
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,916
What were you doing
sneaking around the prison?!

15
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,416
[MEIKO] Hmph. So that's
how you want to play?

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
You'll be begging to
talk soon enough.

17
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,541
[ANZU muffled screaming]

18
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,166
[MEIKO] Twat was that?
I cunt hear you.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,708
[ANZU]
I deserve this.

20
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,250
I wanted to be on the Council
so bad that I set Shingo up.

21
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,541
I'm no better than this psycho.
I'm so sorry, Shingo!

22
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,833
[KIYOSHI] What the hell?
Why isn't she done, yet?

23
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,791
How long are we
gonna stay like this?

24
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,625
It's getting hard to breathe.

25
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,625
But if I take a breath,
I'll totally snort!

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,291
[BOTH panting]

27
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,000
[KIYOSHI] Hana must've been
holding her breath, too.

28
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,500
[KIYOSHI grunting]
Stop it, weirdo!

29
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,500
Haven't you had enough?!

30
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,500
No way. Not by a
longshot, hotlips.

31
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,000
[KIYOSHI] Come on! One of
the most terrifying girls

32
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,458
I've ever met just
stole my first kiss!

33
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,708
We're even.

34
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,083
Bullshit! I haven't seen
you pee yet, jack wagon!

35
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,541
[KIYOSHI] There's no way
in hell I can go right now!

36
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,666
I am stiffer than I've ever
been in my entire life!

37
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,958
Then it's time to
pucker up, numbnuts!

38
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,166
[KIYOSHI]
Forget it!

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,666
[CHIYO]
What was that? A signal?

40
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,416
The note said to wait
until the lights were out

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,083
to enter the corrections office.

42
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,916
Here's how it's gonna work.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,333
You're gonna kiss me,
or I'm gonna tell

44
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:33,416
sweet little Chiyo that
I got to you first.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,791
[KIYOSHI]
Chiyo. I'm sorry.

46
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,916
[CHIYO] What now?
Should I just keep waiting?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,750
I wonder what's
going on in there?

48
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,750
[GAKUTO] Brothers. I would
venture to guess that

49
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,250
the Lady Anzu has aligned
herself with our cause.

50
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,833
If what you're saying's right,

51
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,458
maybe she worked with Chiyo to
draw the Vice President away.

52
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,166
That'd make it a lot
easier for Chiyo

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,541
to get into the corrections
office completely unnoticed.

54
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,250
Thanks Anzu, you're the best.

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,291
We'll clear ourselves. Your
sacrifice won't go to waste.

56
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,083
For now, all we
can do is wait,

57
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,416
and have faith that Kiyoshi
can accomplish his task

58
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
as he suffers Hana's
insidious revenge!

59
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,208
[KIYOSHI]
Wait a second, something's off.

60
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,166
Why does Hana seem so... rigid?

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,458
Is this how kissing is
supposed to go? It can't be.

62
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,208
From what I've heard, it
should be a lot more active!

63
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,166
Soft lips melding together.

64
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,208
Tongues dancing their
sensual ballet.

65
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,041
This isn't the real thing!
Just a poor imitation!

66
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,458
Chiyo, I still haven't
had my first kiss yet!

67
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,625
This is the kiss of a child!
It doesn't even count!

68
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,583
Hana hasn't stolen a
single thing from me.

69
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,833
Chiyo. Please forgive me.

70
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,625
But there's something
far more important

71
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,416
than a "first kiss" debate.

72
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,375
Like my promise to my
friends to save our asses!

73
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:50,500
[HANA] Wait. What's he doing?
Is that his tongue?!

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,333
[KIYOSHI] I knew it. Hana's
sexuality hasn't developed, yet.

75
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,583
You have to give an
inch to take a mile!

76
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,208
I'll give you my first
real kiss, and in return,

77
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,083
I'll prevent our expulsions!

78
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,291
[CHIYO]
It's so quiet.

79
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,083
I wonder if anyone's
even in there anymore?

80
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,250
[HANA]
What the fuck is going on?!

81
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,333
Why'd he poke his
tongue in my mouth?!

82
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,875
Ah! Why is the room spinning?
I feel kind of... dizzy.

83
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:21,416
Like my head, my body.
Everything's tingling!

84
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,833
[GAKUTO] Yoshihiro Shimazu
was a figure of prominence

85
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,416
during the Sengoku period.

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,875
He was head of the Shimazu clan,

87
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,625
which occupied southern
Kyushu, centered around Satsuma.

88
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,250
[GAKUTO chuckles]

89
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,875
Hey what's so funny, bro?

90
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,250
Just a fleeting thought,
a dear memory

91
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,125
of Sir Kiyoshi
flooded to my mind.

92
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,875
Care to share with us
what that memory was,

93
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,791
or are you just gonna
keep giggling?

94
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,625
Twas a beautiful day,
cheery and warm.

95
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,250
We sat in the sunlight enjoying
each other's company.

96
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,958
Hearken back to troubled times!

97
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,625
The Battle of Sekigahara,
fifth year of the Keicho era.

98
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,000
The forces of the
Western Army,

99
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,916
with which the Shimazu
clan were aligned,

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,458
were nearing utter defeat at
the hands of the Eastern Army.

101
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,666
Lord Shimazu's men were
isolated, surrounded.

102
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,625
Total annihilation
seemed inescapable.

103
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,333
However, the mighty
leader struck through

104
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,791
the center of the enemy's line!

105
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,333
Yoshihiro ordered his warriors
to charge the vast army

106
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,958
pushing to their front, before
encirclement proved inevitable!

107
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,375
It was through that
desperate act that

108
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,291
he succeeded in carving
out a path of retreat!

109
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,875
Henceforth, this unorthodox,
yet successful maneuver

110
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,208
would be spoken of in almost
legendary appreciation

111
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,625
as the "Flight of Shimazu."

112
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,625
[KIYOSHI] So anyway. What
kind of music do you like?

113
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,083
[GAKUTO]
Film scores from period dramas.

114
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,000
Like when there's slo-mo
shots of horses charging.

115
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,125
What a curious thing memory is.

116
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,250
It's strange that something
that happened so recently

117
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,583
can also seem to have
taken place ages ago.

118
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,083
[SHINGO]
That's not a story.

119
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,541
It sounds like you were just
talking to yourself, psycho.

120
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,416
Don't be absurd! It's
merely a pleasant memory

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,416
of two friends chatting!

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,291
You were totally
giggling about it

123
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,541
before you even started talking!

124
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,916
What part of that was
supposed to be funny?!

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,791
I was gonna hear a touching
tale of friendship,

126
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,208
but instead it was dick.

127
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,333
Come on. I think what Gakuto's
trying to say is right.

128
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,291
We're in a situation like
that Lord, aren't we?

129
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,791
Quite astute, Sir Andre!

130
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,000
That's exactly what yours truly
was trying to communicate!

131
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,916
[GAKUTO] Sir Kiyoshi.
Yours truly cannot tell

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,291
what trials and tribulations
you may face in there.

133
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,791
But you must continue charging
ahead in the face of danger

134
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,375
like the unstoppable
Shimazu army!

135
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,500
[KIYOSHI] Charge the center
of the enemy line!

136
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,416
There will be no retreat today,
only forward progress.

137
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,208
I will keep pressing my
attack to finally break free!

138
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,416
I can't give up.

139
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,375
I'll keep fighting till
we're in the clear!

140
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,833
This full-on tongue kiss
will go down in history

141
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,000
as my own "Flight
of Shimazu" move.

142
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,458
[CHIYO grunts]

143
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,291
[KIYOSHI panting]

144
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,208
[CHIYO]
It's Kiyoshi. Is he alone?

145
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,750
[KIYOSHI] I won. It was a
hard fight, but I did it!

146
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,208
[KIYOSHI] Chiyo? I told her to
wait until the lights went out!

147
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,708
If she walks in
and sees this view,

148
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,250
then our master plan
is royally screwed.

149
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,625
[CHIYO]
The back door's unlocked.

150
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,125
Does that mean I should go in?

151
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,875
[KIYOSHI]
Underpants? There's no time!

152
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,500
What do I do? I can't let
her walk in on us like this!

153
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,875
Not done! We're just
getting started!

154
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,958
It's too soon,
so hold up already!

155
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,833
That's enough. I'm leaving.

156
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,750
[KIYOSHI]
Huh?

157
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,958
I'm gonna go home.

158
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,833
[KIYOSHI] 
Wait, hang on, Hana!

159
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,583
You left your panties
and jorts behind!

160
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,833
[HANA]
That's okay. I'm going home.

161
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,750
[KIYOSHI] 
No, you can't go yet!

162
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
[CHIYO]
Lights out? That's the signal.

163
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,750
Guess Kiyoshi needed more time.

164
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,416
[MEIKO] Anzu didn't say a
damned thing the whole time.

165
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,875
Maybe she really was just
out for an evening stroll.

166
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,750
It's strange. Something
seems out of place.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,333
Uh?

168
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:39,541
[CHIYO] What is this? Some kind
of message from Kiyoshi?

169
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Whatever it is, it's warm.

170
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,791
[KIYOSHI] I've never seen
Hana acting like that before.

171
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,625
Which kinda proves to me
that it was her first kiss.

172
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,625
Even if I did it to
secure our release,

173
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,958
I hope I didn't take
things too far.

174
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:57,125
I feel kinda bad using
her first kiss against her.

175
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,000
[BOYS gasp]

176
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,083
[HANA] 
Get in.

177
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,416
[SHINGO] I wonder what the
hell went down between them.

178
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,666
Step one of the plan was
a success, gentlemen.

179
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,166
[GAKUTO] Sir Kiyoshi!
Even while bearing the brunt

180
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,708
of Hana's terrible wrath,
he still had the wherewithal

181
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,416
to accomplish his mission!

182
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,041
All right, study at your
own pace until bedtime.

183
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,041
[GAKUTO] Uh! I need permission
to use the lavatory.

184
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,166
[JOE]
Me, too!

185
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,166
Uh. Yeah, yeah. Hurry up.

186
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,250
Meiko, you have a good
explanation for this?

187
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,375
[MEIKO]
Anzu's a person of interest!

188
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,500
[MARI] You did the right thing.
Her behavior sounds suspicious.

189
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,500
[MEIKO] Yes. I applied advanced
interrogation techniques

190
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,833
but she still wouldn't talk.

191
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,625
She might not be part of it.

192
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,500
And the boys might've given up,
realizing their time was out.

193
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,125
You've worked up quite
a healthy sweat again.

194
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,333
If you're hot, perhaps
you should change.

195
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,125
[MEIKO] 
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,541
[MEIKO] "All prisoners
are in their cells.

197
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,291
And the doors have been locked.

198
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,291
Nothing is out of the ordinary,
so I'm going to bed."

199
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,041
That's the message from Hana.

200
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,541
Maybe there really isn't
anything going on.

201
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,333
[MARI] Perhaps. I still
get the troubling sense

202
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,750
that they haven't
given up, though.

203
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,000
I agree.

204
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,541
It certainly feels like
there is something amiss

205
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,541
this evening, but I haven't
a clue as to what.

206
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,833
[MARI]
From what you've told me,

207
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,041
I find it surprising that
Anzu allowed herself

208
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,958
to be caught so easily.

209
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,625
While you were busy dealing with
her unexpected appearance,

210
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,625
the boys must have used her
distraction to their advantage.

211
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,958
[MEIKO gasps]
Let's find out!

212
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,208
Yeah, what is it?

213
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,083
Thank you. That was
a very fine thrashing.

214
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,291
[JOE snores]

215
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,166
The boys are all here.
And two locked doors

216
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,875
are keeping them in
and it's far too late

217
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,375
for them to try anything now.

218
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,333
You're still sweating intensely.

219
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,875
Shouldn't you have gone and
changed your outfit first?

220
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:44,875
No madam, I'm just fine!

221
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,958
So, perhaps we
should split up

222
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,416
and search the other rooms.

223
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,750
Okay I'll go investigate
the corrections office.

224
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,333
You search the restroom.

225
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
[MEIKO grunting]

226
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,125
[MARI]
Nothing out of the ordinary.

227
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,291
[MEIKO] Come on! My bladder's
reaching critical mass!

228
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,166
Just unzip, damn it!
Gotta do something quick,

229
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,625
or I'll be as bad as that
pants crapping nerd!

230
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,375
[MARI] Why is this
container cut like this?

231
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,416
[MEIKO yells]

232
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,833
[MARI panting]
Meiko! What's wrong?

233
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,250
[gasps] Madam Vice President.

234
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,041
What's happening?

235
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,458
I'm terribly sorry, Madam.

236
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,708
I needed to use the bathroom,
but my zipper got stuck,

237
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,291
so I tore it off. I guess
I must have inadvertently

238
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,458
cried out struggling
to derobe!

239
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,000
You can rest easy.
The bathroom is clear.

240
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,625
[MARI laughs] Nothing they
do now can stop it.

241
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,583
It's over.
The boys are finished.

242
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,500
The school's prison is
inescapable, after all.

243
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,708
Yes, everything is going
according to plan.

244
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,625
Tomorrow, they'll be gone.

245
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,375
[CHAIRMAN]
Tomorrow, their conflict reaches

246
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,708
its boiling point.

247
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,791
The boys versus the
Underground Student Council.

248
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:11,166
It will be a hard fought
battle, who will win this...

249
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,875
war?

250
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,041
[MEIKO]
Almost hard to believe

251
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,333
this will be our
last day together.

252
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,416
Hello and good
morning, gentlemen.

253
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
I trust you slept well. Yes?

254
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,541
You've been charged with
a number of crimes,

255
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,833
including peeking
into the girl's baths,

256
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,541
and plotting to escape
from the prison

257
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,958
using various means on
three separate incidents.

258
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,208
Is there any disputing

259
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,750
the validity of
these facts? Well?

260
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,583
Do you have any
objections? None?

261
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,000
[MEIKO] Not even a final
attempt at an appeal?

262
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,458
Pathetic. But I still feel
something's not right.

263
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,125
[GAKUTO panting]

264
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,083
[STUDENT 12A] And I was like
"you barely even know me,

265
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,166
so I don't wanna hear--"

266
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,166
[screams]

267
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,291
[CHAIRMAN] Today your expulsions
will be officially recognized.

268
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,708
So, do you have any final words?

269
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,458
I have to say good riddance!

270
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,833
After all, this school
has a reputation to uphold.

271
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,500
Sleazy perverts like
you only bring us down.

272
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,875
[MEIKO]
I can't shake this feeling....

273
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,333
[STUDENTS gasping]

274
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:33,750
[GAKUTO grunting]

275
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,583
Face the facts,
you lost the war.

276
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,625
Now do the entire campus a
favor, and get out of here!

277
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,875
[KIYOSHI] 
No thanks.

278
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,125
[MARI]
Huh?

279
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,625
You're wrong Madam President.

280
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,833
Today's battle was our victory.

281
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,000
[GIRLS gasp]

282
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,583
[MARI] Hmph. Oh, please.
Talk about tragic.

283
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,000
Sounds like the desperate
mewling of the defeated.

284
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,791
[MEIKO] 
No. It can't be.

285
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,583
You're not Filthy Four-Eyes!

286
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,708
[coughs] Please let me go,
Madam Vice President.

287
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,083
It's Joe!

288
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,583
Then who is this?

Chiyo? Why would you
help these freaks?

291
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,416
[MEIKO]
This is what was eating at me!

292
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,125
How did I not notice
Gakuto's height difference?

293
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,791
Or how last night he went
to bed with his glasses on.

294
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,041
Then where in the hell is
that pants-crapping dork?!

295
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,375
[STUDENT 12D]
Keep moving, ladies!

296
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,041
The Chairman's office
is just up ahead!

297
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,083
[KIYOSHI] We tricked
you this time around.

298
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,000
And when Gakuto
shows up, it will mean

299
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,166
the end of the Underground
Student Council!

300

ourselves! With truth!

the hole the entire time!

Look! We caught
a nasty molester!

You misunderstand!

Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,125
I'm Takehito Morokuzu.
Also known as Gakuto!

309
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,125
[STUDENT 12F] Don't pose
like a hero, boxer-briefs!

310
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,791
[STUDENTS chattering]

311
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,625
[CHAIRMAN] Enough! You girls
need to head back to class!

312
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,666
Right now!

313
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,333
Gakuto, why are you in
your underwear, dude?

314
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,750
Didn't Chiyo give you her
gym clothes to put on?

315
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,958
If I wore the fair
Lady Chiyo's clothes,

316
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,125
they would be sullied.

317
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,375
Unfit for a trouser-stainer
like myself.

318
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,833
Lady Chiyo is not only
beautiful, but brave!

319
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,291
She's a righteous young woman,
who took pity on our plight

320
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,000
and aided us in our plan.
You have my gratitude!

321
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,291
Chiyo? How on Earth
were you even able

322
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,500
to get into the prison?

323
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,833
And how the hell did
you get out of your cell

324
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,416
in the first place,
Filthy Four-Eyes?!

325
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
I know I locked your
ass in before leaving!

326
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,250
Just your run-of-the-mill,
three-way exchange.

327
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,041
What kind of
three-way exchange?

328
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,416
[CHIYO] I snuck in through the
back door of the corrections

329
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,291
office last night and then
I hid in the restroom.

330
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,541
Inconceivable! I know I
locked that door. Didn't I?

331
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,708
[CHIYO]
No. It was open.

332
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,333
[GAKUTO] After which, yours
truly and Joe excused ourselves

333
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,791
to the lavatory where
we met with Lady Chiyo.

334
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,791
[HANA gasps]

335
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,541
There, Chiyo put
on Joe's clothes,

336
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,333
and Joe in return, wore mine!

337
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,625
Then I made my
way to the office,

338
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,041
and our plan for a
three-way exchange went off

339
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,000
without a hitch!

340
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,166
You mean.

341
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,041
Wait, is that why you
cut your forehead?

342
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,208
[GAKUTO] Yes. To make it easier
for Sir Joe to disguise himself.

343
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,708
I then wrapped it in an
excessive amount of bandages!

344
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,375
[KIYOSHI] Mr. Chairman,
we now have proof.

345
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,291
The Underground Student Council
conspired to get rid of us!

346
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,791
The council set a trap.

347
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,666
With the intent of reversing
the new co-ed policy,

348
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,666
and they'd stop at nothing
to get rid of us.

349
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,708
From having crows
attack Joe's ants.

350
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,541
Orchestrating Andre's breakout,

351
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,250
and ensuring Shingo couldn't
make it back before curfew.

352
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,208
All of which were
set up by the USC.

353
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,458
It was called the "Destroy
Testicles Operation!"

354
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,166
All fabrications and
utter nonsense!

355
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,000
There's no evidence of
what you claim anywhere!

356
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,291
You mean the DTO planning
data you erased

357
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,333
from the computer? That
didn't stop us. Madam.

358
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,958
Were we not supposed to know?

359
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,250
We weren't just playing
hide-and-seek last night.

360
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's suppose someone with the
necessary knowledge knew how

361
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,416
to recover the lost data
from the office computer.

362
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,708
[MARI] Impossible. There's
no way you could...

363
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,875
Such a pathetic attempt
to save your neck!

364
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,166
I personally inspected the
corrections office last night,

365
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,791
I'll have you know! And I
was the only person inside!

366
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,583
[GAKUTO] 
Yes, I was outside.

367
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,583
I locked the corrections
office from inside,

368
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,000
then went out the back door.

369
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,416
Where I hid myself
until this morning.

370
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,375
By the time you and
the Vice President

371
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,125
were making your rounds,
you had already lost

372
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,333
to the brilliant tactician
standing here before you!

373
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,583
You're bluffing! Barely
ten minutes had passed

374
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,083
between Hana's text message and
when we headed to the prison.

375
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,583
There's no way you could've
recovered that data so quickly!

376
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,666
[GAKUTO]
Our work wasn't restricted

377
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,958
to a ten-minute window.

378
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,500
We had twenty minutes!

379
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,916
I had been able to download
the restoration software

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,291
onto the corrections
office PC ahead of time.

381
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,541
[MEIKO]
Ahead of time?!

382
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,625
[GAKUTO] Yes. Earlier,
when you were distracted

383
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,166
by our arm-wrestling
competition.

384
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,875
I seized the opportunity

385
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,291
and snuck into the office
for ten minutes.

386
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,708
[MEIKO]
Mother fuck.

387
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,708
Then, where is this
supposed data

388
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,083
you've acquired, son?

389
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,291
[GAKUTO]
The data...

390
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,000
[KIYOSHI, SHINGO, CHIYO groan]

391
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,250
[GAKUTO]
...is here.

392
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,958
I hold our futures
in my hand.

393
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,166
[CHAIRMAN]
What? The flash drive?

394
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,416
[GAKUTO] That's correct.
Though we may have been

395
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
born in different times and
places, we are of one heart!

396
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,458
We are of the same mind!

397
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,666
And this is the soul
of the five of us.

398
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:15,083
Which we have reclaimed after
overcoming hardships untold.

399
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,083
The amalgamated soul
of you young men,

400
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,708
I accept and shall holdfast!

401
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,791
[CHAIRMAN] Indeed. The troubles
you lads have suffered,

402
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,708
and what is written
in these plans

403
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,083
seems well past a coincidence.

404
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,083
Yes.

405
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,416
Hm...

406
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,291
[MARI whimpers]

407
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,291
It's my fault. All mine.

408
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,666
The only person who could have
left the back door unlocked

409
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,208
for Chiyo was you,
Kiyoshi. Isn't that right?

410
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,208
Yes. When I made my move

411
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,541
and exploited your opening,
I unlocked the back door.

412
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:04,500
Opening? Was that it? You
did all that to trick me?

413
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,958
Hana?

414
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,083
[HANA] That was all
just a distraction?!

415
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,083
I'm so sorry.

416
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,541
[HANA]
Fuck your sorries!

417
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,208
--[MEIKO] Hana, don't!
--[CHAIRMAN] Stop at once!

418
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,916
You're a dead man,
you hear me?!

419
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,416
Mari.

420
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,958
It ends now, Hana.
This isn't your fault.

421
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,333
Meiko, you aren't to
blame for this either.

422
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,708
I forced you both to go
along with my plans.

423
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,083
Please, no.

424
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,291
This was all my doing,
and I'm more sorry

425
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,208
than you'll ever know.

426
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,958
[CHAIRMAN] Very well.
These files implicate

427
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,166
the Underground Student
Council in the plot

428
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,333
to permanently eject
these boys. Correct?

429
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,500
[MARI]
Yes.

430
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,083
[CHAIRMAN]
Well, so be it.

431
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,625
Why, sis?

432
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,708
[CHAIRMAN] My decision
concerning your punishment

433
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,291
will be handed down... later.

434
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,791
Gentlemen. You were
originally confined

435
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,291
to the prison for the crime
of attempted peeking

436
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,875
into the girl's bath.

437
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,208
I hereby declare the debt
for that infraction

438
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,041
paid in full by the time
you spent behind bars.

439
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:21,583
To put it simply, from this
moment on, you are...

440
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,250
We are? Are what?

441
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,333
[KIYOSHI]
Well, brothers.

442
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,541
We are free!

443
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
[KATE] Long story short,
it seems the Underground

444
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,125
Student Council has broken
multiple school rules.

445
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,541
Furthermore, I've been
informed of acts of violence

446
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,166
taking place right
here in your office.

447
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,125
It is unclear what
exactly those were,

448
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,583
as the boy with the broken arm
has chosen not to press charges.

449
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,958
But after everything those
misandrists have done,

450
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,291
there's no way a simple
in-dorm suspension

451
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,916
will be sufficient,
Mister Chairman.

452
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,916
[CHAIRMAN]
Hm...

453
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,666
[KATE]
But as I told you earlier,

454
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,041
allowing lesser punitive
actions to take place

455
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,041
would appear too lenient,
especially since

456
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,166
the Underground Student Council
President is your daughter.

457
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,791
I take pride in being
an honest educator.

458
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,583
Will I treat her
differently? No!

459
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,125
School rules dictate
the law on our campus.

460
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,833
And there will be
no exceptions. None!

461
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,875
Very well. Your

These prison uniforms
