I've been informed that all five

31
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,125
of the boys are in that prison.

32

Come.

Isn't that treatment the
slightest bit... harsh?

35
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,666
They were guilty.

36
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,125
Under normal circumstances,
they would face expulsion.

Open and shut.

And besides...

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,458
I was against going
co-ed from the start.

40

As were the majority
of the student body,

the entire faculty.

[CHAIRMAN] Look, I realize
the desire you all have

to hold on to tradition,

44
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,083
but the natural order needs

45
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,916
a good shake up
from time to time.

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,416
Understand?

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,625
[MARI] Mister Chairman, you
ignored all our objections.

48
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,583
And on the first day, those boys
exhibited problematic behavior.

49
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,958
This chaos is the result
of the changes you made.

50
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,583
Young bucks, that's the
kind of hare-brained scheme

51
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,250
that boys their age come
up with every single day.

I know that, Mari.

And I'm not trying to justify
their actions in the slightest.

let them have their Saturdays

and Sundays off.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,875
Prison rules were set with
those contingencies in mind.

Why did you strike me thusly?

68

You failed to ask me why you're
clearing this plot of land.

Now that you know the question,

the answer is:
you're clearing this land

72

for the campus vegetable garden.

Eh?

167
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,291
[KIYOSHI]
It's Chiyo!

168
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,708
[KIYOSHI]
Uh.

169
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,291
[KIYOSHI]
What is she trying to do?

170
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,416
[CHIYO]
"Dear Kiyoshi.

171
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
The doors open at 1:00 PM 

172
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,000
at the Civic Gymnasium for
the student sumo tournament.

173
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,708
You can get sprung on
Saturday, can't you?"

174
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,291
Su-more of you soon.

175
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,000
[KIYOSHI]
Su-more of you soon.

176
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,333
The sad truth is,

177
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,791
we won't get any furlough time.

178
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,625
So the only choice I
have is to break out.

179
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,708
But seeing Chiyo gave me hope!

--[whip cracks]
--[gasps]

181
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,083
Why didn't you load all
the refuse onto the cart?

182
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:35,916
You piece of crap.

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,458
I'm sincerely sorry.

184
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,541
[KIYOSHI] Oh shit!
I must've missed some!

185
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,208
Now Gakuto's taking the
heat for my mistake.

186
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,250
[KIYOSHI]
I'm sorry!

187
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,541
I'll take care of it right now!

188
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,125
[GAKUTO]
Kiyoshi... Thank you!

189
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,500
[MEIKO]
No, he'll do it!

190
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,083
Hey, Gakuto...

191
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,333
I'm sorry, man.

192
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,291
She flipped out on you,
and it's all my fault.

...Gakuto?

194
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,541
Are you okay?

195
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,333
Yes. Just fine.

196
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,833
I've become inured to it.

197
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,041
Thus, all is well.

198
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,208
It was my bad, so have
one of my nuggets.

199

My, how very generous.

200
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,083
[GAKUTO] Sir Kiyoshi,
would you fancy some more tea?

201
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,666
[KIYOSHI]
Sure, thanks.

202
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,875
[GAKUTO]
I thought you should know.

203
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,458
I recovered
something of interest

204
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,125
lying near the refuse site.

205

[KIYOSHI gasps]

206
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,208
[KIYOSHI]
He knows.

207
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,875
There's no doubt about it.

208
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,375
But what's he planning?

209
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,000
How is he going to use
this to his advantage?

210
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,208
Would you like for me to
wash your back for you?

[gasps]

212
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,833
[GAKUTO]
You know, Kiyoshi...

213
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,125
It's my understanding that
the top sumo wrestlers

214
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,958
have devoted assistants.

215
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,833
Men who'll wash
their backs for them,

216
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,958
as well as their
bulbous posteriors.

For today's work shift, Hana

Yes, ma'am!

One things for sure.

than to rat me out

to the Underground
Student Council.

If they so much as catch
a whiff of a breakout,

Making a show of sumo customs.

Is he trying to play some
kind of mind game with me?

did he mean to save me just now?

I dunno what angle he's working.

Maybe he'll try to get special
treatment for squealing on me.

it, he'll have definitive proof!

Incidentally,

323
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,750
I've heard that the
top-ranked sumo wrestlers

324
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,208
have assistants who help
them wash their backs...

325
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,916
...as well as their derrieres.

326
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,750
What're you saying?!

327
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,458
You look at me and think about
sumo wrestlers? Am I fat?

328
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,666
No! It was just an
interesting factoid.

329
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,125
I meant nothing by it!

330
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,208
[MARI] I apologize for you
having to spend your weekend

331
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,166
overseeing the boys.

332
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,875
No, I don't mind that at all.

333
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,208
It's just... Are you
sure it's a good idea

334
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,000
to disobey the
Chairman's orders?

335
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,583
We're not supposed to
make the prisoners work

336
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,708
on their days off.

337
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,125
The Chairman's rule
granting free time

338
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,458
on the weekends applies
to model prisoners only.

339
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,291
And since their work
is behind schedule,

340
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,166
then they are not
model prisoners.

341
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,833
[MEIKO]
You couldn't be more right.

342
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,125
This is our duty.

343
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,958
When I think of how
those peeping toms are

344
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,208
going to be released
in half a month,

345
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,583
I can't sit by and do nothing.

346
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,791
It looks like Mari was here,

347
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,458
and she saw what
was on my screen.

348
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,958
Maybe that's why she took
the boys' free time away.

349
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,291
To pay me back.

350
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,458
Oh yes, Cruelty, thy name is...

351
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,625
...Woman!

352
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,083
But just in case,

353
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,583
I'd better take this home
before she finds it... too!

354
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,208
[JOE, ANDRE singing]

355
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,291
[GAKUTO] Yours truly has
a motive less fleeting

356
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,625
than a sumo date with
the fairer sex, my friend.

357
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,958
Art thou at all familiar with

358
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,791
"The Romance of the
Three Kingdoms"?

359
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,416
Well, I've heard the name
before, at the very least.

360
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,833
We look back to the
later Han Dynasty,

361
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,458
the end of the second
century, Common Era.

362
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,458
The emperor dies,
and the eunuchs

363
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,208
--known as the Ten Attendants--
--Just get to the point!

364
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,041
[GAKUTO]
Very well.

365
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,791
To make a long story short:

366
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,000
Quadrennially, the Three
Kingdoms figurine expo

367
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,666
is held in Akihabara the
same day as your sumo match!

368
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,083
It's quite simple, really.

369
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,125
Yours truly needs the
limited edition Guan Yu

370
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,583
and Red Hare figurines
to complete my collection!

371
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,500
And you had the nerve to
call my motive fleeting?

372
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,958
[GAKUTO]
Not even the same ballpark!

373
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,083
We're talking once-every-
four-years limited edition!

374
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,333
[KIYOSHI]
All right, I get it.

375
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,916
That's why you want
to break out with me.

376
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,041
Sir Kiyoshi, you really are
a buffoon, you know that?

377
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:17,916
We'd both be caught--

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,416
Yo! What're you guys up to?

379
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,958
Playing a little gomoku.

380
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,125
You want next?

381
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,583
Man, that's boring.
Count me out, bro.

382
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,208
Kiyoshi, it's a one-hour trip
one-way from the prison

383
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,583
to the gymnasium where your
sumo date will take place.

384
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,791
If we assume that watching
the matches takes one hour,

385
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,916
then we're talking a grand total
of three hours with you missing.

386
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,458
But if you go missing for three
hours during work detail,

387
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,416
the overseers will
definitely find out.

388
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,750
You got a point.

389
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,458
[GAKUTO] Simply put, it is
categorically impossible

390
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,250
for you to successfully
break out on your own,

391
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,250
and that's why I said
I'd aid your attempt.

392
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,208
Saturday afternoon,
during the three hours

393
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,916
when you'll escape to
go on your sumo date

394
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,708
as well as buy both Three
Kingdoms figures I want.

395
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,541
Yours truly will distract
the gaze of the overseers.

396
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,125
But how the hell are you gonna
distract them for that long?

397
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,291
[GAKUTO chuckles]
I have a stratagem.

398
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,875
Now pay attention.

399
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,375
[KIYOSHI]
No way!

400
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,083
A map of the school disguised
as a gomoku game! Badass!

401
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,291
Patrolling the campus
by night, are we?

402
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,041
Were you heading home?
Be careful--

403
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,083
--[thud]
--[gasps]

404
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,291
[MARI]
Starting tomorrow...

405
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,000
Those boys will learn the true
meaning of cruel and unusual.

406
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,333
Despite their crimes,

407
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,000
I want to ensure that
they don't end up becoming

408
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,583
the deplorable kind
of pervert that you are.

409
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,791
[CHAIRMAN]
Good luck with that.

410
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,041
Hmph.

411
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,250
The hole you're digging is

412
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,041
in the back of the
refuse shack, here.

413
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,958
Through which, if you
can extricate yourself,

414
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,708
you'll make your escape
without anyone the wiser.

415
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,208
The question is, how do I
keep our guards distracted

416
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,291
from your absence
for three hours?

417
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,375
The Underground Student Council
is rather observant, after all.

418
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,250
I appreciate the help, dude.

419
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,000
But from everything
you're saying,

420
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,208
it doesn't sound like breaking
out is even a possibility.

421
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,208
[GAKUTO chuckles]
Never fear, Brave Knight!

422
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,625
I, myself, have been called

423
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,958
the most resourceful
general in Nerima.

424
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,791
Yours truly has a
beauty of a plan

425
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,333
that will make the
impossible possible.

426
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,458
The cart's full. I'll dump it.

Once again, your
dereliction of duty

has lead to me being
horrifically savaged!

[GAKUTO] After everything
I've been through, that's it?

Get on your knees, and plead
for my forgiveness, right now!

You need to calm down.

Back atcha!

481

have gone better!

bring the shed crashing down.

485

leave us by the escape hole

in gear, Dickbags.

492

[KIYOSHI] So, uh... Hana,
are you planning to stay here?

493
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,458
Of course I'm staying.

494
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,083
I have to guard you two idiots.

495
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,666
All right, Brainiac.

496
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,208
Now Hana's gonna be guarding us.
You got a Plan B or something?

resourceful general in Nerima.

499

[KIYOSHI] So you have something
up your sleeve for this?

foresee this development.

Hey, Kiyoshi,
come here a minute.

508
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,375
Why the hell am I
being singled out?

509
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,375
[GAKUTO] It was an honor
serving with you.

510
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,083
What's with the whispering?

511
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,416
Were you telling Four-Eyes
over there about our incident?

512
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,166
[KIYOSHI]
Incident?

513
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, the piss!

514

Shut it! Not so loud.

515
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,666
Yeah, my bad.

516
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,750
I mean it.

517
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,041
You tell anyone
about what happened,

518
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,750
I'm gonna kill you,
then off myself, capiche?

519
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,916
Will you stop saying that?

520
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,250
I told you, my lips are sealed.

521
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,291
[HANA] Good. Now we can
pick up where we left off.

522
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,000
[KIYOSHI] I don't really
need to go right now.

523
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,625
That's fine. You'll drink this
until you're ready to burst.

524
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,000
So, what the hell is it?

525
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,791
[HANA]
It's just a cup of tea.

526
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,041
Now knock it back!

527

[KIYOSHI sighs]

528
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,625
[GAKUTO]
She hasn't killed you yet?

529
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,291
Plan B, you got anything yet?

530
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:38,583
[GAKUTO] If you think coming
up with ideas is so easy--

531
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,166
Then you'd be on target,

532
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,125
for yours truly has the sharpest
wit in all of Nerima, Comrade.

533
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,458
Hell yeah! So what's up?

534
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,916
We are no match for Hana
in the realm of strength.

535
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,791
Thus, we'll have to
attack from the inside.

536
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,500
Good call. But how?

537
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,583
Isn't it obvious?

538
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,375
I'll take the Lady
Hana as my bride.

539
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,750
Huh...?

540
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,958
The surest way is to win
over the lady's heart

541
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,583
utilizing my noble
demeanor and rakish charm.

542
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,250
[KIYOSHI]
Wait... I'm confused.

543
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,458
Is this your Plan B?

544
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,916
[GAKUTO]
Indubitably!

545
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,833
According to my
proficient profiling,

546
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,000
a young maiden who likes clover,
puts jorts on under her skirt,

547
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,541
and wears her hair
in straight bangs...

548
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,875
...is without a doubt,
a history fangirl.

549
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,583
Hence, I shall use
our shared passion

550
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,583
as a foolproof way to
curry favor with her.

551
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,708
[KIYOSHI]
Okay. So what's Plan C?

552
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,500
We haven't the time.
I must away.

553

Now wish me luck.

554

Don't go!

555
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,708

comes a tale from China at the
dawning of the third century.

Zhao Yun, carrying the
son of lord Liu Bei,

this most unexpected turn.

Uh-- Kiyoshi, have you a plan

571
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,000
involving that
little dance step?
