[groaning, grunts]

2
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,395
Take my hand, Meiko.
I'll help you up.

3
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,063
[MEIKO] Thank you,
Madam President.

4
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:33,606
Sorry for the commotion.

5
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,691
[HANA]
If you'd like, Meiko,

6
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:36,609
I can let you
borrow my jean shorts.

7
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:38,903
Jorts? Hmmm.

8
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:41,239
No. But your offer is most kind.

9
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:42,782
Are you sure?

10
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,243
[MEIKO] Yes. Well, I still have
work that needs tending to.

11
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:46,911
Please excuse me.

12
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:51,249
DTO. I've seen that somewhere.

13
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,793
[KIYOSHI] Seriously? I doubt
they'd leave that out.

14
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,045
It's top-secret.

15
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:57,672
I know.
The computer screen!

16
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:59,299
Last time, when the VP
called me into

17
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:02,052
the corrections office,
I saw DTO in some email.

18
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,096
Is that right? It might
have intel on their plan.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,474
If that's so, that email
is jsut what we need.

20
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:09,184
So if we can get into
the corrections office,

21
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,727
log in and grab that data,

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,021
we'd have all the proof we'd
need to give to the Chairman.

23
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,814
Show him those
psycho chicks set us up!

24
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:17,692
That's right! Then he will
repeal our expulsions!

25
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:20,028
But if they got rid
of the paper copy

26
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,738
of their project plan,
wouldn't they have also

27
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,073
erased the emails?

28
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,908
[JOE] He's right.
They wouldn't be dumb enough

29
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,077
to leave any of
those files behind.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,537
You're right, it couldn't
be that easy.

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,499
[GAKUTO] Why so
downtrodden, comrades?

32
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:34,584
Or are you fellows unaware?

33
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:37,837
I, myself, am well versed
in computer utilization.

34
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,798
I don't know about
well-versed man

35
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:41,883
but you are
the smell burst master.

remarks are growing old!

[ALL gasp]

39
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:49,265
[GAKUTO] What yours truly
is trying to say, is that

40
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,393
even if the emails were erased,
I know how to restore them!

41
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:52,977
Restore? Y'mean it?

42
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,229
It's a simple matter
of downloading

43
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,815
the restoration software
from a freeware site.

44
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:59,317
That being said, breaking
into the corrections office

45
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,902
is a horse
of a different color.

46
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:03,530
To be blunt, we don't
have enough time left.

47
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,990
Two more weeks and
then they get rid of us.

48
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:07,701
[BOTH grunt]

49
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:10,704
You're gonna give up
cause there's no time left?

50
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,080
Don't puss out.

51
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,289
If we're running
out of time,

52
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:15,375
we can't afford to waste
any more hesitating.

53
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,669
Now, let's go snag
that DTO project data

54
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,879
and show the world
we're mostly innocent!

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,549
Indeed. I shall join you

56
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,175
on your path of hope,
brave knight!

57
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,970
Yeah, why the hell not?
Count me in you guys.

58
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,556
Better to go out swinging
than sit back and do nothing.

59
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,975
Let's get out there and
make a miracle happen, bros.

60
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:34,102
We've got two weeks.
Fourteen days before

61
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:35,895
the Chairman
declares us expelled.

62
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,231
Our mission is to
track down that data.

63
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:40,316
And then take our
futures back from them!

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,485
After that,
it's wet t-shirt time!

65
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,738

00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,495
Pardon me, Ma'am.

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,456
It would appear you've
dropped your handkerchief.

Shingo saw a nipple and

77
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,721
got the shit kicked out of him.

78
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,890
What would those idiots
do to me for seeing this?

79
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:14,726
They must never find out,
but I can't stop staring.

00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:17,645
It's too perfect.
Hers is like a miracle.

Keep cool, man.

That's it!
Whatever it takes.

No way in hell
I'm leaving this school!

She's out of
hearing range, now.

85
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,493
Our rallying cry was cut
halfway through, earlier.

86
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,787
What say we
give it another try?

87

Sir Kiyoshi, if you
would take it from here.

88
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,999
Hm. I don't care
what happens.

89
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,168
We'll find that data!

90
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:41,503
We're gonna
take our futures back

91
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:42,754
from those crazy chicks!

92
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,130
And then we're
totally gonna catch that...

93

[KIYOSHI]
Poontang P.O.V.!

94
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:47,967
It would seem your
thoughts are not in harmony

95
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,594
with the rest of ours, good sir.

96
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,721
Yeah, I detected something
other than wet t-shirts.

97
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:52,597
[coughs]

98
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:53,765
Yeah, me too.

99
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,100
No, look, I'm just
focusing on our mission,

100
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,559
and that is it, guys.

101
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:31,446
[beeping]

102
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,585
Talking about it's one thing,
but the question is "how"?

103
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,671
Whether in this room
or our individual cells,

104
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,089
the door is locked
from the outside,

105
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,633
denying any approach
to the corrections office.

106
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,301
And even if
that were not the case,

107
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,053
it would be ill advised
to gain access

108
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,888
when the Vice
President is inside.

109
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,848
We're only allowed
in the hallways for class,

110
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,309
meal breaks, cleaning duty,
and when heading outside

111
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:02,894
to perform manual labor.

112
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:05,230
And later in the evening
when we have shower time.

113
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:07,440
None of those options
give us the time we'd need.

114
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:09,609
Plus the Vice President's
always somewhere nearby.

115
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:11,444
[MEIKO] Work detail
is finished, as of today.

116
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,405
After school, you're to
remain inside the prison,

117
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,448
where you can make use
of your time by studying!

118
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,616
[door clangs]

119
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,909
[KIYOSHI] I'm gonna
go ahead and assume

120
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,911
going outside the barricade
is off-limits now.

121
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,621
And they've kicked us out
during our lunch break,

122
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:24,165
which means one less shot
at getting in that office.

123
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,792
If we were still
doing work detail,

124
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,336
we might've been able to
sneak a saw back in with us.

125
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,422
No way. Cutting through
iron bars that thick

126
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,674
is totally out
of the question.

127
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:33,925
[GAKUTO sighs]

128
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,885
Perhaps there's a nook
where one could abscond.

129
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,179
No luck there.
When we're out in the hall

130
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:39,764
the Vice President
is either standing there

131
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,224
keeping an eye on us,

132
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:43,268
or she's off waiting
in the corrections office.

133
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:44,936
[JOE]
So, I was always curious.

134
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,896
What does she
get up to in there?

135
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,442
Well, um. She usually eats
good food or exercises.

136
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,902
[JOE] What about when she's not
here workin' at the prison?

137
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,071
[SHINGO] She's in a class
or her bedroom.

138
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,450
But either way, our asses
are stuck behind bars.

139
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,120
Ugh. I don't think getting
in there's even possible.

140
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:03,872
Shh!

141
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:05,498
The Discipline Committee
meeting has just

142
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:07,834
come to a close.
They decided that expulsion

143
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,878
was the only
appropriate response.

144
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,588
Once we have the
Chairman's official seal,

145
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:15,550
your time here will be over.
Thought you'd like to know.

146
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,054
[JOE] I guess
that's all she wrote.

147
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,764
Not that it's any surprise.

148
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:23,641
[SHINGO] Damn it!
We're running outta time!

149
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,269
[KIYOSHI] We've gotta find a way
to get a shot at that office!

150
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:28,063
[GAKUTO]
Hmmm.

151
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,564
There is yet a chance.

152
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,441
All we have to do
is take the key ring

153
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:32,776
from the Vice President.

154
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:33,693
[KIYOSHI, JOE, SHINGO gasp]

155
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:34,861
You mean by force?

156
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,863
That's impossible.
I don't think any of us

157
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,282
would stand the slightest chance
against the Vice President.

158
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,700
And even if all
five of us jumped her,

159
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,911
that's still not
a guarantee that we'd win.

160
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,579
It's way too risky to try!

161
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:46,998
[GAKUTO] Yes, the Vice
President's strength and skill

162
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:49,376
are on par with
some sort of demon-gorilla.

163
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,378
So? What do we do about it?

164
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:54,839
[GAKUTO chuckles]
Elementary, my dear Kiyoshi.

165
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,175
We simply turn
that strength against her.

166
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,390
[BOYS cheering]

167
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:04,349
Andre wins!

168
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,351
Aah! That's four in a row!

169
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,061
Andre is too strong
to be beat!

170
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,521
Those idiots are
about to get kicked out

171
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,690
and yet they
don't even seem to care.

172
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:15,235
[KIYOSHI] I present Hachimitsu
High's strongest contender!

173
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,653
--[ANDRE] Hm-hmm!
--[SHINGO] Hold on.

174
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:18,822
Calling him strongest in
school's going a bit too far.

175
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:19,823
Huh?

176
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,366
My man Andre's
a powerhouse.

177
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,034
Ain't no one stronger'n him!

178
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:26,246
Sure there is.
Like the Vice President.

179
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,415
The might of the Vice
President is unparalleled,

180
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,749
I assure you.

181
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,752
Come on! She may be tough,
but she's still a girl.

182
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,170
I bet Andre could take her.

183
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,505
[JOE]
Guess you're right.

184
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,298
I answer the challenge.

185
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:40,510
You really think that walking
sebaceous gland can defeat me?

186
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,554
No, ma'am.
I would never say that.

187
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,932
So. You think
you can beat Andre?

188
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,058
Arm wrestling?

189
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,393
[MEIKO] If I didn't think
I could win,

190
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,687
I wouldn't be doing this.

191
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,647
Bring it on, pork loaf.

192
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:57,152
Before you arm wrestle
with Andre,

193
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,070
allow yours truly
to take you on!

194
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,613
[MEIKO] Really?
You honestly think

195
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:02,657
you stand a chance against me?

196
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:05,452
Indeed, I do.
Though I'm painfully aware

197
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,162
of your power,
Madam Vice President,

198
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:10,457
my body has been tempered in the
forge of daily prison labor.

199
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,375
Before you test
the might of Sir Andre.

200
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,045
Allow me the honor of
being your first opponent!

201
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,422
Wow. You're always
full of surprises,

202
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:18,965
aren't you Brown Thunder?

203
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,384
I accept. I'll count
you as a warm up!

204
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,219
Just try not to shit yourself!

205
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:25,847
Everything has proceeded
perfectly, so far.

206
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,515
When you say "turn her
strength against her,"

207
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,100
I assume you've got some plan?

208
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,977
Naturally, the Vice
President seems to be

209
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,646
rather obsessive about her
exceptional physical prowess.

210
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,106
Right. Like how
she's always doin'

211
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,608
push-ups and squat thrusts?

212
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,027
[GAKUTO] Yes! Which is precisely
how we will entice her

213
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,613
into an arm wrestling
contest against us!

214
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,699
Sun Tzu said, "Use the
normal force to engage,

215
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,494
and the extraordinary
to win." So shall we.

216
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,412
I don't think a
sun zoo is a good idea.

217
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:51,790
Putting animals on a ball of
fire doesn't sound very smart.

218
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,208
[JOE] Mister Son
the telecomm tycoon!

219
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,459
[SHINGO]
Duh.

220
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:55,835
You wanna boil that down
to a simpler concept?

221
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,879
We steal the keys from
the Vice President's uniform

222
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,631
during the arm wrestling match.

223
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,216
While everyone else
distracts her,

224
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:04,594
I use the keys to gain entry
to the corrections office.

225
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:07,972
Once there, I've the know-how
to extract the desired data.

226
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:10,767
That is brilliant!
While we're hitting her head-on,

227
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,976
you're off
taking care of business

228
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,853
behind her enticingly
arched back!

229
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,438
It is the tactic of Sun Tzu,

230
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,399
great military
strategist of yore!

231
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,317
Not some
telecommunications mogul.

232
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,694
[ANDRE, SHINGO]
Oooh.

233
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,446
So, how exactly do we
get the keys away from her?

234
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,407
That part is
mere child's play.

235
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,075
We steal the
Vice President's keys by

236
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,160
being gentlemen and
offering to take her jacket

237
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:31,329
before the arm
wrestling even begins!

238
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:35,250
Sir Kiyoshi. You really
shouldn't be so rude! Now.

239
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,086
[KIYOSHI]
What? Oh, my bad.

240
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,504
Madam Vice President.

241
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:41,047
Shall I hold your jacket
while you compete?

242
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,591
I'm perfectly
fine like this.

243
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,926
Yeah okay, but...

244
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,678
...you'd probably have
an easier time without it.

245
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:47,804
[GAKUTO] Yes, most astute!

246
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,305
I said no.
Now let's get started.

247
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,807
[SHINGO]
That crap-spraying nerdlinger!

248
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,392
[ANDRE]
Mere child's play, he said.

249
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,977
[JOE]
It's totally falling apart!

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,646
[KIYOSHI] I guess we're gonna
just have to adapt our plan.

251
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,858
[KIYOSHI]
Okay then. Ready?

252
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,692
Go!

253
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,235
[GAKUTO yells]

254
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm not even
going to count that.

255
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,739
Outta the way, crybaby.

256
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:06,698
Zounds!

257
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:07,991
[MEIKO]
Hey, Andre. Let's roll.

258
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:10,076
Excuse me, ma'am,
but I'd like a turn

259
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,911
before you go for Andre.

260
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:15,290
I have more backbone
than Gakuto. No offense, man.

261
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,709
[MEIKO] I'll take you on.
Why the hell not?

262
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,128
[GAKUTO] Excellent.
Are both competitors ready?

263
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:21,629
All right. Begin!

264
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,131
[KIYOSHI grunts]

265
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,467
[MEIKO] You're definitely
better than Filthy Four-Eyes.

266
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,178
But not much.
What's the matter?

267
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:31,514
That all you got?
I'm going to end this.

268
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,350
[yells]

269
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,268
[KIYOSHI, MEIKO gasp]

270
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:39,314
[KIYOSHI] Her nipple! Areola!
Top-mounted joy-buzzer!

271
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:40,648
[MEIKO]
Uh.

272
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:43,568
Madam Vice President,
do you require assistance?

273
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,528
What's up with this
piece of shit table?

274
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:46,905
[GAKUTO] We'll go fetch
a replacement table

275
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:48,239
right away, madam!

276
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,408
All right.
So, who's up next?

277
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,326
You, Shingo?

278
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,036
Now hold on a sec!

279
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,163
Our match isn't over
just 'cause the table broke.

280
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,539
That's Ridiculous!

281
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:58,416
I wiped the floor
with you, hands down!

282
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,210
[KIYOSHI] No! Even when
the table collapsed,

283
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:01,711
my knuckles never touched it!

284
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:04,422
[MEIKO] It'll end the same.
You know you can't beat me.

285
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,549
[GAKUTO] Keep up
the pressure, Sir Kiyoshi!

286
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,344
Buy as much time
as you possibly can!

287
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,554
So let's assume
you make it to the office.

288
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,015
No doubt they've
deleted the DTO files.

289
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,558
You know a way
to recover the data?

290
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:16,726
Is that right?

291
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,020
Mhmm. It may appear
to have been erased.

292
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,730
But it still exists,
somewhere deep down

293
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:23,024
in the darkest bowels of
the computer's hard drive.

294
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,360
If I can just download
the restoration software,

295
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:26,903
it's really quite simple.

296
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,405
Well it may seem
simple to you,

297
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:30,532
but I wouldn't even know where
to start with all of that.

298
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:31,866
Me either.

299
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,618
And I bet Shingo and
Kiyoshi would say the same.

300
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:36,579
The job can only be
accomplished by yours truly.

301
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,081
And though it is
a simple task,

302
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:40,542
it is one that will
require time to complete.

303
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,544
That's why you must
utilize the arm wresting

304
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,088
to distract the Vice President
for as long as you can.

305
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:47,007
Cool. So how long
do the four of us have

306
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,550
to keep her distracted?

307
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,845
[GAKUTO] Hm. I'll need ten
minutes at the very least.

308
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,221
Ten minutes.

309
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,306
That breaks down to two
and a half minutes per man.

310
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,850
Which isn't gonna be
easy against someone

311
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,476
as tough as the Vice President.

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,478
But what other
choice have we got?

313
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:01,855
[KIYOSHI grunts]

314
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,774
The match was inconclusive.
Please let me try again!

315
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,359
You don't give up, huh?

316
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:09,571
Okay, fine. A rematch
for the whiner. Let's go!

317
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,239
[KIYOSHI]
Thank you very much, ma'am!

318
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,495
[KIYOSHI] All right! Now it's
just a race against time!

319
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,956
I'm gonna tie her up
for as long as I can.

320
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,584
I don't even care
if I break my arm doing it!

321
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,586
[SHINGO] Kiyoshi sure
is full on amped up!

322
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,838
[JOE] He's so psyched
we might not get a turn!

323
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,423
[ANDRE]
He could pull this off!

324
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,843
[SHINGO]
Ready. Go!

325
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,845
[grunting]

326
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,221
Hey boy, what's wrong?

327
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,390
I'm only using thirty percent
of my strength here,

328
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,558
and you're not looking good.

329
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,559
[JOE, ANDRE gasp]

330
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:40,810
She's only giving
thirty percent?

331
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,562
[MEIKO] I'm starting to
get bored with this.

332
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:43,813
How about I finish you off

333
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:46,149
by cranking things up
to forty percent?

334
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:47,400
[yells]

335
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:48,943
C'mon, man! Hang on!

336
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,362
[MEIKO]
Getting close now.

337
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,073
[KIYOSHI] No way! I'm not
throwing in the towel yet!

338
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,534
[KIYOSHI] Everything is
riding on this!

339
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,578
Even if my arm snaps
in freakin' half.

340
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,705
I can't afford to lose yet--

341
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,083
Hello! Nipple.

342
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,669
It's gone.
Now it's back again!

343
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,045
And... it's gone.

344
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,589
What are you doing?
Do you mock me?

345
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:10,924
When you appear,
you vanish,

346
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:12,717
when you vanish,
I still see you.

347
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,886
[sighs]
Am I enlightened?

348
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:16,388
Have I been transported
to some kind of

349
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,348
inter-dimensional Nipple-vana?

350
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:21,101
[SHINGO]
Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi! Kiyoshi!

351
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:22,268
[KIYOSHI]
Huh?

352
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:25,689
So, uh. Your arm.
It's gotta hurt, right?

353
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:27,649
Dammit! I lost the match?

354
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,109
Wait a second,
when did that happen?

355
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,735
Whatdaya mean
"When'd it happen"?

356
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,904
You didn't last one minute.

357
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,073
[KIYOSHI]
You're kidding! She beat me!

358
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,242
Maybe that nip-slip
was part of her strategy

359
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,576
from the beginning.

360
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,037
Was it the same for
that coochie flash earlier?

361
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,914
No, that was something else.

362
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,875
I doubt even the Vice President
would plan something like that.

363
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,293
I don't care if my
arm got all jacked up

364
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,378
in the process.

365
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:49,879
I can't believe
I didn't last a minute!

366
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,173
Curse you, evil nipple!

367
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:54,009
[GAKUTO]
Data restoration software.

368
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,761
Found it! Here goes nothing.

369
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,346
The shirt's off!

370
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,057
Lemme get a little stretch and
then I'll be next challenger.

371
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,517
[SHINGO]
Watch and learn, Kiyoshi.

372
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,893
You can't expect
to buy much time

373
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,395
by fighting fair against her.

374
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,772
I really hope you're
stronger than you look, Shingo,

375
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:08,898
'cause I'm bored.

376
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,483
Careful... You don't
take me seriously,

377
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:11,735
and you're bound to get hurt.

378
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:13,236
After all, I didn't
earn the nickname

379
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,779
"Dynamite Arm Wrestler Shingo"

380
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,157
by taking it easy
on my opponents!

381
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,202
[SHINGO] It was the summer after
my second year of middle school.

382
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,288
I was sitting on these
giant pipes in an empty lot,

383
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,706
surrounded by
some shady characters

384
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,124
who wanted to start some beef.

385
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,959
And I was like, "You wanna
rumble, you Jive-turkeys?"

386
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:29,210
[MEIKO]
I don't care.

387
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,587
Let's do this already!

388
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,088
Hey, hang on a minute!
I haven't gotten to the part

389
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:34,591
in my back-story where
I earn the cool nickname yet!

--[MEIKO] Start us off!
--[KIYOSHI] Yes ma'am!

00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,762
Ready. Go!

00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:39,846
[SHINGO]
Ah-ha!

394
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:40,805
What's going on, man?
I don't think

395
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,223
you even cleared
a full second!

396
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:43,558
[SHINGO] I thought I'd
be able to buy more time

397
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,143
with manly stories from my past.

398
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:48,521
Okay, warm-up round's
done! Andre, come on.

399
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,065
Can't look like a coward
in front of the others,

400
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,232
Madam Vice President.

401
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,400
If you know
what's good for you,

402
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,902
then you'd better just
back off now.

403
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,320
[JOE]
Afraid I can't.

404
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,322
Instead, I'll have to
warn you as you've warned me.

[MEIKO gasps]

406
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,868
[MEIKO] After all the manual
labor you scab-pickers

407
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,746
have had to do, how can you
be so disturbingly scrawny?

408
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:08,416
[JOE] Judge me by my looks,
do you? Hm? Big mistake.

409
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,127
[GAKUTO] What kind of
modem is this, dial-up?

410
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:12,879
It's barely trickling through!

[KIYOSHI]
Ready...

412
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:16,633
Go!

[coughs]

414
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,473
Tell me, does beating
a poor weakling like me

415
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,100
leave a bad taste
in your mouth?

416
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:26,351
[MEIKO]
Now that you mention it.

417
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:27,811
It's finally finished
downloading.

418
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,938
Now to install the program.

419
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,440
Well Looks like it's
down to you and me, chunky.

00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,566
Are you ready?

421
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,235
I look forward to
wrestling with you.

422
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:36,653
[KIYOSHI]
Seven more minutes?

423
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:40,198
I'm sorry, Andre. The rest
of us were total pussies.

[MEIKO]
Yeah.

[MEIKO] A hair growing
from his nipple.

431

And what's worse,
it's so freakishly long!

on the ropes!

Finish her!

00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:05,890
[KIYOSHI]
No, not yet!

437
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,684
We've still gotta buy Gakuto
another seven minutes.

438
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,895
Even if you can beat her, it's
way too soon to finish, Andre!

439
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,439
[MEIKO] How could I
have been so careless?

440
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:15,150
I let myself be distracted by
Double-Stuff's nipple hair!

Tons of Fun?

You're a couple steps up
from the others, sure,

but is that all you've got?

I'm going to put
an end to this right now!

[ANDRE grunts]

447
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,749
[MEIKO]
The nipple hair is moving!

448
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,542
That nasty thing
is swaying side to side

449
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,085
from this heifer's snorting!

450
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,171
The way his breath
makes it swing.

451
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,591
It's almost like...
a single, inexplicable tree

452
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:43,762
standing alone in the desert,
waving in the breeze.

453
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,181
It invokes a strong sensation.

454
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:49,017
Equal parts mesmerizing
and confusing.

455
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,393
[SHINGO]
Oh yeah!

456
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,562

fight in him! Go Andre!

like that, Chubs!

with me? That hair!

[KIYOSHI]
From where I'm standing,

460
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,569
they look pretty much
evenly matched!

461
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,905
At this rate, he might
hold out for all seven.

462

No, all six minutes left!
Don't give up, Andre!

00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,285
[MEIKO] Damn it! Every time
I start to make progress

464
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,620
and move his arm.

00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:10,622
I see that hair and
my strength starts to fade.

466
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,832
That's a dirty trick, fatso!

467
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,209
[ANDRE] The Vice President's
calling me names

468
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,336
and spitting on me?! Ahhh!

469
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,712
Hey, what gives, Andre?

470
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,838
Is it the insults? Quick!

471
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:21,591
Think of whatever's
not sexy to you!

472
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,093
[gasps]

473
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,345
[SHINGO]
Oh! Andre with the comeback!

474
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,429
[KIYOSHI]
What the--?

475
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,056
That wasn't Andre
making a comeback.

476
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,933
That was the Vice President
getting weaker!

477
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,810
She's acting
stranger than normal.

478
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,728
[MEIKO] If I move his arm
past a certain point,

479
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,438
the nipple hair pops into view.

480
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:37,273
What do I do? That's it!

481
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:39,526
If I can win the match
with overwhelming speed,

482
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,152
then I've beaten him before
the sight of the hair

483
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:42,946
even has a chance to register!

484
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,906
The kid gloves
are off now, Meatball.

485
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:48,702
I'm cranking things up to one
hundred percent strength!

486
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,371
[KIYOSHI] Not yet!
It's too soon for him to lose!

487
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,748
[ANDRE grunts]

488
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,208
[MEIKO gasps]

489
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,460
It's a twister!
But that majestic,

490
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,587
lonely tree can
withstand anything that

491
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,008
this fierce desert
tornado tries to deliver!

492
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:08,221
[MEIKO] Stay strong! You can
take it, nameless tree!

493
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:10,265
[SHINGO] Way to go Andre,
that's what's up!

494
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,100
[MEIKO gasps]

495
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,435
Stop scaring me like that!

496
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:14,894
[KIYOSHI]
All right! I dunno why,

497
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,604
but the Vice President
keeps getting weaker.

498
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,898
Now just draw it out
until Gakuto gets back!

499
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,942
[MEIKO] Stop growing
hypnotizing hairs!

500
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,111
Restoration software's
been installed.

501
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,779
And with
only four minutes left!

502
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,781
Awesome, bro! You might
actually win this!

503
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,491
Yeah! Kick ass, Tubbo!

504
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:29,909
[MEIKO]
No matter what I do,

505
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,245
that hair won't
stop taunting me.

506
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,873
Why is there even a hair
growing out of his nipple?

507
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,834
And just one!
From his right nipple!

508
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,878
I'm through
messing around, chunk!

509
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,004
[ANDRE moans]

510
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,672
That feels so amazing.

511
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:46,092
If she keeps rewarding me,
I'll lose it!

512
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:49,512
Andre! You gotta calm down.
Just stay focused, okay?

513
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:51,556
Stupid pig! Are you
getting off on this?

514
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:53,391
[MEIKO] This is
starting to piss me off.

515
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,435
And why does he
look like such an idiot?

516
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:57,937
His eyes are rolling back,
like he's mocking me.

517
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,189
[gasps]

518
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,191
His eyes!

519
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,776
What is this?
Something's changed!

520
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,652
She's blushing
and smiling now!

521
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,404
[MEIKO] Why am I only now
realizing something

522
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,323
so overwhelmingly simple?

523
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,075
I'm embarrassed
it took this long!

524
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,619
[KIYOSHI] Oh man. I've got
a bad feeling about this.

525
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:15,246
[MEIKO] If I don't want to be
distracted by the rogue hair,

526
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,165
I just have to not look at it!

527
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,583
What the hell? Why has
the Vice President

528
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,918
closed her eyes?

529
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,503
What's she got planned now?

530
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,546
You don't think she's waiting
for Andre to try for first base?

531
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,464
[yells]

532
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:25,715
I'm not going to
make it in time!

533
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,801
[MEIKO grunts]
[ANDRE groans]

534
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:29,386
[SHINGO]
Andre! Tough it out!

535
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,054
[KIYOSHI] Oh no! We've still
got two more minutes!

536
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:33,515
If Andre loses this now,
then Gakuto is toast!

537
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:34,766
[GAKUTO]
Where is it?

538
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,143
DTO email, if you can
hear me, show yourself!

539
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:40,647
And now. You lose!

540
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,696
[ANDRE]
No. Too much.

541
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,575
[moans]

542
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:56,121
[MEIKO laughs]

543
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,288
That's it, bitches!

544
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,791
Proof that I'm the
school's strongest mofo!

545
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:03,211
[KIYOSHI] You're kidding.
One minute short?

546
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:06,965
[MEIKO] Hm! You couldn't
beat me in a hundred years.

547
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,260
[gasps]
My keys. They're gone.

548
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,305
[MEIKO]
Hm.

549
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:20,478
Madam Vice President.
Your keys are here.

550
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,022
You must have dropped
them when you fell.

551
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,690
[MEIKO] Give them back
before you soil them.

552
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,984
And you, sweat pig. Stand up.

553
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:26,901
[ANDRE]
Right!

554
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,361
[whimpers]

555
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,155
Hm!

556
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:34,451
[cell door clangs]

557
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,495
[ANDRE, SHINGO, JOE sigh]

558
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,247
Man, I thought
we were caught for sure!

559
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,707
Way too close,
if you ask me!

560
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,000
Back in perfect timing bro!

561
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,418
Nice going, Andre!
You were awesome!

562
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,628
Nah. I was just at
the height of ecstasy.

563
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,630
[JOE] You were about to make
yogurt at the end there!

564
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:48,840
[KIYOSHI]
So, where's this data?

565
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:53,011
[GAKUTO]
Mm! The data...

566
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,929
It was unattainable, I fear.

567
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,348
[BOYS]
Huh?

568
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:57,891
I'd gotten as far
as downloading

569
00:21:57,974 --> 00:21:59,893
and installing
the restoration software.

570
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,062
But before it could
track down the email.

571
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:04,397
I heard Sir Andre crying out,
and thus I hastened

572
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,733
to return before
being discovered.

573
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:09,778
So that means
we have nothing?

574
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,784
[KIYOSHI] We're going
to get expelled,

575
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,495
and there's
nothing left to do?

576
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,294
[JOE coughs]

577
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,215
[SHINGO] You know what?
It's actually kind of a relief.

578
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,384
Besides, we did
everything we could.

579
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:36,054
Uh-huh.

580
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,347
I guess.

581
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,682
Looking back at things now,

582
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,351
this time has been like
a dream come true for me.

583
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:45,105
[GAKUTO] Really? It's been
a nightmare for yours truly.

584
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,691
Soiling my pants in front
of all those cute girls,

585
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:51,945
having my hair cut, and the
loss of my Guan Yu figure.

586
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:55,198
It's all been rather ghastly.

587
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,742
However, fighting through
all the hardships

588
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,536
since we were put in here,

589
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,163
for the first time
in my life, it feels like--

590
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,791
like yours truly
has found friends.

591
00:23:04,874 --> 00:23:06,751
It has been a privilege
to call you gentlemen

592
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,336
my comrades.

593
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,797
Dumbass nerd.
We were all thinking it.

594
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,049
But that doesn't mean
you have to say it out loud.

596

597
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:19,264
[ANDRE sobbing softly]

598
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,474
[KIYOSHI] Our high school lives
were coming to an end.

599
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,018
Or so we thought.

600
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:02,242
[KIYOSHI] Next time
on Prison School:

601

"It's a Bum-derful Life."
