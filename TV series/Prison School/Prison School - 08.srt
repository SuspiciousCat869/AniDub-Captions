no course of action?

[JOE]
I tried talking to him,

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,166
but he didn't seem to
notice me at all. [coughs]

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,750
It's hard to fathom
how the human mind

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,416
could devolve to such a state,

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,791
and much less for one
pining for punishment!

8
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,916
[ANDRE]
Punish me, Madam.

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,625
Please, punish me.

10
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,125
Why won't you punish me?

11
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,291
[MEIKO] Make sure to be back
here by suppertime, at 6:30.

12
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,041
If you're a minute late,
we'll chalk it up as a breakout.

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,541
Thank you, Madam.

14
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,291
But... I haven't really done
anything to earn this favor.

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,375
What's the matter with you?

16
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,791
You want the time
outside or not?

17
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,083
[SHINGO]
No, ma'am!

18
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,625
I mean, yes, ma'am!
I'd like to go out please!

[KIYOSHI]
Andre's looking terrible.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,208
Why is he the only one not
getting smacked around

23
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,458
by the Vice President?

24
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,958
Now that I think of it,

25
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,916
there's been a lot of
weird crap going on.

Uh... My bad.

30
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,708
It's just that...

31
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,375
The Vice President's been
taking you off alone a bunch.

32
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,250
Are you okay?

33
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,333
Uh, I don't know what you mean.

34
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,666
Cool, man.

35
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,333
As long as she's not
torturing you or something.

36
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,708
I dunno. The Underground
Student Council's been

37
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,291
acting strange lately.

38
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:24,333
Anyway, if the situation
goes south, just let me know.

39
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,416
I'd like to help you if I can.

Yes, ma'am.

43

[SHINGO] I should be back
by 6:30, with time to spare!

Oh, ho, ho! Jackpot!

[ANZU] I can't wait to see
these "Grapes of Wrath."

Yeah, right.

I bet you're acting tough
'cause you're scared!

[SHINGO]
I'm not scared!

You snatch-rags are going to
service the barricade entrance.

What's this?

61
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,125
Decided to bring your club
activities outside, huh?

62
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,500
Yeah!

63
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,416
It's a lovely day, I thought
we'd get some fresh air.

64
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,583
Sounds like a delightful
way to spend your time!

The gate's working fine.

69
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,500
[GAKUTO] Is Sir Andre foregoing
his ablutions yet again today?

70
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,750
[JOE] Yeah...
I tried to get him to shower,

71
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,416
but he's gone back to sitting
in the corner of his cell.

[MAYUMI]
I was so nervous

73
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,583
the Vice President would figure
out what we were doing.

74

Thanks for your help, Mayumi.

You did great!

76
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,666
I really hope Kiyoshi was
able to see our message.

77
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,833
I think he did.

78
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,291
As he was walking past us,

79
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,875
I looked in his eyes, and it
seemed like he understood.

to overdo it with me.

Did you really
just call me mommy?!

Too bad. You're
just out of reach.

I can't punish you from
all the way back here.

submitting myself--

gotten through.

Sir Kiyoshi... Take a look.

182
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,750
These wires appear to have
been partially cut through.

183
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,333
They screwed us.

184
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,416
This was all just
part of their plans!

185

That went well, don't you think?

186
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,916
Yes. All thanks to
our secret weapon.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,041
I never imagined such utility
from a too-tight uniform.

He was at his breaking point.

00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,875
My wardrobe malfunction
just lit the fuse.

190
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,208
Just as you planned,
Madam President.

191
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,375
You put up with the constraints

192
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,541
of that tight uniform
like a champion.

193

Thank you.

Now we wait for your
canary to return to his cage.

196
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,875
Y'know, "The Grapes of Wrath"
is a really misleading title.

197
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,125
I'll take your word for it.

198

I was fast asleep before
the thirty-minute mark.

And now, with the way
that things've been going,

00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,708
it might get even more perfect.

I ain't mad at all!

Actually, to tell the
truth, I'm really happy.

Yeah, I think.

If you're so happy, why'd
you pull a psycho-face?

When you're squishing

the face is gonna respond.

Fine, you pinch my

taking his time coming back.

I also let him know that if
he's even one second late,

00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,875
it'll count as a breakout.

my privilege to support the

as Captain of the Guard.

I didn't do something
wrong, did I?

299
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,958
So tell me, Anzu, would a
position in the executive branch

300
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:27,958
be of interest to you?

You flatter me, Madam President.

Listen close.

You have what it
takes to succeed.

You'll have my
recommendation on your résumé.

So, yeah. My mission was
to get friendly with you

away from school.

I was supposed to take you out.
And to make sure that you didn't

311
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,250
get back to the school in time.

312
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,500
Which would then count
against you as a third breakout,

313
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,500
meaning all of the
boys get expelled!

it doesn't stop yours truly

475
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,375
--from being jealous.
--If you caught a nip-slip,

476
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,708
a simple apology isn't
going to cut it, homie.

477
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,625
Tell us dude, pink or brown?

478
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,291
Okay, so now the
score's back to even.

479
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,250
[CHAIRMAN]
Welcome to my office.

480
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,750
It's a pleasure to meet you.

481
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,958
Hi!

482
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,166
[BOYS]
The pleasure's all ours, sir.

483
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,666
[CHAIRMAN] I had hoped we
wouldn't have to meet

484
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,250
in this fashion.

485
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,875
You boys are all aware of why
you've been called before me...

486
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,833
--...right?
--Mari and the rest set them up!

487
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:51,958
[CHAIRMAN]
Chiyo...

488
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,416
I'll listen to what
you have to say--

489
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,541
I saw it in the Underground
Student Council's office!

490
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,458
A document with "DTO:
Destroy Testicle Operation"

491
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,708
written on it!

492
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,458
Mari, is what your
sister saying true? Well?

493
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,375
She must be mistaken.

494
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,208
I have neither seen nor heard
of anything like that, sir.

495
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,500
[MARI]
Without any proof,

496
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,291
there's nothing
for me to explain.

497
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,375
[CHIYO gasps]

498
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,500
[MARI]
Unless there's something else,

499
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,583
why don't you run along, Chiyo?

500
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,583
[CHIYO] I'm so sorry,
Kiyoshi. I tried to help.

501
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,666
[KIYOSHI]
Thanks, Chiyo.

502
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,833
In accordance with
student regulations.

503
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,208
the five of you are
to be expelled.

504
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,708
Isn't that right, Chairman?

505
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,458
According to the student
handbook... Yes!

506
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,958
We can discuss
this matter further

507
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,541
at next week's
committee meeting,

508
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,458
which will end with the
Chairman putting his seal

509
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,708
on the expulsion papers,
making the decision final.

510
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,583
Does that timeline work
for your schedule, sir?

511
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,208
[CHAIRMAN sighs]

512
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,666
[MARI] Mister Chairman!
The rules are very clear!

513
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,958
How long will justice wait?

514
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:53,875
The week after next,
at the very latest... Aah!

515
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,916
Well, I'd say that DTO
was a rousing success!

516
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,666
And masterfully
executed, ladies!

517
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,750
Here, let's raise a glass
to a boy-free Hachimitsu!

518
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,333
[ALL]
Cheers!

519
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,916
[MEIKO] And now, to celebrate
the favorable conclusion of DTO,

520
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,041
might I be so bold as to
give a little performance?

521
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,625
Marvel as I do 50 pull-ups,

522
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,291
utilizing only the
strength of my fingers!

523
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,000
One... Two...

524
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,875

--[MEIKO] Three...
--How did Shingo make it back

526
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,041
in time for curfew, anyway?

527
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,291
--[MEIKO] Four...
--[MARI] I'll have Anzu

528
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,041
come join us, and ask
her for a few answers.

529

--[MEIKO] Forty-eight.
--Only two more left, now.

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,708

You're getting close!

--[ANZU] You sent for me?

536

[GAKUTO]
So it's come to this.

537
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,500
In less than two weeks,
we'll be gone.

538
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,666
[ANDRE sighs]

539
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,458
Goodbye, wet t-shirt contest.

540
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,750
Huh? Wet t-shirt contest?

541
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,041
Where they blast
girls with water

542
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,375
till their shirts
are see-through?

543
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,625
Yeah.

544
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,750
They have summer school
by the sea, apparently.

545
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,500
[SHINGO sighs]
I...

546
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,958
Somehow I already knew about it.

547
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,666
The image of a wet
t-shirt contest

548
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,125
flashed through my mind
as I ran back to school.

549
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,791
I saw it, and I thought
to myself, "What was that?"

550
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,041
I turned, and there
was this van.

551
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,625
If it hadn't been
for that vision...

552
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,291
Well, he would have
squashed me flat.

553
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,750
In sooth?

554
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,250
Then our hopeful thoughts
managed to reach out to you!

555
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,791
It's a miracle!

556
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,458
Seriously? Bad ass.

557
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,791
[ANDRE]
I guess miracles do happen, huh?

558
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,791
So then you became
enamored with this Shingo,

559
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,791
and divulged our plan to him?

560
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,458
You're the Captain
of the Guard, Anzu.

561
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,000
This won't reflect well on you.

a complete success.

matter any further.

Now go.

Yes, ma'am.

Don't worry about the
door on your way out.

572
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,750
Okay. Are you certain
you don't need a hand?

573
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,708
[MEIKO]
It's okay. Go on.

574
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,500
Was that wise,
Madam President?

00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,208
I'm afraid she knows too
much about our operation.

576
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,875
Until the boys
have been expelled,

577
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,333
keep her under
constant observation.

578
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,083
Clever indeed! Keeping tabs
on her comings and goings

579
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,416
is a wise course of action.

Hey, Meiko? Are you sure
you don't need a hand?

I'm fine, thank you.
