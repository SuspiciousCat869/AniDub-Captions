1
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,833
So what am I gonna do?

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,666
I didn't have enough
heads-up to make any plans.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,916
I know.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,333
I'll take care of that
errand for the VP first.

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,041
Buy me some root beer
and kaki peanuts

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,416
from the store in front
of the train station.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,666
[SHINGO]
After that, guess I can

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,000
kill some time at the arcade.

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,375
[GAKUTO]
General Guan Yu,

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,416
your commanding presence
counters my inner weakness.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,541
For I have reaped the
rewards of what I'd sown,

12
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,041
yet abandoned my brother-in-arms

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,291
to shoulder the blame
for the breakout alone!

14
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,833
The shame!

15
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,458
Such ignoble cowardice!

16
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,875
No, worse than cowardice.

17
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,875
More like treason!
I don't want to be a traitor!

18
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,791
Lord Guan Yu, how can
yours truly put things right?

19
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,458
What do I do?

20
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,708
[game characters grunt]

21
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,208
[SHINGO]
Shit-snacks!

22
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,333
[ANNOUNCER]
KO!

23
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,083
[SHINGO sighs]

24
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,375
[SHINGO]
Guess I'll go back.

25
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,583
Though there's still time...

26
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,833
--[ANZU] Giving up already?
--[SHINGO gasps]

27
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,791
Pretty sad performance.

28
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,208
I've been way too busy to play

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,291
the last couple weeks, so
I kinda got a little rusty.

30
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,875
Uh-huh. Is that one of
our school's uniforms?

31
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,916
Wait, you go to Hachimitsu High?

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,250
[SHINGO]
She seems a helluva lot cooler

33
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,916
than the rest of
those stuck-up chicks.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,583
So what exactly are you
doing here at the arcade?

35
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,916
I thought all of the boys

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,750
were supposed to be stuck
in the school's prison.

37
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,333
[SHINGO] I was asked to
run a couple errands,

38
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,708
not that it's any
of your business.

39
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,291
[ANZU] Whoa! Pump the
brakes, Arthur Fonzarelli!

40
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,875
Have you got a
stick up your ass?

41
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,291
Or is that your pathetic attempt
at talking to an older girl?

42
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,625
[SHINGO gasps]

43
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,708
You're uh...

44
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,041
What?

45
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,708
[ANZU] You all right?
Your face is turning red.

46
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,083
[SHINGO]
No, it's not!

47
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,916
Take it easy there, Tiger.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,416
It's natural to get a little
excited by cleavage.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,458
Nah! I wasn't lookin'!

50
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,041
Anzu! It's photo booth time!

51
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,458
[ANZU]
Just a sec!

52
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,375
I'll take you on
any day of the week.

53
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,416
Guess whose name
is number one?

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,666
--[SHINGO grunts]
--[ANZU] See you around, Slick.

55
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,333
[SHINGO] I haven't talked
to a girl that much without

56
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,583
getting smacked
since I enrolled.

57
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,041
Or ever, really.

58
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,583
I wonder if she's
always at the arcade.

59
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,125
[door creaks]

60
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,041
[MEIKO] So, did you
enjoy your time outside?

61
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,166
[SHINGO]
Very much, thank you, ma'am.

62
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,208
But the time seemed
to really fly by.

63
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,166
[MEIKO] Did you purchase
what I requested?

64
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,916
[SHINGO]
Yes. It's in the fridge.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,708
[MEIKO]
Huh...

66
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,166
[SHINGO]
So, uh...

67
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,833
Is there a chance, maybe I
could be allowed out again?

68
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,083
[MEIKO] That depends entirely
on your performance.

69
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,583
[MEIKO gasps, coughs]

70
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,375
Damn it!

00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,500
--Ass hat!
--Sorry! I was running

72
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,416
to get back in time!

73
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,708
For the record,

74
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,208
root beer's carbonated!

75
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,458
Stop gawking!

76
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,375
--And get back to work!
--[SHINGO] Yes, ma'am!

77
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,916
[SHINGO] Getting out of here
depends on my performance?

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,291
But nothing's really
been happening

79
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,791
that's worth reporting.

80
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,166
[SHINGO]
Hm?What's that?

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,833
Where did you come from?

82
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,083
[crackling]

83
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,500
Stop.

84
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,041
That should be sufficient.

85
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,666
[SHINGO] So why did you want
me to crush these kaki peanuts?

86
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Watch and learn, Einstein.

87
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,250
[SHINGO]
Chicken breasts?

88
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,958
You mean--

89
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,500
No way!

90
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,458
[MEIKO]
Agh!

91
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,541
Fryer grease is dangerous!
You should put an apron on!

92
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,791
[MEIKO] The kaki-peanut
breading acts like a barrier,

93
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,250
sealing in the
marinade's flavor,

94
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
and prevents the chicken
from getting dry.

95
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,250
It also provides for
a succulent crunch.

96
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,708
Looks like it tastes good.

97
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,625
It does.

98
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,208
--[yelps]
--[SHINGO] It's too hot

100

[blows]

101
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,208
Now then...

102
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,291
Have you found any tasty tidbits
that I might like to hear?

103
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,291
Oh, right.

104
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,375
--Well, uh... Not much.
--Too bad.

105
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,375
Looks like you won't
get to try any.

106
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,791
[SHINGO]
Aw, man.

107
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,750
Come on, brain. I need ya.

108
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,916
[gasps]

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,041
Oh yeah!

110
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,833
What the hell is this?

111
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,875
[SHINGO]
That?

112
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,333
It's, uh...
I honestly don't know.

113
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,791
I found it on the floor of
the restroom by the field.

114
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,458
[MEIKO grunts]
Don't make me touch something

115
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,250
that was on the floor of
a restroom, Jackwad!

116
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,250
[SHINGO]
I'm sorry, ma'am!

117
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,458
[MEIKO]
Now you're sure as hell

118
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,541
not going to get to
try some of my chicken!

119
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,583
[GAKUTO]
Damnation! It's gone!

120
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,000
Whither is the mighty tip of
the Green Dragon Crescent Blade?

121
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,041
The majestically
symbolic embodiment

122
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,083
of Guan Yu's unmatched
warrior spirit!

123
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,625
Where are you?

124
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,791
I should have been more careful
when gazing upon it earlier.

125
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,375
That's not how you use
a toilet, Pants-Crapper.

126
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,833
[GAKUTO]
Oh! Uh...

127
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,083
I was just picking
up my glasses.

128
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,458
You see, I dropped them, and--

129
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,666
I don't give a flying
fuck, Shit-Nuts.

130
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,375
Now back to work before
I rock your face.

131
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,916
Help yourselves.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,833
I hope you like my popcorn tea.

133
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,458
And to complement
the popcorn tea,

134
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,416
I've provided kaki
peanuts as today's snack.

135
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,916
This flavor...

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,416
Crispy rice crackers
in a spicy soy glaze...

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,041
Tsuruta brand, correct?

138
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,791
Madam President, your
discerning palate humbles me.

139
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,833
All it takes is
time and dedication.

140
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
Though money is helpful as well.

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,541
Oh! I forgot to mention it, but
I caught that "yours truly" guy

142
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,083
crawling around the restroom.

143
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,041
[MEIKO] Ugh! He was probably
just crapping his pants again.

144
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,583
If you don't mind,

145
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,083
I'd prefer you not use such
crass language during teatime.

146
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,208
[MEIKO gasps]
Forgive me, Madam President.

147
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,625
[cracking]

148
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,916
[MARI gasps]
This isn't a rice cracker.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,875
[gasps]

150
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,000
[MARI]
Do you know what it is?

151
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,250
[MEIKO]
No...

152
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,250
[MEIKO] That's the toy
Shingo said he found

153
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,791
on the floor of the restroom!

154
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,500
But I can't let her
ever know about that!

155
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,250
It looks like a falchion blade.

156
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,333
[HANA]
A falchion blade?

157
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,541
A curved sword.

158
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,333
This one is a Chinese design.

159
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,291
--It appears to be a miniature.
--[HANA] Huh?

160
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,791
Why was it mixed in with
a bag of kaki peanuts?

161
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,208
You should file a claim!

162
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,208
[MEIKO]
A Chinese sword miniature?

163
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,250
[MEIKO]
A Chinese sword.

164
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,666
Falchion blade.

165
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,625
Miniature.

166
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,833
Brown Thunder, crawling
around the restroom floor,

167
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,625
--looking for something.
--[rustling]

168
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,791
[chuckles]

169
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,000
I can go out again?

170
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,583
That's right. You even
get an extra hour.

171
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,500
[SHINGO]
I appreciate that a lot,

172
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,875
but... did I even do anything?

173
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,708
You've done a better job than
anyone would have guessed.

174
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,583
[chuckles]

175
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,708
[ANDRE, JOE laughing]

176
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,916
Where's Gakuto?

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,958
He said he didn't feel
like coming outside.

178
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,541
[JOE] He's seemed
really depressed lately,

179
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,708
don't you think?
Did something happen?

180
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,083
[ANDRE]
He won't even answer back

181
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,541
if you ask him something.

182
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,458
[GAKUTO]
Whither hast thou gone,

183
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,833
Green Dragon Crescent Blade?

184
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,375
[MARI] Hard to believe.
The toy sword I put in my mouth,

185
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,250
thinking it was simply
a rice cracker...

186
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,666
...ends up being the rope
that they'll hang from.

187
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,791
I'll let you take
it from here, Meiko.

188
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,250
At your service, Madam.

189
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,166
One thing.

190
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,916
Where on campus did you find it?

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
It was in the rest-- [gasps]

192
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,750
The rest?

193
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,125
[MEIKO] I-I mean--
It was in with the rest of

194
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,875
the prisoner's
miscellaneous items.

195
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,166
I must've dropped
it into the bowl

196
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,875
when looking over what
Shingo had brought me.

197
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,750
[MARI]
Ah, well. Accidents happen.

198
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,666
Quite the useful spy
you have there.

199
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,666
[MEIKO]
Right as always, Madam.

200
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,958
[MEIKO] I have to carry this
secret to the grave with me!

201
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:27,166
[game characters grunting]

202
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,083
[SHINGO]
Guess she's not here today.

203
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,875
[game character yells]

204
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,916
[ANZU]
Stop spacing out, Nimrod!

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,875
She's beating the
crap out of you.

206
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,416
Come on. Keep your
head in the game!

207
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,250
--[game character yells]
--[ANNOUNCER] KO!

208
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,375
Well, damn...

209
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,833
You really suck
at this, don't you?

210
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,083
[SHINGO]
She's so close!

211
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,541
And her boobs are totally
pressing into me!

212
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,583
[ANZU]
So...

213
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,083
Did you get to come out
today for another errand run?

214
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,291
[SHINGO]
Yeah.

215
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,208
I've gotta buy some
root beer after this.

216
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,833
Well, don't go to
the arcade first!

217
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,583
Moron!

218
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,791
[SHINGO]
Oh, shut up!

219
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,166
It doesn't matter either way.

220
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
Well then, let's go!

221
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,375
Huh?

222
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,500
I've got some time.

223
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,291
I'll run your errand with you!

224
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,541
[ANZU]
Here you go.

225
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,875
My treat, 'kay?

226
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,625
Uh, thanks.

227
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,958
It seems to me that the
Underground Student Council

228
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,333
must really trust you if they
let you roam around like this.

229
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,875
I am a model prisoner.

230
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,458
[ANZU] That's funny. You don't
look like a model prisoner.

231
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,541
If you ask me, you look
more like a hipster.

232
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,083
Yeah, well.
You know what?

233
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,458
The same can be said about you.

234
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,875
[giggles] I get that a lot.

235
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,916
[gasps]

236
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,416
Hey, dude, let
me have a bite.

237
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,708
Here you go. You can have some
of mine, if you want a taste.

238
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,041
Do you like lemon?

239
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,333
Oh, wow!

240
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,041
That chocolate is
really freakin' rich!

241
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,166
[SHINGO] Man, she's going to
town on that thing!

242
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,125
It's not going to get weird
if I lick the ice cream

243
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,583
she was licking, right?

244
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,708
[SHINGO] She's not gonna be
like, "Eww!" or anything--

245
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,166
[ANZU] I almost forgot!

246
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,458
I have a couple of
free movie tickets.

247
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,416
[SHINGO]
Wait, "The Grapes of Wrath"?

248
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,708
Sounds kinda freaky.

249
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,125
What, do giant mutant
grapes go on a rampage

250
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,208
in a small Midwest town?

251
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,541
[ANZU]
Ah, like a B-grade horror flick?

252
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,208
That sounds cool.

253
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,958
I got 'em for free; I don't
really know what it's about.

254
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,958
So... Wanna go watch it now?

255
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,958
I'd really like to,
but I can't today.

256
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,375
[ANZU] Man... You're
making things difficult.

257
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,500
Sorry.

258
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,375
I wish I could though, for real.

259
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,583
[ANZU growls]

260
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,208
[ANZU]
Here, hold this for a second.

261
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,666
Oh, sure.

262
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,333
[ANZU]
You're a model prisoner, right?

263
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,916
Then you should get out again.

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,291
These movie tickets are
good through next week.

265
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,375
Yeah, but I don't know
when I'll get out again.

266
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,416
[ANZU] When the time comes
and you know you'll be let out,

267
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
put this hairband on the prison
fence during your lunch break.

268
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,333
Then we'll meet up at the
arcade.

269
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,458
Don't lose it,
Mister Model Prisoner.

270
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,083
All right.

271
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,291
You'll now take a
five minute break!

272
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,125
But first, line up!

273
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,958
Since you've all been doing
such good work recently,

274
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,333
the President has
a reward for you.

275
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,541
Be grateful.

276
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,083
Next! Hold out your hand.

277
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,500
[gasps] Just one piece?

278
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,833
You got a problem with that?

279
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,291
[KIYOSHI]
No! Thank you very much.

280
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,333
[MEIKO]
You get one too, Scat-Stain.

281
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,083
Much obliged, milady.

282
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,125
[gasps]

283
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,250
Oh, my mistake.

284
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,750
It's supposed to go with this!

285
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,041
Isn't that right,
Chocolate Trousers?

286
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,166
[GAKUTO] I've never seen
that before in my life.

287
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,041
[MEIKO] You mean you
don't recognize him?

288
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,166
I thought you were a
big fan of Guan Yu,

289
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,583
hero of the Three Kingdoms.

290
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,500
Ha, ha! Indeed, yours
truly is a fan of Guan Yu,

291
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,291
but I think figurines are dumb.

292
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,083
[MEIKO]
You don't say.

293
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,208
Kiyoshi, does this
belong to you?

294
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,208
[KIYOSHI]
No, ma'am. It doesn't.

295
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,625
I see, So neither of you
know where this came from?

296
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,125
Seems to be the logical answer.

297
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,250
[MEIKO]
I refuse to believe that!

298
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,958
I did the research,
Knuckle-Knob,

299
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,875
and this figurine is
a limited edition,

300
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,208
which could only
have been acquired

301
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,416
in Akiba on Saturday,
May the 7th,

302
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,458
the day Kiyoshi broke out!

303
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,125
Which means you had Kiyoshi
get this figurine for you

304
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,875
in exchange for
providing assistance

305
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,250
--with his escape, right?
--[ANDRE] If Gakuto helped

306
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,958
Kiyoshi escape, that's
bad for all of us.

307
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,208
[MEIKO]
You helped him out because

308
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,750
you needed to add Guan
Yu to your collection.

309
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,250
I'll make a deal with you.

310
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,291
just admit that you were
hiding this figurine

311
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,291
in the field restroom,
and you can have it back.

312
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,708
[GAKUTO gasps]

313
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,291
[KIYOSHI]
Hang in there, Gakuto!

314
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,166
If you admit that it belongs to
you, then you're also admitting

315
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,083
that you helped me out
with the prison break!

316
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,333
If that happens,

317
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,416
everybody's sentences
will be extended again!

318
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,666
Come to think of it,

319
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,208
Guan Yu also came with
a lovely horse figurine.

320
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,708
Let's see.

321
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,541
I loved horses growing up.
Think I'll go for a little ride.

322
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,750
[BOTH gasp]

323
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,583
[MEIKO]
My, what a comfortable saddle.

324
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,666
Giddy-up. Giddy-up.

325
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,000
[KIYOSHI]
Damn you!

326
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,875
Don't you know what
Gakuto had to go through

327
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,625
--to get that?
--[MEIKO] Giddy-up. Giddy-up!

00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,666
[KIYOSHI] He sacrificed
his adolescence.

329
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,583
It's a quadrennial
limited edition!

330
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,333
Add in another three years
of high school bullying,

331
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,250
that's seven years of his
life tied up in that model!

332
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,500
--And now...
--[MEIKO] What's wrong?

333
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,125
You're sweating like
a whore in church.

334
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,625
I know! I'll ride
double with Guan Yu!

335
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,875
[ALL]
Double?!

336
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,916
[MEIKO sighs]

337
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,375
--[MEIKO] Whoa! Whoa!
--[KIYOSHI] If she keeps

338
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,500
doing that, his Guan

339
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,166
[GAKUTO gasps]

[GROUP laughs]

341
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,291
Now, my friend! We drink!

342
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,916
Indeed!

343
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,791
[LIU BEI] Let us as
brothers swear to aid those

344
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,333
who are in distress!

345

[ZHANG FEI] While we may not
have been born on the same day,

we shall die on the same day!

[GAKUTO]
All for one, and one for all!

[MEIKO]
Hyah! Hyah! Giddy-up!

350
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,541
--Thatta boy. Giddy-up!
--[KIYOSHI] Gakuto! Do it!

Hyah, hyah!

00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,000
[KIYOSHI]
If you don't do it, I will!

354
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:53,500
[GAKUTO yells]

355
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,708
[KIYOSHI]
Don't worry, Gakuto.

356
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,625
I understand.

357
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,291
Is he guilty? I'm confused.

358
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,500
[coughs]

[MEIKO]
Madam President.

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,375
As you can see, his
desire to save the figure

361
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,250
is proof of his complicity.

362
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,625
So it would seem.

363
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,833
[MEIKO]
Which as you know,

364
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,125
only serves to compound
their prior crime--

As you were told before...

369
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,000
Yours truly has no interest
at all in such silly toys.

370
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,875
Our break time has
now come to an end.

371
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,750
If you'll excuse me, I'd
like to head back to work.

372
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,875
I'll take a cracker,
as I was promised.

373
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,958
[KIYOSHI]
You didn't have to.

374
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,916
[GAKUTO]
It was for the best, my friend.

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,916
[KIYOSHI]
How? You blew any chance of

376
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,625
getting laid before
college on that figure!

377
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,166
[GAKUTO]
I had two choices:

378
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,375
sell out my friends,
or lose a hunk of plastic.

379
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,416
Either way, I'd never be
able to face Lord Guan Yu.

380
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,916
I should have acted sooner.

381
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,333
Seven years is but a pittance

382
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,166
compared to an entire
life cast into the sewer.

383
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,708
That's heavy, man.

384
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,083
Oh, Sir Kiyoshi. I'm sorry
for everything I've done,

385
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,333
and for what I didn't do

386
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,000
when you alone had to
endure their bullying.

387
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,916
I shall never again conduct
myself in such a base manner,

388
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,083
on my honor!

anything to apologize for.

We're homeboys, man.

Thank you, Milord.

Looks like your plan

396
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,166
to connect Four-Eyes to
the crime has backfired.

397
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,958
This is becoming frustrating.

I am so mortified, ma'am.

to take things that far.

Sorry, I'm late. Just got back.

the little toy sword

that I found in the restroom.

Where did you find it?

409

This?

410
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,208
I grabbed it from the
floor by the toilet,

411
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,333
and handed it off to
Madam Vice President.

It's fine, Meiko.

You can get off the ground now.

Please punish me in
any manner you see fit!

Yes. And we'd come
so close, too.

we missed something.

Some form of punitive
measure must be taken!

Here, use this leather crop and
spank me, please! I beg you!

[gasps] How kind of you to say.

439
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,083
[MARI]
What did you use to make it?

440
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:01,125
Well, um... A little lemongrass
and some hibiscus buds.

I think I'll have
another cup, please.

Okay.

443
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,375
So, uh...

444
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,875
Tell me, does DTO have a Plan B?

--[MEIKO whimpering]
--[MARI] Yes.

From here on, I will
personally assume command.

00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,416
My friends!

448
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,666
I apologize earnestly for
the trouble I've caused.

449
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,500
Madam Vice President
was correct.

450
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,958
I aided Kiyoshi's escape for the
sake of that Guan Yu figurine.

451
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,166
Nay, in truth, it is fair to say

452
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,208
I was ringleader
of the operation!

453
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,875
I am eternally sorry for having
held my tongue for so long!

454
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,375
Knew it all along.

455
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,583
No way in hell Kiyoshi could've
pulled it off on his own.

456
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,708
So, what do we do about
our double-crossing geek

457
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,750
with a loose turd-cutter?

458
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,708
[JOE] I'm not gonna
do much of anything.

459
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,291
Sure, Gakuto may have
assisted with the breakout,

460
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,416
but the Underground Student
Council doesn't know.

461
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,333
[SHINGO] You're missing
the point, Lame-Brain!

462
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,375
Gakuto betrayed all of us!

463
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,916
I went crazy during
the anting incident.

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,625
If Kiyoshi hadn't jumped
in at the last second,

465
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,958
I would have made things
a lot worse for everybody.

466
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,375
I'm the last person to
start the blame game.

467
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,708
Joe...! [sobs]

468
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,083
[SHINGO growls]

469
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,708
Andre, what about you?
Aren't you pissed off, bro?

470
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,833
I choose to forgive
Gakuto as well.

471
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,041
Are you shitting me?!

472
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,333
What's wrong with you?!

473
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,750
Not a thing.

474
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,791
Gakuto went so far as to
destroy his precious figurine,

475
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,625
and he did it to keep the rest
of us out of more trouble.

I say, he's suffered enough.

While we were out there
busting our asses.

He was staring at his
dolly in the john,

Shingo and the Vice

together the last few days.

it was from her.

if the President punished me,

I would be deserving
of forgiveness?
