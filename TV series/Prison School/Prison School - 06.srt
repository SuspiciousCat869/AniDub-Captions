00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,041
[MARI] It's good to
have you back, Hana.

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,458
I hope you're ready for work.

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,333
A lot has happened
during your time away.

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:14,708
Yes.

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,583
Madam Vice-President filled
me in on the highlights.

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,583
Then allow me to cut
straight to the point.

7
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,333
This latest prisoner escapade
has only served to reinforce

8
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,541
my utter distaste
for the Y chromosome.

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,583
That's why we're removing the
boys from the equation entirely.

10
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,000
[HANA gasps]
But how?

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,083
[MEIKO] According to the
Underground Student bylaws,

12
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,416
a third escape attempt
will result in expulsion.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,166
Oh yeah!

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,375
But there's a catch.

15
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,208
Even those Cro-Magnons
aren't stupid enough

16
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,541
to try three times.

17
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,583
[HANA] Which means it'll
have to be some other way?

18
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,333
We simply have to
put the true nature

19
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,041
of the boys on full display.

20
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,291
Then the school will
see their danger.

21
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,666
First we prod the degenerates

22
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,125
into creating problems
this school's never seen

23
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,333
which should turn public
opinion against them.

24
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,583
Of course!

25
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,250
And after we've turned
every girl in school

26
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,958
against those dick-billed
platy-pussies,

27
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,708
the chairman himself
won't even be able

28
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,958
to save their punk asses.

29
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,500
[MARI]
Yes.

30
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,000
The Destroy Testicles Operation,
codenamed... Operation DTO.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,416
[MEIKO whimpers] She's made
the same mistake as earlier

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,041
by saying "Operation"
before the DTO acronym.

33
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,083
Should I risk saying
something to her?

34
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,750
No, don't be rash.

35
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,000
Last time, she recognized
her faux pas in an instant

36
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,166
and corrected it.

37
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,416
Before I can get a word in,

38
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,750
she will have revised
her statement, surely.

39
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,833
Or not!

40
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,416
What do I do?

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,250
Hey, wait. Saying it that way
makes the O in DTO redundant!

42
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,041
[MEIKO chokes]

43
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,750
Well-spotted, Hana.

44
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,500
Since you've been absent and
unable to perform your duties,

45
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,583
it was a test to see if
your skills had dulled.

46
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,500
[MEIKO] Sorry to have
doubted you, Madam President!

47
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,208
I had never considered
such a feint,

48
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,333
and you pulled it off with
such professionalism!

49
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,666
I don't know if this will help,

50
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,625
but I saw Kiyoshi cleaning
the bathroom on his own,

51
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,666
which makes me think the
other boys are shunning him.

52
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,708
You're right. I have
noticed it, as well.

53
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,416
Inevitably, his escape has
caused a division among them.

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,458
Also they've been
excluding Kiyoshi,

55
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,250
and it looks like Shingo
is the ringleader.

56
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,500
How fortunate.

57
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,583
I think we can use that
info to our advantage.

You're still upset
that your sentence

73

was extended because of Kiyoshi?

Right.

well-marbled Kobe?

162
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,833
Just a sec.

163
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,208
What else...?

164
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,250
I've got something!
Joe went absolutely ballistic

165
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,125
when his ant farm thingy
got knocked over!

166
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,333
He threatened Andre!

167
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,291
He went wild!
It was really intense!

168
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,541
My, that's interesting.

169
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,375

[SHINGO]
Are you all right?

171
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,750
Maybe you should wear
a bib or something.

172
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,416
I'm fine, thanks.

173
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,166
Enjoy!

174
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,125
I can have some?

175
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,333
Help yourself.

176
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,833
[SHINGO]
Much appreciated!

177
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,750
[MEIKO laughs] A quick splashing
is enough for shabu-shabu.

178
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,875
You're going to burn it if-- Ah!

179
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,958
[MEIKO]
Your calligraphy on these

181
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,833
[MARI] An under-appreciated
part of the job.

182
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,833
Thank you.

183
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,833
Have you made progress with DTO?

184
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,375
Yes. Just as you planned,

185
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,250
Shingo has made for quite
the valuable informant.

186
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,500
While you're cracking down on
the rest of those ass-clowns,

187
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,000
to really push their stress
levels through the roof.

188
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,375
Except for that tubbo Andre,

189
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,875
who's going crazy not
getting his nuts stepped on.

190
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,791
And it seems that
Joe is responsible for

191
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,166
creating inner turmoil,
which all stems from

192
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,500
his intense obsession with ants.

193
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,250
Is that a fact now?

194
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,416
Then it seems we must
be on the right path.

195
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,041
They're more likely to forget
rules when they're upset.

196
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,166
[MEIKO] Shall I confiscate Joe's
ant farm, Madam President?

197
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,166
[MARI]
No.

198
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,875
We'll ramp up the pressure.

199
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,333
Make them crack.

200
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,416
Hey, Joe?

201
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,791
Sorry for yesterday.

202
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,166
Hope I didn't ruin your
ants' home or something.

203
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,208
It's cool.

204
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,208
I feel bad for going
nuclear on you.

205
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,750
[ANDRE]
Here. Take this.

206
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,500
You can give it to
the ants, from me.

207
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,833
My ants aren't
really into curry.

208
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,375
But thanks, I appreciate
the sentiment.

Hey gang, who's up for a
game of tag outside? Huh?

Count me in!

Come and join us, dude!

You don't know what
you're missing!

In a minute.

221
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,541
I've started taking the ants
for walks on Wednesdays.

222
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,000
Give 'em some fresh air.

223
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,291
[KIYOSHI] I'm just trying
to act natural around them,

224
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,416
but they keep ignoring me.

225
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,083
Huh?

226
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,541
There aren't usually that many
crows out at this time of day.

the fence and stall him.

[SHINGO]
Sure, can do. But why?

231
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,875
[MEIKO] You just do as
you're told, Kenickie.

232
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:34,041
[JOE] Aww, Logan and Jean are
going for a stroll together.

233
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,541
Better hope that Scott doesn't
see you, or he's gonna flip.

Well, wait!

Free-range time isn't over yet.

238

Something feels off here.

00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,333
The three of them aren't usually
in the yard during our break.

00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,041
So... about this
morning's math class,

00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,708
what's with the formula
for the function?

I don't get it, man.

[JOE]
Formula? What the hell?

246
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,708
Why're you asking me that crap?

247

'Cause I thought you were
good at math, Broseph!

Unbelievable.

To potentially injure a lady

277

over something as
trivial as ants.

you're resorting to violence?

00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,125
But in addition to knocking
over the Vice President,

321
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,958
Joe clearly charged at me
with intent to do harm.

322
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,000
That fact is indisputable.

323
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,458
Vice President...

324
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,916
Please escort him to
solitary immediately.

325
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,833
Right.

326
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,166
President?

327
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,250
I volunteer to take Kiyoshi
to go see the nurse.

328
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,375
No need!
Gakuto can just take me.

329
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,666
Or I could easily
waddle there myself!

330
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,208
We can't allow a prisoner to
walk around unaccompanied.

331
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,208
That's correct. Please proceed.

332
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,291
[HANA]
Okay!

333
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,708
Come on, let's get moving.

334
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,791
Great.

335
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,000
[KIYOSHI]
As if the stick in my butt

336
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,375
wasn't enough of
a pain in the ass.

337
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,750
[JOE grunts, groans]

338
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,166
Joe, I hope you realize
I have to report

339
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,166
your little outburst
to the faculty.

340
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,000
[JOE] Maybe you should
report yourself to them,

341
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,750
while you're at it.

342
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,166
This never would've happened,

343
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,041
if you'd just kept your bastard
crow away from my ants!

344
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,333
I want them back you ant-killer!

345
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,583
Ant-killer?
You must be mistaken.

346
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,875
Have we gathered them?

347
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,791
Yes.

348
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,666
Hey, Andre! Bring the ants in!

349
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,875
Check it out!

350
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,708
We got all of your ants
back into the farm!

351
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,666
[JOE gasps]

352
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,416
The Professor? Logan? Jubilee?

353
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,541
They're all here... But how?

354
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,333
[MARI]
She was only anting.

355
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,666
Anting?

356
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,666
[MARI] A trait where birds
literally bathe in ants.

357
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,708
Crows will rub ants
across their bodies,

358
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,291
coating themselves in the
formic acid they secrete.

359
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,291
It helps protect them from
several pests and certain fungi.

360
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,291
For somebody who says
they love ants so much,

361
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,541
I'm surprised you
didn't know that.

362
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,416
Though it looks aggressive
from the outside,

363
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,208
my crows know better than
to alter this relationship.

364
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,041
And you called
her an ant-killer?

365
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,500
How utterly rude!

366
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,625
I didn't know.

367
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,375
You caused quite a
bit of commotion

368
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,166
over what should have been
a simple misunderstanding.

369
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,750
Stay in here and think
about what you've done.

370
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,958
My fault.

371
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,875
My misunderstanding.

372
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,125
[HANA]
I wonder where the nurse went.

373
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,375
[KIYOSHI]
I can go and have her paged.

374
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,958
[HANA]
No need for that.

375
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,333
We'll just disinfect it, apply
some ointment and you'll be set.

376
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,625
I'd rather call her.

377
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,875
Did you not hear me
say there's no need?

378
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:45,875
Fine.

All alone with Hana?

There's no telling what
she's gonna try to do.

there's one thing we can do.

Come on.

It's time for you
to take a leak.

In the clinic?

398
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,166
That's right, which is why
I grabbed this doohickey.

Now make it quick,
before the nurse gets back!

And I'll commemorate
it with a photo.

Why don't you loosen up a bit?

00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,208
We're just too close!

479
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,291
Maybe the nurse had already
finished treating him.

480
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,416
That's gotta mean that he
wasn't wounded too badly.

481
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,958
Oh, well. I'll see him later.

482
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,083
[KIYOSHI gasps]
I'm super freaking sorry!

483
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,166
I didn't mean to do it!
I couldn't turn it off!

484
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,541
It has a mind of its own!

485
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,708
[phone rings]

486
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,125
[CHAIRMAN] Yes, when the
phone rings, one answers it.

487
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,208
Excuse me.

488
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,708
[CHAIRMAN]
Hello? No.

489
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,416
I told you, you don't have to
plant sponge gourds this year!

490
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,250
And don't call me at work
for something like that! Bye!

491
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,416
I don't know why the
HOA is so obsessed with

492
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,833
growing their own loofahs--

493
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,083
[gasps]

494
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,791
Now don't get the wrong idea.

495
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,250
It's an orthopedic mouse pad.

496
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,500
--Honest!
--I am sure it is.

497
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,375
Not any of my business, anyway.

498
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,083
[CHAIRMAN] My wrist has
been acting up lately,

499
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,416
and... this gives the
right amount of support.

500
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,250
[MARI]
Pardon me.

501
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,625
[MARI] We need to shift the
Destroy Testicles Operation

502
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,958
into high gear.

503
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,666
The time has come to
intensify our plans.

504
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,333
[SHINGO]
What the hell was that about?!

505
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,666
You're being too loud.

506
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,541
Lower your voice, Ponyboy.

507
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,125
[SHINGO] I called Joe
away like you asked me to,

508
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,500
but I didn't know you were
gonna screw with his ants.

509
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,291
It's like you made me
set Joe up for a fall!

510
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,125
[scoffs]

511
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,500
Is that all?

512
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,958
Are you kidding me?

513
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,791
If that's the kind of
work you want me to do,

514
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,333
then I'm not gonna--

515
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,250
[MEIKO]
Not gonna what?

516
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,875
Go on. You won't do
what I tell you anymore?

517
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,083
You don't seem to realize
the position that you're in.

518
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,041
Fine! If you won't do as I say,

519
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,875
I can inform your
prisoner buddies that

520
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,750
you've been spying on them
for special treatment.

521
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,291
[SHINGO]
No...

522
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,958
What will they think when they
find out all the fancy foods

523
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,750
their good pal Shingo
has been pigging out on?

524
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,375
--Not to mention--
--[SHINGO groans]

525
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,791
When they learn how
trustworthy you are.

526
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,541
Just keep going the
way you've been going,

527
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,375
and things will work out fine.

528
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,875
Do we have an understanding,
you miserable sack of shit?

529
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,916
Yeah.

530
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,166
Get your ass back
to work now, Maggot!

531
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,083
And if you pull any more
crap like yesterday,

532
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:20,916
you're out of here for good!

533
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,708
Poor Joe! Are you okay, man?

534
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,208
You look so thin!

535
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,000
So, were they starving
you down in solitary?

536
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,375
Nah, I got three squares a day.

537
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,333
[coughs] I even got dessert.

538
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,208
[KIYOSHI] Joe looks like
he's gonna be all right.

539
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,375
Hey, Numb-Nuts!

540
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,208
What are you staring
off into space for?

541
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,541
Get back to work, Prick.

542
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,541
Right! My bad.

543
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,833
[KIYOSHI] Aww man, she's
giving me the stink eye.

544
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,041
She must be pissed about
what went down at the clinic.

545
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,791
[HANA]
I remember everything up until

546
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,666
Kiyoshi and I hid under the bed.

547
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,166
I've got the sneaking suspicion

548
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,166
something truly horrifying
happened... But what?

549
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,250
[MEIKO] Okay, five minute
break, Butt-Sniffers!

550
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,250
Kiyoshi, get up and
bring me that kettle.

551
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,666
[KIYOSHI]
Huh?

552
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,125
I said bring it.

553
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,416
[KIYOSHI]
Here we go again.

554
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,083
[JOE]
Get it yourself.

555
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,250
Hey, bro, what the hell's
the matter with you?

556
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,291
--He screwed all of us over!
--I think you've been acting

557
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,416
like a spoiled brat
for long enough.

558
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,333
Shut your piehole.

559
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,416
[SHINGO grunts]

560
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,291
[SHINGO grunts]

00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,083
[BOTH]
Uh...

562
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:25,916
[MEIKO]
Break's over!

563
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,541
Back to work, now!

564
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,250
[SHINGO]
Tch.

565
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,333
[MEIKO]
Hey, Shingo.

566
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,625
--[SHINGO gasps]
--[MEIKO] Come with me.

567
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,541
I have a different
job in store for you.

568
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,041
Yes, ma'am.

569
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,958
[JOE]
Want some?

570
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,708
Sure, thanks.

571
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,416
You saved me.

572
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,875
Yesterday, if you hadn't
stopped me by jumping in front.

573
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,416
They'd be taking me
to a real prison today.

574
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,708
Thanks.

575
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,291
Yeah. It's no big deal, man.

576
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,958
My body just did
that on its own.

577
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,583
Don't try playing the cool hero,

578
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,708
after you got a stick
jammed up your ass.

579
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,750
[KIYOSHI]
Dude, you're the one

580
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,166
who jammed it in
there, Turd-Breath.

581
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,250
[JOE laughs]

582
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,333
--You're right. Sorry.
--[BOTH laugh]

583
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,875
You know, the worst part is that

584
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,500
none of this should've
ever happened.

585
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,666
I guess I have a lot
to learn about ants.

586
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,875
[KIYOSHI]
Maybe not.

587
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,125
Huh?

588
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,833
But... How do I put it?

589
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,541
Something about
that lunch break.

590
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,000
I could sense the
weirdness in the air.

591
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,875
The whole Underground Student
Council was sitting in the yard.

592
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,041
And they're never
there together.

593
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,208
One other thing.

594
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,333
[JOE]
What's that?

595
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,291
I couldn't clearly make out

596
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,791
what they were
saying to each other,

597
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,958
but I definitely
think I got the gist.

598
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,833
[SHINGO]
Wait...

599
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,666
This is my normal uniform.

600
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,875
For the next two hours,

601
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,000
you have my permission
to leave the campus.

602
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,250
[SHINGO gasps]

603
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,958
So why don't you put on
that uniform, head out,

604
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,791
and have yourself some fun?

605
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,375
I can leave the school?

606
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,166
[MEIKO]
Didn't I just say you could?

607
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,500
Besides, why would I lie to you?

608
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,041
