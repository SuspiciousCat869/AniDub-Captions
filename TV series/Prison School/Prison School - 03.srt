1
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,583
[KIYOSHI] Because of the golden
shower incident the other day,

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,958
Hana has been relieved
from overseer duties.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,333
And the Vice President
only checks

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,333
the trash area occasionally.

5
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,458
And now... Today, at last...

6
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,166
You don't start off
with your right hand,

7
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,666
--you use your left.
--[GAKUTO] Listen closely.

8
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,625
You'll go through the hole
today, and scout the other side.

9
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,291
[KIYOSHI]
Sort of a practice run, huh?

10
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,708
[GAKUTO] Endeavor to engage
in the foray for one hour.

11
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,583
A whole hour?

12
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,166
You'll have gone for three hours

13
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,333
on the day of the
actual excursion.

14
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,833
[KIYOSHI]
Good point.

15
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,416
When you put it that way, it
doesn't really sound so bad.

16
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,958
One thing...

17
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,791
Just make sure to be back here
by the time the bell rings.

18
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,041
Understood.

19
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,083
[CHAIRMAN]
I have failed Mari as a father.

20
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,708
To have allowed her
to find my collection

21
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,958
of beautiful Latina booties,
not once, but twice?

22
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,541
Hm...

23
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,000
It is my responsibility,

24
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,791
as both an educator and a
father, to seal these away.

25
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,958
Damn it.

26
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,416
[KIYOSHI] Guess I should
check my escape route.

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,291
--Train? It's over there.
--[MAN 3A] Come on.

28
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,666
[GIRL 3A]
What? Like right now?

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,041
[KIYOSHI] Stupid happy couple!
Just you watch!

30
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,625
I'll make some moves on Chiyo.

31
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,333
And if I play my cards right,
I might even get to second base!

32
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,791
The Chairman?

33
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,083
Where is the other one?

34
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,500
Uh-- Sir Kiyoshi's dropping
of debris in the back.

35
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,625
Shall I summon him
for you, Madam?

36
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,500
[MEIKO] There's no need.
Get back to work.

37
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,083
[GAKUTO]
That was significantly easier

38
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,083
than I thought it would be.

39
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,208
Isabel, summer of 1986, Brazil.

40
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,375
Such a fine behind.

41
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,916
Never forget.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,083
[smooch]

43
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,875
Evita...

44
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,000
[KIYOSHI] What the hell is this
old dickhead doing anyway?

45
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,791
And how long is
he going to take?

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,000
Speed it up, Grandpa!

47
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,541
--[bell chimes]
--[KIYOSHI] Oh shit!

48
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,875
The bell!

49
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,000
[MEIKO]
Where is Kiyoshi?

50
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,166
Still working in the back?

51
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,416
Very astute.

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,791
Kiyoshi! Front and center, now!

53
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,458
[GAKUTO]
Kiyoshi! What are you doing?!

54
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,625
Show yourself!

55
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,708
Allow me to go and
fetch him, Milady.

56
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,375
No... I'll go.

57
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,916
[GAKUTO] Kiyoshi! You
must return post-haste!

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,791
[CHAIRMAN] I'll miss you,
my beautiful brown buncakes.

59
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,208
[KIYOSHI]
He's finally leaving!

60
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,875
[pants]

61
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,791
[grunts]

62
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:02,833
[sighs]

63
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,041
[gasps]

64
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,125
[KIYOSHI]
What the f--?!

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,708
I slipped right
through here earlier!

66
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,125
[GAKUTO]
Quickly!

67
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,666
[KIYOSHI grunting] It's no use!
I guess it's all over...

68
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,916
[MEIKO grunts]

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,208
[GAKUTO] Madam Vice President!
Are you unhurt?

70
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,666
[MEIKO grunts]

71
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,791
Kiyoshi! If you're
there, answer me!

72
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,125
I'm sorry, ma'am.

73
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,458
[MEIKO]
And you, straighten this mess!

74
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,875
Unbelievable!

75
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,250
What the blazes took
you so long to get back?

76
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,416
I can't even begin
to explain it.

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,041
I just used up the
ploy I was saving

78
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,250
for the actual day
of your bold egress.

79
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,333
You mean, that was you?

80
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,708
I shall have to concoct another

81
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,458
subtle yet brilliant
contrivance.

82
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,958
There's one more thing.

83
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,000
We've gotta work on
making that hole larger.

84
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,125
I only got in halfway last time.

85
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,666
[SHINGO sighs]

86
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,250
Is it too much to ask for
something other than news?

87
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,416
[GAKUTO] We must quickly devise
some way to keep the overseers

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,625
distracted for three hours
during the breakout...

89
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,000
As for the hole,

90
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,708
one more day of solid
hammering should handle it.

91
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,750
--[SHINGO] Yo!
--[BOTH gasp]

92
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,000
What're you guys talkin' 'bout?

93
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,583
Oh... This and that.

94
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,125
[SHINGO] You two seem to
have gotten closer recently.

95
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,500
Comrades in bondage.

96
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,916
Well, we are working
together a lot lately.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,125
Right...

98
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,875
[MEIKO] I've come to collect
the purchase request forms

99
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,000
that were handed out
to you the other day.

100
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,000
Tank tops and... booty shorts?
I flock to your siren's call!

101
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,458
I'm dressed for bed!

102
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,875
Now, submit your forms!

103
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,375
Kiyoshi wants a dictionary.
Not happening.

104
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,000
For Andre, disappearing ink.
Denied.

105
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,208
For Shingo, hair gel. Denied.

106
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,416
For Joe, an ant farm. Maybe.

107
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,375
And a pocket audio player
for Gakuto. Denied.

108
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,000
But I need it for my
foreign language practice!

109
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,875
[MEIKO]
Do you? Then we'll consider it.

110
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,375
Madam, I am in your debt.

111
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,541
[MEIKO]
Attention!

112
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,708
I'm posting next
month's schedule.

113
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,208
[BOYS gasp, sigh]

114
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,333
I was starting to get used
to the random panty flashes

115
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,666
and those bazookas hangin'
out of her school uniform.

116
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,375
But this new look
reminds me how hot she is.

117
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,000
[ANDRE]
It's like covering everything up

118
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,500
makes it more naughty.

119
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,416
[GAKUTO] And I, myself, am a
total sucker for hot pants!

120
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,583
[JOE coughing]
I wanna eat sushi off that ass.

121
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,500
[MEIKO] All right, you
boys give it a look over.

122
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,416
Umm... Excuse me?

123
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,750
Yes, what?

124
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,458
Won't next Saturday's work
be the same as always?

125
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,000
It's what's written down.

126
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,916
That's the day the track club's
regional meet is being held.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,250
Your usual work assignments

128
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,166
will change to providing
aid for the event.

129
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,291
I've a query, Madam.

130
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,125
[MEIKO]
Which is?

131
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,458
Could you describe in detail

132
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,833
the exact nature of this
work and where it will be?

133
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,125
Three of you were assigned
to purse watching detail,

134
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,875
and the rest miscellaneous.

135
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,291
Gakuto, Shingo, and
Kiyoshi are on purses,

136
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,750
while Joe and Andre will
fill in where needed.

137
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,666
[GAKUTO]
Hm...

138
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,041
[KIYOSHI]
Three of us, huh?

139
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,250
Check it out.

140
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,916
Our purse watching gig's gonna
be in front of that restroom.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,083
[GAKUTO]
Hm...

142
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,791
The distance from here
to the refuse area

143
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,291
presents a whole new problem.

144
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,041
How do we get you to the
hole in the wall unseen?

145
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,208
And that's not all.

146
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,875
Hey, I'm looking
forward to Saturday.

147
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,458
They'll sing songs
about our ding dongs.

148
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,041
[BOTH chuckle nervously]

149
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,875
[GAKUTO]
What's to be done about Shingo?

150
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,500
[KIYOSHI] With him lurking
around on Saturday,

151
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,000
I won't be able
to leave our post.

152
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,583
[GAKUTO]
Do you think it's possible

153
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,708
that Shingo might have become
cognizant of our escape ploy?

154
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,625
I think he knows
we're up to something.

155
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,750
At this point, we may have
to bring him in on our plan.

156
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,000
[SHINGO]
Saturday'll be nice.

157
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,375
I've barely gotten to
hang out with Kiyoshi

158
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,333
since all this work started.

159
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,583
[KIYOSHI]
Squeeze in another?

160
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,666
I don't think we can.

161
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,708
Of course we can.

162
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,750
He'll go for it.

163
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,958
It's Shingo.

164
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,166
There's no way he's as
tight-assed as that!

165
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,666
[SHINGO] They're talking
about squeezing things in!

166
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,750
And tight asses!

167
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,333
An issue--

168
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,875
What incentive can we give Sir
Shingo to gain his assistance?

169
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,166
His request for hair
gel was denied.

170
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,000
I bet a little grease
is all it would take.

171
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,291
[SHINGO]
It couldn't be!

172
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,875
[GAKUTO] I honestly doubt
he would go for it.

173
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,333
[SHINGO] What are they
planning to squeeze in

174
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,583
and why would it need
to be greased up?!

175
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,958
[SHINGO] That conversation
today was insane.

176
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,041
I'd heard that kind of
thing happened in prison,

177
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,708
but maybe I misunderstood.

178
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,125
I've known Kiyoshi since
we were in middle school.

179
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,708
He's not like that.

180
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,875
So, what the hell do
we do about Shingo?

181
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:47,833
[GAKUTO]
Hmm...

182
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,875
[gasps]

183
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,500
How clumsy of me.

184
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,666
I'm gonna to slip right by.

185
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,750
[KIYOSHI]
Do your thing.

186
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,041
[SHINGO]
"Do your thing"?!

187
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,750
Is Gakuto really
that good at it?!

188
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,333
[GAKUTO groans]

189
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,041
Faceplant! You okay?

190
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,708
[SHINGO]
No. I can't believe it!

191
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,166
I must be seeing things!

192
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,708
Stop over thinking, Shingo.
There's no way.

193
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,291
[GAKUTO grunting]
No... It's rather painful.

194
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,125
[SHINGO screams]

195
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,291
[KIYOSHI, GAKUTO gasp]

196
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,208
[KIYOSHI]
Shingo! Did he hear us?

197
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,500
[GAKUTO] Does he know
what we're planning?

198
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,125
[SHINGO]
Oh shit, they're hardcore!

199
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,375
And they've totally got
their eyes on me, now!

200
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,083
Oh! Sir Shingo!

201
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,666
Join us and come in here.

202
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,041
Don't just stand there,
the water's fine!

203
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,083
Plus, it's good for your skin!

204
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,083
[GAKUTO] Yours truly will gladly
wash your back for you.

205
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:31,916
Know what?

206
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,125
I'm actually good.

207
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,708
[KIYOSHI] You know you
want to. Come on in!

208
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,166
Remember, Shingo, you're the one
who said you looked forward to

209
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,875
the three of us hanging
out and having a blast--

210
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,625
[SHINGO] This isn't the kinda
blast I was talking about!

211
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,833
In fact, I've changed my mind.
I'm out! Sorry, guys!

212
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,833
--[KIYOSHI] Hold up, Shingo!
--[GAKUTO] Sir Shingo!

[MEIKO panting]

214
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,208
Excuse me!

215
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,541
--[BOTH gasp]
--[MEIKO] What?

216
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,333
It's about Saturday's
work assignments.

217
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,083
Miscellaneous duties should
be busier than purse watching.

218
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,458
Allow me to volunteer
to help with that!

219
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,083
[MEIKO]
Very well. Granted.

220
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,208
[SHINGO]
Thank you so much!

221
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,791
What came over Shingo?

222
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,000
Odd.

223
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,208
Well, whatever changed
his mind, I'm glad.

224
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,708
[GAKUTO]
The quandary remains.

225
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,416
How does one reach the hole
in the wall from this post?

226
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,666
[KIYOSHI] How do I move unseen
from the side of this restroom

227
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,250
over to the collapsed shed?

228
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,041
I can't just cut across the
grounds, out in the open.

229
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,666
[KIYOSHI grunting]

230
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,875
[KIYOSHI]
What's this?

231
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,541
[GAKUTO]
That's odd.

232
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,541
Am I imagining things?

233
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,125
I thought I heard
Kiyoshi's voice.

234
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,916
He's been in the
lavatory a long time.

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,958
Hope he's not ill.

236
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,375
--[KIYOSHI] Gakuto.
--[GAKUTO gasps]

237

[KIYOSHI]
Down here.

238
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,333
Hey-oh!

239
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
[GAKUTO]
Sir Kiyoshi!

240
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,708
[KIYOSHI]
Keep your voice down, 3PO!

241
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,541
[GAKUTO]
My apologies.

242
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,000
[KIYOSHI]
It's on, now.

243
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,875
This is how I'll get here
from the purse-watching post

244
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,666
without being seen.

245
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,958
Couldn't be more perfect.

246
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,375
[KIYOSHI] The drainage
channel is covered.

247
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,208
And it runs all around
the school grounds.

248
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,208
It's also wide enough for a
single person to crawl through.

249
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,708
Just now...

250
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,000
I got in behind the restroom
and worked my way over here!

251
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,333
[GAKUTO]
Sir Kiyoshi,

252
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,208
that was uncharacteristically
brilliant of you.

253
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,125
[KIYOSHI] Wow. Your confidence
is really inspiring.

254
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,500
All right. I'm takin' off.

255
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,166
Gonna find my way
back to the restroom.

256
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,083
[ANDRE]
What, no kidding?

257
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,500
[SHINGO]
Dead serious.

258
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,083
[ANDRE] I never would've
thought that Kiyoshi and Gakuto

259
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,750
would end up in a physical
relationship together.

260
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,375
[JOE coughing]
Real shocker.

261
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,125
[KIYOSHI gasps]

262
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,625
To be honest,

263
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,333
I thought they'd both been
acting really strange lately.

264
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,750
Then, I walked in on them.

265
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,500
Gakuto was going down on
Kiyoshi prison shower style.

266
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,333
[KIYOSHI] Lying bastard!
That never happened!

267
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,500
[SHINGO]
That totally happened.

268
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,625
To be sure, I went
in for another look.

269
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,083
There they were.

270
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,708
Whoa. So there's more to it?

271
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,583
You don't mean...

272
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,625
Yeah, down and dirty butt time.

273
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,125
Gakuto was getting
drilled by Kiyoshi.

--[GAKUTO grunting]
--I heard Gakuto

From my understanding,
that makes Kiyoshi a top.

277
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,833
Gakuto's such a bottom.

278
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,916
[KIYOSHI]
This is bullshit!

279

I never drilled anyone,
front or back!

Look, I don't care
if those dudes

want to bang each
other or whatever.

They're still totally
my buddies regardless.

[MEIKO]
Really?

316
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,541
Strange, he never had
an issue with it before.

317
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,916
Could I say something?

318
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,625
I'm afraid they're not
telling you the whole truth

319
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,708
about what's really going on.

320
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,625
[KIYOSHI gasps]

321
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,791
Well? Out with it.

322
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,375
I'll tell you the real reason.

323
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,083
His hemorrhoids.

324
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,333
[ALL gasp]

325
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,875
[KIYOSHI] Where'd all
that blood come from?!

326
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,250
Oh, shit. It's from the Vice
President's heel stomp earlier.

327
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,041
[SHINGO] Looks like
he's not just a pitcher.

328
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,291
[JOE]
He's a catcher, too.

329
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,666
[ANDRE] Well he's
definitely never gonna be

330
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,166
a power bottom.

331
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,375
[GAKUTO]
Huh?

332
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,416
[MEIKO] The items you asked for
the other day have arrived.

333
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,375
Come up and grab
what's yours.

334
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,750
[BOYS gasp]

335
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,291
[GAKUTO] Now I can work
on my foreign language

336
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,708
listening comprehension!

337
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,958
What, like Italian?

338
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,875
Au contraire, my simple
friend! This is for--

339
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:32,958
[MEIKO]
One more thing.

340
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,708
It's about your
IT class tomorrow.

341
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,958
It will be held in the school's
computer lab, with the girls.

342
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,250
[BOYS gasp]

343
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,250
Unfortunately, there
are no computers here

344
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
for the prison population.

345
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,041
Be on your best behavior.

346
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,166
Oh, yeah!

347
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,958
With the ladies!

348
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,166
We're in with the bitches!

349
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,583
Dude, this is great!
In class with the girls!

350
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,208
[GAKUTO chuckles]
Just as I surmised.

351
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,416
Do what now?

352
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,458
This is our contingency plan.

353
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,291
[KIYOSHI]
Uh...

354
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,166
[STUDENT 3B]
Despicable.

355
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,208
[STUDENT 3C]
This sucks.

356
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,625
[STUDENT 3D]
They smell like feet!

357
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,916
It sounded so good.

358
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,750
[coughs] Yeah... This blows.

359
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:08,250
Hm? What? I like basking
in the girls' derision.

360
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,166
[KIYOSHI gasps]

361
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,666
Chiyo.

362
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,458
[CHIYO]
Su-more of you Saturday!

363
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,125
[KIYOSHI]
Yeah, su-more of you Saturday!

364
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,458
Gakuto, what's your plan?

365
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,541
While you're sneaking
out of the lavatory,

366
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,458
using a remote, yours
truly shall play back

367
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,500
the sounds of defecation
loaded onto this device.

368
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,875
In doing so, we can
buy some more time.

369
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,750
Big Bad Nerima General!

370
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,458
Are the poop sounds
on it already?

371
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,250
Not yet.

372
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,041
Huh?

373
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,791
You still don't get it?

374
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,375
Whilst formulating this plan,

375
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,083
yours truly thought ahead to the
exploitation of computer class.

376
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,791
[KIYOSHI]
Is that... the net?

377
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,041
[GAKUTO]
Indeed.

378
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,625
I should find a treasure
trove of sound links.

379
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,958
But alas!

380
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,750
My "poop mp3" searches
have resulted in nothing!

381
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,833
This is our shot!

382
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,916
There's no more computers.

383
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,250
It's do or die time, dude!

384
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,666
I'm well aware of that!

385
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,041
But no matter how hard I search,

386
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,583
I can't get anything
to come out!

387
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,208
[KIYOSHI]
But if nothing comes out...

388
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,833
[GAKUTO] 
...we must force it out!

389
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,125
[KIYOSHI gasps]
No, we can't do that!

390
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,375
It's way too risky!

391
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,416
Besides, which one of us
is gonna poop on record?

392
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,708
[GAKUTO]
This is the only way.

393
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,666
[KIYOSHI]
It's okay. Give it up.

394
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,833
We gave it our best.

395
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,250
[GAKUTO] Sir Kiyoshi,
is that how little regard

396
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,833
you have for your
upcoming sumo date?

397
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,791
These headphones also
work as a microphone.

398
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,958
[blows]

399
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,458
Don't do it, man!

400
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,750
You have any idea
what will happen

401
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,250
if you go through with this?

402
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,791
It may indeed be too much
to ask of you, Brave Knight.

403
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,541
If you did so in front
of the fair Chiyo,

404
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,833
your date would be cancelled

405
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,583
and your cause for
escape rendered moot.

406
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,666
[KIYOSHI]
It's not just me.

407
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
You shouldn't do this either.

408
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,875
It's gonna ruin the next
three years of your life.

409
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,541
My life?
Yours truly thought that

410
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,625
if I went to a school
with so many damsels,

411
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,125
I'd have a shot at
finding a girlfriend.

412
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,083
[KIYOSHI]
Over three years, you can!

413
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,541
There's a thousand
babes here, man.

414
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,750
[GAKUTO] However, those
figurines only come once

415
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,250
every four years.
The math is rather simple.

416
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,041
My final equation tells me,
it is easier to struggle

417
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,041
through three years than
persevere through four.

418
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,458
This is ridiculous!

419
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,000
You'd rather have some figurine
than a high school life?

420
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,250
Without a doubt.

421
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,250
[KIYOSHI]
Please stop! Think it over!

422
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,833
If this were elementary,
that's one thing.

423
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,125
But we're in high school, man!

424
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,541
Kiyoshi... I leave
it all in your hands.

425
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,458
Gakuto, no!

426
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,541
[GAKUTO]
Forgive me.

427
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:20,333
[wet farts]

428
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,208
Teacher! Please allow me
to go to the restroom.

429
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,750
By all means, go ahead.

430
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,708
But it may be a little after
the fact at this point.

431
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,166
[KIYOSHI]
Gakuto...

432
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,625
I swear your social death
won't have been for nothing.

433
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,166
Hey, Dick Nose!
What's up with the slacks?

434
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,750
They're due to ineluctable
circumstances, Madam.

435
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,125
[MEIKO] What kind of
ineluctable circumstances?

436
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,166
Well, it's uh...

437
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,041
You will answer me!

438
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,166
Yours truly...

439
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,625
...in the middle of class...

440
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,958
...soiled mine striped breeches.

441
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,291
How pathetic!

442
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,625
You're a high-schooler,
and yet you shit yourself?

443
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,416
Is your pooper
really that loose?

444
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,666
Time for some Kegels.

445
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,791
Yes, probably a good idea.

446
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,541
That's top-notch verbal abuse.

447
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,541
[JOE] "It loosened thusly
whilst Sir Kiyoshi

448
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,958
was pounding me in
the dookie-chute."

449
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,125
[SHINGO]
Stop it, dude!

450
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,708
Madam Vice President,
will that be all?

451
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,458
That shed isn't
going to fix itself.

452
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,791
[MEIKO]
Go ahead.

453
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,416
And cram a cork in his ass
if you think it'll help.

454
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,250
Who needs a cork when
there's Kiyoshi's junk?

455
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,250
[SHINGO]
Dude, shut up!

456
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,708
What's with you
dickheads anyway?!

457
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,666
You're standing around laughing

458
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,416
while your buddy
gets torn apart!

459
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,125
Sorry, bro. Joe made me laugh.

460
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,291
Calm down.

461
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,833
I'm sorry. [coughs]

462
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,958
Pay it no mind, Sir Kiyoshi.

463
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,916
I've prepared
myself for this.

464
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,041
[CHAIRMAN]
How ludicrous.

465
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,583
I can't believe how
weak-willed I am.

466
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,083
Old fool!

467
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,791
I bid those sweet, swarthy
behinds adios once and for all,

468
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,791
yet I've dug them back up.

469
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,916
[CHAIRMAN] But this time, I
swear, things will be different.

470
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,416
I'll properly seal the
lot of them away forever.

471
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,583
As an educator...

472
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,875
...as a father...

473
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,750
a line must be drawn...

474
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,833
...now!

475
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,208
Those jerks!

476
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,708
They have no idea
what it really meant

477
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,625
when you crapped your pants.

478
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,416
I'd expected a
negative reaction,

479
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,333
but being berated for befouling
myself is quite onerous.

480
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,916
[KIYOSHI] Gakuto,

481
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,125
I will not let the poop sound

482
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,083
you sacrificed so
much for be wasted.

483
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,416
I'm breaking out of here.

484
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,791
That's exactly what
I needed to hear.

485
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,541
Let's endeavor to make
this breakout a success!

486
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,416
[CHAIRMAN]
I'm sorry.

487
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,250
It seems the idea of merely
burying you in the earth

488
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,250
won't keep me from
digging you back up.

489
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,833
This time I mean it.

490
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,375
Adios.

491
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,458
On the day of the mission,
we won't be at the shed.

492
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,500
We'll be at the restroom
adjacent to the field,

493
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,916
watching belongings.

494
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,375
When the bell chimes at noon,

495
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,208
you'll enter the drainage
channel behind the restroom.

496
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,000
And from there, you'll
make for the shed.

497
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,875
Then,  you slip out the hole
in the wall and into freedom.

498
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,583
[GAKUTO]
You'll have 15 minutes.

499
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,083
Then I make for
the train station

500
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,666
and head to the
Civic Gymnasium where

501
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,291
I'll rendezvous with Chiyo by
the time the clock strikes one.

502
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,708
You'll spend half an hour

503
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,958
watching sumo with Chiyo,
then leave for Akihabara.

504
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,833
There, you'll grab the
figurines for yours truly.

505
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,041
If you board the train
just after 2 o'clock,

506
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,833
that puts you back
here by three.

507
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,791
[KIYOSHI] Meanwhile,
back inside the school,

508
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,458
you'll trick the
patrolling Vice President

509
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,625
using the poop sound file you
worked so hard to prepare.

510
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,291
Absolute perfection.

511
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,708
Heads up.

512
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,875
I'm slipping through the hole

513
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,250
to double-check the
route to the train.

514
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,416
Right! Good thinking!

515
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,291
[KIYOSHI gasps]

516
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,333
It can't be... No!

517
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,833
[CHAIRMAN]
I can't believe how quickly

518
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,250
the school's facilities
have deteriorated.

519
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,875
[SHINGO]
This curry's off the chain!

520
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,750
I know. I wish I
could get seconds.

521
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,625
[JOE coughs]
Nice burn.

522
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,083
You think they figured it out,

523
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,833
and the Underground
Student Council sealed it?

524
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,208
If that were the case,

525
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,791
they would have already
doled out the punishment.

526
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,166
The more likely answer is that
the school's staff filled it in.

527
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,291
So, what now?

528
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,875
If you had simply
checked the hole

529
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,791
before the cement hardened, you
could have just dug it back out,

530
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,041
and we wouldn't be in this mess.

531
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,875
Hold the phone, you
can't seriously blame me

532
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,000
for the mysterious hole repair!

533
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,833
Sir Kiyoshi,
checking in on the status

534
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,291
of the hole was your obligation.

535
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,750
Fine.

536
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,541
Dump all the responsibility
on me, you awful bastard.

537
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,875
[GAKUTO]
You are correct.

538
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,458
Yours truly is undoubtedly
an awful man.

539
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,416
Not a man, but a foul beast.

540
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,291
I pooped my pants in public!

541
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,041
[BOYS gasp]

542
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:05,083
I shit my slacks and flushed
away three years of my life!

543
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,333
I put it all on
the line for this!

544
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,583
Now that I have no chance of

545
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,291
acquiring my
quadrennial figurines.

546
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,500
I've sacrificed a grand
total of seven years!

547
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,541
No... I'm pretty sure
your math is a bit off.

548
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,083
Stop being so blasé!

549
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,750
For what, nay, for whom did
yours truly stain his breeches?

550
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,833
[SHINGO]
It is Kiyoshi's fault.

551
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,041
[ANDRE]
Kiyoshi's junk's fault.

552
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,458
[JOE] Banged the clench
out of his bunghole.

553
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,166
Chill out, man. Keep it down!

554
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,125
I want my feces back, damn it!

555
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,666
[MEIKO]
Time to shut up!

556
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,416
What's with all the
racket during dinner?

557
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,583
Keep your mouths shut
unless you're eating.

558
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,000
[door slams]

559
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,958
Look, dudes, it's time to
end this lovers' quarrel.

560
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,666
Just stop! It isn't
like that at all, okay?

561
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,083
[JOE coughs]
Hey, look.

562
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,333
We know what's up, so
you can drop the act.

563
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,625
There's another reason
for all of this!

564
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,458
All right. What other
reason? Just tell us.

565
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,250
[KIYOSHI]
There's no way I can tell them.

566
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,208
[SHINGO]
Hey, Joe. Don't push him.

567
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,500
You're right.

568
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,958
He didn't mean anything by it.

569
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,708
You two will get nothing
but support from us.

570
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,041
[KIYOSHI]
Damn it! It isn't like that!

571
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,166
Yours truly wants his
feces back, damn it!

572
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,041
[GAKUTO sobs]

573
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:10,125
I can't believe it.
I pooped my pants.

574
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,750
I shat myself in public...

575
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,250
[BOYS laughing]

576
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,000
Never seen Gakuto
looking so sad.

577
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,125
Should we talk with him?

578
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,083
No, don't.

579
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,041
This ain't our battle to fight.

580
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,625
What do you want?

581
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:33,166
You know, when you squeaked
that loaf out, I decided.

582
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,416
I'm gonna escape,
no matter what.

583
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,166
Don't you see? It's over.

584
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,958
Mine adolescence as well
as the plan to break out.

585
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,125
[KIYOSHI]
No, it's not over yet.

586
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,625
[GAKUTO] But with the
hole in the wall sealed,

587
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:45,958
escape is impossible!

588
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,708
Our entire plan hinged on it.

589
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,833
Now, everything we've
done has been for naught!

590
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,958
There is no longer enough time
for us to devise a new strategy.

591
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,250
[KIYOSHI]
There is a way.

Huh?

593
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,916
I will become a girl!

Whoa, sex change? What's next?!

595

[KIYOSHI] I thought
about it all last night.

596
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,916
I don't think
there's any other way.

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,041
I'll use the front gate.

598
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,250
[GAKUTO gasps]
You don't mean...

599
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,750
When you say you'll
become a girl--

600
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:09,750
[KIYOSHI]
Yes...

601
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,458
I'll dress up as a girl,

602
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,750
and walk proudly out
through the front.

603
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,208
That would be rash!

604
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,625
[KIYOSHI]
Yeah. I know it.

605
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,000
But then, it's the only way

606
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,541
we're gonna have a chance
at making this work.

607
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,208
And how do you propose we
procure a girl's uniform?

608
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,875
Well, this is a boarding school.

609
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,208
So that means a cleaning service

610
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,375
would come by every week
to get the laundry, right?

611
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,708
Precisely.

612
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,000
Their vehicle stops at
the dorm's back entrance,

613
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,208
just on the other
side of those tanks.

614
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,250
The day after tomorrow,
when the cleaners are working,

615
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,583
I'll sneak in and
hijack a girl's uniform.

616
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,083
The owner of the uniform won't
be wearing it over the weekend.

617
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,041
If I return it by Sunday,
they'll never know.

618
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:45,833
[GAKUTO]
Nevertheless--

619
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,250
Listen up!

620
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,375
This is the only chance we
have left for a breakout!

621
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,250
Do you still want your
Three Kingdoms figurines?!

622
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,541
Well, yes, but--

623
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,291
Then make up your mind!

624
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,041
We just have to wait for
the perfect time to act.

625
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,875
We can't let the
Underground Student Council

626
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,333
suspect anything.

627

Cocksnout! You didn't
stack this lumber properly!

[GAKUTO groans]

629
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,541
On your feet, already.

630
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,041
[GAKUTO groans]
Yes...

631
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,833
I told you to get on
your feet now, Fignuts!

[spits]

633
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry, Madam--

634
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,166
Please forgive my boorishness!

[MEIKO]
You must want a beating!

636
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,500
[KIYOSHI] What the hell
is Gakuto thinking?

637
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,166
Dude! Why? I thought we
decided to lay low today?

638
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,458
Almost there...

639
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,375
But it's still not quite
enough, as things stand.

640
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,750
[GAKUTO]
It's the president.

641
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,583
That's the only way!

642
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,500
Please, Madam Vice President!

643
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,916
I beseech you, please
forgive my indiscretions!

644
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,500
Looks like someone
hasn't had enough!

645
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,791
Now get back to work!

Next time on Prison School:

00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,416
"Take Me Out to the Sumoland"
