00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,708
[MEIKO]
I won't ask you again, Kiyoshi.

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,666
Step out of that
stall immediately.

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,416
[GAKUTO gulps]

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
This is no time for pocket
pool, Filthy Four-Eyes!

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,000
[GAKUTO]
I have an itch!

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,458
[MEIKO]
So both your ass and your

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,875
--toolbox are filthy?!
--[GAKUTO] What this?!

8
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:24,583
When needed most, my defecation
sound refuses to play?

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,291
[MEIKO]
Still nothing, huh?

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,250
Well... in that case...

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,208
I'll just do... this!

12
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,041
--[GAKUTO] It's over!
--[SHINGO gasps]

13
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,416
You're kidding me.

14

[sobs]

15
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,958
[MEIKO] If you're in there,
then answer me!

16
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,208
Sorry. I'm sorry.

17
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,958
Damn, do your hemorrhoids
really hurt so bad

18
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:15,958
they make you cry?

19
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,208
Weeping on the toilet?

20
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,458
That is pathetic.

21
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,250
Get back to your
post immediately!

22
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,666
[SHINGO] You've been sitting
on the can for too long, bro.

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,375
You gotta get back to work.

24
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,875
[KIYOSHI]
I'm sorry... Shingo.

25
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,208
Sir Kiyoshi...

26
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,500
[GAKUTO]
You...

27
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,916
You made it back
in record time!

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,750
Yours truly couldn't help
but worry that you might

29
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,666
get so caught up in
watching the sumo matches

30
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,750
with the Lady Chiyo, thine
arrival would be delayed!

31
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,708
Whither dost thou
shed salt-tears?

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,916
Since you've completed your
mission and returned so soon,

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,625
you must have cut short
your sumo watching time.

34
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,666
--Is that your lament?
--No, Gakuto.

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,708
It went bad... so bad.
It was an absolute failure.

36
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,708
Failure? What're you saying?

37
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,166
[KIYOSHI]
It got all screwed up.

38
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,833
You don't mean you've come
back here ten minutes early

39
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,416
because you failed to
acquire my figurines?

40
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,708
[GAKUTO]
The Three Kingdoms Fair

41
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,083
only comes once
every four years.

42
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,875
I've tarnished the next
three years of high school

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,458
by defecating in my trousers!

44
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,583
Do you really hold yours truly's
seven years in such low regard?

45
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,208
"It got all screwed up"
doesn't cut it!

46
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,833
Get your ass back out
there and buy them!

47
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,166
I did my part!

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,208
Where's my limited edition
Guan Yu and Red Hare?

49
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh... I bought your figurines.
They're still in the bag.

50
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,041
See?

51
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,000
[laughs]

52
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,541
Sir Kiyoshi, you really
shouldn't tease me like that!

53
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,875
Thy pranks really
had me worried.

54
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:31,958
Not exactly.

55
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,500
It's just that my date didn't--

56
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,541
We have to hurry back out!

57
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,125
They might still
suspect something!

58
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,458
I'll stash these away
here for the time being,

59
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,250
and return later
to reclaim them.

60
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,458
I have to admit,

61
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,208
you've impressed yours
truly, Sir Kiyoshi.

62
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,541
Those tears seemed authentic.

63
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,250
I never knew you
were a thespian!

64
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,666
Well, there's a reason
I'm back so soon.

65

--My date didn't--

00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,500
It was you, wasn't it?

68
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,750
Did you enjoy yourself?

69
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,125
How was the sumo match?

70
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,666
I don't know what
you're talking about.

71
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,958
You were the one I stopped at
the front gate, weren't you?

72
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,541
With the bag on your back?

73
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,000
[KIYOSHI] No, ma'am. I've been
in the restroom the whole time.

74
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,291
You don't say?

75
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,791
If you've been in there...

76
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,458
Care to explain this photo?

permission to leave for the day.

to do with sumo,

so I'm sending it.

examine the contents of his bag.

Yes, ma'am.

Huh? Ugh!

I know these split ends.

Then you-- You used
Filthy Four-Eyes's hair!

98
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,041
No way... If he--

99
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,375
--That means--
--Uh-huh.

100
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,750
Looks like somebody screwed us.

101
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,666
I don't know how or
where you managed to

102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,750
get your hands on
a girl's uniform.

103
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,208
But beyond a shadow of a doubt,

104
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,541
you disguised yourself
as a girl to escape.

105
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
Is that correct?

106
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,500
[KIYOSHI]
Yes...

107
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
[ANDRE] But escape means
that we're all held liable,

108
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,583
and our sentences are extended
another month, right, guys?

--That blonde guy punched him.
--What for?

132
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,958
Ugh! You went and got it on
with a girl on your own time,

133
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,083
and said "screw the rest of
those chumps," didn't ya?!

00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm sorry.

00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,958
[MEIKO] We'll be keeping you in
solitary confinement, Pig Boy.

139
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,875
Breaking out of here was
bad in and of itself,

140
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,541
but then you make a move on
the President's own sister?

141
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,083
They're gonna hang
you out to dry.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,250
[KIYOSHI] I-- I don't know
how much more I can take.

143
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,041
[MEIKO]
What about the wig you made

144
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,666
from Filthy Four-eyes's hair.

145
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,041
Explain that.

146
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,541
Easy.

147
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,500
I took the hair you shaved off
Gakuto's head and used it.

148
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,000
[MEIKO] Oh? So you're saying
that Mister Brown Thunder

149
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,666
had nothing to do
with the breakout?

150
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,833
Right. Gakuto didn't have
anything to do with it.

151
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,708
I just told him I had to
really use the bathroom,

152
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,125
then I snuck out.

153
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,791
Then how do you explain
the sound of crapping I heard

154
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,916
when I walked into the restroom?

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,125
I don't know.

156
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,541
I must've still been
off-campus at the time.

157
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,208
Who knows? It could have been
any number of butts from school.

158
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,625
[MEIKO] So you continue to claim

Why did you decide to
steal Chiyo's uniform?

162

[KIYOSHI]
I didn't.

I needed a girl's

come to a decision.

Kiyoshi, the accused...

174
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,041
You acted alone
in your escape...

And left campus, shirking
your bag-watching duty.

[KIYOSHI]
Yes.

177

[GAKUTO gasps]
Sir Kiyoshi.

178
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,041
You're accepting the
censure for this alone?

179

Like I warned you
in the beginning,

you are all liable
for any breakout.

That's why, except for Kiyoshi,

--[SHINGO] Tch.

charged with breaking out,

sexual relations.

186

00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,291
[gasps]

316
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,166
--Is that...?
--[MARI] Chiyo...

317
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,375
This meeting's private.

318
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,625
What are you trying to do,

319
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,250
kick him out just for
leaving school grounds?

320
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,625
And worse, forcing him to write
his own withdrawal request?!

321
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,125
You make me sound cruel.

322
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,666
Mister Kiyoshi here chose to
withdraw of his own accord.

323
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,041
This reprobate has been found

324
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,791
guilty of larceny and
illicit sexual conduct!

325
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,416
Thus, his expulsion
is warranted!

326
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,000
If it was elicit sexual conduct,
then that makes me guilty, too!

327
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,291
[MARI]
But you're the victim!

328
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,875
He coerced you into joining him.

329
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,416
You must have
Stockholm Syndrome.

330
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
You're so wrong!

331
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,833
I invited him!

332
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,500
[MARI] You're really
covering for the degenerate

333
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,750
who stole your uniform
and split your jacket open?

334
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,708
No, but I'm sure Kiyoshi
had a good reason.

335
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,083
Didn't you?

336
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,500
[CHIYO]
I'm sorry for what I did.

337
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,708
I was shocked.

338
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,500
So I said something
awful that I now regret.

339
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,583
I left without hearing
your side of it.

340
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,083
Chiyo, I swear.
It was coincidence.

341
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,000
I grabbed a uniform
for my escape.

342
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,625
But I never meant to take yours!

343
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,791
Enough lies!

344
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,708
Now pipe down!

345
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,000
[CHIYO]
Don't hit him, Meiko!

346
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,250
That's so mean!

347
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,708
[KIYOSHI]
Whoa!

348
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,791
Kiyoshi made a promise to go
to the sumo match with me,

349
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:09,875
that's why he broke out!

350
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,583
Which makes me guilty
too, doesn't it?

351
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,708
I already told you that
you were in the clear!

352
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,833
And you, get your head
off of my sister, now!

353
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,333
Well, in any case,
if Kiyoshi is dropping out,

354
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,875
then I'm dropping out too!

355
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,583
[KIYOSHI]
Huh?

356
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,750
Stop being so difficult!

357
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,250
[ALL gasp]

358
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,875
[MARI]
Enough of this nonsense!

359
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,041
Miss Chiyo, don't!

360
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,708
[CHIYO]
Let me go, Meiko!

361
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,583
Why do you insist
on being so stubborn

362
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,458
over this disgusting reprobate?

363
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,166
Kiyoshi isn't a reprobate!

364
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,791
I know because of what you said!

365
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,166
Anyone who likes crows
isn't a bad person!

366
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,458
He's the kind who
returns baby crows

367
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,041
that have fallen out of
the tree back to their nest!

368
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,000
Really, baby crows?

369
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,291
Him?

370
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,250
[MARI sighs]

371
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't believe it.

372
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,250
I saw him do it!

373
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,458
I'm sure you must be mistaken.

374
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,500
Now, Kiyoshi.

375
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,458
Stop stalling and sign
this withdrawal form.

376
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,791
[KIYOSHI]
I, uh...

377
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,875
I ain't signing that shit.

378
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,083
But you--

379
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,333
No, you have to!

380
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,875
I don't know what kind
of trouble's waiting,

381
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,875
but my future's at this school.

382
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,250
And one thing's certain.

383
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,166
I will prove you wrong.

384
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,083
To do that, I can't drop out!

385
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,291
You see? Kiyoshi's
been rehabilitated!

386
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,375
[MARI sighs]

387
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,916
[MARI]
Enough.

388
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,333
Take the prisoner
back to his cell.

389
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,000
[CHIYO]
One more thing.

390
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,333
If you try to get
rid of Kiyoshi again,

391
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,541
then I swear I'll turn this in.

392
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,166
[KIYOSHI] I got to clear
things up with Chiyo.

393
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,500
And she totally pulled
my face into her boobs.

394
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,916
Chiyo's boobs are
as soft as pillows.

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,666
Chiyo's boobs smelled
like lilac and berries.

396
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,083
Her left boob...
and the right one.

397
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,083
Chiyo's boobs rule!

398
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,791
[KIYOSHI]
As of that moment,

399
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,875
any reason I had to leave
this school... was gone!

400
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:13,875
[MARI] Anyone who likes
crows... isn't a bad person.

[KIYOSHI]
Hey, guys. I'm back.

403
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,000
I somehow managed to get through
it without being expelled!

404
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,083
But I really wanna say,
"I'm sorry, you guys!"

405
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,708
[KIYOSHI]
Uh...

406
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,125
Ah, well, good for you.

407
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,875
[KIYOSHI]
Thanks, Gakuto.

408
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,875
So... what's for dinner?

409
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,625
Oh... Well, uh...

410
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,500
Huh? Seems my
dinner's gone AWOL.

411
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,583
I'll go get it.

412
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,458
Don't bother.
There isn't any left.

413
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,833
[KIYOSHI]
Uh...

414
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,500
We were all under the
impression you got expelled,

415
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,791
so we decided to
split your dinner.

416
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,375
Sorry, "bro."

417
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,125
Oh. Right. That's cool.

418
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,375
We'll just count it
as part of my apology.

419
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,291
[laughs awkwardly]

420

Yeah? Thanks a lot man!

423

Hey! Thanks, bud.

424

Golden-fried crispy
nuggets are my favoritest!

425
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,875
You don't want
yours, I'll take it.

426
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,166
No, but... I meant...
for Kiyoshi...

427
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,750
No worries, Gakuto.

things with Kiyoshi as they are?

As they... are?

Now, split into two
teams and get to work!

474
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,916
[BOYS]
Yes, ma'am!

475
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey, Joe, Andre, how 'bout
we tackle that storeroom?

476
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,250
[BOTH grunt]

477
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,958
The tennis club's
practicing over there.

478
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
It should be pretty tasty.

479
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,166
Well, come on, Gakuto.
Let's go clean the restroom.

480
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,875
[GAKUTO]
Indeed.

481
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,458
[SHINGO]
Hey, Gakuto!

482
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,750
You come to the storeroom
with the rest of the dudes.

483
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,083
[BOTH gasp]

484
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,416
Come on! Sure, I could
clean the restroom myself,

485
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,041
but the door's gotta get fixed.

486
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,333
Gakuto, let's roll, bro.

487
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,125
[GAKUTO]
Uh...

488
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,000
[KIYOSHI] Looks like they're
totally shutting me out.

489
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,125
[SHINGO] And I was like, "You
kiss your baby with that mouth?"

490
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,208
[ALL laugh]

491
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,166
[KIYOSHI]
Yeah, I brought it on myself,

492
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,833
but this is brutal.

493
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,125
It wasn't so long ago,

494
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,500
I wouldn't have been able
to get through this.

495
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,625
But now...

496
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,916
I know I can do anything!

497
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,916
Titties!

498
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,208
Chiyo's cans were awesome.

499
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,416
They were so soft!

500
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,916
Now that I have
firsthand experience

501
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,291
of how soft and inviting
Chiyo's breasts are.

502
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,625
I can take anything
they throw at me!

503
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,000
[KIYOSHI gasps]
Oh, damn it.

504
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,541
Guess someone's in there.

505
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,208
The investigation
is going smoothly.

506
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,041
The prisoners suspect nothing.

507
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,958
[MARI]
Excellent work.

508
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,625
Please continue
looking into it.

509
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,250
You must discover their
weaknesses for our plan.

510
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,166
"Boys Expulsion Operation."

511
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,625
Which we'll codename
"Operation DTO."

512
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,041
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,083
[MEIKO gasps] "Operation Destroy
Testicles... Operation"?

514
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,625
Unless the O doesn't
actually stand for operation?

515
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,791
Should I point that out to her?

516
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,208
[MARI]
Oh my...

517
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,833
"Operation" is rather
redundant there, in hindsight.

518
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,750
How careless of me.

519
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,083
I'll rephrase.

520
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,125
For the sake of Codename "DTO."

521
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,416
[MEIKO]
Yes, ma'am!

522
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,958
[MEIKO]
That's the President for you!

523
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,125
She recognizes her own
mistakes immediately,

524
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,583
and she exhibits the strength
of character to correct it!

525
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,916
I am in complete awe of
the caliber of person she is.

526
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,166
[MARI]
Look at the time.

527
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,333
It's unlike her to be late.

528
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,458
She should have been
here six minutes ago.

529
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,791
You're right, as always.

530
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,875
[toilet flushes]

531
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,041
[HANA] What are you doing,
sitting by the toilet?

532
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,833
I-- I'm not doing
anything shady.

533
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,208
I came here to
clean the restroom,

534
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,750
but the stall was occupied,

535
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,583
so I'm waiting outside, instead.

536
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,625
[HANA scoffs] Well, that's
a job that fits you.

537
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,333
[gasps]

538
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,250
Hana?!

539
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,791
[KIYOSHI gasps]
Hana's back on the scene!

540
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,916
I heard that you'd
escaped from prison.

541
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,291
[KIYOSHI]
Well, uh, 'scuse me.

542
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,166
Need to clean the restroom, so.

543
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,666
[KIYOSHI] To run into
her here, of all places.

544
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,000
Why do you keep ignoring me?

545
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:39,833
[gasps]

546
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,333
[HANA]
Ugh! How rude!

547
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,875
Like I'm dirty or something!

548
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,750
It's not that! You startled me!

549
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,291
O-Of course I don't
think you're dirty.

550
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,333
Really?

551
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,750
You don't think
I'm dirty, Kiyoshi?

552
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,666
[KIYOSHI] Whoa! You're
kinda getting close here.

553
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,208
What's wrong?

554
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,625
You afraid I'm gonna get my
dirtiness on you or something?

555
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,791
No! That's not it!

556
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,958
Great! Then shut
up and prove it!

557
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,166
[KIYOSHI whimpers]

558
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,625
Prove it... how?

559
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,166
[yelps]

560
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,416
Come on.

561
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,541
You haven't forgotten,
and neither have I.

562
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,000
[KIYOSHI gasps]

563
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,916
Right.

564
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
I'm not an absolute monster,

565
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,458
so I won't do anything to you
worse than what you did to me.

[KIYOSHI gasps]

567
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,541
Whoa! Hang on.

568
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,666
You don't mean-- That?!

569
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,166
[HANA]
You said I'm not dirty, right?

570
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,416
[KIYOSHI]
Of course not.

571
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,416
I'd never dare to
call you dirty.

572
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,375
Honest.

573
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,333
[chuckles]

574
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,208
Terrific!

575
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,125
Then there won't be a problem!

576
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,666
See ya!

577
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,750
[sighs]

578
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,083
[HANA]
I'm in a bit of a rush today,

579
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,125
so you can thoroughly
prove it to me next time!

580
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,291
[KIYOSHI gasps] It's not
like I did it on purpose,

581
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,833
you blonde psycho!

582
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,583
This sucks balls!

583
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,416
[MARI]
Welcome back, Hana.

584
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,416
[chuckles]

585

"Vengeance is Hana's"
