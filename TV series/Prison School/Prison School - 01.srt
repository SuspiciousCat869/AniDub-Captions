Hachimitsu Private Academy.

00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,833
A boarding school known as much
for its strict discipline policy

12
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,291
as its stellar record
for college prep.

But the turbulence
of a new system

would shake the

before I enrolled.

And to be honest, that's
why I signed up, man.

have explosive diarrhea.
