158

[KIYOSHI chuckles]

159
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,708
You gave yours truly
quite the scare.

160
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,750
Yeah, that was too close.

161
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,000
No offense intended, but
your usage of the basket ploy

162
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,458
was cleverer than I expected.

163
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,541
None taken.

164
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,625
But I've gotta thank you.

165
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,458
Distracting the
cleaning guy really--

166
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,625
[KIYOSHI]
...really saved the day.

167
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,041
[GAKUTO] T'was mere
child's play, I assure you.

[MARI] If the events of
yesterday are any evidence...

170
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,958
It seems obvious
that the prisoners

171
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,208
have begun to rebel
against our authority.

172
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,250
Have you not been providing
sufficient supervision?

173
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,875
It seems the boys
have grown accustomed

174
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,416
to the harsh environment
of the prison.

175
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,833
Their will to live rivals
that of a cockroach.

176

[MARI] You're not here
to give me excuses.

Yes! Y-You're right, ma'am.

179
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,208
Starting tomorrow, I would like
to reinforce the methods of

180
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,500
discipline I employ while
overseeing the prisoners.

181
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,750
I-Is that acceptable?

182
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,375
[MARI]
Yes, see that you do.

Do I really need to
spell out what will happen

188
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,166
if you disappoint me again?

189
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,666
No, ma'am.

I'm really looking forward to

191
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,791
helping out with the
track meet tomorrow.

192
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,083
Might even be kind of fun!

193

[JOE coughs]
And chicks.

194

The day has come.

By this time on the morrow,

the quadrennial limited edition
Guan Yu and Red Hare figurines

will be all mine!

198
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,708
I don't need any girl.

199
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,708
Not as long as I have
my collectables!

200

[CHIYO] Can't wait for
the match tomorrow.

201
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,208
I'm keeping my eye
on Big Bad Tanaka.

202
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,666
He's a real powerhouse!

203

[MAYUMI sighs]

204
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,500
Once he gets his left arm in,
he's pretty much unbeatable.

Are you even listening
to me, Mayumi?

Yeah...

Tomorrow's the big day.

210
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,083
When I face the greatest
challenge of my life.

211
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,375
I swear, I will
break out of here,

212
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,791
and then I'll have my
sumo date with Chiyo!

On the gate!

[MEIKO] The track and field
regional meet takes place today.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,500
Kiyoshi and Brown Thunder
will guard the bags,

while the rest of
you pull odd jobs.

Yes, ma'am.

[SHINGO]
Check it out!

Here comes the buffet of fresh
talent from the other schools!

[ANDRE]
Imagine how great it would be

222

if you were the starting block
they were crouching over.

223

Bitches better hurry and change.

I just can't get enough
of the taut-bodied babeage!

[MEIKO] Who gave you
permission to speak?!

226

[GAKUTO]
While we have down time,

227
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,958
let's go over today's plan.

228
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,041
When the school bell
chimes at noon,

229
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,291
you'll grab the errand bag,

230
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,291
and yours truly's
specially made wig.

231
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,791
Then make for the toilet.

232
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,250
--Yeah...
--[STUDENT 4B] Excuse me!

Would you keep an eye
on my bag for me?

234
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,208
I acknowledge receipt of
your possessions, miss.

235

Everyone feel free to use
the complimentary bag check.

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,875
Okay. Here's mine, too. Thanks.

237
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,833
[STUDENT 4B] I wonder why
they were dressed like that?

238
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,708
[STUDENT 4C] I think the
guy who was talking funny

239
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,958
totally had a boner.

240
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:01,416
Okay. Time to continue
going through our checklist.

241
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,166
I have the portable
speaker right here.

242
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,125
[KIYOSHI]
Gross, dude. It's still warm.

243
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,125
You'll enter the lavatory,
set up the speaker unit,

244
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,166
clamber up and out
of the rear window,

245
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,500
travel through the drainage
channel to the refuse area.

246
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,958
Here, you'll don your disguise.

247
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,333
First, pop the wig on.

248
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,500
Next, it's time to change

249
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,000
into the girl's uniform
we stashed there.

250
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,916
And walk boldly
out the front gate.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,041
Then you watch your sumo
matches and buy my figurines.

252
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,250
Afterward, you return on
the two o'clock train,

253
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,291
and all is well.

254

Making a picnic lunch?

256
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,166
Well... lunch at least.
I thought it would be nice

257
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,541
to have something to eat while
we watched the sumo matches.

to eat a lot, right?

going with Kiyoshi?

Of course, lame brain.

Well, yeah, but that was before

the boys got caught
trying to peep.

permission to leave.

Yeah, but it's still
a date with a boy.

Calm down. It's not as
big of a deal as all that.

Eating boxed
lunches in the shade

269

asses is the best.

be such good friends,

but we make a good team.

all for my figurines.

00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,750
so I'm really glad Kiyoshi
said he'd come with me!

315
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,833
This will also be the
first time I've gone out

where it's just a boy and me.

317

That sounds like a date to me.

But it isn't a date!

Thanks for making
me anxious, Mayumi!

321
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,333
I wonder if they've let
Kiyoshi out of prison yet.

I'll see you soon, Chiyo!

So should I just cut
through right here?

Why do you think it's
okay to dress like that?

You shouldn't wear
this bag on your back.

a boner when he took my bag!

There was a student sumo
wrestler in the bathroom also!

474
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,125
Seeing him up close,
that dude is huge!

475
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,250
Hm?

476
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,666
I can't...

477
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,791
Uh?

478
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,791
You disgust me.

479
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,708
[KIYOSHI gasps]

480
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,083
I disgust you?

481
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,541
What, for going to the toilet?

482
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,458
[squelch]

483
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,708
[gasps]

484
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:13,041
[KIYOSHI gasping]

485
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,041
[CHIYO] You disgust me!
You disgust me! You disgust me!

486
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,750
You disgust me! You disgust me!
You disgust me!

487
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,500
One hour left...

488
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,791
I wonder if Sir Kiyoshi
has already procured

489
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,041
my limited edition figurines.

490
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,958
[SHINGO]
Being a baggage clerk

491
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,541
looks like a total
cakewalk, bro.

492
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,875
[GAKUTO]
Shingo, if you'll recall,

493
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,250
it was you who opted for
miscellaneous duties.

494
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,666
Yeah, I guess you're right.

495
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,375
Say, where's Kiyoshi at?
I haven't seen him in a while.

496
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,708
Sir Kiyoshi is indisposed
in the lavatory.

497
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,041
His piles seem to worsen

498
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:46,916
--with each passing day.
--Nah...

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,166
Bet he's just takin' it easy.

500
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,500
I'll go have a chat.

501
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,791
[gasps] Speaking to someone
using the facilities

502
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:52,875
is the epitome of
impolite behavior--

503
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,083
[MEIKO yells]

504
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,875
What are you fart-huffers doing?

505
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,375
I think Kiyoshi's slacking off

506
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,333
on the clock, ma'am!

507
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,416
As I've told you before,

508
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,250
he's voiding his bowels!

509
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,875
Hey! Kiyoshi!

510
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,666
Come out immediately!

511
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,541
I haven't seen you at your
post since before noon!

512
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,833
If you're refusing to come out,
then I'll have to go in.

513
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,000
[CHAIRMAN] The boys' release
date is coming up soon.

514
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,000
Next week, in fact.

515
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,625
Right?

516
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,916
That's up to them.

517
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,291
But those five degenerates
are perverted fools.

518
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,750
Once they're freed from prison,

519
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,791
they'll surely do something
to be put back in.

520
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,166
[CHAIRMAN]
Don't say that.

521
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,000
They've endured the
Underground Student Council's

522
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,333
strict mentoring regimen.

523
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,291
Even animals can learn
from their mistakes.

524
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,125
Agreed?

525
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,500
[phones ring, vibrate]

526
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,500
[BOTH]
Pardon me, I have a text.

527
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,208
[MEIKO]
I won't ask you again, Kiyoshi.

528
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,708
Step out of that
stall immediately.

529
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,708
[GAKUTO gulps]

530
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,458
This is no time for pocket
pool, Filthy Four Eyes!

531
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,833
[GAKUTO]
I have an itch!

532
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,083
[MEIKO]
So both your ass and your

533
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,500
--toolbox are filthy?!
--[GAKUTO] What this?!

534
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,458
When needed most, my defecation
sound refuses to play?

535
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,208
[MEIKO]
Still nothing, huh?

536
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,750
Well... in that case...

537
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,916
I'll just do... this!

538
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:44,208
[KIYOSHI]
Next time on Prison School:

539
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,041
"The School's Number One
Most Treacherous Man"
