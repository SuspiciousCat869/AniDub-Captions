1
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:13,125
[GAKUTO] We have Sir Kiyoshi's
quick thinking to thank

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,375
for our expulsion postponement.

3
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,875
Nonetheless, our reprieve
lasts but a day.

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,791
I cannot reiterate enough.

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:25,333
Urgency of action is key,
if we wish to be victorious.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,916
Sir Kiyoshi, have you seen
to the arrangements,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,625
so that all will be
ready when needed?

8
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,333
[KIYOSHI] Yes. Wheels
have been set in motion.

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,333
I sent a note to Chiyo. She'll
make sure things are prepped

10
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,041
for the moment in question.

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,583
I understand your hesitance
to involve her.

12
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,500
But without the assistance
of Lady Chiyo,

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,625
I'm afraid our plan
would prove impossible.

14
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,416
So I'm supposed to challenge
the Vice President

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,666
to another arm wrestling match
at lunch. Isn't that right?

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,041
[GAKUTO] Correct. Just like the
prior arm wrestling competition,

17
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,500
you will lure the Vice President
with a test of might!

18
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,916
Meanwhile, yours truly

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,416
will sneak into the
corrections office.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,583
Just one thing.

21
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,375
Andre got his ass handed
to him last time.

22
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,708
She's probably lost all
interest in that kind of bait.

23
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,041
[JOE]
Yeah. [coughs]

24
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,833
Yours truly has taken that
variable into account.

25
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:09,166
We shall utilize a new contest
to reignite the competitive fire

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,916
within the Vice President.

27
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,958
One day. That's the
most I could give them.

28
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,291
Those boys have proven
enterprising so far.

29
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,083
How will they
capitalize on this?

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,666
I watch!

31
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,666
Please reconsider,
Madam President!

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,541
I take full responsibility for
the boys' stay of expulsion

33
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,041
from my lack of due diligence,
but sending Hana in

34
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,083
as the lone overseer
could be dangerous!

35
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,875
Really? What do
you mean by that?

36
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,458
It's her behavior.

37
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,166
I question Hana's
mental stability.

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,458
[HANA]
I'm perfectly fine, Meiko.

39
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,416
I'll admit, things got a little
heated earlier, but don't worry,

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,250
'cause I've completely calmed
down now, I promise.

41
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,416
[MEIKO]
You had a knife!

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,291
[HANA] But I don't
have one now, do I?

43
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,250
You can frisk me if you want.

44
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,458
Actually. I'm more concerned
about the amount

45
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,541
of influence the boys
seem to have over you.

46
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,750
[MEIKO]
Huh?

47
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,041
Kiyoshi did thank you,
rather specifically.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,916
What was that for?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,083
[MEIKO]
No, that's not...

50
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't have a clue what
he meant by that!

51
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,958
Vice President. I never
dreamed I'd have to ask you,

52
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,750
but have you begun
to develop feelings

53
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,958
for those wretched dirtbags?

54
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,791
[MEIKO] No, Madam!
That's impossible!

55
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,333
I would never dare!

56
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,750
[GAKUTO] Butt wrestling! A game
where you stand back to back

57
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,833
in a small circle and butt-bump
the other person out!

58
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,708
Butt-on-butt!
Brawn-on-brawn!

59
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,541
Fierce at the start, yet
growing ever more tender.

60
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,833
A grand competition
both violent and sexy!

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,875
[KIYOSHI] You can't believe
the Vice President

62
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,750
is gonna get lured
into that contest?

63
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,791
Yea verily! The Vice
President must have

64
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,291
absolute confidence
in her buttocks.

65
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,125
I'm certain she'll
accept the challenge.

66
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,916
Lunch-time swiftly approaches.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,208
Sir Andre! When the
Vice President arrives

68
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,166
with our meals, you
must challenge her!

69
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,458
Butt wrestling style.

70
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,041
Ah! I can't wait to
tear into each other!

71
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,708
Getting butt bashed
by the Vice President

72
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,833
would be a dream come true!

73
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,291
Hey man, I don't
think it'll work out

74
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,625
quite the way
you're imagining it

75
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,625
We're screwed.

76
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,875
[GAKUTO]
No need to panic, friends.

77
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,875
We simply entice her
with it at lunch-time.

78
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,750
The actual match
will be tonight.

79
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,000
[door slams]

80
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,583
Hey boys! Come and
grab your lunches.

81
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,333
[GAKUTO]
What?!

82
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,083
[KIYOSHI]
Not Hana!

83
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:34,625
[SHINGO, JOE]
Crap!

84
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,583
[ANDRE]
No!

85
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,708
Hey, what do I do now?

86
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,916
We'll just have to get
things started ourselves.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,375
Let's go! It's butt
wrestling time!

88
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,250
[ANDRE]
You'll never beat me, Gakuto!

89
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,250
Your skill has
overwhelmed me!

90
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,666
I know when I've been bested.

91
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,708
Andre's mighty rump is
surely unparalleled!

92
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,666
What say you, Madam
Vice Preside--

93
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,916
uh, I mean, Lady Hana?

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,750
Would you care to try
your hand or, rather,

95
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,916
your hind at a bit
of butt wrestli--?

96
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,625
Now would you boys rather
keep playing grab ass,

97
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,833
or come get your trays?

98
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,333
[BOYS]
Trays!

99
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,916
[KIYOSHI gasps]

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,708
Hey. I finally remembered
what happened back

101
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,041
in the nurse's office.

102
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,416
[KIYOSHI]
Uh. Uh...

103
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,583
And I plant to make
you're eryngii pay

104
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,666
for everything it did.

105
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,333
[KIYOSHI]
What?

106
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,125
You mean like the mushroom?

107
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,666
I'll have my payback
before the day is over.

108
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,166
You can count on it.

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,916
I'm afraid things have
taken an unexpected turn.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,625
Our butt bumping
stratagem was geared

111
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,791
towards the Vice
President, not Hana.

112
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,666
Sir Kiyoshi, are you
even listening?

113
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,375
[KIYOSHI] My eryngii? She
mentioned the nurse's office,

114
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,583
so it's definitely
not about the food.

115
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,750
This isn't fair. I didn't
do anything on purpose!

116
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,208
What the hell is Hana planning
to do to my mushroom?!

117
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,875
[MEIKO] Way to be less
than worthless, Meiko.

118
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:59,208
Failing to meet the President's
expectations. To top it all off,

119
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,250
Kiyoshi's pronouncement
of gratitude

120
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,250
further undermined
Mari's trust in me.

121
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,458
[knocking]

122
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,625
[MARI] Madam Vice President?
A moment please.

123
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,041
[MEIKO]
Uh! Madam President!

124
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,000
Please pardon my intrusion
on your training regimen.

125
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,625
[MEIKO] I'm trying to get
stronger, so that I won't

126
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
disappoint you again.

127
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,166
I'd never do anything to
betray you, Madam President!

128
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,583
That's all quite unnecessary.

129
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,458
I think you misunderstand.

130
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,291
[MEIKO]
Uh?

131
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,125
I'm not upset with you.

132
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,500
And I've never once
doubted your capabilities.

133
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,208
Honestly?

134
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,833
[MARI] I had a reason to
send Hana to oversee them.

135
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,166
I realized it was possible
that the boys could have

136
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,916
learned your behavioral
patterns with intent

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,208
to use them against you.

138
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,125
Having spent so much
time with them,

139
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,958
this outcome was inevitable.

140
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,458
However, Hana will prove
much tougher to predict.

141
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,416
That's why I
switched you out.

142
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,166
So that on their final day,

143
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,166
we can make sure to keep
them on their toes.

144
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,083
Wow. None of that had
even occurred to me!

145
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,583
Apologies, Madam President.
Forgive my shallow mindedness!

146
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,875
[MARI] You have nothing
to be sorry for.

147
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,166
In fact, I have another task I'd
like you to attend to instead.

148
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,958
[MEIKO]
Another task? Gladly.

149
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,875
I must say, your metabolism
is as active as ever.

150
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,458
Uh! I'm so sorry!

151
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,208
I'll see to having your
handkerchief cleaned

152
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,291
and returned to you.

153
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,541
[MARI] 
It's all right.

154
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,416
I consider it a sign of
good health, actually.

155
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,583
But ma'am! Your
handkerchief has been

156
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,833
sullied by my sweat!

157
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,750
Really, that won't be necessary.

158
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,458
I don't consider
your sweat dirty.

159
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,875
[MEIKO]
Uh! Thank you Madam!

160
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,500
[MARI]
Oh, my. Next time I'll have to

161
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,500
bring a bath towel instead
of a handkerchief.

162
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,833
We are up shit creek,
as they say.

163
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,541
Our plan cannot
proceed as scheduled

164
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,083
while Hana is in here with us.

165
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,125
Let's go over our
original plan.

166
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,500
We appeal to the Vice
President's competitive side

167
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,083
with a butt wrestling match.
I will then use the distraction

168
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,083
to sneak my way into
the corrections office.

169
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,791
I don't really see
Hana agreeing to

170
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,833
a butt wrestling contest.

171
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,458
No way.

172
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,708
[ANDRE]
Mm....

173
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,083
Sir Kiyoshi, has Lady
Chiyo responded yet?

174
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,875
Yeah, she did. I got
this note from her.

175
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,208
I really hate that we had to
drag her into this mess, though.

176
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,166
But I guess there's
no other choice.

177
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,333
That's true. Sadly
a single day's delay

178
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,166
is all we were granted.
We go tonight.

179
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,916
Ask Chiyo to come
to the rear door

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,666
of the corrections office. Have
her be there after supper.

181
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,000
[KIYOSHI gasps]
All right, will do.

182
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,833
[GAKUTO] As the situation
stands at the moment,

183
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,958
it is impossible for
yours truly to access

184
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,708
the corrections office.
A solution must be found.

185
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,791
[KIYOSHI]
She'll let me in.

186
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,916
[BOYS]
Huh?!

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,416
I'm pretty sure I
could convince Hana

188
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,333
to take me into the office
alone. This one's mine.

189
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,791
I think I'm gonna have to
take your place, Gakuto.

190
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,625
[GAKUTO]
Uh?

191
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,083
What are you talkin' about?

192
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,791
Well, you see. Hana's been
holding a grudge against me

193
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,416
for a while now. And she
has no plans to forgive.

194
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,250
It's gone too far for that. She
just made it very clear to me.

195
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,958
[JOE]
What the hell happened, man?

196
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,416
[KIYOSHI] For the sake of
Hana's honor, I can't tell you.

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,583
But, I'm gonna gamble on
exploiting her grudge.

198
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,416
If it works, I'll
get in that office.

199
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,833
You can't, it's
far too dangerous.

200
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,166
Alone, Hana would be able

201
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,166
to fully exact her
vengeance upon you!

202
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,291
Hana doesn't know how
to hold back, remember?

203
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,750
Forget expulsion, she's gonna
hospitalize your ass!

204
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,208
She's gonna go medieval on it.

205
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you sure, Kiyoshi?
You don't have to do this!

206
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,250
But there is not
another way, is there?

207
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,666
My life was spared once.
I give it freely.

208
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,500
[CHIYO] Say, can I
take that for you?

209
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,041
Thanks, Chiyo! You're
always so helpful!

210
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,000
[CHIYO] It's on my way back
to class. I don't mind!

211
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,500
Hello! I brought back
the dirty dishes!

212
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,875
Thanks a lot, darlin'.

213
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,291
Just leave 'em there.

214
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,083
"Come tonight, after supper."

215
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,541
Whoa. I could get in
trouble for that,

216
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,416
but Kiyoshi and his friends
all got set up by my sister.

217
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,541
I have to help them.

218
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,083
[ANZU]
Notes in the food?

219
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,875
So that's how you've
been able to communicate

220
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,666
with the boys in the
prison. Very clever.

221
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,125
It must've just fallen in!

222
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,625
[ANZU] You wanna help them
because they're the victims

223
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,666
of entrapment by the
Underground Student Council.

224
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,583
That's right. Who are you?

225
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,916
[ANZU] There's no need
to get all defensive.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,125
I'm on your side!

227
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,375
[gasps]

228
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,333
Hi there, my name's Anzu.

229
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,791
I wanna help you prevent
the boys getting expelled.

230
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,916
[MARI] Night has come, and
they haven't made a move.

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,708
Why? The scum went to the effort
to gain a one-day reprieve.

232
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,708
Going so far as to rope
in the Chairman to get it.

233
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,708
What could those
degenerates be planning?

234
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,750
[MARI]
Madam Vice President?

235
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,791
[MEIKO]
Yes, ma'am?

236
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,541
This is their last night.

237
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,458
The scum are certain
to make some move to

238
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,291
stop their expulsion.
We must remain vigilant.

239
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,958
[MEIKO]
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,208
[KIYOSHI]
You sure you're ready?

241
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,958
Do it as hard as you can.

242
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,750
Okay, man. As hard as I can.

243
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,666
[GAKUTO inhales]

244
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,791
What are you waiting
for? Just hurry it up.

245
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,333
[screams] Your timing is
spectacularly abominable!

246
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,208
Sorry! So, did it work?

247
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,916
[GAKUTO grunts]
It was to no avail!

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,958
There's not a single
drop of blood!

249
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,833
Did I not say "do it
as hard as you can"?

250
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,458
I wanted to get it
over with in one shot!

251
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,208
[JOE]
Gakuto.

252
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,458
Yes? What?

253
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,125
[screams]

254
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,875
Shut it! What's wrong?

255
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,333
[screams] Bleeding blood!

256
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,416
[HANA]
Back off!

257
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,833
Wait, this is all my fault!

258
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,708
We were arguing and I snapped.

259
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,916
But he needs first
aid immediately.

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,333
It doesn't really
look that bad.

261
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,333
Just rub some spit in
it or whatever. Later.

262
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,208
[KIYOSHI] Hey, wait! Can we at
least get a styptic pencil?

263
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,833
She's just gonna leave.
What do we do?

264
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,833
[GAKUTO] U-Uh.Dammit!
Damn it hell ass!

265
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,000
What a disaster. This is
all your fault, idiot!

266
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,958
You team up with the Lady Hana
so that she'll only help you,

267
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,166
then you dare bring
me to injury?!

268
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,500
[KIYOSHI] Chill, Gakuto
what the hell are--

269
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,000
[GAKUTO] You've got
some explaining to do!

270
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,625
I demand to know what happened
between you and Lady Hana!

271
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,541
[HANA] Try anything funny,
and I'll kill you. Twice.

272
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,791
All right. Guess I'll
start patching him up.

273
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,291
[HANA]
Hey, be my guest.

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,875
At least I don't
have to touch him.

275
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,333
[KIYOSHI]
So, uh. I'm still out, y'know.

276
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,791
I need to have a
little word with you,

277
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,916
so shut up and follow.

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,250
This is an outrage!

279
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,416
You really are colluding
to try and save Kiyoshi--!

280
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,916
[HANA]
Let's go.

281
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,625
[KIYOSHI] Thanks to
Gakuto's quick thinking,

282
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,583
everything seems to be
going according to plan.

283
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,791
[GAKUTO] Step One:
Sir Kiyoshi and Lady Hana

284
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,208
go to the corrections office.

285
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,625
Step Two...

286
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,791
[CHIYO] Tonight at eight
o'clock. The prison back door.

287
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,625
[MEIKO]
I can smell it in the air.

288
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,750
They make their move tonight!

289
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,875
[KIYOSHI gasping]

290
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,333
[HANA] At long last.
The two of us can be alone.

291
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,583
[KIYOSHI whimpers]

292
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,041
Kiyoshi. I better not find out

293
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,250
you told the others
what happened.

294
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,791
I haven't said a word!

295
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Now that we've cleared
that up, what are you

296
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,791
planning to do with
those scissors?

297
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,916
What am I going to do
with them, he asks?

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,250
I have a score to settle,

299
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,541
and just killing you
outright is far too simple.

300
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,541
You saw me peeing.
You peed on me!

301
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,125
And worse. Your grody mushroom
defiled my forbidden garden!

302
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,791
If you're religious,
say your prayers.

303
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,666
I'm going to make this
the most terrifying,

304
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,250
embarrassing
night of your life!

305
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,458
And I know exactly how we're
gonna start things off!

306
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,625
[KIYOSHI] Goodbye, mushroom!
It's been a fun ride!

307
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,166
[CHIYO] All right, Chiyo.
You can do this.

308
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,000
Kiyoshi and his friends
need your help!

309
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,750
[MEIKO] I was right.
They're making their move.

310
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,125
For the sake of the President,

311
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,875
it's time to nip their
little plan in the bud.

312
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,625
[KIYOSHI whimpers]

313
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,791
[HANA]
Here. Use this.

314
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,333
[KIYOSHI]
Uh...

315
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,166
You saw me pee,
now I watch you pee.

316
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,208
Better get cracking, or this
could be a long night.

317
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,416
[KIYOSHI] Oh, good. I thought
for sure this psychopath

318
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,583
was gonna use that
pair of scissors

319
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,666
to turn my dong into a ding!

320
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,125
I even cut off the
spout to make sure

321
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,541
you didn't start spilling
piss everywhere.

322
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,750
Now chop-chop, numbnuts!

323
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,208
Fine. Let's do this.

324
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,416
Why are you taking
your pants off?

325
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you, a five year old?

326
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,875
[KIYOSHI] I knew it! Hana isn't
used to seeing a dude's body.

327
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,333
One last layer. Don't punk out!

328
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,083
If I don't do this now,
then it's the end!

329
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,000
I refuse to let everyone's
sacrifices be for nothing!

330
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,583
That's right, dude.
This is your last shot!

331
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,583
Don't wuss out, whip it out!

332
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,041
The best defense
is a good offense!

333
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,333
[HANA gasps]

334
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,208
Let's rock n roll.

335
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,875
Now then, please hand
over that bottle

336
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,541
and we can get started.

337
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,125
That way I can pee in
it and you can watch.

338
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,958
[HANA] How. How can he be
acting so calm right now?

339
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,625
Why isn't he embarrassed?

340
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,333
[KIYOSHI] Yes! It's working!
I'm in total control!

341
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,833
[KIYOSHI]
What's wrong?

342
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,041
[KIYOSHI] I need to get to that
door. If I can just get it

343
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,666
unlocked, then part of the
mission will be a success!

344
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,708
Here, please hold it!
Then I can pee.

345
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,625
[HANA] Why the hell do
you need me to hold it?!

346
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,541
Isn't that something you can
do for yourself, weirdo?!

347
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,791
[KIYOSHI]
No, it isn't.

348
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,875
My right hand's between
my legs for guidance.

349
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,166
And my left hand rests
on my hip, for balance.

350
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,750
Otherwise, things can get messy.

351
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,083
For real. I'm talkin'
whiz spray everywhere.

352
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,416
[HANA] How can
this dumb fuck-face

353
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,958
be so relaxed about this?!

354
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,166
As soon as he drops trou, he
starts acting high and mighty?

355
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,833
Well I'm not backing down!

356
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,458
I'm a girl who gives as good
as she gets! That's right.

357
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,250
I can't let this
dipshit upstage me!

358
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,833
[HANA]
Now we're on even footing!

359
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,583
No, this turns
the tables on him!

360
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,458
[KIYOSHI] Holy shit-balls!
What's she doing now?

361
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,333
[HANA] That should put
this idiot in his place.

362
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,750
Two can play the "I'm not
wearing underwear" game!

363
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,750
[KIYOSHI] So, uh. Why are we
both pants-less to watch me pee?

364
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,083
[HANA]
Why am I pants-less?

365
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,625
Because it's my turn
to pee on you, genius.

366
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,875
[KIYOSHI gasps]
It's her turn to pee on me?!

367
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,125
Like, while I'm going?
Simultaneous?!

368
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,625
[HANA]
I'm in total control here.

369
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,500
Bathe in the
embarrassment!

370
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,416
[KIYOSHI] Damn it! This has
really spiraled out of control.

371
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,583
But one thing is certain.
No way in hell would I ever

372
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,000
have imagined I'd end up
in this kind of situation!

373
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,583
[KIYOSHI]
It's a battle of wills.

374
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,666
[HANA] Whoever has the
upper hand mentally

375
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,333
will be victorious!

376
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,875
[KIYOSHI] If I lose here,
then everything we've done

377
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,541
will be for nothing. Damned
if I do, damned if I don't.

378
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,375
And if that's the case,
I must push forward!

379
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,625
[HANA]
He's advancing?!

380
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,458
I thought removing my
panties would stop him!

381
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,166
[HANA] How can his spirit
not be broken yet?

382
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,625
Now. You get to watch me pee.

383
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,208
[gasps]

384
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,416
What's the matter, Hana?

385
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,916
Don't you want to finish this?

386
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,458
[groans]

387
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,208
You're too close, dumbass!

388
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,000
Who the hell do
you think you are?!

389
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,666
[KIYOSHI] All right! I got it
done! Step one is a success!

390
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,916
[KIYOSHI] Oh, no! No, no,
no. Don't look at it.

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,458
Close your eyes. Turn away!

392
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,041
It's Medusa! If I
keep staring at it,

393
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,333
my mushroom will turn to stone!

394
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,333
[NARRATOR] At long last, Kiyoshi
reverted to his natural state.

395
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,291
Up until now, he'd
successfully suppressed

396
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,875
his desires, driven by
a sense of purpose.

397
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,958
Like a photographer
in a battlefield.

398
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,208
Or a fireman amidst an inferno.

399
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,666
This sense of purpose
can overcome fear itself.

400
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,583
But now, with his
goal accomplished,

401
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,083
an overwhelming tidal
wave of shame and lust

402
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,583
came crashing over Kiyoshi.

403
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,291
[screams]

404
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,541
[KIYOSHI]
Oh, no. What's happening?

405
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,958
I can't close my eyes,
or look away!

406
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,333
Can it be that it's
already petrified me?

407
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,791
[HANA] You wanted to get
this over with, right?

408
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,291
Then you'd better start peeing.

409
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,791
[KIYOSHI]
I can't. It's turned to stone.

410
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,041
[HANA]
Stone?

411
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,458
[KIYOSHI] Oh yeah. It's
a petrified mushroom.

412
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:11,250
For sure. I'm afraid my
member is rock hard.

413
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,416
I don't understand what
you're saying. Talk sense.

414
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,000
Sorry. But now Little Kiyoshi's
standing at attention.

415
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,166
When a guy's business barrel
gets stiff like this,

416
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,041
peeing becomes
extremely difficult!

417
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,500
Why the hell has your
wang gotten hard,

418
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,875
you fucking perv-dog?!

419
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,750
I'm sorry, all right?! It's
from seeing your Medusa!

420
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,083
Aren't you even embarrassed?

421
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,750
Wagging your boner around
like that! You creep!

422
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,916
I'm awful. I'm a creep!

423
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,458
Right now, I'm too
stiff to take a leak.

424
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,666
But you go right ahead!

425
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,500
[HANA exhales]

426
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,458
[KIYOSHI gasps]

427
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:44,291
All right. I guess I will.

428
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,416
What do you think you're doing?!

429
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,291
[ALL gasp]

430
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,916
Resistance is futile!

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,916
What?!

432
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,125
It sounds like the
Vice President!

433
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,708
That can't be good.

434
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,208
If Chiyo is caught in the act,

435
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,791
then our plan will be
utterly fruitless!

436
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,791
[KIYOSHI]
Chiyo?

437
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,625
Hana! Is everything all right?

438
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,916
I caught an intruder.

439
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,166
The prisoners, no doubt,
are up to something!

440
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,166
But don't worry.
I'll be right there!

441
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,708
No! I'm okay!

442
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,583
Nothing out of the ordinary
going down here!

443
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,166
Really? You're sure?

444
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
[ANZU gasps]
Please, let me go!

445
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,958
[MEIKO]
Stop squirming! Come with me!

446
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,125
[ANZU]
Hey! No reason to get so rough!

447
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,375
[KIYOSHI]
That voice.

448
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,083
I know that voice! It's Anzu!

449
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,500
Please stop! It's a mistake!

450
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,708
I don't think so!

451
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,291
[KIYOSHI]
That's not Chiyo's voice!

452
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,083
I don't know what's going on,
but that means she's still safe!

453
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,041
[MEIKO] Hana! Open up. Have you
noticed any unusual activity?

454
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,000
Not at all! Everything is still
going super smoothly in here!

455
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,291
So smooth in fact,

456
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,416
you should get that
intruder out of here now!

457
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,291
It could all be a
ruse to get inside!

458
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,625
[KIYOSHI]
I just got it unlocked!

459
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,791
Yeah. That makes sense.
Okay, get moving.

460
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,291
I need to ask you
a few questions.

461
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,666
[CHIYO] Anzu! Thank you
for sacrificing yourself!

462
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,875
Now I'll have an easier
time getting around!

463
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,375
[ANZU] So. The boys asked you to
sneak into the prison tonight.

464
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,208
And you're actually
gonna help them out?

465
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,666
Yes. The Underground
Student Council

466
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,375
entrapped the boys so
they'd get kicked out

467
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,833
of school permanently! And I
don't think they deserve that!

468
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,416
Same here. But passing
notes is one thing.

469
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,875
Helping them could be dangerous.
Why would you risk it?

470
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,750
Are you trying to save
someone in particular?

471
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,541
[gasps] It's not
like that, okay?

472
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,833
I can't stand to see my sister
resort to these measures

473
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,791
just to get her way!
It's not fair!

474
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,791
I do have someone specific
I'm trying to save.

475
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,500
I want to help,
just tell me how!

476
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,083
[CHIYO]
I won't let you down, Anzu.

477
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,708
With the Vice President gone,

478
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,333
I can get closer to the prison!

479
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,250
[sighs]

480
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,208
[screams]

481
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,083
Hold on. What're you looking at?

482
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,083
I saw it. Sorry.

483
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,416
Your Medusa was staring
me square in the face.

484
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,750
[KIYOSHI]
Uh?

485
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:50,208
[HANA cries] Don't go
calling it Medusa, okay?

486
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,041
What gives you the right
to give it a nickname?

487
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,625
That's my bad.

488
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,708
[HANA] It's no fair!
It's always you!

489
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,666
Why does all this super
embarrassing stuff

490
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,125
keep happening to me, huh?

491
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,708
It's getting ridiculous!

492
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,000
You see me pee, then pee on me,
and if that's not bad enough,

493
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,875
your mushroom got
pressed against me!

494
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,625
[KIYOSHI] Yeah, you're right.
You've had a streak of bad luck.

495
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,375
[HANA] Nobody'd ever seen
me down there before now!

496
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,791
And of course it
ends up being you!

497
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,333
[cries]

498
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:21,500
I really am sorry. But this was
all a first for me as well.

499
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,416
And everything else
was purely accidental.

500
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,875
[HANA] Oh! So if it's
not on purpose,

501
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,083
then anything goes, huh?

502
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,250
No way, Hana, that's
not what I meant.

503
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,708
I'm sorry.

504
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,666
[HANA] Is "sorry" the only
thing you can freaking say?

505
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,666
If hitting me makes
you feel better,

506
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,125
then hit me as much
as you like--

507
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,625
[HANA screams]

508
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,208
[KIYOSHI]
Hold up! It hurts a lot more

509
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,416
than I thought it would!
Please make this the last one!

510
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,333
[HANA groans]

511
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,666
[KIYOSHI]
Wait... The hell...?

512
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,041
I have no idea what's
going on right now.

513
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,208
[laughs]

514
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,625
[KIYOSHI]
What are you laughing about?

515
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,958
Why did you just do that?

516
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,458
[HANA] Tell me, Kiyoshi.
Is there a girl you like?

517
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,083
[KIYOSHI]
Uh. Yeah, well, sorta.

518
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,583
Then I got you!

519
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,666
[KIYOSHI]
Huh?

520
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,166
[laughs] I just stole
your first kiss!

521
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,250
And you can never get a first
kiss back, no matter what!

522
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,291
So suck on that!

523
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,833
What makes you so
certain that was

524
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,041
my first kiss anyway?! I just
said I had someone I liked.

525
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,666
I never gave you my backstory!

526
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,041
Am I wrong?!

527
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,250
You're a virgin who's never
even held a girl's hand!

528
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,416
Don't try to pretend this
wasn't your first kiss!

529
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,083
I'm willing to bet
the girl you like

530
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,333
is the President's little
sister! Am I wrong?!

531
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,708
No, you're on the
money. She's--

532
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,125
Uh!

533
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,666
I'll do everything you want
her to do to you first.

534
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,375
You get it?
This is my revenge...

535
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,666
[KIYOSHI]
Next time on Prison School.

536
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,750
The final episode:
"Good Morning, Prison."
