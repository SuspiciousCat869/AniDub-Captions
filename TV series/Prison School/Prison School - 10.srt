1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,041
[KIYOSHI] We needed proof
we could show the Chairman

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,416
for a stay of expulsion.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,916
But our attempt to obtain
the DTO project files

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,750
resulted in failure.

5
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,958
In the end, we had resigned
ourselves to our fate.

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,000
Any desire we had
to fight back was long gone.

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,541
We weren't even angry,
or anxious, or sad.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,416
After everything
we'd been through,

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,541
our spirits were
completely broken.

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,083
[distant farting]

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,458
A new plan! As long as we're
cleaning the bathrooms,

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,000
we should answer
the call of nature first,

13
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,208
thus killing two birds
with one stone!

14
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,375
[KIYOSHI]
And then there was Gakuto.

15
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,333
[ANDRE] But then we have
to work in the stink.

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,333
[SHINGO groans]

17
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,625
[JOE]
Smells like a sweaty turd.

18
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,625
That's a masterful strategy.
Well done, Gakuto.

19
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,958
Come join me on
the throne, brave comrades!

20
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,125
Depending upon your diet,
it will be a show of solidarity.

21
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,208
[KIYOSHI] Gakuto's spirit
wasn't broken.

22
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,833
It had been
absolutely pulverized.

23
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,375
[MARI] It seems those fools
have finally been

24
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,166
cowed into accepting
their punishment.

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,375
They're so submissive now.

26
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,041
I'm actually a little
bit disappointed.

27
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,541
And by this time next week,
the school will finally

28
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,583
be free of their
disruptive presence.

29
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,625
Won't that be wonderful?

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,958
[MEIKO]
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,416
[GIRL STUDENT 10A]
The boys' food is ready.

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,875
[MEIKO]
Excellent.

33
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,875
[CHIYO sighs lightly]

34
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,333
[MEIKO]
It won't be long now.

35
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,666
The day after next, the
Chairman will affix his seal,

36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,708
and your time at this school
will have come to an end.

37
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,500
[MEIKO] They say it was Texas
that started the tradition

38
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,958
of allowing condemned prisoners
to customize their last meal.

39
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,583
If you think about it,
the day after tomorrow

40
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,500
is like your execution day.

41
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,125
So then,
tell me what you want.

42
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,583
[ANDRE]
Salisbury steak.

43
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,791
[KIYOSHI]
Steak-steak.

44
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,458
[SHINGO]
I gotta go with katsudon.

45
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,791
[JOE] I'll stick with
the normal menu.

46
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,500
Hey Brown Thunder.
What's yours?

47
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,375
Yours truly shall dine on
deep-fried grasshoppers

48
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,750
over sticky rice,
and don't skimp.

49
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,416
I expect only
the finest insects!

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,666
[MEIKO]
Very well. Approved.

51
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,291
[BOYS]
Approved?

52
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,708
Oh, Madam?

53
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,875
I hope you don't mind, but I'd
like to change my order.

54
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,375
[MEIKO]
To what?

55
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,041
I'll take a whipping from your
riding crop for starters.

56
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,541
For the main dish,
a flurry of kicks

57
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,583
mixed with groin stomping,
and lastly, for dessert,

58
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,958
I want you to spit
in my face and tell me

59
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
how naughty I've been.

60
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,166
[MEIKO] Anything other than
food is out of the question.

61
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,416
Denied.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,333
[KIYOSHI] Two more days,
then we're out of here.

63
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,208
[CHIYO]
"It's Chiyo. How are you?

64
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,916
Stupid question,
I'm sure you're miserable.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,833
If you're able to write a reply,

66
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,791
leave a little bit
of bread on your tray.

67
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,750
and try to stuff
your message inside it."

68
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,416
[KIYOSHI] I will, Chiyo.
What an awesome girl!

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,708
Dammit, I don't wanna
split up with her!

70
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,541
What's this? Comrades!

71
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,208
Kiyoshi has received an
illicit missive from a lady!

72
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,666
So? Doesn't matter now.

73
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,000
[JOE coughs]

74
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,000
[KIYOSHI] He's right.
This is all over, anyway.

75
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,500
Over? How right you are,
my good man.

76
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,250
Perhaps, using this method,
we'll nullify

77
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,875
our sentence
once and for all.

78
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,750
[BOYS gasp]

79
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,916
Our means of escape
is right here.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,750
Wait, what're you saying?

81
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,208
Have you only been
pretending to go insane?

82
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,500
[GAKUTO chuckles]

83
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,583
You mean you've been
plotting this whole time?

84
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,458
Hell yeah!

85
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,583
[GAKUTO chuckles]

86
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,500
Hurry up and tell us
your master plan!

87
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,166
We'll camouflage ourselves
with the leftover food,

88
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,583
and escape unseen!

89
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,083
Some soup for me. You mix
in with the breadcrumbs!

90
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,750
Join me, brothers!
We'll climb atop

91
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,541
scallion stallions,
and ride away from this

92
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,708
oppressive hell-hole!

93
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,500
[groans]

94
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,625
[KIYOSHI] Great plan,
Gakuto. Incredible.

95
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,166
[SHINGO]
Just brilliant.

96
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,583
Two days,
and then he's gone.

97
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,166
[KIYOSHI]
Dear Chiyo. Thank you.

98
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,000
And now, farewell.

99
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,875
Kiyoshi, stay strong.

100
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,083
We'll figure something out.
It can't end like this.

101
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,375
[MEIKO panting]

102
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,375
[yells]

103
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,833
[CHIYO]
Huh?

104
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,750
[MEIKO] Each requested item
cooked to perfection.

105
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,000
Enjoy your last meal.

106
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,291
[SHINGO]
Damn, that smells good!

107
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,166
[hollers] I, myself,
have chosen the most

108
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,833
scrumptious dinner
of them all!

109
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,000
For real though.

110
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,458
Are you seriously
gonna eat that?

111
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,791
Snap out of it, bro.
They're freakin' bugs!

112
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,166
[JOE] You really
shouldn't do it, dude.

113
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,458
[ANDRE] Don't you
have a weak tummy?

114
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,458
Shut up, fools! The
grasshoppers are all mine!

115
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,416
Wait. It's so clear to me now.

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,833
You're trying to take away my
delicious dinner, aren't you?

117
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,250
Well so be it.

118
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,875
Have at thee,
ye curséd scalawags!

119
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,041
Knock it off, geek!

120
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,208
[groans]

121
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,041
[MEIKO]
Shut up and eat!

122
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,166
[KIYOSHI] I've never had
meat this tender before.

123
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,125
It looks so good.

124
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,583
[JOE]
I know, mine's perfect!

125
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,875
[SHINGO] Well, at least
our last night here

126
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,875
isn't gonna suck.

127
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,416
Another missive without
promise for a future?

128
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,750
Goodness gracious, Kiyoshi!

129
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,041
Is sex the only thing
on your lewd mind?

130
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,500
[retching]

131
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,791
Dude, are you okay?

132
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,125
The hell were those
grasshoppers loaded with?

133
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,625
An epiphany!
From on high!

134
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,125
A means of escape has struck
me like a bolt of lightning!

135
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,666
We don't have any
grasshopper-sized saddles.

136
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,375
[GAKUTO] There's no time
for ludicrous musings.

137
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,916
Now hurry up
and finish your meals!

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,708
[retching]

139
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,291
What sort of disgusting
meal have they given me?

140
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,375
[JOE] Fried grasshoppers
over rice, dude?

141
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,625
Indeed! But why
serve them to me?

142
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,750
Have I not undergone
enough torture?

143
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,041
What the hell
are you going on about?

144
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,666
That's what you ordered
for your last meal, bro.

145
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,500
[GAKUTO] I have no
recollection of those events!

146
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,333
Wait, what?
So does that mean.

147
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,916
You're back to sort-of normal?

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
What is normal?

149
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,500
Certainly not this
six-legged eccentric fare!

150
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,708
Forget that nonsense!

151
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,833
Gakuto, you've come up
with a plan, right?

152
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,750
Yes. Sir Kiyoshi, when I
espied your note from Chiyo,

153
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,083
a thought occurred to me.

154
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,791
One final gambit
we must now employ.

155
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,125
[MARI] Are you working on
something, Mister Chairman?

156
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,458
[grumbles] Some miscellaneous
pieces of business

157
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,250
needed seeing to. So.

158
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,250
Of course. Working hard.

159
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,416
Very hard, yes!

160
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
Best of luck with that.

161
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,625
Just a reminder, those scumbag
boys will be expelled tomorrow.

162
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,791
I ask you not to delay
in affixing your seal

163
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,125
to the documents.

164
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,875
[CHAIRMAN] So the day has
finally come. Very well.

165
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,000
Furthermore, I ask you
to refrain from seeing to

166
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,541
"miscellaneous pieces
of business" at school.

167
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,541
It's beyond disgusting.
Please excuse me.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,125
[door squeaks, thuds]

169
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,375
[CHAIRMAN] Hmmm.
[door squeaks, thuds]

170
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,416
[gasps]

171
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,583
I should probably invest
in some blinds soon!

172
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,541
[GAKUTO] And that's
my plan in a nutshell.

173
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,416
Come tomorrow, we shall
set it in motion, my brothers.

174
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,791
[chuckles]

175
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,458
It would seem my plan's
brilliance is so astounding,

176
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,125
it has rendered
the lot of you speechless!

177
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

178
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,333
[GAKUTO]
Hm?

179
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,666
Look, man. Any way you
cut it, it's still crazy.

180
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,500
No matter the insanity,
we must keep trying!

181
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,500
There's no more time!

182
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,750
We're getting
expelled tomorrow!

183
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,583
Uh! Tomorrow?
That much time

184
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,333
can't possibly have elapsed!

185
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,666
What are we to do?

186
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,375
However you slice it,
my proposal needs

187
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,958
at least two more days to work!

188
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,291
There's nothing
left to do, bro.

189
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,875
We're outta time.

190
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,958
If we are indeed
to be expelled tomorrow,

191
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,666
then this plan hasn't a chance.

192
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,833
Well. I hope you
enjoyed your meals.

193
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,666
There's some paper work you
germ-farms need to fill out.

194
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,958
Your withdrawal requests.

195
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,166
[BOYS gasp]

196
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,208
It's funny. I doubt that
school life will be

197
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,458
quite as lively once the five
of you are out of here.

198
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,458
[KIYOSHI] Is it just me,
or does it almost sound like

199
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,791
she's going to miss us
when we're gone?

200
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,875
And good riddance,
in my opinion.

201
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,333
[gasps]

202
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,166
[GAKUTO] Her body
quivers with repression.

203
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,708
I would have never guessed
she'd be so sentimental.

204
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,166
Thou art not alone in
thy tears, your ladyship,

205
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,291
we too shall never forget
the memories forged

206
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,583
during the last several weeks...

207
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,083
[MEIKO] Dip-shit!
You dare to waste the food

208
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,958
I worked so hard to prepare!

209
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,291
[yells]

210
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,666
Now, I believe
you turd-cutters

211
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,416
have paperwork to complete.

212
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,375
[KIYOSHI] Guess I read
that situation wrong.

213
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,250
So much for sympathy!

214
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,416
[GAKUTO groans]

215
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,750
How's your
head feel, Gakuto?

216
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,041
If I'm being honest,
not so good, actually.

217
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,541
No time for self-pity.

218
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,000
I say, let's get the gears
turning on your plan!

219
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,166
It's impossible. Put simply,
yours truly's plan

220
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,916
needs more time
than we have been given.

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,333
We'll come up with something.

222
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,916
Yeah? Like what, man?

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,041
We're kinda out of
options here.

224
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,416
We will simply write a plea
directly to the Chairman!

225
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,416
[ANDRE]
To the Chairman?

226
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,916
That's right.

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,958
We'll write an appeal and
stick it on one of our forms.

228
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,583
Then we can speak to him
in person about this

229
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,291
"DTO" trap set by the
Underground Student Council.

230
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,916
[GAKUTO] Of course! That could
buy us a couple days

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,125
while the Chairman
conducts an investigation.

232
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,208
A couple extra days
would come in handy.

233
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,625
Which would give us
enough time to follow

234
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,708
Gakuto's plan, and track
down hard evidence of DTO!

235
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,000
Wise up. We'll just
get shot down again.

236
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,625
[KIYOSHI] Don't think
like that, Shingo!

237
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,208
We can't accept getting kicked
out of school lying down!

238
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,458
Not until we've
made it to summer.

239
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,666
Until the wet t-shirt contest.

240
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,750
When you talk about
giving up, all I hear is

241
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,375
"I don't want to see nipples
through transparent,

242
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,750
clingy clothing!"

243
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,291
But I do, man!

244
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,208
I want it more than
anything in the world!

245
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,500
What'd you say?
Sound off like you got a pair!

246
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,291
I wanna see 'em!
Perky nips poking through

247
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,958
wet t-shirts
like nature intended!

248
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,958
Like pencil erasers
from heaven!

249
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,791
[KIYOSHI] I know. That's why
we've gotta keep the faith, man.

250
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,083
[indistinctive chatter]

251
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,416
[HANA]
Hm. How strange.

252
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,208
It feels like I've
forgotten something.

253
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,500
[gasps]

254
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,541
That one day.
In the nurse's office.

255
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,125
What was it? And why
did I think back to it

256
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,791
when I saw these mushrooms?

257
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,708
Have you bitches
filled out those forms yet?

258
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,666
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,958
[MEIKO]
What's this shit?

260
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,875
It's for the Chairman. Madam.

261
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,583
You wrote a fucking appeal?

262
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,416
[KIYOSHI] I know it
won't do us any good,

263
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,333
but we wanted to send this note
as a sort of official apology.

264
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,750
Please, Madam. Give us
one last shot at dignity!

265
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,000
[MEIKO] Ha! How adorable.
I'll put it on the fridge.

266
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,875
All right.
I'll take it to him.

267
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,000
[BOYS] We are
forever in your debt!

268
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:05,083
[MEIKO grunts]

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,166
It's late.

270
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,666
[GAKUTO] I'm afraid our
breakfast isn't coming.

271
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,208
And yet hunger isn't the only
reaction taking place in my gut.

272
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,666
Think he'll come down here?

273
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,416
Assuming Miss Ball-breaker
gave him the note

274
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,625
in the first place.

275
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,041
I really don't think
this is gonna work guys.

276
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,083
We are gonna be fine!
Even if it is just blind hope!

277
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,416
Then why hasn't the
Chairman dragged his ass

278
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
down here yet?

279
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,750
No clue.

280
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,708
[KIYOSHI] It isn't him.
Does that mean?

281
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,625
As previously scheduled,
your expulsions

282
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,375
become official as of today.

283
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,250
Form a line and follow me.

284
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,208
You are hereby ordered
to return to the dorms

285
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,958
and retrieve any personal
effects before you leave.

286
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,666
This is your
last work detail.

287
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,541
Erase any sign of your presence.
I don't want so much as

288
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,958
a single hair to get left
behind by you dumb pricks.

289
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,000
[GAKUTO]
It can't be!

290
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,541
How could you be so cruel,
Madam Vice President?

291
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,041
Tearing up our appeal
so callously?

292
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,250
Deceiver! You gave us
your word of honor!

293
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,208
The time for talking is over.
Now shut up and walk.

294
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,541
[HANA] Today's the day those
idiots get kicked out.

295
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,833
I guess I won't
get my payback

296
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,041
on that dumbass
Kiyoshi after all.

297
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,041
Whatever, I'll just bash him
in the stomach real hard

298
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,666
before he leaves
school for good.

299
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,500
That's weird.
This mushroom is making me

300
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,000
think of passing out
in the nurse's office too.

301
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,125
But why?

302
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,666
[HANA gasps]

303
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,083
Almost. Got it.

304
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,541
[MARI] This is the beginning
of the end for you.

305
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,166
I hope you enjoyed
your last meal

306
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,416
and it gave you
some sense of closure.

307
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,750
Any final words
from the condemned?

308
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,500
[KIYOSHI]
Hmph.

309
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,625
[CHAIRMAN] Any last words should
be directed towards me,

310
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,375
shouldn't they?
It's part of my job.

311
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,833
Agreed?

312
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:10,916
Hello, Father.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,958
What the hell
is he doing here?

314
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,291
I know for a fact
he didn't get that note!

315
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,791
[MEIKO gasps]
[KIYOSHI chuckles]

316
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,958
[MEIKO]
What did you snot-nachos do?

317
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,416
[CHAIRMAN] Come. Let's
head back to the prison.

318
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,666
I need to have
a word with you boys.

319
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,291
I could go for a hot
cup of tea. Please!

320
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,708
[ANDRE]
Oh! Yes sir.

321
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,958
So what made
the Chairman want to

322
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,083
come down to our dungeon?

323
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,708
[GAKUTO] I haven't
the foggiest notion.

324
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,416
The Vice President ripped our
appeal letter into pieces.

325
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,958
[MEIKO]
Sneaky little rats.

326
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,000
I ripped up their little letter,
but it still got through.

327
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,791
--A decoy.
--A decoy?

328
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,333
Yep. I wrote the legit
appeal on my

329
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,916
withdrawal request form.
Then made a dummy note.

330
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,666
That's what got ripped up.

331
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,750
I figured she'd get rid
of the obvious note,

332
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,458
and that it would
go to her head.

333
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,958
Never thinking
to check the contents

334
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,000
of the requests themselves.

335
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,708
Positively genius!
Much akin to the

336
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,625
clever stratagem
employed by the brilliant

337
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,000
and shrewd Pang Tong during
the Battle of Red Cliffs!

338
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,958
[KIYOSHI] I'll have to take your
word for it on that one, man.

339
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,500
Pray tell, what did you
write on your form

340
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,500
to catch his eye?

341
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,708
Oh. Uh.

342
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,833
I came here because
I got your message.

343
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,208
Before we start,
let's get one thing straight.

344
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,666
I've made some mistakes,

345
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,083
but kissing a blackmailer's
ass wasn't one, boy!

346
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,541
[BOYS]
Blackmail?

347
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,291
[KIYOSHI] Must be something
he's been trying to hide.

348
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,000
Guess I picked
the right hot button.

349
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,833
I had to go with what I
witnessed on the other side

350
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,166
of the wall if I really
wanted to get his attention.

351
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,291
It's the trump card I've been
saving to persuade

352
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,208
the Chairman to
postpone our expulsion!

353
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,291
Damn it. What're they
talking about in there?

354
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,875
[gasps]
Hana?

355
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,583
Where is he?
Where's that bastard, Kiyoshi?

356
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,625
Dickhead!

357
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,208
[KIYOSHI]
You've got it wrong.

358
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,125
I only mentioned that to make
sure we got this conversation.

359
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,000
The fact of the matter is
the USC set us up.

360
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,458
[CHAIRMAN] Yes. I've heard
this all before.

361
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,375
But you have no credible
evidence to verify

362
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,416
this accusation, do you?

363
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,333
[KIYOSHI]
Not at the moment, no.

364
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
One more week!

365
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,166
No, three more days should give
us enough time to find proof!

366
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,000
[CHAIRMAN] I understand.
You want more time

367
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,708
to gather evidence and
build a case for yourselves.

368
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,958
And to that end,
you need to have

369
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,916
your expulsions
postponed, correct?

370
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,416
[CHAIRMAN] Well then.
Between booties and breasts,

371
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,333
which do you prefer? Speak.

372
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,125
Who, me?
Which do I prefer?

373
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,625
Buttocks or breasts. Well?

374
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,000
Given the choice,
yours truly

375
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,750
would have to go with boobs--

376
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,166
Hold on a second guys.

377
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,333
Why don't you sit back
while I field his question?

378
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,916
Go right ahead.

379
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,666
[KIYOSHI] They don't
know it, but the Chairman's

380
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,250
putting us to a test!

381
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,708
I have to remember!
Which one was it?

382
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,583
Evita! Argentina!

383
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,041
[KIYOSHI gasps]
Booties are what we love!

384
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,250
Ha! You have
answered wisely.

385
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,541
[BOYS gasp]

386
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,833
[CHAIRMAN] Allow me
to share with you a motto

387
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,875
I've believed in
throughout my life.

388
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,541
"Nobody who is
an ass-man can be all bad."

389
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,750
Agreed?

390
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,333
[KIYOSHI]
Freakin' jackpot!

391
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,833
So then, does that
mean you'll postpone

392
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,833
our expulsions, honorable
Master Chairman?

393
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,833
No, no. I cannot
in good conscience

394
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,458
give my approval yet. After all,
your claims to be ass-men

395
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,083
could have been disingenuous
scheming, who knows?

396
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,916
Why did you choose butts?

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,375
Well? A true ass-man
would already know

398
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,875
the answer to this riddle.

399
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,750
Breasts are great fun, so why
did you pick asses? Speak.

400
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,500
[KIYOSHI] Could answering
this one question determine

401
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,000
the course of
the rest of our lives?

402
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,791
Of course! Now I see.

403
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,875
This question's like
the riddle of the Sphinx!

404
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,208
What has four legs
in the morning,

405
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,333
two legs at noon,
and three legs in the evening?

406
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,708
That's the way the riddle goes,
am I right? Gakuto?

407
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,875
Indeed. And according
to the legend,

408
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,041
those who answered
the question incorrectly

409
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,208
got killed and eaten by the
giant lion-pharaoh monstrosity!

410
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,625
And our answer's gonna kind
of determine the same thing.

411
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,041
Answer wrong,
and we're expelled!

412
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,791
[KIYOSHI] But then,
on the other hand,

413
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,041
if we answer the question right,
we'll be rewarded with survival!

414
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,041
Ah!

415
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,750
Way to stay positive, Kiyoshi!

416
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,833
We could change everything
with a right answer!

417
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,291
If we all put
our heads together,

418
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,583
we'll figure
this out in no time!

419
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,916
[CHAIRMAN]
I'm afraid not.

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,958
[BOYS gasp]

421
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,583
No deliberation.

422
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,500
When discussing
one's personal tastes,

423
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,750
common-denominator answers are
devoid of any deeper meaning.

424
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,791
What is it about booties that
enflames your inner desire?

425
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,333
The booties demand
you speak for them. Obey.

426
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,083
Kiyoshi, you're the one
who said you liked butts.

427
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:22,041
So you'll be the one
to answer. Understood?

428
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,458
[MEIKO]
Take it easy, Hana!

429
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,666
[HANA] Move it! Let me
cut that creep to bits!

430
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,250
No way! You aren't going
anywhere with that knife!

431
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,666
What's gotten into you, anyway?

432
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,750
Nothing got in!

433
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,833
But it got way
too close for comfort!

434
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,375
Don't you see? His and my--

435
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,750
We were so close.

436
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,291
I'll kill that jerk!

437
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,041
I'll kill the shit out of him,
and then I'll off myself!

438
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,583
[MEIKO] I can't allow Hana
to go on like this.

439
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,375
The Underground Student
Council can't lose face

440
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,166
in front of the Student Body!

441
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,625
[HANA gasps]

442
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:50,958
Ugh!

443
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,541
[MEIKO]
Hana. Please forgive me.

444
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,416
Now then.

445
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,416
[KIYOSHI] It's no use!
I can't come up with anything!

446
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,666
I mean. I personally like
tits more than ass,

447
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,208
if I'm being honest.

448
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,666
[KIYOSHI] I've got a million
things to say about gazongas.

449
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,666
They have nipples!
And make milk!

450
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,666
And are way
squishier than butts!

451
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,458
Uh! It's hopeless! I keep
trying, but I can't think of

452
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,708
a single reason why butts
are better than boobs!

453
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,500
Do you know the answer
that the hero Oedipus

454
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,291
gave to solve the Sphinx's
riddle in the end?

455
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,916
The answer is "man."

456
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,041
First man learns
to crawl on all fours,

457
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,041
then he stands
unaided on two legs.

458
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,625
and once old, uses a cane
making three legs!

459
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,958
Sir Kiyoshi, you must
become our own Oedipal hero

460
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,166
in our time of need!

461
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,875
Gakuto. No offense,
but could you not talk?

462
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,166
Your wealth of knowledge
is only going to distract me.

463
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,583
Ah! Not my intention!

464
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,875
[KIYOSHI] Hold on. Maybe I'm
just over thinking it.

465
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,000
Of course! There's no logic
behind preference!

466
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,666
Just like when the
mountain climber was asked

467
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,333
why he climbed
the mountain and he said

468
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,041
"Because the mountain
was there."

469
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,166
The same could be said
about butts, couldn't it?

470
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,875
Perhaps you need
a little hint to push you

471
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,541
in the right direction, fine.

472
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,583
In my travels, I've asked
this same question

473
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,500
to people from
all different cultures.

474
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,958
And I've been given
disappointing answers by most.

475
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,000
The worst answer being
"there's no logic behind

476
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,291
one's preference." Bull.

477
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,125
"No reason."
"C'est la vie."

478
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,541
And of course, the tired,
George Mallory-inspired

479
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,541
"Because the butt
is there" sound bite.

480
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,208
But if you say
you prefer butts without

481
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,083
a reason behind it, you
proclaim your own phony-ness.

482
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,666
You've had plenty of time
to justify your decision.

483
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,833
I think it's time you shared
your answer. Don't you?

484
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:25,166
[KIYOSHI] It's no use. I got
nothing. Drawing a blank!

485
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,500
[KIYOSHI] Butt cheeks? The hell
is a butt doing in the window?

486
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,625
Wait, that's no butt!
Those are...

487
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,958
Boobs! The Vice President's
giant ass-like boobs!

488
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,833
[MEIKO] What are those chump-ass
losers talking about in there?

489
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,666
[KIYOSHI] They're so similar.
Part of human development.

490
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,625
The evolution of the species.
They're both round.

491
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,291
Boobs and butts.
Butts and boobs.

492
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,750
Butts. Boobs!

493
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,416
[KIYOSHI]
Mankind.

494
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,458
When the first men
walked on all fours,

495
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,500
what was right in their
faces but the posterior!

496
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,583
Then, when mankind started
walking on two legs,

497
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,250
we stopped having
round butts in our faces

498
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,583
all day every day
and to take their place

499
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:17,375
something new appeared in
front of our faces. Titties!

500
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,416
Women's breasts continued
growing throughout the ages,

501
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,416
taking the place of the butt
as a carnal focus!

502
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,166
But the original source
of desire was the ba-donk.

503
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,041
Boobs are
a substitute, frankly!

504
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,166
Tits are merely a pale
imitation trying to take glory

505
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,375
from the buttocks! If asked
what I'd rather have,

506
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,291
a copy or the original,
I would choose

507
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,791
the original, naturally!

508
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,458
Boobs have evolved
to jut out in front of us

509
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,541
as a greeting to the world.
While the buttocks remain

510
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,250
hidden around the back
waiting their turn,

511
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,625
coyly drawing attention,
in true erotic grace--

512
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,458
That's enough.

513
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,791
You have proven to me,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

514
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,958
that you are a bona fide
ass-man, Kiyoshi.

515
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,125
A well thought out answer,
kindred spirit of mine.

516
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,333
[BOYS gasp]

517
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,958
Master Chairman,
does that mean?

518
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,458
[CHAIRMAN] Like I said,
nobody who is an ass-man

519
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,791
can be all bad.
Expulsion postponed, now!

520
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,541
Uh. What the hell?

521
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,250
[CHAIRMAN] However,
the maximum reprieve 

522
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,208
I can grant you
is a single day. Sorry.

523
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,083
But that is much
too brief, your honor!

524
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,291
Couldn't we have three?

525
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,208
If a man is earnest,
it is possible for him

526
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,041
to accomplish great tasks
in a single day. Ciao.

527
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,833
You've postponed
their expulsion, Chairman.

528
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,291
Explain yourself!

529
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,041
I have come to the decision
that there is enough here

530
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,708
to question
whether their expulsion

531
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,750
is actually justified or not.

532
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,750
Their expulsion's
a matter of policy!

533
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,208
What's your angle?

534
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,791
[CHAIRMAN] Madam President.
It's unbecoming of someone

535
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,416
in your position to callously
challenge an educator!

536
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,750
Or are you implying that
granting a one-day extension

537
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,541
might be problematic
for you? That it?

538
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,666
[grunts]

539
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,000
I think I'll
take my leave, now.

540
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,375
Well then.
Thank you very much.

541
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,875
Your help was much appreciated,
Madam Vice President.

542
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,250
Huh?

543
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,500
We somehow managed to
get through that unscathed.

544
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,416
But all we got is
a one day extension?

545
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,125
This is no time to mope.

546
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,375
Up until that meeting,
we were on our way

547
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,791
to the chopping block!

548
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,750
But from the depths
of the darkness,

549
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,833
came a light at
the end of the tunnel.

550
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,416
And though it appears
small from where we stand,

551
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,458
it is a beacon that will
guide us out of this pit!

552
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,958
That was beautiful.

553
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,291
Kiyoshi's right, man.

554
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,708
I'm in it to win it.

555
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,708
We just have to make it
beyond the light.

556
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,916
That's where our
future lies. And also...

557
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,958
[BOYS]
The wet t-shirt contest!

558
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,583
There's no more time
for self-pity!

559
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,791
[BOYS]
Hm!

560
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,208
Now, my brothers,
let us set yours truly's

561
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,541
final plan into motion,
without further delay!

562
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,375
And we shall make sure
it succeeds!

563
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,750
[BOYS]
Yeah!

564
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,541
[MARI] How did they get
their punishment postponed?

565
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,708
And why did Kiyoshi thank you
after the Chairman left?

566
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,875
[MEIKO]
I don't know, Madam.

567
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,416
Not good enough.
You were listening in

568
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,333
on what they were saying
in there, weren't you?

569
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,375
Well, Ma'am.
I heard their conversation,

570
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,583
but was completely lost.
They were--

571
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,250
I only heard them
talk about admiring butts.

572
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,875
In any case,
it's just one more day

573
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,500
of keeping a close
eye on them right?

574
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,333
[HANA] Madam President.
Don't worry.

575
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,833
Just let me handle
the boys' final day.

576
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,541
I won't let those
mouth-breathers

577
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,416
get away with anything.

578
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,708
[KIYOSHI] Next time,
on Prison School:

579
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,458
"Eryngii Brockovich."
