1
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:17,868
You wanted to see me, Professor?

2
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,695
Ah. Come in, Jayce.

3
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:21,603
Can you believe it?

4
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:24,728
Our city is about to turn 200 years old.

5
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:26,876
A bicentennial.

6
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,872
It's shaping up to be an amazing Progress Day.

7
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,754
"Stanwick Padidly"? Huh, I don't know much about him.

8
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:44,091
Everything he built either
exploded, melted, or toppled over.

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,639
And yet, here he stands.

10
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,904
Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside

11
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,559
and focused on something far more important.

12
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,159
Our future.

13
00:00:55,854 --> 00:01:01,197
He realized nothing he could accomplish could
compare to the contributions of his students.

14
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:02,531
I had no idea.

15
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,281
That was his sacrifice.

16
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:09,229
A dear friend.

17
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:13,642
The Council has recommended you
give the Progress Day speech this year.

18
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:17,292
What… But you always give that speech.

19
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,301
I… I could never take your place.

20
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,236
I agree with them.

21
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,590
Your Hexgates have done wonders for our city.

22
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:29,646
Brought scholars from distant lands.
Reignited passions in arts and science.

23
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,253
You deserve this honor.

24
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,984
I… I will do my best to make Piltover proud, Professor.

25
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:43,436
It's short notice, I know, but perhaps there's
something in the lab you might be able to share?

26
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,898
People love a grand reveal.

27
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:49,174
Viktor and I have just the
thing. The next chapter of Hextech.

28
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:51,236
Come to the lab this afternoon, I'll show you.

29
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:52,776
I'll look forward to it.

30
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,719
You certainly have something to live up to, my boy.

31
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,146
Happy Progress Day. Happy Progress Day.

32
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:21,790
Our most famous protégé, Jayce Talis.

33
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,634
The visionary behind the Hexgates,

34
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:28,737
a beacon of trade and prosperity
for our great City of Progress.

35
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:29,590
Excuse me.

36
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,583
Sorry, sorry. Yeah. Excuse me.

37
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,739
He's a very busy man.

38
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,022
Cait.

39
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,308
Serves you right.

40
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:48,040
You still avoiding her?

41
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,104
I'm working.

42
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:50,676
Oh, I can see that.

43
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,165
I mean, there's so much crime to
thwart outside your family's tent.

44
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,744
I can only imagine the strings
she pulled to have me posted here.

45
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,277
It's your fault really,

46
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:02,531
for not following her into a
career "more befitting your station."

47
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:06,077
She'd do anything to keep me from seeing the real world.

48
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,486
Well, at least you'll have front-row seats to the speech.

49
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:10,371
Speech?

50
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:13,106
Mm-hmm. I'm giving the big address tonight.

51
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:16,309
Hmm. We really have descended to anarchy.

52
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:18,511
Have fun herding the drunkards.

53
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,395
Happy Progress Day.

54
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,229
Uh, shipping manifest?

55
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,206
From your friend. Downtown.

56
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:26,828
Let's go!

57
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,508
Ah, shit. The Firelights.

58
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,384
We have five minutes till they're out of there.

59
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,404
You ever seen this much Shimmer before?

60
00:06:57,452 --> 00:07:01,454
They're expanding. Check for more below. Burn it all.

61
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,645
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Open up.

62
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,400
Open the door.

63
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,764
Oh, no. She's here.

64
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:09,979
What the…

65
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:39,249
Hi.

66
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:14,627
Vi?

67
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:16,949
I can't lose you.

68
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,581
Why did you leave me?

69
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,871
Because you're a jinx.

70
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,384
I want to fight.

71
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:31,442
You're not ready.

72
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:37,669
No.

73
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,209
You were supposed to guard the cargo.

74
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:54,654
You think he will approve?

75
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:59,479
Heimerdinger believes science should be
used to improve lives as much as we do.

76
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,157
We just need to show him it's safe.

77
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,486
And what about the Council?

78
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,923
We stabilized the crystal like they asked.

79
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,097
Built the Hexgates like they asked.

80
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:13,282
It's our turn to decide the future of Hextech.

81
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:17,778
Professor. I'm so glad you could make it.

82
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:21,804
Wouldn't miss it for the world, my
boy. What do we have on the docket?

83
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,078
It all began with this.

84
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:32,992
A crystal of magical energy, too volatile
to be handled outside our workshops.

85
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:36,537
Hextech was supposed to bring
magic into the life of the common man.

86
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,625
And now, it finally can.

87
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:43,377
A Hextech Gemstone.

88
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:55,968
Wait.

89
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,546
Holy sprockets.

90
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,592
We've found a means to fortify the crystals.

91
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:12,437
This new version is stable and absolutely safe.

92
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:19,516
We present to you the next chapter of Hextech.

93
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,245
We can now design portable devices.

94
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:24,152
Oh…

95
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,992
The Gemstone can power virtually anything.

96
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,432
The Atlas Gauntlets.

97
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:56,684
The mining colonies in the fissures
can work faster and without fatigue.

98
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:00,112
The Hex Claw.

99
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,735
A mechanical arm, equipped with a powerful ray of light.

100
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:17,372
Imagine what our artificers could do with such a device.

101
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:21,229
I want Hextech to be a tool for us to build a new world.

102
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,454
And now, it's finally possible.

103
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:31,855
Anyway, this is our presentation.

104
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:36,463
Quite amazing, gentlemen. You should be very proud.

105
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:41,023
Obviously, there are a few kinks to
iron out and screws to be tightened,

106
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:45,371
but give it a decade of careful
research, and it will be ready.

107
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:46,037
A decade?

108
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:50,536
Oh, don't worry, my boy. It zips
past you in the blink of an eye.

109
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,191
With respect, Professor.

110
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,196
We can be improving lives with Hextech now.

111
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,865
A breakthrough like this takes time, Viktor.

112
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:01,245
Putting that kind of power into
everyone's hands is dangerous.

113
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:06,374
Keep at it and I'm sure you will discover
a way to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

114
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:23,584
There must've been four, five of
them. I don't know how they got inside.

115
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,637
You're from the undercity.

116
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,417
I didn't do anything. She's crazy.

117
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,604
Easy.

118
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:50,180
She shot me.

119
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,673
Who shot you? Who were you working for?

120
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,513
I can't. He'll kill me.

121
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:56,160
Who?

122
00:15:57,882 --> 00:15:59,095
I can protect you.

123
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:02,961
Caitlyn Kiramman, why does that not surprise me?

124
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,816
Interfering in an investigation, again.

125
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:08,751
You're supposed to be guarding your mother's tent.

126
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,919
I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need
it. And clearly, this takes priority.

127
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:15,924
I realize you're used to getting your way, Kiramman,

128
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,939
but we have a chain of command for a reason.

129
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,446
I understand.

130
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,480
But there's more going on here than just the smuggling.

131
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:23,768
If I could just question him I could...

132
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:24,913
I'll take it from here.

133
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,129
Since you're looking for more work,

134
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,331
you can take the graveyard shift tonight at the fair.

135
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,290
Yes, sir.

136
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:32,361
Good.

137
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,716
I want this one on a boat to Stillwater prison.

138
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,490
Yes, sir.

139
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,514
She fired on us.

140
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:24,192
There are always mishaps in battle.

141
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,084
The Firelights were her target and most are dead.

142
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:32,556
It wasn't a mishap, she froze up and lost her shit.

143
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:34,980
I could've handled those brats.

144
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,370
She's a problem and we all know it.

145
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,235
We?

146
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:40,646
Who's we?

147
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,012
I expect better from you than excuses.

148
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:49,180
It was your job to make sure things went smoothly.

149
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,686
You failed. Don't disappoint me again.

150
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:06,995
The world's growing smaller
every day, thanks to the Hexgates.

151
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:09,363
And now, we're cut off.

152
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:12,584
The topsiders are leaving us further and further behind.

153
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:15,357
What happened?

154
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,606
She already told you.

155
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:20,289
I'm asking you.

156
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:26,831
One of those Firelight wackos was a girl.

157
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,015
With pink hair.

158
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,586
Hmm…

159
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:39,956
Your sister's gone.

160
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:42,447
You know that as well as I do.

161
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,957
I know. I know. Sisters, right?

162
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:49,342
You can't live with 'em, can't
stuff 'em back in the ol' babymaker.

163
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:54,183
Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.

164
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:57,143
I'm sorry.

165
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,422
I need to know that I can rely on you.

166
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:01,146
Phew.

167
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,815
I'm doing this for us, Jinx.

168
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,338
All of us.

169
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:10,492
The sons and daughters of Zaun
deserve more than their runoff.

170
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:13,123
It won't happen again.

171
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:14,878
I know.

172
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:28,428
Sevika will clean up today's mess.

173
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:32,461
Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean
a dust bunny with a blowtorch.

174
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:36,740
She'll suffice. You should focus on your gadgetry.

175
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:37,613
Ugh.

176
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:39,681
Take some time.

177
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:42,298
I don't need time.

178
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:46,057
Take it anyhow.

179
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,456
Fundraiser's going well.

180
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,669
Your mother would be proud.

181
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:15,697
Hmm… Would she?

182
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:17,253
Tired of mingling?

183
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:20,965
Hmm. These people have nothing new to offer me.

184
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:24,232
The only one actually worth my time is him.

185
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,279
The golden boy.

186
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,744
Ah, he's won Piltover's heart.

187
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,225
Oh, speak of the devil.

188
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,232
Could I borrow you for a minute?

189
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:02,281
To what do I owe the pleasure?

190
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,100
It's Heimerdinger.

191
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:07,720
When is it not?

192
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,435
We've shown him our research.

193
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:11,252
He thinks we need more time.

194
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:12,651
It's Progress Day.

195
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,641
Representatives from all over the world have come to
see what new wonders the City of Progress has to offer.

196
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,507
If there's a time to present a new creation, it is now.

197
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:24,255
Great.

198
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:32,568
Heimerdinger is a great scientist.
But he's old. He only ever sees the past.

199
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,622
Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.

200
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:37,589
Someone like you.

201
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:39,622
You really believe that?

202
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:44,225
Hextech has the potential to change everything.

203
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:45,778
The world is ready.

204
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,771
And I've already spoken to several potential investors.

205
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:49,839
Investors?

206
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,979
Of course.

207
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:53,266
Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.

208
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,180
It's your speech.

209
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:57,943
Give the people a glimpse of the future.

210
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,066
It wasn't her.

211
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,765
It wasn't.

212
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:28,189
I know. Just… just some wannabe street trash.

213
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,649
I got confused, that's all.

214
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,554
Now, he thinks I'm weak.

215
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,797
"Sevika will clean it up."

216
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:39,872
Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.

217
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:44,176
I'm not weak.

218
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,604
And I'm gonna show him.

219
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:56,197
Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.

220
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:09,350
Where were you?

221
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,828
They were asking if I could do the address.

222
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,307
You should come up with me. We're partners.

223
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:18,075
No, no. Not in front of all of them…

224
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,941
You… have your speech prepared?

225
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:23,724
Uh-huh.

226
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:29,773
An inspiration to Piltover's
future and that of all humanity.

227
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:34,077
Please join me in welcoming to the stage…

228
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:36,136
Jayce Talis.

229
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,057
Guess it's time.

230
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:18,090
Uh, good evening.

231
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:23,137
I know many of you probably
didn't expect to see me here today.

232
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:25,424
And believe me, I'm just as shocked as you are.

233
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:37,220
My family and I are simple people.
In our factory, we made hammers.

234
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,822
They were probably used to cut the
stones you're standing on right now.

235
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,849
No one in my life expected very much of me.

236
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:50,252
And that is precisely what
makes this moment so extraordinary.

237
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:54,631
A few years ago, the Hexgates
opened their ports to the world

238
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:58,974
and made Piltover prosper beyond
anything we could have ever imagined.

239
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,800
But… we're not done yet.

240
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:25,349
This year, we've created something new for you.

241
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,656
Something that… um…

242
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:41,144
That we will share with you…

243
00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:45,811
…when the time is right.

244
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:52,910
Things that will bring an end to your hardships.

245
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:55,277
Whether you're the scion of our high houses,

246
00:25:55,742 --> 00:25:57,610
or an honest laborer from the underground.

247
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,642
We vow to keep pressing forward,
for we are the City of Progress.

248
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,726
And our future is bright.

249
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,386
That it, then?

250
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:36,174
I thought that Talis boy was some kind of genius.

251
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,891
Last year, didn't he launch a
blimp halfway across the continent?

252
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,126
Airship, actually.

253
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:44,536
An airship has a rigid metal hull. It's not a blimp.

254
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,381
It's a balloon, ain't it?

255
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,437
Sure as hell looks that way.

256
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:53,224
Pardon us, if we aren't quite so refined as you, milady.

257
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,950
What are you even doing here, Kiramman?

258
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:58,826
Don't you have a cocktail party to attend?

259
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:03,374
Fire.

260
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:04,603
Fire!

261
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:11,837
What's happening?

262
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:13,156
Get the fire brigade.

263
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:22,452
Help. In here, please. Help me.

264
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:34,896
Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped.

265
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,828
I'm a helpless little girl and
I've set the building on fire.

266
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:45,222
By accident. Totally by accident.

267
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,749
Get out. Now.

268
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:57,448
Also, I brought this dynamite. Goodbye.

269
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:32,602
The Gemstone is gone.

270
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,263
Along with some of our research papers.

271
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,117
The situation is still developing.

272
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:42,219
No one in the undercity has claimed responsibility yet.

273
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,813
How did it come to this?

274
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:54,346
Hmm. For too long has the underground been left unchecked.

275
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,739
We've lost touch.

276
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,991
They may not be your preferred
constituents but they're still our people.

277
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,099
The undercity cannot be controlled. Not by us.

278
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,736
So where does that leave us?

279
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:08,777
Mr. Talis?

280
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:11,547
Could the trenchers build a
weapon with the stolen crystal?

281
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:13,547
Shimmer, body replacements…

282
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:17,175
We've seen their ingenuity over
the years, of course, they can.

283
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:22,848
If the right person got a hold of it,

284
00:29:22,873 --> 00:29:25,397
it's possible they could utilize its energy.

285
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:27,558
We need to address this immediately.

286
00:29:29,777 --> 00:29:30,622
I agree.

287
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,274
It was my responsibility to
safeguard this technology and I failed.

288
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:36,976
My mistake cost people their lives.

289
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,558
I have come before you to recommend that we suspend
all Hextech operations until the situation is resolved.

290
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:46,622
Including our laboratories, the refinery and the Hexgates.

291
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:48,688
Have you lost your mind?

292
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:50,996
The Hexgates must remain open.

293
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,444
Piltover's status as a global shipping lane depends on it.

294
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,612
Thousands would lose their income.

295
00:29:57,006 --> 00:30:00,544
But shouldn't the safety of
Piltover be our first priority?

296
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,905
You would sacrifice your life's work?

297
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,349
Without the Hexgates, my goods cannot
reach foreign markets till winter.

298
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,565
Am I to tell the Noxians

299
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,143
their next shipment of wine will be vinegar?

300
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,180
Councilors. It appears we are at an impasse.

301
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,866
If we shut down the Hexgates, the city will suffer.

302
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:20,652
But if we do nothing,

303
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:24,002
we leave ourselves vulnerable to malefactors.

304
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,445
More lives may be lost.

305
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:32,138
Perhaps the time has come to
explore a more radical solution.

306
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:33,537
What are you suggesting?

307
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,691
Mr. Talis has demonstrated his commitment to our safety.

308
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:43,363
He's willing to sacrifice his own enterprise.

309
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:46,496
And it seems to me only Mr. Talis

310
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:49,394
has the knowledge necessary to secure the Hexgates.

311
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,168
I propose that a new chair be brought forth,

312
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:56,747
and that House Talis be elevated to this august body.

313
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:57,182
What?

314
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,381
As a Councilor,

315
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:03,286
he will have the resources necessary
to protect all our investments.

316
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,496
Councilor Medarda, his is highly irregular.

317
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:10,028
The Council has held seven seats for generations.

318
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:12,578
Does the boy have any experience?

319
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:15,871
Only that of a scientist. Like Heimerdinger.

320
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,206
I believe Councilor Medarda is right.

321
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,833
Hextech security should be administered by a scientist.

322
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:30,713
I second the motion.

323
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:33,119
Well then, shall we vote?

324
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:53,621
Jinx!

325
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:59,521
Jinx! Jinx!

326
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:01,660
Jinx!

327
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:03,060
That's me.

328
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:06,874
Half a dozen enforcers, dead. Enforcers. Dead.

329
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:07,715
Yeah…

330
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:09,277
A building blown to pieces.

331
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,964
Oh, yeah.

332
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:15,560
Do you have any idea what you've done?

333
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:18,866
Actually, I do.

334
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:29,811
Happy Progress Day!

335
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:58,402
Hey.

336
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:00,529
How are you feeling?

337
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,104
I've had a break in the case.

338
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:06,538
Shouldn't you be resting?

339
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,895
While the trail is hot?

340
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:13,138
Listen, you know how I've suspected there is
a single mind behind the undercity's violence?

341
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,808
The great conspiracy.

342
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:18,463
I think whoever attacked the square is our suspect.

343
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,222
The same symbols showed up at the
botched smuggling operation at the Hexgates.

344
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:23,064
The Hexgates?

345
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:23,747
Keep up.

346
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:27,537
All this time, they've kept their
dealings localized to the undercity.

347
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:31,162
Low priority. The attack on the square changes things.

348
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:32,133
They've overstepped.

349
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:33,868
If I can figure who made this,

350
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,236
it could lead me directly to whoever's behind it all.

351
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:39,273
The answer is here, staring me in the face.

352
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:41,439
I can feel it.

353
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,711
How do you intend to prove any of this?

354
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:52,698
If I can just work this out. Marcus will have to listen.

355
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:56,218
If there's one thing I've learned about the Council,

356
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,172
they need more than just theories.

357
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:01,615
Since when did you concern
yourself with the Council's opinion?

358
00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:04,148
Since I…

359
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,032
became a Councilor.

360
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:10,573
You're serious.

361
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:12,723
When? Why?

362
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:15,897
Have they discovered how to
govern with grease and a spanner?

363
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:22,622
Ha ha. I was actually hoping you
might consider joining my staff.

364
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:27,163
"House Talis Security."

365
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,362
That's a ceremonial position. I'd live behind a desk.

366
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:33,112
You almost died, Cait.

367
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,545
I just… I just want you to be safe.

368
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,889
Thanks, but I already have a job.

369
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,127
No. You don't.

370
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:44,385
After the attack, your parents spoke to the Sheriff.

371
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,614
This is the best I could do.

372
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:52,120
I don't need charity, Councilor. Yours or my parents'.

373
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:52,995
Cait.

374
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:53,973
Get out.

375
00:35:24,278 --> 00:35:26,095
I need to speak with one of the inmates.

376
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:30,515
Oh, folks in here aren't usually very talkative.

377
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,588
This one was hit by friendly fire.

378
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:36,353
He's got reason to talk. Must have been sent in today?

379
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:42,356
Oh. Inmate 2135.

380
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:46,315
Yeah, I'm, uh, afraid that's not possible.

381
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:46,937
Why not?

382
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,442
Uh, well, there's been… an incident.

383
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:51,447
What kind of incident?

384
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:52,500
The…

385
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,367
…not so pretty kind.

386
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,695
You don't understand, I have to talk to him.

387
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:06,471
Oh, you'll be able to. As soon
as he can move his jaw again.

388
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,343
Who assaulted him?

389
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,261
Who the hell are you?
