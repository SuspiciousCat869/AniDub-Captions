1
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,290
Ever wonder what it's like to drown?

2
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,322
Story of opposites.

3
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,938
There's peace in water.

4
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:47,041
Like it's holdin' you, whisperin'
in low tones to let it in.

5
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,965
And every problem in the world will fade away.

6
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:04,244
But then there's this thing…

7
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,485
…in your head, and it's raging.

8
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,120
Lighting every nerve with madness.

9
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,050
To fight.

10
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:16,104
To survive.

11
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,453
And all the while, this question lingers before you:

12
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:24,665
"Have you had enough?"

13
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:31,270
It's funny. You could pass a lifetime
without ever facing a choice like that.

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,194
But it changes you forever.

15
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,612
For that, I thank you…

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,755
old friend.

17
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:12,322
Vander?

18
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,767
We don't have much time.

19
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:15,923
How did you find me?

20
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:18,652
I'm proud of you. Always have been.

21
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:22,955
I'm sorry, I… This is the only way to protect the others.

22
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,601
Vander.

23
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,032
You've got a good heart. Don't ever lose it.

24
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,562
No matter how the world tries to break you.

25
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,766
Protect the family.

26
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:33,592
What are you...

27
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,189
No.

28
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:41,727
Vander.

29
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,481
Let me out. This isn't right.

30
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:45,669
I'm guessing that's for me.

31
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,612
You gonna let us make the arrest or not?

32
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,551
You'll oblige a doomed man one last smoke.

33
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:06,960
Won't you?

34
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,990
I'm not putting you away, Vander.

35
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,234
The Council needs its pound of flesh.

36
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:17,854
Without you down here, it all falls apart.

37
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,553
Benzo will handle things.

38
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:27,120
I may not have my devilish
charm, but he runs a tight ship.

39
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:30,271
Vander, no. You can't do this.

40
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,804
You won't be coming back for a long time.

41
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:33,497
I know.

42
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:36,920
Why?

43
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,578
Mm.

44
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,139
It's the only way.

45
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,499
Benzo, open the damn door.

46
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:51,947
What's happening?

47
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,924
Hey. Stop right there!

48
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,957
What the devil…

49
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:17,925
No.

50
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,076
Silco?

51
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:40,956
You animal. Go crawl back into
whatever hole you came out of.

52
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:42,325
Benzo, stay back.

53
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,480
You never did know when to walk away.

54
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,320
Wait.

55
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,367
No!

56
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:55,468
Hmm. Stubborn to the end.

57
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:03,586
What the hell have you done? This wasn't the deal!

58
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,596
Deal's changed.

59
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,167
No.

60
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:21,695
No!

61
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,367
This entire time, I thought I
needed to dampen the oscillations.

62
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,267
The crystals will only stabilize at high frequency.

63
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,025
You have to...

64
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:19,644
Crank it.

65
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,100
Yes. Yes. You have to… crank it.

66
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,279
It works.

67
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:26,606
Eh… On paper.

68
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,325
Well, we could test it if we had access to my equipment.

69
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,072
Which is being destroyed tomorrow.

70
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:32,364
What?

71
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,821
Oh. I… Yeah. I, I meant to tell you.

72
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:39,808
That research is everything. My… my whole life.

73
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,229
Maybe if we showed them the equations, they'd let us...

74
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,058
We need more than promises.

75
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:44,862
We need proof.

76
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:48,051
Not without the crystals. The
enforcers took them all. They're gone.

77
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,990
Yeah. Locked away in Heimerdinger's lab.

78
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:57,430
No. No. No. You heard the Council. If we're wrong…

79
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:58,810
Better be right then.

80
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,095
Why? Why would you risk this?

81
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,523
Do you think it was my life's ambition to be an assistant?

82
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,017
Scientists seek discoveries.

83
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,560
Ways to make the world a better place.

84
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:14,707
This Hextech dream of yours has the potential to do that.

85
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:19,288
Our Hextech dream.

86
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,456
I saw everything.

87
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,420
Be… Benzo. They…

88
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:53,572
What about Vander?

89
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:55,808
They took him.

90
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,178
Where?

91
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,484
It's a little crude, I'll admit.

92
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,300
The base violence necessary for change.

93
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:38,952
But we both know topside won't listen to anything else.

94
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:49,260
Even with your monsters, you
won't win a war against Piltover.

95
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,496
I don't have to. I just need to scare them.

96
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:56,675
They won't dare set foot in the underground again.

97
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:01,557
You'll get people killed. For what? Pride?

98
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,697
For respect.

99
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:08,098
Opportunity. Everything they've denied us.

100
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,948
You had my respect.

101
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,187
The Lanes' respect, but that…
that was never enough for you.

102
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:18,566
We shared a vision, Vander. A dream of freedom.

103
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,305
Not just for the Lanes, but the
whole of the underground, united as one.

104
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,125
The nation of Zaun.

105
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,805
Do you even remember?

106
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,025
I trusted you.

107
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,783
And you betrayed me.

108
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,393
What I did to you…

109
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:51,858
I've never forgiven myself. You were my brother.

110
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,257
No, you still don't understand.

111
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,607
Can you imagine what it's like?

112
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:06,405
When your blood mixes with the filth and
the river toxins eat through your nerves.

113
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,560
Oh, I hated you for what you'd done.

114
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:15,912
But as time passed, so did my hate.

115
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,468
And I was left with an understanding.

116
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:25,746
The only way to defeat a superior
enemy is to stop at nothing.

117
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:28,188
To become what they fear.

118
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:34,243
I hated you, but you kept my respect.

119
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:37,192
Until you made peace with them.

120
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,189
Played lapdog after everything we suffered.

121
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,890
I had no choice.

122
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,096
Perhaps.

123
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,196
But now you do.

124
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:51,113
Shimmer. We have the power.

125
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,514
We can finally realize our dream,

126
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:57,577
brother.

127
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,132
Look at what you've done.

128
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,198
Benzo. These kids.

129
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:08,425
In fighting topside, you'd
sacrifice everything that we are.

130
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:12,257
It's not the way. Can't you see that?

131
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:19,534
Kill me if you have to, but please spare the Lanes.

132
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:24,212
You'd die for the cause, but you won't fight for one?

133
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:30,234
I'm just… not that man anymore.

134
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,306
I'll show you what you really are.

135
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,719
Hmm.

136
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:11,312
So far, so good.

137
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:17,256
Hmm. Willing to risk exile for your endeavor.

138
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,772
That's quite the conviction.

139
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:19,748
Councilor.

140
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,983
What a surprise to see you, huh?

141
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:22,783
How could I have…

142
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:26,984
Please. We can prove that it works.

143
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,541
Hmm. You couldn't do so earlier
today, how is tonight any different?

144
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:33,171
We figured out how to stabilize it.

145
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,042
You're the Professor's assistant.

146
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,479
No, he's my new partner.

147
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:43,051
Even if you manage to prove your
theory, the Council would destroy it.

148
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,337
Heimerdinger will recognize the potential.

149
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,376
He already does.

150
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,122
It scares him. It scares them all.

151
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,055
What about you?

152
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:55,743
I recognize that any worthwhile venture involves risk.

153
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,757
Councilor, this technology, it's real.

154
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,933
And no matter what happens here,
it's going to change our world.

155
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,724
We should be the ones to lead it.

156
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:17,760
Piltover, the land of progress, equality, innovation.

157
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,733
I know it sounds impossible, but
when have we ever let that stop us?

158
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:24,896
Please, just give us a chance.

159
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:34,771
One night, gentlemen. Impress me,
or I'd suggest you pack your bags.

160
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:38,263
Harold.

161
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:39,603
Oh. Oh.

162
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:44,217
Oh, Councilor Medarda, you… you nearly scared me to death.

163
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:47,825
Ah. Another late night. The work just doesn't end.

164
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,433
Well, I suppose that's a sign of good business, huh?

165
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,265
Well, if the enforcers hit tonight, we'll be ready…

166
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:03,476
I think.

167
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,183
Dibs on the bat.

168
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,588
No, no, no, no. I found it.

169
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:06,683
But I called it.

170
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:07,546
But I found it.

171
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:08,586
Respect the dibs.

172
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:09,312
I called it already.

173
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,978
Stop being such a big baby.

174
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,010
Vi?

175
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,511
Where's the...

176
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:16,543
Oh, you're back.

177
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:28,837
Hey. Those are Vander's. Slow down. What's going on?

178
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,014
Benzo's dead.

179
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:32,152
Dead?

180
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:33,422
They took Vander.

181
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:34,517
Who took Vander?

182
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,335
I don't know. But I need to help him.

183
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:37,409
We're going with you.

184
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:43,069
Whatever killed Benzo… was like nothing I've ever seen.

185
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:46,217
It tore him apart.

186
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,213
You're not doing this alone, Vi.

187
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:51,553
He's our father too.

188
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:54,368
Do we know where they took him?

189
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:56,131
Ekko followed them.

190
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,144
The old cannery next to the docks. He said…

191
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,757
I need you to sit this one out, Powder.

192
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:08,724
What?

193
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:10,615
You're not coming.

194
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:11,629
I'm not afraid.

195
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:12,700
It's too dangerous.

196
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,150
But families stick together. You said it yourself.

197
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,362
I know what I said…

198
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,725
I want to fight. I can help.

199
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,667
You're not ready.

200
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,754
You're all I have left.

201
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,365
I can't lose you.

202
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:34,426
Here. If they come for you, take this and run.

203
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,640
Where ever you are, light it
up, and I'll find you. I promise.

204
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:00,474
It's all here.

205
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:14,849
It's time to crank it.

206
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,975
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

207
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:34,658
I don't think it's gonna hold! Look at the buildup!

208
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,618
The resonance will stabilize it.

209
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,408
Trust me.

210
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,856
Hey, you seeing this?

211
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:38,072
I can help them.

212
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:50,834
Let's get Vander and get out.

213
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,345
I told you it would work.

214
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:03,047
All yours.

215
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,433
Wow.

216
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,607
It's never done that before.

217
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,886
All right. Here we go.

218
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:26,316
Disengage!

219
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,152
Incredible.

220
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,846
Vi.

221
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:14,780
What are you doing here?

222
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:16,488
We're breakin' you out.

223
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,198
Mylo.

224
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:20,383
On it.

225
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:27,273
How… how did you get in?

226
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,209
There's guards everywhere.

227
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:33,269
It was easy. We found an open window and…

228
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:34,733
Oh, god.

229
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,031
You have to get out. Now.

230
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,015
Welcome.

231
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:52,190
You have my congratulations.

232
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:57,111
But I'm afraid this will be a very short reunion.

233
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,232
Hmm.

234
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,293
Have you heard the rumor?

235
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,265
Vander the coward fled town with his children.

236
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,175
And they were never seen again.

237
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,167
Claggor, see if you can find another way out of here.

238
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:15,912
Okay.

239
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,220
You don't have to do this.

240
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,358
Yes, I do.

241
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:23,824
Vi.

242
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:32,206
Mylo.

243
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:39,225
Take a breath. You can do this.

244
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:55,231
We're gonna get you out.

245
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,875
Ready to rise to the surface?

246
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,101
Mylo, hurry.

247
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:16,700
Vi.

248
00:24:18,644 --> 00:24:20,551
Silco. Let her go.

249
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,725
This is between you and me.

250
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:24,269
You had your chance.

251
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:38,358
Vi.

252
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,607
You did good.

253
00:25:06,392 --> 00:25:07,207
Open up.

254
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:09,442
Stop this lunacy at once.

255
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,744
They're almost through. No pressure.

256
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,108
That sounds like pressure!

257
00:25:20,474 --> 00:25:21,432
Open it.

258
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:48,019
Excuse me. Underfoot.

259
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:14,791
You've actually done it.

260
00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:18,428
But just because it can be done, doesn't mean…

261
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,465
Will you please stop hovering?

262
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:24,118
I'm not sure how to do that, sir.

263
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:30,134
This is not what Piltover's
future looks like, my dear boys.

264
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,171
That's for the Council to decide.

265
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,355
Perhaps it's time.

266
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:40,193
For the era of magic.

267
00:26:40,218 --> 00:26:43,533
Uh, Hextech. For the era of Hextech.

268
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:01,710
You have to work. For me. Okay?

269
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,456
Kill them.

270
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:24,107
I knew you still had it in you.

271
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,312
Find the girl.

272
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,746
Silco!

273
00:34:19,353 --> 00:34:20,077
Vander.

274
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:22,852
Vander…

275
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:28,688
Take care of Powder.

276
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,681
No!

277
00:34:57,774 --> 00:34:59,096
Vi, it worked.

278
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:00,251
What?

279
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,126
Did you see me?

280
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,476
My monkey bomb finally worked.

281
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:06,767
You did this?

282
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:15,750
Why?

283
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:18,088
Why did you do this?

284
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:20,401
I… I didn't…

285
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,257
I was saving you.

286
00:35:26,444 --> 00:35:28,643
I only wanted to help.

287
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:32,324
I only wanted to help. I only wanted to help.

288
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:34,224
I told you to stay away.

289
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:35,643
Please. Please. Please...

290
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,107
I told you to stay away!

291
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:41,518
No. Why did you leave me?

292
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:45,718
Because you're a jinx. Do you hear me? Mylo was right.

293
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:49,355
No. No. No. No. Violet, please.

294
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:03,419
Violet, please.

295
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,617
Vi! Vi, come back! Please come back!

296
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:19,864
Please, Violet. I need you. Please.

297
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:34,774
Violet…

298
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:38,700
Violet. Please.

299
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:06,503
Powder.

300
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:08,233
Pow...

301
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:08,842
Shh.

302
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:10,584
He'll kill you if he hears you.

303
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,444
Come on. Let's go.

304
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,025
Hello, little girl.

305
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,571
Where's your sister?

306
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,028
She left me.

307
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:06,472
She is not my sister anymore.

308
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:27,267
It's okay.

309
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,634
We'll show them.

310
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:36,102
We will show them all.
