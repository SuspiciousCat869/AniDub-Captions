1
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,492
We're almost there.

2
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,325
Aw, man.

3
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,107
Hey, Powder.

4
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,587
Come take a look.

5
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:44,533
Whoa.

6
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,770
It's nice getting above it all, huh?

7
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,594
One day, I'm gonna ride in one of those things.

8
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,318
And one day, I'm gonna shoot one of 'em down.

9
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,828
Vi, are, are you sure about this?

10
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:17,903
Look, if we get caught, we're...

11
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,021
We're not gonna get caught.

12
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,994
We'll be in and out before anyone notices.

13
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:29,980
All right, everybody, follow me. Just don't look down.

14
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,940
Couldn't we have at least just walked there?

15
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,548
Gotta stay out of sight for this one.

16
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,683
Called it.

17
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:05,783
This is on you, Vi.

18
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:06,893
I'll get her.

19
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:07,485
No.

20
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:08,911
Powder, look at me.

21
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,367
What did I tell you?

22
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:12,874
That…

23
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,178
…I'm ready.

24
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,050
That's right! So?

25
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,274
Phew!

26
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:38,324
Thanks.

27
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,622
What if Vander finds out we're all the way up here?

28
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:01,509
Look around you.

29
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,270
You think anyone topside's going hungry?

30
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:07,862
Besides, this is exactly the sort of job
Vander would've pulled when he was our age.

31
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,416
I'm going. Are you with me or not?

32
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:18,015
Vander's gonna kill us.

33
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,303
Yeah, only if we screw up.

34
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:21,540
So don't screw up.

35
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,242
All clear.

36
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,152
Who locks their balcony?

37
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,862
Hmm.

38
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,551
Whew.

39
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,920
There's tons of enforcers down there.

40
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,225
Means we're in the right place.

41
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,498
You gonna get that door open any time soon?

42
00:07:58,523 --> 00:07:59,657
Working on it.

43
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:02,981
Seeing as I'm the only one who
knows how to pick locks, I suggest...

44
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,182
Animals.

45
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:30,482
You know, Claggor, for once you're right.

46
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,444
We are definitely not supposed to be here.

47
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:40,285
Hmm.

48
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,648
Must be an inventor.

49
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:54,722
Huh.

50
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:59,582
Whoa, I think this is a real Valdiani.

51
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,607
Oh, yeah? What about this?

52
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,161
That's a nose hair trimmer.

53
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,319
Keep an eye out for anything that looks valuable, Powder.

54
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,185
Before Mylo fills the bag with junk.

55
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,060
Uh… guys?

56
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:28,156
Wait, Vi, how the hell did we find this place?

57
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:30,522
It was a tip from Little Man.

58
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:31,500
Little Man?

59
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:32,780
Just leave it.

60
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:33,606
Come on.

61
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,896
How can anyone have so much stuff?

62
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,118
Simple, just get born lucky.

63
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:04,350
Woo-hoo!

64
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:08,407
Mm.

65
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,316
Huh.

66
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:27,555
Whoa.

67
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:52,585
Mylo.

68
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:56,529
Powder, we gotta go.

69
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:57,388
Hello?

70
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,333
Is someone in there?

71
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:07,799
Come on.

72
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,727
We'll be fine. Just get back on the roof.

73
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,589
Hold on!

74
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,655
Whoa! Look out!

75
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:43,984
Watch out!

76
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:52,037
Hey.

77
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:53,507
Shit.

78
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,041
Stop right there!

79
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,532
Get them off!

80
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:16,370
Faster!

81
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,311
Hey! Hey!

82
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:21,384
Look out!

83
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,262
Down there!

84
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,451
You can't get away!

85
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:43,551
Hey!

86
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:44,356
Come on!

87
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:47,117
Oh.

88
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:52,816
This way!

89
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:54,070
Keep going!

90
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,596
Go, go, go!

91
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,571
Oh, man, not again. I just got this shirt...

92
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,648
Thought last time was the last time we were gonna do this.

93
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,380
Well, this time's the last time.

94
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,817
Guys, what was that? What the hell happened back there?

95
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,023
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

96
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:52,601
You could fill a damn library
with all the things you didn't do.

97
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:57,238
Guys, we just emptied a Piltover
penthouse right under the enforcers' noses.

98
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,052
So, if you're done beating
yourselves up, let's get this home.

99
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,113
Nice haul?

100
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:29,420
You could say that.

101
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:32,094
I heard there was some action across the river.

102
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,329
Someone, uh, someone really kicked the nest, huh?

103
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,762
Is that so?

104
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:45,231
But now you're, you're tracking
this mess of yours through my streets.

105
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,087
Your streets? What makes you think...

106
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:48,825
Listen, we don't want any trouble, okay?

107
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,195
Hear that, Deckard? They don't want any trouble.

108
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,814
You know, in my experience, trouble finds you.

109
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:57,550
There's no reason this has to get ugly.

110
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:01,345
How about you share a little taste of your treasure there

111
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:02,789
and we'll call it even?

112
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,600
No, no, no. We worked too hard to…

113
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:11,325
Just a taste?

114
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,206
Just a...

115
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:17,758
Huh?

116
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:14,659
Huh.

117
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:04,364
This day's turning out all right after all.

118
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,173
Wait!

119
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:18,070
Wanna see how that ends?

120
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:33,075
Where's Powder?

121
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,175
Oh! Oh! You little…

122
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:50,837
Oh!

123
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,918
Come on, Mouser, I need you!

124
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:16,131
No.

125
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,631
You did what?

126
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:46,742
I'm sorry.

127
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:50,148
I tried to fight him off with
Mouser, but… she didn't work.

128
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:51,608
Who saw that coming?

129
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,391
We never should have gone over there.

130
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,567
Doesn't matter. The stuff's gone.

131
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:59,756
It's all right, Powder. At least you're okay.

132
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,691
Okay? What about us?

133
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:05,416
I get my face bashed in, and she just gets a pass?

134
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:05,768
Yup.

135
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:19,148
Every time. Every time she comes, something goes wrong.

136
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,151
She jinxes every job.

137
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,638
Just drop it, Mylo.

138
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,313
Sit still!

139
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:34,159
Come on, get out of here!

140
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:35,217
You gotta pay!

141
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:36,088
Look at that!

142
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:55,914
Hey! Watch it.

143
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,719
Well, I, uh, suppose that concludes our business, then.

144
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:09,120
Mm. I suppose it does.

145
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:11,241
Wait…

146
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,590
Uh, wait a minute.

147
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:14,249
This, uh…

148
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:17,730
uh, this… isn't what we agreed on, so…

149
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:21,380
Well, demand for your wares has
dropped since we made our arrangements.

150
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,806
This is the new value.

151
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:24,748
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, um…

152
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,157
we shook on it.

153
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,465
Ten thousand.

154
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:29,367
Such are the risks of business.

155
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:29,918
Ten.

156
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:31,840
It's a fair price.

157
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:34,221
I think you should take it.

158
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:36,440
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

159
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,191
I can't do that. I can't do that!

160
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,155
Make your choice.

161
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:54,362
You folks need anything?

162
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:56,002
Leave us.

163
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:57,443
You sure about that?

164
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:58,805
Sounded to me like...

165
00:21:58,829 --> 00:21:59,590
Piss off.

166
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:01,247
Ah.

167
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:08,576
I think I know what you need.

168
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:10,744
You don't seem to listen, barman...

169
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,275
A bit of advice.

170
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,164
Don't threaten the guy who pours the drinks.

171
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:21,872
So you're Vander.

172
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,062
Hound of the Underground.

173
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:28,855
I expected something… younger.

174
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,642
We were expecting traders who would honor their word,

175
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,756
so I guess we're all disappointed.

176
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:37,752
You got us all wrong, my friend.

177
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:40,660
We were just… negotiating.

178
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:43,273
Now you're speaking my language.

179
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:46,249
How about you just give Huck the rest of what you owe him,

180
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,139
and I'll let you walk out of here in one piece?

181
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,390
Do we, uh… have a deal?

182
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,362
This is vile.

183
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,130
You'll learn to love it.

184
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:17,553
Welcome to the Lanes.

185
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,673
Vander learns none of this.

186
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:27,528
No worries there. Powder took care of the evidence.

187
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:31,389
I tried, okay? You don't get
it. You're older, you're bigger.

188
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:32,886
It, it isn't fair.

189
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,815
So stick with us!

190
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,030
Take a punch or two.

191
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,077
Everyone all right?

192
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:42,837
Never better.

193
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:43,817
Good.

194
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:50,421
I don't suppose you can explain why it is that I'm
hearing about an explosion and a foot chase topside?

195
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:53,511
Four children fleeing the scene.

196
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,025
What the hell were you thinking?

197
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,004
That we can handle a real job.

198
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:00,991
A real job?

199
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:03,401
We got our own tip, planned a route, nobody even saw.

200
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:05,048
You blew up a building.

201
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:05,381
That wasn't…

202
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:07,687
Did you even stop to think about
what could have happened to you?

203
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:10,034
Eh? To them?

204
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,850
Where did you even get this tip?

205
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:22,466
We just heard it at Benzo's shop.

206
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,471
From?

207
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,908
Little Man.

208
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:30,386
I took us there. If you wanna be mad, be mad at me.

209
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:33,430
But you're the one who always says we
have to earn our place in this world.

210
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:37,629
I also told you time and time
again, the Northside's off-limits.

211
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,710
We stay out of Piltover's business.

212
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:40,248
Why?

213
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:43,606
They've got plenty, while we're
down here scraping together coins.

214
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,295
When did you get so comfortable
living in someone else's shadow?

215
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:50,877
Everyone out.

216
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:00,673
Sit down.

217
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:01,450
I'm fine.

218
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:03,404
Sit. Down.

219
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:13,318
Those kids look up to you.

220
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:15,625
Yeah, I know.

221
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,378
You know, but you don't know.

222
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,290
When people look up to you, you don't get to be selfish.

223
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:20,878
I'm not...

224
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,333
You say run, they run.

225
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:26,207
You say swim, they dive in. You say
light a fire, they show up with oil.

226
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,186
But whatever happens, it's on you.

227
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:35,325
Just like it's on me what happens to us down here.

228
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,315
We make ourselves a problem for
Piltover, and they will send the enforcers.

229
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,270
So? Why answer to them?

230
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:44,678
These are our streets. Someone should remind them of that.

231
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:47,423
You're not hearing me. That path?

232
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:49,055
This?

233
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:51,586
It's not gonna solve your problems.

234
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:53,874
Just makes more of them.

235
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:55,910
We clear?

236
00:26:01,582 --> 00:26:02,828
How'd you get this?

237
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,619
Some idiot was following us.

238
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,119
On our side? Who?

239
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,121
I don't know. He was after the stuff.

240
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,715
Where is it now?

241
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,291
We lost it.

242
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:19,164
All of it?

243
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,183
Good.

244
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,486
Nothing can tie you to what happened up there.

245
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:28,723
You're gonna have to lay low for a bit, understand?

246
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:30,530
Okay.

247
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,828
We're gonna be fine, right?

248
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:35,655
I'll take care of it.

249
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,180
Oh, you did put that idiot on his ass, though, right?

250
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:48,460
Mm.

251
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,414
Get up, Claggor. We're going out.

252
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,554
Wait, now?

253
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,096
Hey, hey, that's mine!

254
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,006
You wanna be treated like adults, right?

255
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,427
Then you should know better than
to come back from a job empty-handed.

256
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,611
I'm gonna have a little word with your informant.

257
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:21,578
All right, give me the details
of exactly what happened up there.

258
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:41,655
She's a problem.

259
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,065
Mylo, I'm really not…

260
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,783
Do you remember what was in that bag?

261
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,898
The biggest payout we've ever seen and she just lost it.

262
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:49,188
She made a mistake.

263
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:51,301
Name one time she hasn't.

264
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:52,283
She's young.

265
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:53,856
Don't bullshit me.

266
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,798
You were twice the person at half her age.

267
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:59,370
You know what, Mylo? You're right.

268
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,636
There's a bunch of things Powder just can't do.

269
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,727
You don't have to tell me twice.

270
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:07,461
Like, complain about everything.

271
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,019
What?

272
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,436
And brag nonstop.

273
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,097
Okay, okay, I see where this is going.

274
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,586
Pick fights with the group when we need to focus.

275
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,674
Vi, I…

276
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,711
And tell strangers on the street that we got a nice haul?

277
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:18,541
I, I didn't mean to...

278
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,127
Powder's my problem, okay?

279
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:22,211
Your problem is never knowing when to shut up.

280
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,291
But I'm gonna help you with that. Ready?

281
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,865
You see this look on my face?

282
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:28,561
This will always mean it's time to shut up.

283
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:30,025
But… I…

284
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:40,811
Nobody comes in.

285
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:44,244
We're closed.

286
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,925
Well, open up.

287
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:50,159
For good. You can take your worthless junk elsewhere.

288
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:52,192
Just as well.

289
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,691
Owner's the shittiest businessman I know.

290
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:01,090
Ekko. What's going on with that thing?

291
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:03,940
Give me a few seconds. The cannon pinion's still busted.

292
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,178
Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.

293
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:06,733
But...

294
00:29:06,757 --> 00:29:07,852
Uh-uh. Off you go.

295
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:14,742
Claggor.

296
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,274
He-he-hey, Little Man.

297
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,714
You're a little early.

298
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,572
My guys are still roundin' up this month's collections.

299
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:23,227
Won't have numbers until next, um…

300
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:24,434
Whoo.

301
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:27,661
Why are you muckin' about with this?

302
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:29,988
I assume you've heard.

303
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:32,360
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

304
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,657
How could they be so stupid?

305
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:38,254
The younger folk think it's the right thing to do.

306
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,315
Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

307
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,915
Throws herself at trouble wherever she can find some.

308
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,445
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

309
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:49,895
Looking to write their own stories.
You can't protect them forever.

310
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:52,523
Someone was following them.

311
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,044
Whole lot of someones, from what I heard.

312
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,855
Not enforcers.

313
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:57,599
Someone on our side.

314
00:29:58,069 --> 00:29:58,704
Who?

315
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:03,082
There's worse things than enforcers out there.

316
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:05,737
We both know that.

317
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:09,398
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

318
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:10,343
Did you guys go?

319
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,215
Sure did.

320
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:14,151
Hey, listen, how did you find that place? I just...

321
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:16,781
Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

322
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:18,656
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

323
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:20,648
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

324
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:22,690
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be here otherwise.

325
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:25,217
Oh, she showed me a couple moves to practice. Look.

326
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,236
Yeah, it's… it's coming along.

327
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,393
Hey, so, how'd you find that place, anyway?

328
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,590
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

329
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:37,556
Bought a whole bunch of stuff
Benzo only keeps there for display.

330
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,888
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

331
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:43,005
I charged him double price. Sucker.

332
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:45,511
But how did you know where he lived?

333
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:46,791
Uh, followed him.

334
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:47,446
How else?

335
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,564
Oh. Right.

336
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,114
Oh, crap.

337
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:54,944
Uh…

338
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:57,117
They'll be fine. Go.

339
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:01,809
Well, hello.

340
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,110
Evening, friends.

341
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,446
Shit.

342
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:23,605
Something I can help you with?

343
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:27,101
Some trencher trash attacked one of
the buildings in the Academy district,

344
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:28,868
but you already knew that.

345
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,738
We're looking for the culprits.

346
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:31,958
Got a description?

347
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:36,190
Yeah, it's exactly who you're
picturing in that thick head of yours.

348
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:38,440
Mm. You think my head is thick?

349
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,682
Uh, just past the average.

350
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:41,923
Listen, you shady son of a…

351
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:44,278
How about you go for a little walk, Marcus?

352
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:45,952
Cool off a bit.

353
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:48,000
Go.

354
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,625
Lovely chap you've brought.

355
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,606
Don't mind the kid.

356
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:27,579
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

357
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:30,598
Some things are the same topside and bottom.

358
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:37,148
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

359
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:38,440
Was anyone hurt?

360
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:41,504
A building was blown to bits. What do you think?

361
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:46,486
Those who did this will be dealt with.

362
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:49,209
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

363
00:32:49,983 --> 00:32:51,983
You know what kind of stuff they had in there?

364
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:55,048
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

365
00:32:55,846 --> 00:32:58,635
The Council needs someone to make an example of.

366
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:00,548
People need to feel safe.

367
00:33:00,573 --> 00:33:02,422
Yeah, topside people.

368
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:03,871
We had a deal, Vander.

369
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,313
You keep your people off my streets,
and I stay out of your business.

370
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,713
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

371
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,644
No one will know you were involved.

372
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,281
I can't do that.

373
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:19,695
You don't seem to grasp how serious this is.

374
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:22,188
If I don't put someone behind bars tonight,

375
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:26,277
the next time I come down here,
I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

376
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:28,179
We both know how that'll go.

377
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:32,542
I'm sorry, Grayson, but I can't offer up my own people.

378
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:41,297
If you change your mind, this will reach me.

379
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:43,510
And only me.

380
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,453
What are you calling this one?

381
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:14,758
Whisker.

382
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:19,612
You wanna talk about today?

383
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:20,897
What's the point?

384
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,642
I ruined everything. I always do.

385
00:34:23,825 --> 00:34:24,942
Nobody said that.

386
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:29,245
No. Just that you were "twice the person" at half my age.

387
00:34:30,307 --> 00:34:31,542
You heard them.

388
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:33,549
I'm not a fighter.

389
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:35,189
You don't have to be.

390
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,867
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

391
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,507
They never work.

392
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:44,064
They will.

393
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,511
Come with me.

394
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,235
What?

395
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:48,764
Come on.

396
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:05,803
What are we doing here?

397
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,693
See that gutter running along the canal?

398
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,971
That's where Claggor got his
foot stuck running from enforcers.

399
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,905
They thought it was funny, so they left him there.

400
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:27,010
He was out all night before we found him.

401
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:30,264
That sign?

402
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:34,037
You see it?

403
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:34,944
Uh-huh.

404
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,537
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket and
nearly fell off trying to draw a giant middle finger.

405
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,156
His ass made that splotch.

406
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:46,898
And that?

407
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:53,827
When I was a kid, some guy took my
favorite toy and threw it up there.

408
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,319
I used to come out here at night and stare at it,

409
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:03,293
hoping maybe the wind or a bird might knock it down.

410
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,490
We've all had bad days.

411
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:12,925
But we learn. And we stick together.

412
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:17,755
Oh, I forgot.

413
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,792
These were in my pocket.

414
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,438
They're from the apartment.

415
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:23,956
What are they?

416
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:26,540
I don't know.

417
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:29,003
Should we show Vander?

418
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:29,830
No.

419
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:36,671
Let's keep this our little secret.

420
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,802
Mylo's wrong, Powder. You're stronger than you think.

421
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:43,879
And one day…

422
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:47,164
this city's gonna respect us.

423
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:24,640
You were supposed to follow them and not interfere.

424
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:27,673
I'm sorry.

425
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,231
They just caught us by surprise.

426
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:34,494
Now his accomplice is asking questions about you.

427
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:37,573
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

428
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:45,705
The kids. It was their fault,
the explosion in the upper city.

429
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,165
That was them?

430
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:51,210
Yeah. The topsiders are up in arms looking for 'em.

431
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,295
Vander's in trouble.

432
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,533
Smartest thing you ever said, boy.

433
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:04,537
Get him a meal.

434
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:08,054
But keep him off the streets.

435
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:14,177
Our timeline has moved up.

436
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,021
It's almost ready.

437
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:19,326
Show me.

438
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:28,985
Feeding time.

439
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:36,137
And the side effects?

440
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,200
Stabilizing.

441
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,142
You have a subject in mind?

442
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,994
Someone just volunteered.
