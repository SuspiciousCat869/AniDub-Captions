1
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:27,316
You didn't have a choice.

2
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,493
He knew what he was signing up for.

3
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,648
We're done here.

4
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:38,678
We haven't even scratched the
surface. Silco's still out there.

5
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:43,430
Do you not understand? I am part of this now!

6
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:48,151
The next parents who get a
message their kid isn't coming home…

7
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,721
I don't even know where to take it.

8
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:52,836
Do we just leave him here?

9
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:55,653
You've always been a part of this.

10
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:58,361
You just never had to look it in the eye. One dead kid?

11
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,738
There's hundreds more where he came from, thanks to Silco,

12
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:03,606
and thanks to people like you
who stuck their heads in the dirt.

13
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:05,670
This is over.

14
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,981
Not for me.

15
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:11,679
Take those off.

16
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:18,658
Make me.

17
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:25,951
I can't let you leave with them.

18
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:28,746
Then, I guess you're gonna need to kill another trencher.

19
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:46,445
You won't make it alone.

20
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:30,074
Been a while since topside's gotten this bold.

21
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,733
Say what you want about the late Sheriff. He had his uses.

22
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,186
Too bad Jinx didn't think so.

23
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:39,055
We'll buy another.

24
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:40,990
You gonna do anything

25
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,793
about that piece of shit that murdered my boy?

26
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:47,370
Let me guess, "Jinx will take care of it."

27
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,584
Just like she's been taking care of everything else.

28
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:56,903
We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni.

29
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:04,310
At least, we have the solace of
knowing he died fighting for our cause,

30
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:10,989
instead of some petty personal
dispute, as so often occurs here.

31
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:14,733
You're one to talk about sacrificing for the cause.

32
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,183
Where is Jinx anyhow?

33
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,081
Help her with the body.

34
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:01,401
Viktor…

35
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,984
I know this will probably never see the light of day,

36
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:09,498
but watching how you work so tirelessly
to make the world a better place…

37
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,567
Well, I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't try.

38
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,324
Everyone's gotta do their part, right?

39
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:01,554
Okay.

40
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,760
Noxian wine is bold by comparison.

41
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,446
The grapes are hardened by the climate.

42
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:27,358
But then, so is everything
that manages to survive in Noxus.

43
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,961
Mel, would you like...

44
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:37,011
Leave.

45
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,019
Hmm.

46
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,913
Stay away from Jayce!

47
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,621
You really are fond of him.

48
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:51,291
Better yet, march back to your
ship and get the hell out of my city.

49
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,077
Get ahold of yourself. I taught you better.

50
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,532
We're in trouble, Mel.

51
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:17,008
The man who killed your brother
doesn't believe the score is settled,

52
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,654
and his resources exceed ours.

53
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,382
If there is a chance Hextech
can be weaponized, we must have it.

54
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,427
Piltover isn't your testing ground.

55
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,398
I've only accelerated the process you started.

56
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,117
I wanted to protect the city from people like you.

57
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:35,486
I can't believe you'd start a war just to cover your ass.

58
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:38,659
I would set the world ablaze to protect our family.

59
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:39,425
No.

60
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:44,061
I stopped being part of this
family the moment you cast me out.

61
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:48,971
Why? Why did you do it?

62
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,429
Because you weakened me!

63
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,901
I couldn't endure the look in your
eyes whenever I made the decisions,

64
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,494
the necessary decisions to keep us safe!

65
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,331
We need that weapon, Mel.

66
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,051
Let the war unfold.

67
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:13,149
And you come home,

68
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,664
take your place at my side.

69
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,068
It's where you belong.

70
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:31,484
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,296
I don't know where you'd have preferred.

72
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:39,693
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,445
Am I interrupting?

74
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,584
Remember the Distinguished Innovators competition?

75
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:34,381
I remember you notching gears in the carriage over.

76
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,304
They started cranking the engine
and the whole thing was rattling.

77
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:41,036
I thought a loose cog was gonna take someone's eye out.

78
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,725
At least, you didn't throw up.

79
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:47,186
Everything made sense then.

80
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,502
You have to destroy it.

81
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:55,102
I know.

82
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:56,692
The Hexcore.

83
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,195
I… I can't do it.

84
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:04,974
You have to. Please.

85
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:09,663
What about your disease?

86
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:10,725
Without the Hexcore...

87
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:14,820
Promise me.

88
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:20,494
Okay. Okay.

89
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:22,644
I promise.

90
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:27,101
We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.

91
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:32,739
In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good.

92
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,418
We have to make it right.

93
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,355
I'm busy.

94
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:09,909
When you took Vander out of play, I thought, "Now here's
a man who understands what it takes to run an enterprise."

95
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,045
The attitude, the instinct, the eye.

96
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,279
The whole package, you were.

97
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,855
Always two steps ahead.

98
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:22,792
But time's lapped you, old man.

99
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,250
You're with him, are you?

100
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,840
You screwed up, Silco.

101
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,509
You're too young to remember what the
undercity was before it became an "enterprise".

102
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:41,022
We had nothing.

103
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,850
You know what bore us through those times?

104
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:47,806
Loyalty.

105
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:52,592
Brothers and sisters back-to-back
against whatever the world threw at us.

106
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:57,155
Now I'm forced to share the air with parasites like you,

107
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:00,432
who leach off their legacies.

108
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:04,337
Today's the day you die, Silco.

109
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:06,961
That's a risk I've known all my life.

110
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:11,381
But I still believe in loyalty.

111
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,758
I would have had your son killed for this.

112
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,196
Though I suppose we're ahead on that account.

113
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:46,946
Get out.

114
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,757
Were you tempted?

115
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:58,361
Not for a worm like him.

116
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,627
But he won't be the last.

117
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,161
Perfect place for an ambush.

118
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,639
And you without your hammer.

119
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,980
I was reminded recently of what
brought us together in the first place.

120
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:58,350
The threats beyond our walls.

121
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:01,187
This city has a short memory.

122
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:02,780
"Progress."

123
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,359
Far be it from me to stand in the way.

124
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:31,459
"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty,
unrestricted access to the Hexgates, sovereignty."

125
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,355
Do you really think you're in
a position to demand all this?

126
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,437
I give you credit for your stunt, boy.

127
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,487
Didn't think you had the stomach.

128
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,864
But the big display followed by a request for parley,

129
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,899
you're tipping your hand.

130
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:48,871
You're afraid.

131
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:50,873
I am afraid.

132
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,266
Today, I got a glimpse of what
war between us might look like.

133
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,621
Your people wouldn't stand a chance.

134
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,876
The Council couldn't care less.

135
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:03,635
I'm trying to save you from annihilation.

136
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:08,287
Well, well.

137
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:12,048
Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge, are you?

138
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,057
You want peace, this is the price.

139
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:18,749
You'll discontinue the production of Shimmer?

140
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,050
Half there already.

141
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,804
Return the Gemstone.

142
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,503
And I need Jinx.

143
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:26,633
She has to pay for what she's done.

144
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,970
They weren't her crimes. She was working for me.

145
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,519
Believe me, if I had it my way,
it'd be you rotting in Stillwater,

146
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:39,029
but we can't make a deal with
a snake and cut off its head.

147
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,328
We both have our shitty parts to play.

148
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:45,597
Get me Jinx. And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.

149
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,812
Astonishing.

150
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,540
You say all this came about in your own brief lifespan?

151
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,409
How were you able to accomplish so much so quickly?

152
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,940
You'd be surprised what you can
pull off when your life depends on it.

153
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:34,809
Uh, why this form?

154
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:38,946
Surely, there are more efficient
and safer methods of transportation.

155
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:41,826
Firelights!

156
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:42,788
Huh?

157
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:43,607
Hmm?

158
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:50,308
Oh.

159
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,145
It's not enough to give people what they need to survive,

160
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,474
you have to give them what they need to live.

161
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:09,251
A thousand times I've imagined this moment.

162
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,204
Never like this.

163
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:15,088
All we ever wanted.

164
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,804
The boy didn't even haggle.

165
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,439
And what do I lose but problems?

166
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,743
Oh, it all makes sense now, brother.

167
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,010
Is there anything so undoing as a daughter?

168
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,089
Damn it.

169
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:22,237
Piss off.

170
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,723
Everyone out.

171
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:54,160
Well, your guard needs working.

172
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,726
I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo.

173
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,674
But I'd be lying.

174
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,431
What I can say is…

175
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:06,439
She still needs you.

176
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:07,856
They all do.

177
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,804
So what do you say?

178
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:18,520
That's my girl.

179
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,597
Silco.

180
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,543
Bravo, sis.

181
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:52,085
Councilors…

182
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:57,424
My recent unsanctioned activities in
the underground have shown me two things.

183
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:01,194
I'm not fit to govern the people who live there.

184
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,022
And neither are you.

185
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:06,050
Our opportunity to demonstrate our compassion,

186
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,839
our dedication,

187
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:11,156
our solidarity has passed.

188
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,889
They're right not to trust us.

189
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,765
You're walking a fine line, Jayce.

190
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,312
With respect, I don't give a shit
what any of you think of me anymore.

191
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:26,371
Except you.

192
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,126
You were right.

193
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:30,236
You were always right.

194
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:34,267
My days here are numbered, but I've come with Viktor,

195
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:38,289
my partner and a Zaunite, with one final proposal.

196
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:43,992
Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.

197
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:48,864
In exchange for the undercity's independence.

198
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,590
What? Nonsense! We have procedures…

199
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,409
Really thought I buried this place.

200
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:34,433
But I should have known better.

201
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,453
Powder?

202
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,847
Nothing ever stays dead.

203
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:44,537
Are we alone?

204
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,231
For now.

205
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:49,951
Maybe forever.

206
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:53,591
Wanna know a secret?

207
00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:57,506
Silco thinks he made Jinx,

208
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:02,678
with all his rants and his hard-won lessons.

209
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,742
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."

210
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,912
"Be what they fear, Jinx."

211
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:11,929
Like everything was the same as when Vander left him.

212
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,634
But he didn't make Jinx.

213
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,760
You did.

214
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:22,032
I'm sorry, Powder.

215
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:24,770
I never meant to leave you.

216
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:26,758
You never left.

217
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,308
I always heard you.

218
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:34,210
Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck.

219
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:37,371
Your voice.

220
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,182
Pushing me.

221
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:42,931
Picking me up when all the colors were black.

222
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,589
You're the reason I'm still alive.

223
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:50,716
I spent so many nights in that shitty prison.

224
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:54,695
On the freezing floor, hungry, bloody, counting the hours.

225
00:25:55,986 --> 00:25:57,079
The only thing…

226
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:01,308
The only thing that kept me going
was the thought of getting back to you.

227
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:08,704
Are we still sisters?

228
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:13,312
Nothing is ever going to change that.

229
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:19,589
I always knew you'd come back.

230
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:20,688
What's going on?

231
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:37,106
No.

232
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,784
He took everything from us.

233
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,941
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.

234
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,983
Just like he planned to do with me.

235
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:50,827
All the time saying you abandoned
me when he knew the truth.

236
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:53,326
Liar.

237
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:58,010
Mm. We're missing someone.

238
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:23,999
Huh?

239
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:31,124
I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.

240
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:33,953
What did you do?

241
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:35,951
I made her a snack.

242
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,361
No!

243
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:46,554
Sheesh.

244
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,342
I'm not that crazy.

245
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,669
Powder! Leave her out of this.

246
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:08,706
Now…

247
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,136
Where should I sit?

248
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,683
That's your choice, really.

249
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,357
Make her go away. Please.

250
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,518
Send her on her way and...

251
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:35,814
And you can have Powder back.

252
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:37,892
Mm.

253
00:28:39,872 --> 00:28:40,741
I can't.

254
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:41,399
Ah.

255
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:44,949
No! Powder, listen.

256
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:47,071
We… we can just go.

257
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,973
We'll leave and never come back.

258
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,177
Where would we go?

259
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:54,584
No, no, no. She's not saying that.

260
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:59,494
It's true, we'll put this behind us.
You'll never have to see him again, Powder.

261
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,853
What do you have to say about that?

262
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:09,210
Her name is Jinx!

263
00:29:09,677 --> 00:29:10,604
She's lying.

264
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:16,404
You'll be with her a day before she realizes you
aren't that girl anymore and turns her back on you.

265
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:17,546
Mm-hmm.

266
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,908
You aren't lying?

267
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:22,800
You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.

268
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:23,967
I'm not lying.

269
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,544
I'm on your side. I promise.

270
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:36,099
Shut up! We're talking!

271
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,900
The topsiders offered me everything.

272
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:41,596
Independence, a seat at the table.

273
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,432
All in return for you.

274
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:45,616
They can all burn.

275
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:50,006
Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her.

276
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,694
They will never understand.

277
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:55,171
It's only us.

278
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:58,385
You're my daughter.

279
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,376
I'll never forsake you.

280
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:05,587
Drop the gun!

281
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:21,751
No. Please.

282
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:34,589
No! Stop!

283
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,069
Drop the gun.

284
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,851
Wait! She's my sister.

285
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:51,684
Vi, she's too far gone.

286
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:05,200
No, no, no.

287
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:15,373
Look out!

288
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:23,662
You see, now finish it.

289
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:26,964
Damn it! Powder, wake up!

290
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,932
Remember who you are! I know you remember!

291
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,731
Picture Mylo! Claggor!

292
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:36,863
Stop.

293
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:37,652
Vander!

294
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,179
Shut up! Don't listen to her!

295
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:40,239
Dad!

296
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:43,607
Mom!

297
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,596
Me!

298
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,160
No!

299
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:31,935
No…

300
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,547
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

301
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:37,911
I'm sorry…

302
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:43,306
I never would have given you to them.

303
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:45,926
Not for anything.

304
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:49,070
Don't cry.

305
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:51,878
You're perfect.

306
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:23,813
Powder?

307
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:27,971
It's okay.

308
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,937
We'll be okay.

309
00:33:56,902 --> 00:34:00,895
I thought maybe you could love me like you used to.

310
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:07,931
Even though I'm… different.

311
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,336
But you changed too.

312
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:18,849
So…

313
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:22,124
Here's to the new us.

314
00:35:02,228 --> 00:35:03,062
We'll show them.

315
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:06,676
We will show them all.

316
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,371
I support Councilor Talis' proposal for peace.
