1
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,118
You really went to the undercity to get these?

2
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:17,184
Weren't you afraid?

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,390
A little danger is worth the risk, don't you think?

4
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,145
Oh.

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,177
Uh, careful.

6
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:23,957
That's your parents' money you're dropping.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,123
Powder, we've gotta go!

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,832
Hello? Is someone in there?

9
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:36,139
Hey, open up!

10
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,499
Jayce?

11
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:08,516
Jayce!

12
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:22,885
Mom!

13
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,702
Mom. Mom, wake up.

14
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:29,068
Mom.

15
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:33,927
Help! Please, someone, help us!

16
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,670
Help! Please!

17
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,959
No. Wait. Wait.

18
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:09,640
How?

19
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,237
Let's go over it again.

20
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,390
You have to believe me. I didn't do this.

21
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:40,881
Relax, kid. We know it was a
break-in but that doesn't explain this.

22
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,006
There's a lot of restricted items
here and I don't see any permits.

23
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,681
You wanna tell me how you got them?

24
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:49,449
Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please.

25
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,922
I believe someone should have said that earlier.

26
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,948
What happened here?

27
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,914
Science, I guess?

28
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,893
Last time I checked, science
didn't require illegal equipment.

29
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,967
Nor was this approved by the
Academy. Who authorized your research?

30
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:10,306
It was an independent study. Who are you anyway?

31
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,447
I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy,

32
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:15,642
who it may serve you to remember
is also head of the Council.

33
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:20,400
He sent me here to ensure that
anything dangerous is removed safely.

34
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,942
Which, according to my list, includes you.

35
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,498
What? How am I dangerous?

36
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,542
Uh, that's for the council to decide.

37
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,288
Imprisonment. What a curious principle.

38
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:05,304
We confine the physical body, yet the mind is still free.

39
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,349
I do love a good conundrum.

40
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,598
I remember the first time I saw you at the Academy.

41
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,335
You reminded me of myself.

42
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:18,234
A scientist ready to forge a
new vector of experimentation.

43
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:21,644
But sometimes we venture too far.

44
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,454
No great science should ever put lives in danger.

45
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,912
Be honest, now. What manner of inquiry was this?

46
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,365
Professor Heimerdinger, I…

47
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,440
I believe I've discovered something truly incredible.

48
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:37,295
A way to harness magic through science.

49
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:38,275
Magic?

50
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,122
Yes.

51
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,015
No.

52
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:41,085
No?

53
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:43,631
The Arcane is dangerous, Jayce.

54
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:46,823
A force of nature. Science cannot control it.

55
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,162
But maybe it can.

56
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:51,797
I'm close to a breakthrough, I know it.

57
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,743
How old are you, my boy?

58
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,580
I'm… I'm 24.

59
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:57,534
Ah.

60
00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:00,752
Well, I am now 307 years old.

61
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,682
All my life, I've pursued the mysteries of science,

62
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:08,759
only to discover some are better left unsolved.

63
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,722
This, I'm afraid, is one of them.

64
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:16,026
Own your mistakes before the
Council, admit your work was dangerous,

65
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:19,038
but speak nothing of magic.

66
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:25,719
Do that and I theorize you'll get away
with, um, how do you say, a slap on the wrist.

67
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:51,438
Remind me why we bother with this dump.

68
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:55,137
Vander said to lay low.

69
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:58,642
Enforcers never come down here,
so this is as good a place as any.

70
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:02,714
Oh, what's the matter, Mylo? You
worried Powder's gonna beat you again?

71
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,876
Hey, if she didn't keep fixing these things,

72
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:06,124
I wouldn't keep missing.

73
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,082
You guys know I wouldn't take you
on a job you couldn't handle, right?

74
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:23,124
Are you kidding? That was the best job we've ever done.

75
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:26,194
Maybe just don't take Powder next time.

76
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:28,134
Um…

77
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,559
Get back.

78
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,432
Tell me where I can find them.

79
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,412
Topsider business ain't my concern.

80
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,709
It's every one of you trencher's concern now.

81
00:08:58,113 --> 00:08:59,402
Give me a name.

82
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,508
Hey, guys? You should see this...

83
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:21,949
Search them.

84
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,862
Go ahead, idiots. We've got nothing.

85
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:52,286
Go!

86
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,098
Go!

87
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:05,838
Come on!

88
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:14,688
Get them!

89
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,442
Over here!

90
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,737
You need to hide those crystals.

91
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,168
Yeah, no shit.

92
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,917
The House Ferros received your letter.

93
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,761
They insist business is steady.

94
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,505
Steady is stagnant, Elora.

95
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,804
They wished me to remind you that
it's thanks to their innovations

96
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,934
that you are the richest person in Piltover.

97
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,423
Yet I remain the poorest Medarda.

98
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:00,577
Excellent choice, Councilor Medarda. Supreme challenge.

99
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,373
If I may…

100
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:04,581
We need something revolutionary, Elora.

101
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:07,478
Something to put Piltover on the map.

102
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,820
What of today's trial?

103
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:12,147
His name is Jayce of House Talis.

104
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:14,522
A House? Remind me.

105
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:15,620
They're toolmakers.

106
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,485
I believe they came to renown for their design of the…

107
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:20,125
collapsible pocket wrench.

108
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:22,791
But Heimerdinger favors him?

109
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,151
As far as I can tell.

110
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:25,362
Hmm.

111
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:27,142
This one.

112
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:31,118
But that's… Well, that's a child's toy.

113
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:33,512
Good.

114
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:39,236
The boy's got ambition.

115
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,223
It's why we supported him in the first place.

116
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:44,229
Ambition? Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter.

117
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,535
Jayce had nothing to do with that. He was robbed.

118
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,318
We need to help him.

119
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,567
Caitlyn's right.

120
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:52,755
We've known Jayce for years. Besides, we're his patrons.

121
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,601
If anyone is meant to speak up for him, it's us.

122
00:11:57,073 --> 00:12:00,271
We should hit them back. We've
got the numbers to beat them.

123
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,776
Yeah. Let's teach them what it means to mess with us.

124
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:03,979
Yeah!

125
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,857
You sure that's what you want?

126
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,803
Let's do it.

127
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:18,016
We crossed that bridge once before,
and we all know how that ended.

128
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,776
You're just protecting your kids.

129
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,705
I'm protecting our people. I'd
do the same for any one of you.

130
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,242
We look out for each other. It's the way it's always been.

131
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:33,974
This will blow over. We just need to stand together.

132
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:37,506
The Vander I knew, the one who built the underground,

133
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,526
wouldn't be afraid to fight.

134
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,078
Do I look afraid?

135
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:47,516
No.

136
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:49,458
You look weak.

137
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,585
Why isn't he doing anything?

138
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,431
We kicked the Enforcers' butts with just the four of us.

139
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,384
Imagine what the whole of the Lanes could do.

140
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,336
Jeez, even Powder wants to fight.

141
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,120
So, why aren't we?

142
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,857
Spill it, Ekko.

143
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:16,118
Um…

144
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, okay. Well, um, Vander's
got a deal with the Enforcers.

145
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:23,213
What deal?

146
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:42,918
For your birthday, Councilor.

147
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,473
Ah, Mel, this is too kind.

148
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,890
I'm told it was built only for the sharpest of minds.

149
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:53,165
And I bought you some Ginko nuts.

150
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,306
Don't you know I'm allergic?

151
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,482
What are you trying to do? Kill an old man?

152
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,430
Jayce Talis.

153
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:39,383
You are accused of illegal experimentation
and endangering the citizens of Piltover.

154
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:41,938
What do you have to say for yourself?

155
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:50,915
The materials were far more dangerous than I was aware of,

156
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:55,297
and I… I now know my actions
were against Academy regulations.

157
00:14:55,765 --> 00:15:00,018
What I did endangered people. It
was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry.

158
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:05,631
I ask the Council's forgiveness, and
I hope that I can continue my studies.

159
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,472
As Jayce's patron of many years,
I can speak for his character.

160
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:11,236
I believe that one day,

161
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,598
he will be a great contributor to our society.

162
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,706
He destroyed a building.

163
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:19,307
Is this the sort of contribution we can expect?

164
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,810
If you were a scientist,

165
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:24,657
you'd know you can't make a prototype
without breaking a few wrenches.

166
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:28,042
Do you have anything to show
for your work besides an explosion?

167
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,624
Uh, no. It came to nothing.

168
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,441
So, you're saying your study was meaningless?

169
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:35,064
It was revolutionary!

170
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:36,416
Revolutionary how?

171
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:40,012
All I see is a boy meddling
with things he doesn't understand.

172
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,102
The Academy seems to have loosened its standards.

173
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,807
This is a fine line. If we condone this, what's next?

174
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:46,479
Ridiculous, really.

175
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,956
The Council has more important matters to deal with.

176
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,329
Perhaps we should just finish this…

177
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,322
I was trying to create magic.

178
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,957
Magic?

179
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:03,627
Arcane talents are something you're born with.

180
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:05,742
They can't be fabricated.

181
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,981
Actually, I believe it is possible.

182
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,074
Has anyone even tried it before?

183
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:19,220
The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.

184
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,931
Surely, we, the pioneers of science, can use it for good.

185
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:27,398
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it?

186
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:28,415
Jayce, enough.

187
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:32,530
This is the city of progress,
think of the wonders we could create.

188
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,305
Let me prove...

189
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,030
Enough!

190
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,835
You don't understand what's at stake.

191
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,933
But how can you?

192
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,213
That's a burden that only I here carry.

193
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:45,643
Time.

194
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:50,731
I've seen this power in the wrong hands.

195
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:57,033
It corrupts, consumes, lays waste to civilizations.

196
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:03,405
That cannot happen here, my boy. It must not.

197
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,015
Heimerdinger is right.

198
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,954
Piltover was founded to escape the warmongering of mages,

199
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,349
not cultivate it.

200
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:15,870
The Ethos is clear. He must be banished from Piltover.

201
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,492
Please, let me speak!

202
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:28,344
As a lower house, my voice doesn't carry much weight here.

203
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:32,336
But as a mother, I have a voice that matters deeply.

204
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,970
My son isn't in his right mind.

205
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,884
His entire life, he's chased an impossible dream.

206
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:45,082
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.

207
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:49,848
But he has a good heart. Please, let him come home.

208
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:54,423
A crime like this can't be
overlooked. The boy must be punished.

209
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,940
A violation of the Ethos calls for banishment,

210
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,083
but I can sympathize with a young
man's dream to change the world.

211
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:06,335
Perhaps in this matter, a lesser sentence may suffice.

212
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:10,286
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled from the Academy

213
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:13,016
and remanded to the care of his parents.

214
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,162
All those in favor?

215
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,784
You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,

216
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:37,391
but he is to never set foot on Academy grounds again.

217
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:15,217
First time I've been invited to
the Lanes. It better be worth my time.

218
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:19,231
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.

219
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:23,373
You carry your chin so high, you
fail to see the opportunity below.

220
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:24,532
Who are you?

221
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,384
You're looking for four children,

222
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:30,721
the ones running circles around Piltover's finest.

223
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,736
What about it?

224
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,542
Don't look so concerned.

225
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:36,844
I'm about to make your day.

226
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:49,875
Can I come in?

227
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:55,281
Hmm.

228
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:59,358
I still remember the look on
your face when you found these.

229
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:08,051
Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken, you'd be lost to me.

230
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:10,951
I had to say something.

231
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,491
Magic saved your life.

232
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:19,665
Yes, but it won't save yours now. You need to let it go.

233
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,149
I could've convinced the Council.

234
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,849
If my own family won't help
me, I'll find someone who will.

235
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:40,045
Oh. That foolish boy.

236
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,329
Yeah, I must admit, his theory intrigues.

237
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:47,533
If dangerous ideas didn't excite the
imagination, we would never wander astray.

238
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:52,581
Could it work? Could these stones really invoke magic?

239
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,998
Nonsense. It's far too unstable.

240
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:57,096
Could you stabilize it?

241
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,971
Me? Why would I?

242
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:01,206
That only leads to more problems,

243
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,498
and that poor boy has enough of them already.

244
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:08,349
There. Come tomorrow morning, his
research will be safely disposed of.

245
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:09,835
Lock up.

246
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:16,358
No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous in the wrong hands.

247
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:21,302
Will he live?

248
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:23,577
Long enough.

249
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:35,629
Beautiful, aren't they?

250
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:40,724
Yet, up there on the surface,

251
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,520
no one even knows they exist.

252
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:45,427
They're monsters.

253
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:51,183
There's a monster inside all of us.

254
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:56,693
What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!

255
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,988
I'd like to let you in on a very important secret

256
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:05,574
I learned when I was about your age, boy.

257
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:09,381
You see, power,

258
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:14,324
real power doesn't come to those who were born strongest,

259
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,849
or fastest, or smartest.

260
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:19,124
No.

261
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:24,598
It comes to those who will do anything to achieve it.

262
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:28,835
It's time to let the monster out.

263
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,777
They won't see you.

264
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,014
Your name's no good now.

265
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:25,672
My dad says you're a misfit, and
that we can't be friends anymore.

266
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,300
So, why are you out here?

267
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,962
I'm a misfit too, I suppose.

268
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,286
What will you do?

269
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,020
Join the Talis hammer business, I guess.

270
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:40,393
You can't do that.

271
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,739
No, I can't.

272
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:49,024
Come inside, Caitlyn. Now.

273
00:23:57,706 --> 00:24:00,348
I'm sorry. I just wanted to explain…

274
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:01,612
I think you've done enough.

275
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:10,436
You said this was a robbery.

276
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:12,465
Did they take anything dangerous?

277
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:13,376
Hard to say.

278
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:17,377
We don't exactly know what we
did find, let alone what we didn't.

279
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,636
This mention of magic has the people afraid.

280
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:23,159
The culprits must be apprehended.

281
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,956
We're doing our best, Councilor. I assure you.

282
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:29,894
Your attitude makes me question
if your best is up to the task.

283
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,914
Oh, we'll find them. Don't worry.

284
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:36,546
We've conducted exhaustive interrogations,
frozen commerce for half the district.

285
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:38,463
With all due respect, Councilor,

286
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,929
don't you think we've pushed them hard enough?

287
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,553
Do whatever it takes.

288
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,248
Turn the undercity upside down if you have to.

289
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:48,045
Just find them!

290
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:02,278
Welcome to The Last Drop.

291
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:12,002
What can I get you?

292
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,680
Four sump-rats will do.

293
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,325
Search the place.

294
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:24,130
While you're wasting your time, how about a proper drink?

295
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,452
I'll take the strongest shit you got.

296
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,595
Mm. You be careful with that.

297
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,676
Nearly forgot. I ran into an old friend of yours.

298
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:36,400
He had some stories.

299
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,183
You weren't always the peacekeeper, were you?

300
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:55,754
Yeah, well, you can't escape the past. Right?

301
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,944
Be a shame if I had to put them on again.

302
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,339
Cast iron's, well, it's hard to clean.

303
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:59,031
You people down here are all the same,

304
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,819
mistaking arrogance for bravery.

305
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,734
You think you're standing up for something,

306
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:09,292
but we all know there is a crime behind
every coin that passes through this place.

307
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:16,948
You're just a small man in a
little hole the world forgot to bury.

308
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,343
And I'm gonna bury the lot of you.

309
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:34,938
Are you all okay?

310
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:40,218
No, we're not okay. They almost
saw Powder. What if they took her?

311
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,249
No one is taking any of you.

312
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:43,441
Never let that happen.

313
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:45,213
It's already happening.

314
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:48,909
You heard him, they won't stop. We need to fight back.

315
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:54,099
And if you won't, I will.

316
00:28:56,812 --> 00:28:58,711
I've heard this kind of talk before.

317
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:28,444
Why are we here?

318
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,161
You still don't understand.

319
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,644
What I don't understand is how you can work with them.

320
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,974
We were here. We saw what they did.

321
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:45,242
I grew up knowing I'm less than
them, that my place is down there.

322
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:49,972
I want Powder to have more than
that, and I'm willing to fight for it.

323
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:56,196
So was I. I was angry, just like you.

324
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:01,264
I led us across this bridge, thinking things could change.

325
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:04,181
If I hadn't…

326
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:07,795
your parents would still be alive.

327
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:13,302
I know you wanna hurt the
topsiders for what they've done to us.

328
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:15,637
But who are you willing to lose?

329
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,193
Mylo? Claggor?

330
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,478
Powder?

331
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:30,124
Nobody wins in war, Vi.

332
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:38,671
What are we gonna do?

333
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:41,650
The Enforcers will come back.

334
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:48,665
I… I don't know. I'll, uh, I'll figure it out.

335
00:31:39,956 --> 00:31:41,194
Am I interrupting?

336
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:46,352
The hell's your problem?

337
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:49,748
What's that? Another list with my name on it?

338
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,172
Actually, yes, but only because you signed your notes.

339
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:58,847
Every page, I might add. Eh, a
little egotistical, don't you think?

340
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,698
Is that why you came? To insult me?

341
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:07,622
No, no, I was… I was intrigued
by what you said at the trial.

342
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,399
That makes you the only one.

343
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,248
Yes, well, I wanted to talk about your work.

344
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,113
This Hextech theory of yours.

345
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:16,323
It's not a theory.

346
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:21,631
I saw with my own eyes what magic
can do, the lives it could save.

347
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:24,788
You've no idea how beautiful it is.

348
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,088
And now it's gone. No one believed me.

349
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:33,259
Nobody's ever believed in me.

350
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,893
A poor cripple from the undercity.

351
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,734
I was an outsider the moment I stepped foot in Piltover.

352
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,299
I didn't have the benefits of a patron or a name.

353
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,203
I simply believed in myself.

354
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:53,721
Which is why I'm here because
I think you're on to something.

355
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:56,818
I want to help you complete your research.

356
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:59,287
No one thinks it can be done.

357
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,456
When you're going to change the
world, don't ask for permission.

358
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,722
I don't even know your name.

359
00:33:22,244 --> 00:33:23,109
It's Viktor.

360
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:32,240
Vi, where you been?

361
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,879
Rumor is the Lanes are gonna fight.

362
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:42,748
Look, I made them for the Enforcers.

363
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:46,123
These are smoke bombs, and those two are full of nails.

364
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:49,776
They're gonna work this time, I know it.

365
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:52,885
Me too.

366
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:04,863
You know, Powder, what makes
you different makes you strong.

367
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,262
Always remember that, okay?

368
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,933
What the hell were you thinking, going into The Last Drop?

369
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:21,270
Do you have any idea what you've done?

370
00:34:21,294 --> 00:34:22,808
I was getting results!

371
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,136
You heard the Council.

372
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,101
You're a fool.

373
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:27,665
There is no stopping what happens now.

374
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,331
Maybe it's not too late.
