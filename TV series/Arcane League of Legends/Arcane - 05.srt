1
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:43,727
Hmm.

2
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:31,412
That was quite some shooting, Kiramman.

3
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,035
Did my parents pay you to let me win?

4
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:37,526
Hmm… That's a serious accusation.

5
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,849
You held your shot, I saw you.

6
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,562
The trophy is yours. You earned it.

7
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,978
You haven't answered my question.

8
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:49,909
No, your parents didn't pay me.

9
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,691
I just thought you deserved it.

10
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,731
I'm an enforcer.

11
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:02,697
For me, knowing how to handle this
weapon means being able to protect people.

12
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:07,102
To be of service to the city. And that's trophy enough.

13
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:12,089
Begs the question, young
Kiramman. What are you shooting for?

14
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:23,358
I took a look at your file.

15
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:27,623
There's no record of you or
your crimes. What are you here for?

16
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,453
My sunny personality.

17
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:33,016
You attacked an inmate. Why?

18
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,309
Why not?

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,487
He was a witness in an ongoing investigation.

20
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:39,287
Hmm, bummer.

21
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,287
This was a waste of time.

22
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,331
Couldn't have put it better.

23
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:46,153
Hey, give Silco a kiss on that
winning eye of his, will you?

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,655
Silco? The industrialist?

25
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:53,553
Okay, this is getting old.

26
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:57,225
Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick the
shit out of me, so I can get on with my night?

27
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,290
Does this mean anything to you?

28
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,160
Where did you get this?

29
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:19,349
My question first. He worked for Silco?

30
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,409
Uh, they all do.

31
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,611
How can anyone not know that? Where did you find this?

32
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,336
There was an attack. This is evidence.

33
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,971
I need proof if I'm to believe
what you're saying about Silco.

34
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:34,682
I could get it for you. Just not from in here.

35
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:40,060
In what mad world would I trust someone like you?

36
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,234
Someone like me?

37
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:45,748
You enforcers are all the same. Just
asshole criminals in fancy uniforms.

38
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,619
You know what? Find Silco yourself.

39
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,085
I will, thank you.

40
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,419
Hmm… Undercity's gonna eat you alive.

41
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:02,627
I've got orders from Councilor
Talis, concerning Inmate 516.

42
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,277
Not cooperative, huh?

43
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,492
You, uh, you want us to have a chat with her?

44
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:10,108
No.

45
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,059
Oh.

46
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,349
It's for her release.

47
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:16,370
Huh. Since when's he a Councilor?

48
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:18,356
Since today.

49
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,172
How many chats have you had with her?

50
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:30,015
You know, I never even thought to count.

51
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:08,280
These brave Enforcers sacrificed their
lives to defend the values of our great city.

52
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:11,659
To some, they are mothers…

53
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:14,402
fathers,

54
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,735
sons…

55
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:20,952
daughters…

56
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:26,870
but to all, they are heroes.

57
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:54,767
Who was this, Daddy?

58
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,326
A good woman.

59
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:11,486
You said you could control her. I lost six officers. Six!

60
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:16,633
She pushed it too far this time. The Council's up in arms.

61
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,974
I can't make this go away for you
unless you give me something to work with.

62
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,888
Arresting her would be doing you a favor.

63
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:26,108
I don't need favors.

64
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,670
I need you to do your job.

65
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,523
The Firelights have been a thorn in both our sides.

66
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:39,227
They ambushed my shipment at the
Hexgates on the same day as the attack.

67
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:43,419
It seems to me the Council has its culprit.

68
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,975
Oh, that's tidy for you.

69
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,760
What if I'm not interested in playing along?

70
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,460
We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus.

71
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:53,873
Sheriff.

72
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,217
And there is more yet to achieve.

73
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,999
I hope you can remain a part of it.

74
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,348
For their families. From an anonymous, concerned citizen.

75
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:30,436
Yesterday's smuggling fiasco was nothing.

76
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,443
These manifests are full of
discrepancies, dating back months.

77
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,390
This is a poor use of our time.

78
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm a Councilor now, Viktor.

79
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,757
It's my responsibility to make sure
the Hexgates are safe and protected.

80
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:46,003
What about our pledge to improve lives,
for those in need? For the undercity?

81
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:50,792
Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce
our other projects in my speech.

82
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:52,064
Soon, we can do everything we...

83
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:52,909
Soon?

84
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,186
There are people who need our help now, Jayce.

85
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:58,770
You wanted to see me?

86
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,651
Have your people ever reviewed these logs?

87
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,780
Mr. Talis, I assure you...

88
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:03,525
Councilor.

89
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:07,961
And the only assurance I need is that you will
search and seize any unauthorized merchandise.

90
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,362
I've made a list of suspicious transactions.

91
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:12,596
All due respect, Councilor,

92
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:13,708
today's your first day...

93
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:14,326
Second.

94
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:15,347
Right.

95
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:18,186
You sure you don't want to confer
with the other Councilors before...

96
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,044
This corruption runs deep, Sheriff.

97
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,612
I intend to root it out.

98
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:25,313
Have you made any progress with the stolen Gemstone?

99
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,357
Yes. Chief suspect is an undercity gang.

100
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,768
They call themselves the Firelights.

101
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:36,127
They operate like phantoms, doing hit-and-runs
on civilians and disappearing into the night.

102
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:37,887
How soon till we track them down?

103
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,360
I've got my best officers on it.

104
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:51,061
Viktor? You all right?

105
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:56,077
A… a headache. I just… I need to get to the lab.

106
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,123
Boring…

107
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:09,899
Boring. Wow. Super boring…

108
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,281
Here we go!

109
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:17,362
It's all about these runes.

110
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,518
They form some kind of math-y, magic-y gateway.

111
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:28,536
To the realm of heebie-jeebies. And this… Turns it on.

112
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:32,095
So… here goes.

113
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:04,505
No!

114
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,428
No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.

115
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,376
I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.

116
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,669
That could be a good way to get a lay of the land.

117
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,153
Too risky.

118
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:27,685
What…

119
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:43,238
Nice jacket.

120
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,109
Welcome to the Lanes.

121
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:00,589
You almost got me killed.

122
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,774
My little sister could do that when she was seven.

123
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,346
All us fissure folk can. Don't you want to blend in?

124
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:17,754
You had a vision?

125
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:20,007
What if we've been looking at it backwards?

126
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:25,841
We've been trying to discover runes that invoke specific
effects and then molding them to a useful function.

127
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,485
Tools, as you like to put it. But, but…

128
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:33,361
If the legends are true, mages
aren't bound to single functions.

129
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:36,284
It's said the Arcane speaks through them.

130
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,645
I'm still not following.

131
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:41,701
They think. They adapt.

132
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,118
You think Hextech can… learn?

133
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:51,227
Are you sure this is safe?

134
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,301
Of course not.

135
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:11,303
Oh, Jericho! Have I missed these.

136
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:16,258
Hmm?

137
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:18,543
No. Thank you.

138
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,034
You're missing out.

139
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,428
Are you going to question him?

140
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:23,967
About what? The meat?

141
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:27,276
Definitely not above board.

142
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:31,155
Silco. His connections? Isn't that why we're here?

143
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,834
We're here because I'm hungry. Do
you know what prison food is like?

144
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,174
No, of course, you don't.

145
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:40,590
Unbelievable. I didn't break you out of jail to eat… slop.

146
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:44,758
I knew this was a terrible idea. You
don't actually know anything, do you?

147
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,117
Mm. Better than I remember.

148
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,238
Hmm.

149
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,761
I haven't been here in years.

150
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,125
Since my parents brought me for the winter fest.

151
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:17,288
We're not here for the
performance. Your House is in trouble.

152
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:21,842
That merchant formerly enjoyed certain leniencies

153
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:26,634
with regard to her trade in exchange
for her generous Academy patronage.

154
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,347
By leniencies you mean corruption?

155
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,058
Hmm, Amara's harmless.

156
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,568
Oh, look at those two stooges.

157
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,039
Councilors Hoskel and Salo. Don't they hate each other?

158
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:40,668
Hmm. But they share a taste for the finer Noxian spirits,

159
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:43,374
technically an illegal import.

160
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,347
I tightened our security.

161
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:49,457
And in so doing, put a target on your back.

162
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:54,611
There are those who covet your power
over the wealth the Hexgates afford.

163
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:57,292
And would take any opportunity to seize it from you.

164
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,121
You've just made yourself everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

165
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,590
Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?

166
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,996
You worried Powder's gonna beat you again.

167
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:26,311
Vander.

168
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,542
Because you're a jinx!

169
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,990
What makes you different makes you strong.

170
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:26,514
Hmm.

171
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:30,201
Well, that place does look like it
has bodies buried in the basement.

172
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:35,218
You don't know anything.

173
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:50,546
I can't compromise the safety
of the Hexgates for collateral.

174
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:55,317
No one's asking you to. These
are simply favors amongst friends.

175
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:58,737
I never wanted anything to do
with politics. You pushed this on me.

176
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,298
You're a symbol of the future now,
Jayce, whether you like it or not.

177
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:05,811
With that comes the potential to shape your own destiny.

178
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:11,311
The Council assumes you'll fail. Time
to prove them all wrong. Once again.

179
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:16,569
Welcome, Amara. How's little Rohan?

180
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:20,386
Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.

181
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,847
He's just as precocious as ever.

182
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:30,634
I had quite a shock this morning.
Enforcers banging on my door.

183
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:34,564
Oh, I hope you'll understand,
Jayce had to make a show of safety.

184
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,037
But he's here now to negotiate all his deals personally.

185
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:43,335
Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate former
trade privileges to those who share his vision.

186
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:45,299
Can we count you amongst them?

187
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:49,644
Councilor Bolbok seems to think other
arrangements would be more profitable.

188
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,372
The man's a fool.

189
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:53,710
With him, you'd be investing in the past.

190
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:56,526
With us, you'd be investing in the future.

191
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,232
You know, Councilor Medarda's right.
The Hexgates are only the beginning.

192
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:06,678
In fact, we're currently looking for
new partners in our Hextech research,

193
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,577
and as a supporter of House Talis,

194
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:11,307
you'd be the first in line to any of our advancements.

195
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:19,907
How can I say no to such an auspicious offer?

196
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,611
Hextech partners?

197
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,245
Has a nice ring, doesn't it?

198
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:30,005
Mm. Your audience awaits, Councilor.

199
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,368
He's been quite the investment.

200
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:41,417
Indeed. Better than expected.

201
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,191
The one place all the secrets are spilled.

202
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,804
Oh.

203
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:56,253
How exactly do you propose we go about this?

204
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,786
Let 'em think you work here.

205
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:00,197
Excuse me?

206
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:02,353
I will not.

207
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:03,940
You know what your problem is?

208
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:05,655
Please. Tell me.

209
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,986
You expect everyone to give you what you want.

210
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:12,669
If you really want people to talk to you, you
have to let them think you have what they want.

211
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:14,283
And what do I have?

212
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,775
You're hot, cupcake.

213
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,854
So what'll it be, man or woman?

214
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,727
Um…

215
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:27,664
Hi.

216
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:30,462
I'm Pim. What's your name?

217
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:36,439
Matilda. But you can call her whatever you want.

218
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,236
Ah, yes. Matilda.

219
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:43,592
My parents named me Matilda.

220
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:47,694
After my great-grandmother Matilda, the, uh…

221
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:52,738
Would you believe it?

222
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:03,705
Sheriff, what a lovely surprise.

223
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,030
The Hextech wonder boy is on the Council now,

224
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:09,491
and he's asking questions.

225
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,609
It's only a matter of time before he finds the truth.

226
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:15,798
What is truth, but a survivor's story?

227
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,575
If I'm discovered, we're both finished.

228
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:22,381
Good thing you've located proof
of the Firelights' involvement.

229
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,492
This has gone too far.

230
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:36,645
Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero?

231
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:42,060
One final act to make you the
martyr you've always seen yourself as?

232
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:51,750
Then what are you waiting for?

233
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,617
Ah, he's faltering.

234
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,538
You need to weaponize the Hextech soon.

235
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:13,815
Once we've cracked their prize,
topside will have no power over us.

236
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:18,290
I can't do it. Just… give it to the doctor.

237
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:21,061
You're the only one I can trust with this, Jinx.

238
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:25,315
I keep… seeing them. That day.

239
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,282
Fear haunts us all, child.

240
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:38,145
Sweetheart, I was real sad to hear about Vander.

241
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:41,790
And the kids. Just terrible.

242
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:44,942
By the looks of it, no one down
here lifted a finger to stop Silco.

243
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:49,975
A few tried but Silco's got the muscle… and the money.

244
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:52,035
He took over the Last Drop.

245
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:53,478
I saw.

246
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:57,095
Things have changed without Vander looking out for us.

247
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,058
Have you heard anything about
Powder? I think Silco has her.

248
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,692
I have to find her.

249
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,650
Silco's number two's a regular.

250
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,010
I can have Miguel tell you where to find her.

251
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,069
I owe you.

252
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:17,204
It's nothing.

253
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,877
I've only ever imagined the gardens…

254
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:25,852
This is all I've seen.

255
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:40,647
You did well today.

256
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:42,603
I had a good teacher.

257
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:48,142
It's only a matter of time before those old
fools on the Council officially accept your research.

258
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:54,374
My father put hammers in the hands of the
people, and they built this magnificent city.

259
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:58,590
Imagine the wonders they could
create if we put magic in their hands.

260
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,317
The world will never be the same.

261
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,833
The Medardas usually only take from the world.

262
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:09,012
We're not often in the position to give anything back.

263
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,952
I couldn't have done it without you.

264
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:17,689
Hmm.

265
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:42,777
It's beautiful.

266
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,461
I can't figure out why it's not working.

267
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:46,801
You will.

268
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:53,070
Are you headed home soon? I
thought we could walk together.

269
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:56,715
I'm, uh, probably going to sleep here tonight.

270
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,632
Again? You know there's always tomorrow, right?

271
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:02,805
Good night, Miss Young.

272
00:27:59,002 --> 00:27:59,565
Mm.

273
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,728
I almost drowned in these waters.

274
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,423
You told me a million times.

275
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,324
Vander wasn't the man you thought he was.

276
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,218
Right, he was like a brother to you, and
he turned his back and blah, blah, blah.

277
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:03,825
Did I miss anything?

278
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:07,265
I've got a new one for you.

279
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:17,242
That day, I let a weak man die.

280
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:28,205
And another was reborn.

281
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:35,277
Betrayal, that pain that feels like
it'll eat you from the inside out,

282
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:40,472
can either break you or forge you into something greater.

283
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,952
You need to let Powder die.

284
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:47,596
So the fear of pain will no longer control you.

285
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:53,927
You're strong now. Just like you were always meant to be.

286
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:56,434
Jinx is perfect.

287
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,576
Jayce?

288
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:47,990
Viktor, the doctors, um, they said you're…

289
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,858
How much time do I have?

290
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:02,355
Rotten luck, boys!

291
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:14,762
Vi?

292
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,728
You filthy traitor.

293
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:22,455
Vander had his chance.

294
00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:51,324
I see you never learned patience.

295
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:16,245
Where's my sister? Where's he keeping her?

296
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:19,409
Keeping her? You mean Jinx?

297
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,463
She works for him.

298
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:35,991
She's like his daughter.

299
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,008
I'll give her your regards.

300
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:16,851
Why did you let her go?

301
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:18,455
Do you ever say "thank you?"

302
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:20,551
He's gonna know we're here now.

303
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:21,488
Whose fault is that?

304
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:28,804
You're an all-right shot.

305
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:30,924
I'm an excellent shot.

306
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:33,813
You gonna help me out, cupcake?

307
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:38,210
Stop calling me that. My name is Caitlyn.

308
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,954
But you're so sweet.

309
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:41,893
Like a cupcake.

310
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,133
Shut up.

311
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,636
You're making a mess.

312
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:29,090
The sister.

313
00:36:30,198 --> 00:36:31,210
She's back.

314
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:35,030
From the dead?
