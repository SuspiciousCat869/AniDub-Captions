1
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,001
Whoo!

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,731
Come over here, come on!

3
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,012
Sky?

4
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,255
Don't be afraid.

5
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,028
You built this?

6
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,855
Why aren't you playing with the others?

7
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,531
Hm.

8
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:12,205
Loneliness is often the byproduct of a gifted mind.

9
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,646
What is it?

10
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:18,599
Hmm? Oh. This is Rio.

11
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,228
She's a rare mutation that I cultivated.

12
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,012
Here.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,622
Go on.

14
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:45,598
Hmm.

15
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,353
She's dying.

16
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm attempting to prevent that. The mutation must survive.

17
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:56,402
Can I help?

18
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,923
You want to assist me?

19
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:01,908
Very well.

20
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,223
We can be loners together.

21
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,852
Good to see some things haven't changed.

22
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:32,120
Seems just yesterday I stumbled upon an
aspiring young scholar from the undercity here,

23
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,476
ruminating in his steel oasis.

24
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,829
I heard your prognosis.

25
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,617
I'm terribly sorry, my boy.

26
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:45,783
Do you contemplate death, Professor?

27
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,386
Only that of friends.

28
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,530
I suppose your legacy has been well-secured.

29
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:53,565
As one of Piltover's founders,

30
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,475
what haven't you to show for your remarkable life?

31
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:04,268
You should be proud of what you've accomplished, Viktor.

32
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,592
Figments.

33
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,839
My contributions will be short-lived, even in your memory.

34
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,753
I have seen many students.

35
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:23,130
It's a sad truth that those who
shine brightest often burn fastest.

36
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:51,186
I didn't know you were an artist.

37
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,209
Hm. There's quite a lot about me you don't know.

38
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,471
Listen, I'm sorry for disappearing last night.

39
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,261
Duty calls.

40
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,893
Viktor's dying.

41
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:25,728
I think it has something to do with
gasses in the fissures where he grew up.

42
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,214
Exactly the sort of thing we wanted to fix with Hextech.

43
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:34,666
Improving lives. Solving real
issues, not just trade disputes.

44
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:37,978
Viktor saved my life once.

45
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,737
Now, he needs me and there's nothing I can do.

46
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,132
I hate feeling so useless.

47
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,971
I didn't realize you were so close.

48
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,571
He's like my brother.

49
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,462
Why did you come to me with this?

50
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:54,689
I just…

51
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,561
Nothing feels impossible when I'm with you.

52
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,828
I'm an exile from my family.

53
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:05,195
What?

54
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:06,412
Why?

55
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:09,693
I fell short of Medarda standards.

56
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,243
I don't believe that for a second.

57
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:13,956
Do you?

58
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,313
You should be with him, Jayce.

59
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:24,786
We can't change what fate has in store
for us, but we don't have to face it alone.

60
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,597
It's a beautiful painting.

61
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:35,754
Chuck!

62
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,817
Thieram. Uh… My name's Thieram.

63
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,563
Nice try, Chuck.

64
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,177
What's all the hubbub?

65
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,685
Uh. Boss wants us to grab someone up.

66
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,708
Someone? Anyone?

67
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:52,781
Who are you grabbing?

68
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:53,892
Some girls.

69
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,027
I mean, I mean not… I'm not grabbing girls.

70
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:59,664
Oh, other than the… those ones… I guess.

71
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,548
Focus. Who are they? Why wasn't I invited to the party?

72
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,941
Uh, I don't know.

73
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:08,295
They… they got in a fight with
Sevika. They did a number on her.

74
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,652
Oh really? Which number?

75
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,485
It's like a saying…

76
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,240
You're doing great, Chuck.

77
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,077
Here, for your troubles.

78
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,585
Silco's goons aren't far behind.

79
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,161
We have to keep moving.

80
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:45,106
What the hell is that?

81
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,227
The sign.

82
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,160
Never mind, just help me to the edge.

83
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:03,199
Can you do this in your...

84
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:14,520
Shit.

85
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:22,489
Come on!

86
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:29,263
Come on. Let's go!

87
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:35,969
We lost her.

88
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:40,190
Lost who?

89
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,326
I feel like you and I got off on the wrong arm.

90
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:23,159
Maybe we should try the other.

91
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,821
No need. It's your sister.

92
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,809
She's back. She's looking for you.

93
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:35,240
It's not what you think.

94
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:39,269
She's with some girl enforcer. Guess she replaced you.

95
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,204
You're lying!

96
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,433
Why bother?

97
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,444
Her back in town, it's only a
matter of time before you implode

98
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:52,881
and Silco finally gets the message that you're
about as good for our cause as you were for your family.

99
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,368
Jinx.

100
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,602
Ten outta ten, toots!

101
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:08,643
I think I know just how to deliver that message.

102
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,379
Ah, about time Daddy joined us.

103
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:47,375
You were so busy, little Ren here saw me in.

104
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:03,425
Let's talk outside.

105
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,900
Can't you see we're playing?

106
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,226
You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?

107
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,620
Vander's daughter. She was about your age.

108
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:18,949
Her father went on a long trip and Daddy
here assured me that she left with him.

109
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:24,317
But it seems she never made it. Isn't that sad?

110
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:28,498
Could you imagine being separated from your father?

111
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,754
She's… in a safe place.

112
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,134
She's in the Lanes.

113
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,357
That's not possible.

114
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:42,932
There's an enforcer with her.
A girl. Roughly the same age.

115
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:49,558
Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them, she
does whatever she wants. I… can't control her.

116
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,154
Then of what use are you?

117
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,927
I'll track her down.

118
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,293
I can fix this.

119
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:01,439
Please.

120
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,454
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

121
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,838
What's important is that we don't repeat them.

122
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,140
My people are tracking Vi and this…

123
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:16,639
…Caitlyn. They cannot be allowed to resurface.

124
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:19,376
Do we understand each other?

125
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:20,936
Hmm.

126
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:33,817
Hmm.

127
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,479
Oops. Ah. So sorry. Accidents happen.

128
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:51,233
Watch.

129
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,835
It responds to organic matter.

130
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:11,405
Incredible.

131
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,948
This is unlike anything we've ever seen, Jayce.

132
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:19,338
It, it, it could be the key to
augmenting physiology, extending life…

133
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,626
Curing you.

134
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,807
It's happened to everyone.

135
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,691
I can't determine why.

136
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,118
They're… rejecting the transmutation.

137
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,457
We'll solve this.

138
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:45,596
There may not be time.

139
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:48,441
We're in uncharted waters here and…

140
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:53,048
I can feel my body… eroding.

141
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,754
I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger. He
might know something that could help.

142
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,679
In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

143
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,457
What is this place?

144
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,013
It's where the kind of people you
topsiders don't want to think about, wind up.

145
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,666
It was never this big, though.

146
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:37,926
There.

147
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:17,932
I know you have your reservations about me,

148
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,091
but this only works if we can trust each other.

149
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,933
It doesn't work. It never has.

150
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:25,352
You topsiders always find a way to screw us.

151
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:28,420
I suppose topside is to blame for all your misfortunes.

152
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:31,437
No.

153
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:33,894
Not all of them.

154
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,466
We aren't monsters, you know. We're people, just like you.

155
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,956
You don't know anything about me.

156
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,114
I shouldn't have left you.

157
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:48,763
It's all right. Despite it all, I can tell…

158
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,211
you have a good heart.

159
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:54,917
You've got a good heart.

160
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,414
What is that?

161
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,999
I'm calling it the Hexcore.

162
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:13,084
It's an adaptive rune matrix. Hextech that evolves.

163
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:15,753
It's groundbreaking.

164
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,408
What's most exciting is that
it reacts to biological matter.

165
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:22,326
There are stories of healing magic.
Our samples thus far have perished…

166
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,971
You must destroy it.

167
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:31,878
What?

168
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,168
Please, if ever you've put
faith in my guidance, hear me now.

169
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:42,092
I've seen nations destroyed
by a single seed and it looked…

170
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:44,868
exactly like this.

171
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,279
Professor, this could save Viktor's life.

172
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:53,628
Viktor, something's different.
You've changed. What did you do?

173
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:55,675
What do you mean, Professor?

174
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,744
It's that thing. It must be destroyed!

175
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:01,893
Wait.

176
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:03,868
No. I won't let you.

177
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,426
Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.

178
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:11,283
I will have it destroyed one way or another.

179
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,338
That's your opinion. We'll see if the Council agrees.

180
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:27,601
I might know someone else who could help.

181
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,611
You do what you have to. I need to get ready.

182
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:33,534
For what?

183
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,472
Is she all right?

184
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,773
Wait, wait, wait! Easy. Easy.

185
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,869
That's Vi, right?

186
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:57,479
I'm a friend.

187
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,840
Or at least I was. I mean, I… I owed her old man my life.

188
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,220
Probably more than that.

189
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:07,620
I guess.

190
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,998
She's bleeding. She needs a doctor.

191
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,501
Not so simple to come by around here.

192
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,277
Hey.

193
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:17,003
I'm sorry.

194
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,624
Oh, oh. But, ah, I do know someone
else who might be able to help.

195
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:26,323
Come with me.

196
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,135
Ailment?

197
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:40,121
Uh…

198
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:44,550
Uh… she's been stabbed.

199
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,942
She makes potions.

200
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:53,346
Helps people here with…

201
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:55,783
…with this.

202
00:20:57,114 --> 00:21:00,113
Shimmer. Why would you take
something that does that to you?

203
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:05,349
I just… wanted to feel what it was like…

204
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:09,797
To be somebody. To make other people afraid.

205
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:11,808
Instead of...

206
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:14,062
Trade.

207
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,134
Thank you, I really...

208
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:49,510
Let's go. I think Vi will be happy to see a friendly face.

209
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:52,451
No, no. You go ahead.

210
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:55,266
She knew me when I was still…

211
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:59,590
Anyway, I don't want her to see me like this.

212
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,357
Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry. About everything.

213
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,704
Okay?

214
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:22,676
I found this on one of the Firelights.

215
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,687
It matches fragments we found
outside your lab and at the Hexgates.

216
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:32,356
I… have reason to believe they're planning more attacks.

217
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:35,348
Well, how has this threat gone unnoticed for so long?

218
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,980
Since the Hexgates were completed,
the fissures haven't been a priority.

219
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:42,753
Oh, we'll settle that later. For now,
we need to prevent any further attacks.

220
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:45,989
Short of searching everyone who crosses the bridges.

221
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,749
I don't know how we can.

222
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,416
Then, that's what we'll do.

223
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:52,775
Are you certain? This sort of an order...

224
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,206
Do it. We have to protect the city.

225
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:03,001
One other thing.

226
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:06,479
I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a
prisoner released on your order.

227
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:09,943
Is there anything I can assist with?

228
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:15,151
No. No, uh, we've got it covered.

229
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,379
Councilors, we have lost our way.

230
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:25,206
This city was founded to be a bastion of enlightenment.

231
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:29,992
In a world that cannibalized itself over power and pride.

232
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:31,660
But we've forgotten.

233
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:36,070
Loosened our morals in favor of comfort and convenience.

234
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:38,696
Traded honor for prestige.

235
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,717
We were once one tribe.

236
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,947
Now we are Houses divided.

237
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:50,850
I believe, if we set aside our greed
and arrogance, we can be one again.

238
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,030
It will take vigilance. We
must hold each other accountable.

239
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,553
And who holds you accountable?

240
00:23:57,648 --> 00:23:57,994
What?

241
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:03,453
Shimmer is rampant in the undercity. Attacks
at the Hexgates and in the Academy Square.

242
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:08,279
Enforcers fear to set foot in
the Lanes. All under your watch.

243
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,893
Jayce, you forget yourself.

244
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:14,908
I'm sorry, Professor, but healing this
city will take more than just speeches.

245
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,164
Time and again, you've warned us what not to do.

246
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:22,603
But let me ask you this, what's your plan to fix this?

247
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:24,756
I see what this is about.

248
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,932
Your Hextech projects need more time. More safeguards.

249
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:33,697
Humans don't live for centuries.
We can't wait for progress.

250
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,511
We need a leadership focused on the future, not the past.

251
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:41,195
You are the true Father of Piltover,

252
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,701
and your years of service can never be repaid.

253
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,193
I believe it's time we gave
the beloved founder of our city…

254
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:50,710
a well-deserved retirement.

255
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,414
Jayce, don't do this.

256
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,284
Hmm.

257
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:06,430
It has to be unanimous. All in favor?

258
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:17,693
With my deepest respect and appreciation, Professor.

259
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:49,105
Vi.

260
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,443
Easy, easy, easy.

261
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:10,544
We need you back on your feet.

262
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:14,563
What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx?

263
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:22,107
Right. Jinx. How could I forget?

264
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,024
We're going to have to be more careful now.

265
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:25,739
Silco will be watching...

266
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,516
You used to live here?

267
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:42,026
Who's Powder?

268
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:48,011
My sister. I thought she died, but, no.

269
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,112
I have to try and find her.

270
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:53,107
How do you not know if your sister is alive or dead?

271
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:56,793
It's hard to check up on people
from inside a concrete cell.

272
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:58,661
What, you don't have parents?

273
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:03,240
No! They were killed by enforcers.

274
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,476
Vander's prodigy.

275
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:41,020
I've regretted that we never had the opportunity to speak.

276
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:48,917
What have you done with my sister?

277
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,441
I've freed her.

278
00:27:52,423 --> 00:27:56,632
Candidly, I thought you were the
prize of your secondhand family.

279
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,774
But Jinx…

280
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:04,478
Oh. She is more than I ever imagined.

281
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,976
I'm gonna find her and erase whatever
fucked-up delusions you put in her head.

282
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:23,326
But first, I'm gonna bring your
bullshit empire down all around you.

283
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:29,466
You don't know your limits,
girl. It's what got Vander killed.

284
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:33,338
What drove your sister away.
And it's why I'm here right now.

285
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah, well…

286
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:40,400
You talk too much.

287
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,576
Wherever you are, light it up and I'll find you.

288
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:32,274
Rio will live.

289
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:33,633
You did this?

290
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,257
I thought you understood. The mutation must survive.

291
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,005
I understand now.

292
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:26,377
How many problems can one girl cause?

293
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:09,757
Powder?

294
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:23,479
Vi?

295
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:25,346
Oh, Powder!

296
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:38,278
I'm so sorry, Powder. I…

297
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:42,267
I tried to come back. I promise,
I did. But I… I got arrested.

298
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,387
Marcus?

299
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:45,461
I don't know. I… It doesn't matter.

300
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,057
I just… I never thought I'd see you again.

301
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:51,447
Are you real?

302
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:59,849
Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your
sister. I'm here. I'm right here.

303
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:05,270
Things changed when you left. I changed.

304
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,952
I know, Pow-pow, I know. You
did what you had to do to survive.

305
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:14,256
Me too. It's okay.

306
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,708
What matters is we're together.

307
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:26,654
Who's she?

308
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:27,876
Who are you?

309
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:30,116
It's okay. She's a friend.

310
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:33,785
Sevika wasn't lying? You're with an enforcer?

311
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:39,004
Your sister is Jinx?

312
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:42,386
Caitlyn, just listen, we can work this out.

313
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,973
This is a trick! You're playing me!

314
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,093
Shut up! I'm in no mood.

315
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:49,718
We didn't say anything.

316
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:51,031
I wasn't talking to you!

317
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:52,445
Powder, it's okay.

318
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:54,469
Stop calling me that.

319
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:57,818
It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.

320
00:34:58,145 --> 00:34:59,342
You're not a jinx.

321
00:34:59,388 --> 00:34:59,990
God, I never should have...

322
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,797
Stop talking to me like I'm a child!

323
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:03,410
Was that why you came?

324
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,340
For this stupid stone?

325
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:08,248
No, I don't even know what that is, I…

326
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:10,719
You're a class act, Sister.

327
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:15,479
Sister. Thought I missed her. Bet you wouldn't miss her.

328
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:18,732
Powder! I'm here for you. Only you.

329
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,671
You can fire that thing if you
want, but I'm not going anywhere.

330
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:24,066
I'm not going to abandon you again.

331
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,456
Everyone, shut up, I need to think.

332
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:31,491
Do you hear that?

333
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:10,659
Powder.

334
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:20,977
Powder!

335
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:38,714
Take her.

336
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:01,098
Vi?

337
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:04,745
No!
