1
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:25,880
When I was ten,

2
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:29,748
your grandfather brought me to the
aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard.

3
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:35,143
He offered me a gold coin for every
blade I retrieved from the fallen.

4
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:37,256
Said we needed the steel.

5
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,469
But I knew it was a lie.

6
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:43,399
He wanted me to know death.

7
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,744
Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.

8
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,106
Your brother thinks he can talk his way out of anything.

9
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,727
He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.

10
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:56,417
But mark me, child, if you want to last in this world,

11
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:00,989
you must learn to be both the fox and the wolf.

12
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:05,015
We'll paint the walls in gold.

13
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:07,750
Import crystal chandeliers.

14
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,925
Advisors will enter here,

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,947
but the regent will have her own, secret entrance.

16
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:16,877
She should have a kind, fat face.

17
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:22,305
Clever, to charm her subjects,
but pliable so we can mold her.

18
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:23,987
Perhaps, she could be my daughter.

19
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:26,424
You'd give me a throne?

20
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:32,743
I will give you the world,
child, if you prove you can take it.

21
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,106
What should we do with her?

22
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:55,697
She won't make trouble for us.

23
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:59,689
Strip her of her possessions
and send her to the far colonies.

24
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:05,965
She's a symbol of the old regime.

25
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,226
Kill her now, and only one must die.

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,061
Let her live and you may need to kill thousands.

27
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,636
We can show the people we are merciful.

28
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,518
A wolf has no mercy.

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,580
Will you be okay?

30
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,719
I'll be right back.

31
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:05,417
Okay.

32
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:14,770
Jinx!

33
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:49,141
It's gone.

34
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:50,541
What?

35
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,898
It was all for nothing.

36
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,536
Sir, we've secured the area.

37
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,612
I've got orders to escort you back into the city.

38
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:43,726
Sir?

39
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:45,736
Are you all right?

40
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,165
Who lives here? Another Councilor friend of yours?

41
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,888
Caitlyn!

42
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,705
Oh. We were so worried. Thank goodness you're safe!

43
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,158
And you found a stray.

44
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:41,879
This is Vi.

45
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,750
She's from the undercity.

46
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,170
So I see.

47
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,827
Could we have a word, Caitlyn?

48
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:49,831
In private.

49
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,155
You have to speak to the Council.

50
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,681
Speak to the Council?

51
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,525
You understand you've broken several laws?

52
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,600
She was doing what she thought was right.

53
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,201
I'll take responsibility.

54
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,896
You're a Councilor's daughter.

55
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,351
Your actions reflect on the entire body.

56
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,326
My actions?

57
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,407
You know what else reflects on the Council?

58
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,879
Its citizens living on the streets. Being poisoned.

59
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,601
Having to choose between a
kingpin who wants to exploit them

60
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,786
and a government that doesn't give a shit.

61
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:24,659
Caitlyn!

62
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:30,933
I'm sure our daughter could use
some rest after her adventures.

63
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,248
I'll schedule an audience.

64
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:41,755
Thank you.

65
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:45,785
You and your friend can address the Council yourselves.

66
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,795
I'd suggest you prepare accordingly.

67
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,145
Her injuries are severe.

68
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:14,343
You think I can't see that?

69
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:15,887
Huh.

70
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:21,788
I believe I can save her, but
the process will be demanding.

71
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,949
Sometimes death is a mercy.

72
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:26,761
She can take it.

73
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,733
And before I begin, I must know…

74
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,454
Are you prepared to lose her?

75
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:34,985
Jinx?

76
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:36,994
Jinx!

77
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:43,868
She won't die, Doctor.

78
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:45,688
She can't.

79
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:49,738
I understand.

80
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:56,547
Please understand, this is for your own sanity.

81
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,294
I, too, once had a daughter.

82
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,106
Silco isn't taking guests.

83
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:22,547
Not a problem.

84
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,992
Wasn't here for him. Thought I might bend your ear.

85
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,408
You know when I ask my mates what Silco's up to,

86
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:34,618
your name's first out of their mouths.

87
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:39,128
"Sevika's out in the harbor," or
"Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit."

88
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:41,571
You're a scary lady.

89
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:44,833
Get to your point.

90
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,721
Run a tight ship, don't you?

91
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,623
Except it's not your ship.

92
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,568
It's his and Jinx's.

93
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:53,923
This is your plan?

94
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:57,505
Undermine Silco by making a half-assed play at my ego?

95
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,820
Gotta hand it to you, Finn.

96
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,005
Every time I think you can't
get dumber, you dig a new low.

97
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,762
Let's be plain, then. He's slipping.

98
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,615
The undercity's devolving to chaos.

99
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,051
And somehow, I get the feeling he
isn't up there balancing booksheets.

100
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,046
Jinx gets a whim, suddenly his spine's made of jelly.

101
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:21,169
And here you are, shoveling his shit.

102
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,846
Ego is one thing, brain's another.

103
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:35,428
You aren't the only one dissatisfied with his performance.

104
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:38,320
There's bigger fish than Silco.

105
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:16,545
Mel. Elora. You didn't have to come out to meet me.

106
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,460
What are you doing here, Mother?

107
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:19,573
Can I not visit?

108
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,588
I've heard stories of Piltover's hospitality.

109
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,184
You didn't sail halfway across the
continent to sample the local cuisine.

110
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:29,296
It's been over a decade, Mel.

111
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,554
Since you banished me?

112
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,488
Such drama.

113
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:36,562
I sent you here to oversee our
family's interests and grow yourself.

114
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,542
Which you have.

115
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:43,848
You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality will be
more at home with those soft-spined idealists overseas."

116
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,546
You have your father's memory.

117
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:49,940
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.

118
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:50,740
Mel.

119
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,039
Or that.

120
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,343
Your brother's gone.

121
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,213
What happened?

122
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,875
He crossed the wrong man.

123
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:09,936
I was distracted.

124
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,139
That's a mistake I can't take back.

125
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,582
Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye to Hextech weaponry.

126
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:22,605
I knew it.

127
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:23,805
War is coming.

128
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:27,237
You've let the problems of your undercity fester too long.

129
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:28,978
Piltover isn't like Noxus.

130
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:31,688
War isn't our first and every recourse.

131
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:36,380
I sponsored Hextech to protect
the city, not burn it to the ground.

132
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,830
It's not conjecture, it's a fact.

133
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,499
Weapons can't be unmade and they are always used.

134
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:46,589
I'm here to help guide you to the right decisions.

135
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,589
I don't need your guidance.

136
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,086
We'll see.

137
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:53,252
Miss Medarda?

138
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,420
Yes?

139
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:00,390
He's for me, dear.

140
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:06,751
I'm off to sample the local cuisine.

141
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:23,505
We'll present our case to the Council tonight.

142
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:27,802
You did all this yourself?

143
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,798
Without even going down there?

144
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:35,092
And I thought Powder could get obsessed.

145
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:41,440
What happened to her, it's not your fault.

146
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,877
When my parents were still alive…

147
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,706
me and Powder used to share a bed like this.

148
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,790
Except, maybe, half the size.

149
00:13:56,164 --> 00:14:01,112
We played a game where we pretended
to be bigger and bigger monsters.

150
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:06,937
So she would say, "I'm a slug
monster with venom for ooze."

151
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:12,553
And I'd say, "Well, I'm a
slug-eating crab with razor spikes."

152
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:19,364
Sometimes, I… I'd get carried away and she'd get scared.

153
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:25,272
I didn't want her to start
crying and wake my parents up, so…

154
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,134
I pretended to chase my own monsters away.

155
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:30,502
I'd say…

156
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,027
"No monster's gonna get you when I'm here."

157
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,501
Then a real monster showed up.

158
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:41,870
And I just ran away.

159
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:44,963
I left her.

160
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:16,443
You know, Powder, you're stronger than you think.

161
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:18,163
Vi?

162
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:21,328
I'm so sorry, Powder.

163
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:23,492
Your sister is jinx.

164
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:24,578
No!

165
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,906
No, no. No!

166
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:33,239
I understand this must be painful.

167
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,066
No!

168
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,223
I'm afraid it will only get worse.

169
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,917
No!

170
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,095
What have you done?

171
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,804
I saved her life.

172
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:38,719
Hey, watch it, furball.

173
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:39,805
Move.

174
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:13,248
Oh.

175
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:15,568
Hmm.

176
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,501
Hmm.

177
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:20,428
Huh?

178
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,522
Hmm…

179
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:25,949
Like this.

180
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,403
Get away from her.

181
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:32,383
Bye…

182
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,605
Oh, ingenious.

183
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,782
Though these blades seem improperly pitched.

184
00:17:58,737 --> 00:17:59,450
You're wrong.

185
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,340
It's designed for the fissures.

186
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,169
The air is denser.

187
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:05,746
Oh.

188
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:07,994
Are you all right, lad?

189
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:11,009
Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle.

190
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:15,206
Are you Councilor Heimerdinger?

191
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,774
It's just Heimerdinger now.

192
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,785
What are you doing on this side of the river?

193
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,203
I wanted to offer my assistance to
the citizens of the undercity, but…

194
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:30,008
it seems I'm unwelcome.

195
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:32,847
What is it?

196
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:34,809
We're having the exact same day.

197
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:40,851
That looks like more than a
sprain. You need medical attention.

198
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:44,275
I have to get home. It isn't safe for me here.

199
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,820
I don't know how I'm gonna get
there with my leg busted, and, well…

200
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,807
you're holding my ride.

201
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:07,166
Do they teach military history at your Academy, Mr. Talis?

202
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,534
It's, um, Councilor Talis.

203
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:12,318
And I'm not sure.

204
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:18,156
The Alornian General Sonnem Parlec used to
find ways to meet his enemies blindfolded.

205
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:21,086
He said a man's mind hides behind his body.

206
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,515
Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.

207
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:26,394
You're Mel's mom.

208
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,368
Among other things.

209
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,128
Squeeze, child. You won't break it.

210
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:35,642
I do have other matters, so if you'll excuse me…

211
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,344
The threat of the undercity is real.

212
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,212
Your leadership is impotent.

213
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,478
We may not be Noxus, but Piltover
isn't as helpless as you think.

214
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:45,979
Who said anything about Piltover?

215
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,111
The Council is the problem.
The mind hiding behind the body.

216
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:54,871
Navigating your current crisis
requires expertise you lack.

217
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:58,573
Do you know what the success rate
for senior Academy inventors is?

218
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:00,120
Three percent.

219
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:02,302
We're no strangers to failure.

220
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,302
What makes this the City of Progress is
that we keep trying until we get it right.

221
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,476
So thank you for your advice, Mrs.
Medarda, but I have a city to run.

222
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,007
Wait.

223
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,258
I see why this province and
my daughter have fallen for you.

224
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,440
You have the passion of youth.

225
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:26,749
I have experience.

226
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:30,901
I want you to succeed here, Jayce,
to grace the world with Hextech.

227
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:35,580
But if you don't accept certain realities,
I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.

228
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,236
Slaughtered with your eyes closed.

229
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,948
Three of my suppliers have said they
intend to delay shipments until fall

230
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:49,289
to give things "time to cool off."

231
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,742
We have greater concerns than a dip in profits.

232
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:54,749
The Sheriff betrayed us. We need better information.

233
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:57,783
We need to act. Before anyone else gets killed.

234
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:01,046
Perhaps Marcus was operating independently.

235
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,653
What could anyone in the undercity
offer him that he didn't have up here?

236
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,009
It's not what they offered him,

237
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,455
it's what he had to lose.

238
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:14,153
Councilors, my daughter has a
unique insight into our situation.

239
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:15,326
Thank you.

240
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,566
Councilors, this is Vi. She was born in the undercity.

241
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,068
Even though we failed her in countless ways,

242
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,035
she risked everything to show me
what life is really like down there.

243
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:32,907
People are starving, sick, ravaged by Shimmer.

244
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:37,761
They live in constant fear of the
coordinated efforts of violent crime lords.

245
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,950
One man leads these efforts.

246
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:41,023
Silco.

247
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,406
We've done investigations of Silco.

248
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:47,341
They yielded no such level of organization.

249
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,128
And who led these investigations?

250
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:52,826
What does this Silco even want from us?

251
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:55,192
He believes the undercity should be independent.

252
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:57,413
He calls it the Nation of Zaun.

253
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:02,742
What about these? Do you know who made them?

254
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,293
No, well…

255
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:05,886
Uh…

256
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,063
Her name is Jinx.

257
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,219
This Jinx has the Gemstone?

258
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:12,044
Then we have to go in by force.

259
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:13,222
That could trigger war.

260
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:14,734
There are good people down there.

261
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,539
Hmph. Bad ones too.

262
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:19,571
Even if we wanted to invade, they have Shimmer.

263
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:21,571
We have Hextech.

264
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:23,399
What happened to you?

265
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:26,409
We've been talking about talking for weeks now.

266
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,642
They're still cleaning the blood off the bridge.

267
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,050
When do we say enough is enough?

268
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:31,536
Jayce, you don't know war.

269
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:32,983
I do.

270
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,817
It must be our last resort.
There may be a diplomatic solution.

271
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,605
She's right.

272
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,515
What? You want to negotiate with him?

273
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,703
It may be the only way to avoid further bloodshed.

274
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:56,526
This is insane. Did you learn nothing?

275
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,034
You can't talk to him!

276
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:02,010
He hates you. Everything you stand for.

277
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:04,557
He will never back down.

278
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:10,047
Enforcers, please escort them out.

279
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:10,972
Forget it.

280
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,725
I remember where your fancy damn door is.

281
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,544
Vi! Wait!

282
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:30,781
Wait! Where are you going?

283
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:32,889
I don't know. Back where I came from?

284
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,083
Seems like that's what everyone up here wants.

285
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,595
I can fix this.

286
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,447
You can't!

287
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,910
This is how things are. How they've always
been. I was so stupid to think it could change.

288
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:46,507
There must be something else we can do. Some other way.

289
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:49,382
We'll make a new plan. We have to try.

290
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,430
We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.

291
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,685
Topside and bottom. Oil and water. That's all there is.

292
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,560
What about us?

293
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,328
Oil and water.

294
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,119
Wasn't meant to be.

295
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,839
You're just saying that.

296
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,210
Do yourself a favor, Cupcake.

297
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,571
Go back to that big, shiny house of yours and just…

298
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:15,986
forget me, okay?

299
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:23,650
Viktor, I've been working on a
private project for a couple weeks now.

300
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:25,276
No.

301
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:43,899
Viktor, I've been working on this for a year now and…

302
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:47,390
Viktor.

303
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:03,734
Viktor, I was hoping you might take a
look at something I've been working on.

304
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:09,974
Viktor…

305
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,386
I was inspired by your…

306
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,839
Everything you do inspires me.

307
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:25,339
Viktor!

308
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,676
Viktor!

309
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,658
Sky? Sky? No.

310
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:18,898
No! That… that can't… that can't…

311
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:04,607
You want to make Silco pay for what he's done?

312
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:07,688
I could have you arrested.

313
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:10,766
You guys really like to bandy that threat around.

314
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:12,769
You ever been to Stillwater?

315
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:13,924
No.

316
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:19,454
So you just wave an arm, have someone
dragged off, don't bother to find out

317
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:24,901
what it does to someone being stuffed in a
stone box for weeks, or months, or even years?

318
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,948
Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.

319
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:31,173
I want in.

320
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,142
There is no in.

321
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:34,320
You heard the Council.

322
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,338
Fuck the Council.

323
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:37,779
You said you were tired of doing nothing.

324
00:28:37,912 --> 00:28:40,631
That's the only sensible thing that
came out of anyone's mouth tonight.

325
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:42,599
I'm not a vigilante.

326
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:45,035
No, you're a victim.

327
00:28:56,858 --> 00:28:59,640
This so people notice you when
you raise your hand in the boardroom?

328
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,563
We built them for mining the fissures.

329
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:03,756
Hmm.

330
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:06,410
Someone close to me had a pair of these.

331
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:11,558
You're the first person Caitlyn
looked for when we made it to topside.

332
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:14,126
Of everyone up here,

333
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:17,261
you're the one she trusted to do something.

334
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:23,348
What do you want me to do? Arrest him?

335
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:26,277
Silco controls the undercity with Shimmer.

336
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,782
Shut down his supply, and it's only a matter
of time before his own people turn on him.

337
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,281
And how do we do that?

338
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,411
Take out his manufacturing facilities.

339
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:36,773
Hit them hard and fast, before he can react.

340
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,275
So…

341
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:45,077
We got a deal, pretty boy?

342
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:22,285
Come on.

343
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,063
Over the bridge.

344
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:26,530
Secured!

345
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:31,406
Get back!

346
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:32,806
You little punk.

347
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:39,300
Hey!

348
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:15,626
Hmm.

349
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:44,698
Hmm.
