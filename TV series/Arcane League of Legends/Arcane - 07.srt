1
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:56,275
I knew it was a mistake trusting you.

2
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:58,108
You've been a real picnic yourself.

3
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,794
I'm not the one who walked us into,
not one, but two of Silco's traps.

4
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,194
This isn't Silco, it's someone else.

5
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:06,152
How do you know?

6
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:08,041
'Cause we'd already be dead.

7
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,308
Oh, very nice.

8
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:12,272
When were you planning to tell me
that your lunatic sister works for him?

9
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:14,986
Just as soon as you came clean about
what the hell you're really doing down here.

10
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,149
I told you the truth.

11
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:16,681
Bullshit.

12
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:18,069
What was that glowing stone?

13
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,149
That's what I thought.

14
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:26,022
What's going on?

15
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:28,068
Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me!

16
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:28,950
Leave her alone!

17
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:29,821
Let me go!

18
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:30,360
Vi?

19
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:31,912
Vi!

20
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:33,969
Vi!

21
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,210
You shy? Or just ugly?

22
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:24,759
You look good for a dead girl.

23
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:35,351
Ekko?

24
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:40,446
What do you know about this?

25
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,314
Nothing. What the hell is this all about?

26
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:47,851
What were you doing with Jinx?

27
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,331
Her name is Powder.

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,002
And I just found her when you and your goons showed up.

29
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:54,899
It's me. Vi.

30
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:59,117
Same person who used to take you down to the junk
heap and hose you down when you got covered in grease.

31
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,396
That was a long time ago.

32
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,640
People change.

33
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:06,655
Yeah. I'm getting that.

34
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,634
Are you working for Silco?

35
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:12,214
Fuck. You.

36
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,997
I thought you were dead.

37
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,781
Now you show up with a Piltie
and give her a tour of the Lanes?

38
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,542
You were following us? Why didn't you say something?

39
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,391
I didn't know if I could trust you.

40
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:24,065
So… so you just come out swinging?

41
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,731
Gee, I wonder who I learned that from?

42
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,114
Ah, well, you shoulda learned more.
You still punch like a little boy.

43
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,811
And you still block with your face.

44
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,830
I remember when you wouldn't stand up to me.

45
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:41,904
I missed you, little man.

46
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,970
How long have you had those off?

47
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,354
How long have you been whining?

48
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:57,067
Hmm. Fascinating.

49
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,973
I would very much like to see the device.

50
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,246
This, uh, Hexcore.

51
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:09,791
That may be difficult to arrange.

52
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:16,507
I've tried every combination of
runes, but… it's always the same.

53
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:20,713
The subject, wither and rot.

54
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:25,099
Uh, perhaps the error resides
not with your calculations but…

55
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:26,848
with your subjects.

56
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:30,028
Nature has made us intolerant to change,

57
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:34,658
but fortunately, we have the
capacity to change our nature.

58
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,397
And this is… Shimmer?

59
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:38,441
A variant.

60
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:42,831
It should provide everything one
needs to survive a violent transition.

61
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:44,758
Will it work on plants?

62
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,861
You aren't here about the plants, are you?

63
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:51,358
I know the look of a doomed man.

64
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,145
I must warn you.

65
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:58,151
If you take this path, they will despise you.

66
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,270
Love and legacy are the sacrifices we make for progress.

67
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:07,126
It's why I parted ways with Heimerdinger.

68
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,638
Jayce will understand.

69
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:14,875
Perhaps.

70
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:52,114
Hammer work is such a delicate art.

71
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,141
How'd you find me?

72
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,698
You're the de facto head of the
Council. People notice where you go.

73
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,640
Huh. Don't remind me.

74
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,248
This border shutdown has people agitated.

75
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,535
They should be.

76
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,720
Marcus brought this to me. It's an explosive.

77
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,369
I tried taking it apart and it nearly killed me.

78
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,573
Whoever built it knows exactly what they're doing.

79
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,703
This and Shimmer. It's hard to
believe what they're capable of.

80
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,311
Is that what's really bothering you?

81
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:29,222
He was my mentor, Mel. And I betrayed him.

82
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,270
Everything you said about him was true.

83
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:38,588
My family cast me out and yet,
part of me still loves them.

84
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:42,129
Heimerdinger will understand eventually.

85
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:46,348
It's your time now, Jayce. No more red tape.

86
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:50,198
You can bring Hextech to the masses,
just like you've always dreamed.

87
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:55,475
Hmm. First, I have to save Viktor.

88
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:56,507
Where is he?

89
00:07:57,348 --> 00:07:57,898
I don't know.

90
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,599
He disappeared. He does that sometimes.

91
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,423
No sign of Caitlyn either.

92
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,562
The Kiramman girl?

93
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:05,509
It's just…

94
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:08,303
Uh, never mind.

95
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,621
Hey. We'll get through this.

96
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:14,031
I'll stall the Council but they'll soon need their leader.

97
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:15,962
In the meantime…

98
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,009
Try not to lose your nuts.

99
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,711
All our business is down. Enforcers are
searching anyone who crosses the bridge.

100
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:41,241
Marcus is following my orders.
Preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning.

101
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:42,987
Or he's finally flipped.

102
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:45,102
Hmm.

103
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,121
The chembarons scheduled an assembly.

104
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,453
Oh.

105
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,865
I've had enough headaches.

106
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,036
It didn't sound like a request.

107
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:04,694
Where are you going?

108
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:06,156
I need to find Jinx.

109
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:06,738
Sir.

110
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:07,644
What?

111
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,821
I got more in common with cave lice than Jinx.

112
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:17,251
But let's just say I didn't always
see eye-to-eye with my old man.

113
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:19,628
And?

114
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:24,072
She'll come to you when she's ready.

115
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:29,402
Hmm.

116
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,311
You lost her.

117
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,458
I didn't lose her! They took her.

118
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,475
She cares about that enforcer, you saw it.

119
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:57,824
She was there for me! Not the enforcer.

120
00:09:58,073 --> 00:09:59,584
Remember her name?

121
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:01,735
Why would I remember her name?

122
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:06,398
Well, she's just some stupid topsider!

123
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:21,102
Caitlyn.

124
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:44,007
Pow.

125
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,281
Come on. Go!

126
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:55,548
I got it.

127
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,248
Whoo-hoo!

128
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,024
Is that real tree?

129
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:00,589
Pretty cool, huh?

130
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:03,319
When I first saw it, I knew this was the place.

131
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,638
If a single seed could make it down here, so could we.

132
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,844
You built all this?

133
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,302
Not alone.

134
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,239
After Vander…

135
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:15,076
…died,

136
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,501
Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer.

137
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,199
He didn't care what it did to people.

138
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:23,069
Everyone here was an addict or a victim.

139
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:24,752
Hi.

140
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,172
They needed somewhere safe to start again.

141
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:33,650
I should have been there. For you. For everyone.

142
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,903
That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.

143
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:41,037
If I just went with you that day,
maybe none of this would have happened.

144
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,800
Or maybe you'd be dead. Or… changed.

145
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:47,515
Powder's gone, Vi.

146
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,594
All that's left is Jinx and she belongs to Silco.

147
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:53,266
You're wrong. She's still in there. I can reach her.

148
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,046
You can't.

149
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,681
I know my sister.

150
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,510
I got one more thing to show you.

151
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,385
This is everyone we've lost.

152
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,160
The price of our freedom.

153
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,637
Some of it was Enforcers.

154
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:26,654
Most was Silco.

155
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:33,034
Your sister works for him not because
she has to, but because she wants to.

156
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,521
I'm sorry, but that's who she is now.

157
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:51,834
Get down!

158
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:52,821
Let us through!

159
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:53,473
Come on!

160
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,493
We understand.

161
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,996
Just stand down!

162
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:07,324
Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.

163
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,315
Not a problem, Councilor.

164
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,541
Jayce, what is this?

165
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,202
Do you have any idea how this looks?

166
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,948
I order a blockade and my own partner violates it?

167
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:23,147
You ordered this? Why?

168
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:26,594
There are people down there who
seem hell-bent on destroying us.

169
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,747
What were you doing?

170
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,044
I was consulting a friend about our quandary.

171
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,892
I told you, I knew someone.

172
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:34,812
Well, you didn't say they were from the undercity.

173
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,723
What difference does that make?

174
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,158
What diff… They're dangerous.

175
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:41,894
I'm from the undercity.

176
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,101
You're right.

177
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,973
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:47,580
I've had a lot on my plate.

179
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,839
Was your friend able to help?

180
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:52,016
No.

181
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:56,337
No, he said, "Nature was
resistant to this sort of tampering."

182
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:58,927
All right, we'll keep at it.

183
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:23,653
First, this wild attack in the heart of Piltover.

184
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,750
Now, the border's closing.

185
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,969
We're bleeding money and for what?

186
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:33,274
His dreams of rebellion? He's losing control.

187
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:35,514
If we stand together…

188
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:38,339
We aren't due for an assembly.

189
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:43,909
We should be.

190
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:47,968
Ever since your stunt topside,
profits have been plummeting.

191
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,274
He's right. Merchandise is frozen at the border.

192
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,671
Topsiders are too afraid to cross.

193
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:57,329
We're all wondering, what's your plan to fix this?

194
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,811
You're all wondering, are you?

195
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:08,382
Way I see it, we should cut a
deal and give back the Gemstone.

196
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:11,463
Better to have some trade than none at all.

197
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:17,073
The border issue is temporary. Jinx will deal with it.

198
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,713
Huh.

199
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:22,074
Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.

200
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:27,612
How you meant to bring Piltover to heel
if you can't handle your own people, huh?

201
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:41,394
What's that?

202
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:47,339
Oh, you don't recognize it?

203
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,714
Have you forgotten where we came from?

204
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,471
The mines they had us in?

205
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,229
Air so thick it clogged your throat.

206
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,788
Stuck in your eyes.

207
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,186
But I pulled you all up from the depths.

208
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,326
Offered you a taste of topside.

209
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:13,838
And fresh air.

210
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,441
I gave you life.

211
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,174
Purpose.

212
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:26,741
But you've grown fat and complacent.

213
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:30,378
Too much time in the sun.

214
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:46,859
We came from a world where there
was never enough to go around, Finn.

215
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,639
That is why we fight.

216
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:53,522
Do you remember?

217
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:59,645
Sorry. Please.

218
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:02,815
Please.

219
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:11,690
Don't forget again.

220
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:26,064
Good meeting.

221
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,707
I've had word from our friends overseas.

222
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:54,804
This threat from the undercity is drawing attention.

223
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,038
Piltover looks vulnerable.

224
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:04,361
It's too soon. Jayce isn't ready.

225
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,381
There's one other thing.

226
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:14,403
This arrived for you.

227
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:40,532
Hmm?

228
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:54,519
What have you done with Vi?

229
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:02,582
Listen, let her go. I brought her here. It's me you want.

230
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:05,323
My hero.

231
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,021
You're…

232
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,244
But I thought you… I thought they were hurting you!

233
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,541
Vi tells me I can trust you.

234
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,686
You get a pass back topside, that's it.

235
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:16,819
Let's go.

236
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,531
Let me help you with that.

237
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:33,912
Where've you been, Jinx?

238
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:40,413
Oh, you know. Here, there, chasing down dead ends.

239
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:44,766
And guess what? They're not all dead.

240
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,008
I can explain.

241
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:50,514
Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.

242
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:55,352
I didn't know. Marcus never told me she was in Stillwater.

243
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:58,692
But you found out she came back.

244
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,736
You lied.

245
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:04,420
I wanted to protect you.

246
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,544
From what?

247
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:10,975
She and the enforcer are back
for the crystal. Not for you.

248
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,636
Have you forgotten how she left you?

249
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:19,219
Who found you? Who cared for you? Gave you a home?

250
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:24,619
I am your family. Everyone else betrays us.

251
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:28,605
I need you.

252
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,432
Now more than ever.

253
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:37,089
You have to complete the weapon.

254
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,933
It's beautiful.

255
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,425
If your people had your way, it'd be rubble and ash.

256
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:06,945
It's a misunderstanding.

257
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,358
They think you work for Silco.

258
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:14,421
Your people hunt us like
animals. Silco pays them to do it.

259
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,620
That's not possible. You're wrong.

260
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:20,177
Say that one more time.

261
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:23,849
Ekko, she believes what she's
saying, okay? She's not your enemy.

262
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:25,755
Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

263
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:30,822
You got it. You have to let me take that back.

264
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:34,208
What is it?

265
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,781
It's a Gemstone.

266
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:39,292
It was stolen during the attack. By your sister.

267
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:41,846
You just forgot to mention that?

268
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:45,350
With this, someone with the right knowledge could build…

269
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:47,258
any Hextech device.

270
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:53,098
If enforcers are becoming more… aggressive, that's why.

271
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,488
We could beat Silco with this.

272
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:58,665
That won't solve things.

273
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,159
Easy for you to say. Your
people aren't dying all around you.

274
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:06,949
Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.

275
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:09,700
You'd be well within your rights to keep it.

276
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:11,832
I couldn't blame you.

277
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:15,953
But… if you do,

278
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:18,317
this cycle of violence will never stop.

279
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,780
This is our best shot at setting the record straight.

280
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,048
This city needs healing.

281
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,452
More than I ever realized.

282
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:30,522
Please, let me help you.

283
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,626
You got a plan?

284
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:37,229
I have a friend on the council.

285
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,647
Let me take the Gemstone to him.

286
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,729
He'll listen to me. Your people
wouldn't have to hide anymore.

287
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:49,892
One condition. I'm the one who gives it to them.

288
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:56,877
Um, the form is crude, but…

289
00:22:57,823 --> 00:23:00,347
uh, the engineering is… inspired.

290
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,211
You think they could crack Hextech?

291
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:05,567
Mm. It's a leap.

292
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:10,124
It's been suggested that they may
have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.

293
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:14,645
If we are to assume the worst, that
would mean they've turned it into a weapon.

294
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:15,972
Well, do we know this for certain?

295
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:18,665
We can't afford to wait to find out.

296
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:21,796
Wait. What are you suggesting?

297
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:26,349
We should prepare our own countermeasures.

298
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,934
You want us to build weapons?

299
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:33,090
Absolutely not. That is not why we invented Hextech.

300
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:35,399
We would shatter any attempt at peace.

301
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,802
Heimerdinger would never go for this.

302
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:40,583
Heimerdingers' inaction is what
brought us here. You said so yourself.

303
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:44,574
The peace is already broken, Jayce.

304
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:47,435
I'm only asking you to prepare to defend your people.

305
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:50,266
If we're lucky, we'll never need to use it.

306
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:56,076
The decision is yours.

307
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:08,897
Ridiculous. You cannot be considering this.

308
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:12,865
What if she's right? Are we just
gonna stand by while they attack us?

309
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:15,360
We're scientists, not soldiers.

310
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,037
We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.

311
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,581
We agreed Hextech was to improve lives…

312
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,062
…not to take them.

313
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,504
We may not have a choice.

314
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:42,850
There is always a choice.

315
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:46,677
I need to think.

316
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,119
What are they?

317
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,152
We call them firelights. Never seen so many though.

318
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,262
I'm worried I have to do
something I never thought I would.

319
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:49,803
Vi?

320
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,382
I can't leave her again.

321
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,019
You can't change her.

322
00:27:58,756 --> 00:27:59,797
I have to try.

323
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:04,525
Don't get yourself killed.

324
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:07,812
No promises.

325
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:19,872
It's been real, Cupcake. Thanks. For everything.

326
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:32,084
Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug.

327
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,173
She wouldn't do that. Not again.

328
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:02,724
Halt!

329
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,034
What the hell is this?

330
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:12,300
Sir! I have proof. Silco's behind everything.

331
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:19,477
Show me.

332
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:24,555
No.

333
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,165
Shit.

334
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:51,954
Caitlyn!

335
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:02,242
Liar.

00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:53,632
Tell my daughter I…

339
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:04,197
Go!

340
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:28,601
Oh, look who it is. The boy savior.

341
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,470
Hah.

342
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:13,098
No.
