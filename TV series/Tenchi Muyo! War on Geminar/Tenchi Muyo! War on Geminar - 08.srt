1
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,291
Oh... It must be
time for the next shift.

2
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,750
Thank you for coming.

3
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,166
We've been expecting you.

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,458
We're in... Target one
is under our control.

5
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,750
Good.

6
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,916
That wasn't as tough
as I thought it'd be.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,583
And they call themselves
defenders of the Holy Land.

8
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,166
They're not defenders...

9
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,833
They usually have
pretty good intel,

10
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,333
but I guess this time
we caught them off guard.

11
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,208
Mainly they just keep
an eye on other nations

12
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,625
and slap their wrists
when they're outta line.

13
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,125
Whatever they are,
apparently they're weak

14
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,125
when attacked
from the inside.

15
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,583
Yeah, normally, getting in
would be the hardest part.

16
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,083
Huh...

17
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,375
Sir, we've taken out targets
two and three, as well.

18
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,500
Why don't we just keep on
pressing them with an attack

19
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,208
and overrun all
the guard posts?

20
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,583
Because we only have so
many Sacred Mechamasters

21
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,166
in our possession...

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,500
There's no point in stretching
ourselves too thin, is there?

23
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,000
Besides, the last thing we want
is for Shurifon to catch on...

24
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,250
They're independent

25
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,291
and we do not want
them getting involved...

26
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,125
On another note,
where did Emera go?

27
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,500
Beats me. If you're
asking my opinion,

28
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,666
I think that girl's a
complete waste of space

29
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,541
and we're better
off without her.

30
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,000
Who's there?

31
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,041
I hope I didn't
inconvenience you.

32
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,250
But she was needed.

33
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,958
No! Don't...!

34
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,750
If you ever borrow
one of my subordinates

35
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,708
without my
permission again...

36
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,666
I will have
to punish you.

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,791
My sincerest
apologies, sir...

38
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
But it couldn't
be helped.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,416
Sir... we've suppressed
targets four, five and six.

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,250
Well, since you're already
here, you should stay

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,041
and watch the show.

42
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,458
I'm grateful I could
see this day come...

43
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,958
We've been preparing for
this moment for a long time.

44
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,250
Ideals only matter
when put into action.

45
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,500
When they're only talk,
they mean nothing...

46
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,125
But in practice,
they shine.

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,500
The actions that we
take here today...

48
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:17,333
will guide each and every one of
us to never before seen heights.

49
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,458
So get out there
and do your job.

50
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,125
The main forces will
arrive any minute now.

51
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,916
Good morning!

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,958
What's wrong,
you guys?

53
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,833
Let's go...!

54
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,125
For this morning
we shall all be victors!

55
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,083
Oh no!
The guard post!

56
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,250
It's here!

57
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,125
I need to get as many
merit points as I can...!

58
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,250
Come on, let's crush
them all, one by one!

59
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,541
Time to show them our
true strength, gentlemen!

60
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,125
Right!

61
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,541
You'll have to do
better than that!

62
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,291
What are you doing...?!

63
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,416
It'll revert back to a cocoon
if you leave the draft.

64
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,958
Oh, right.

65
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,125
What could
that noise be?

66
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,833
Yukine?

67
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,791
But that's impossible.

68
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,791
What is it?

69
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,708
There's lots
of black smoke.

70
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,708
The guard post...
It must be on fire.

71
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,458
But how can that be...?

72
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,375
If we're under attack,
why hasn't the alarm sounded?

73
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,833
Seventy percent of the
posts have been destroyed!

74
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,000
Well done...
Almost there.

75
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,041
Don't you move!

76
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,166
What do you think you're
doing here, Dagmyer?!

77
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,583
What exactly
is this about?

78
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,458
Well... It would appear
that the Holy Land

79
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,916
has fallen under
my control.

80
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,666
No, you can't...!

81
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,666
That's Shtrayu's
flagship fortress!

82
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,500
I'm demanding a complete,
unconditional surrender...

83
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,416
The battle
is already over.

84
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,458
Stupid old bag!

85
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,583
Let her go.

86
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,083
The Shurifon Mechanoids
have arrived!

87
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,458
Huh... It looks like
they've kept two hidden...

88
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,708
I'm going in...

89
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,708
You can handle
things here!

90
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,250
I'm telling you...!

91
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,041
Those bandits have overrun
the central control room...

92
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,875
Dagmyer's the one
calling the shots!

93
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:23,916
All right.
You got it.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,583
I'm on my way now.

95
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,791
Poor hotheaded baby
thinks he's in control.

96
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,166
Well, we'll
see about that.

97
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,166
That lady said a storm
was coming our way...

98
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,000
Maybe this
is what she meant.

99
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,208
This is more of a
typhoon than a storm...

100
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,666
Curse you,
Lord Babalun...

101
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,416
We do not understand,
how in the world

102
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,458
did they manage to get
through that narrow ravine?

103
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,458
Empress Lashara, the
Principal would like a word.

104
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,250
Could you please explain to us
just what is going on out there?

105
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,750
We suppose this means
you have heard

106
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,708
about our current
predicament in Shtrayu...

107
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,208
Please, you have
to believe us!

108
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,000
We had nothing
to do with this!

109
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,458
No, of course you didn't...

110
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,791
However, given the current
situation, I believe

111
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,750
we have no other choice
but to evacuate the campus...

112
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,791
But we won't be able
to do it without you!

113
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,500
Whatever you need!

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,333
Principal!

115
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,125
Go...! Get the SWAN ready
for takeoff immediately...!

116
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,791
Kenshi!

117
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,958
You have to fight them
off and keep us safe...

118
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,166
You're the only
one who can do it!

119
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,875
Do you think I could
maybe get a little help?

120
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,125
The Holy Land Instructors

121
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,208
have started evacuating
the students...

122
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,333
But every second
that passes,

123
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,458
those bad guys get
closer and closer...

124
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,500
And if we don't do something
to stop them soon,

125
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,416
we will be in
an awful situation!

126
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,958
"We" or "you?"...

127
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,500
My family motto is, "one must
clean up their own messes,"

128
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,041
and I think those
are wise words!

129
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,125
Perhaps you should
consider this then...

130
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,250
If you don't
help us out,

131
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,791
everyone who's
looked after you here

132
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,000
is going to
be in grave danger!

133
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,291
Right...!
On my way!

134
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,583
You are going to hear
more from us later on...!

135
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,375
Chiaia, go and join
Kenshi, please.

136
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,250
No, I can't.

137
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,000
We understand this must
be very hard for you...

138
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,500
Dagmyer's involvement
in all of this.

139
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,000
He wouldn't do that.

140
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,666
Empress Lashara,
please hurry!

141
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,291
Chiaia...

142
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,500
If your heart is telling you
to join him, go ahead and go.

143
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,625
First up...
Evacuations!

144
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,625
Target seven's silent.

145
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,208
It looks like-

146
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,666
I don't know why, but
we've lost control!

147
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,291
Who cares, we've
done our part...

148
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,833
Have you looked outside?
It's complete chaos out there!

149
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,791
We should go earn some
pocket money then.

150
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,666
Hey...! Wahanly...!
You okay?

151
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,583
Yeah,
you bet I am...!

152
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,000
But I'll be doing
a whole lot better

153
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,083
once I get this
thing in the air!

154
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,416
Are you close?

155
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,541
I'm almost done!

156
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,541
Just gotta finish
attaching the weapons!

157
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,083
No, I like it like this...

158
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,666
If you weigh it down with
stuff it won't maneuver well.

159
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,875
According to Lan's info,

160
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,958
this is a Sacred
Mechamechanic's workshop...

161
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,333
If we find anything
valuable, we take it.

162
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,416
Great work...! It's like a
totally different mechanoid!

163
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,666
Thank you... Hey,
aren't those two guys

164
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,375
part of the gang of bandits
that attacked us at the resort?

165
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,041
Think so...
You handle them!

166
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,916
Kenshi, hold on...!
Wait! Don't go yet!

167
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,208
The way is blocked.

168
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,250
Well, well, this sure
is a sight to see...

169
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,625
The Elf Princess
is scared.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,916
Sad.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,291
Please don't hurt me.

172
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,375
Oh, don't you worry.

173
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,625
There's nothin'
to be afraid of...

174
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,541
I promise
we'll be gentle!

175
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,291
Don't touch me!

176
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,000
What's that?

177
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,833
You again!

178
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,875
No!

179
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,958
Ah...! No...!
That punk!

180
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,000
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?!

181
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,291
Stop...!
I'm gonna fall!

182
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,208
Oh, you are so dead!

183
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,125
Almost there!

184
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,500
I'm very sorry,
Kenshi...

185
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,416
Unfortunately, it seems you
always catch me at my worst.

186
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,416
I'm just glad you
didn't get hurt.

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,166
They're my least favorite
parts of the day.

188
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,708
You should've held onto
him a little bit longer.

189
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,208
Perhaps this was
your big chance.

190
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,958
Go confirm if there
are still students

191
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,500
who haven't made
it to safety yet!

192
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,833
Right... Good idea,
I didn't even think of that.

193
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,833
Will do...! Sir Kenshi!

194
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,708
Please look after our
Princess, won't you?

195
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,958
Princess...

196
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,708
You should
make your move!

197
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm going to have to dock
their pay for this!

198
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,500
Oh no.

199
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,708
Something tells me

200
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,041
I'm gonna like this
combat thing after all!

201
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,208
Those cowards!

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,166
No!

203
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,333
That's what she gets
for messing with us!

204
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,958
How dare you?!

205
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,916
Come and get me!

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,666
These dark fields
can be a hassle.

207
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,333
Finish her off!

208
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,166
Is this equipped
with weapons or no?

209
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,208
No.

210
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,833
You're finished!

211
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,416
I failed you,
Princess... I'm sorry.

212
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,750
What is going on now?!

213
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,083
They turned on the
defense system!

214
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,333
Now let's try to
secure the way

215
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,875
for the students
fleeing to safety.

216
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,500
Yeah, good idea!

217
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,500
We're taking hits
from the outside...

218
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,000
but the damage is minimal!

219
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,458
The enemy stronghold
is increasing!

220
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,958
Well, well...

221
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,500
Considering it's Dagmyer,
it could've been much worse.

222
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,125
Launch all Sacred
Mechanoids at once!

223
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,833
Nothing will stand
in BABEL's way!

224
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,541
Prime Minister...!

225
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,000
We have received a transmission
from Queen Flora of Havoniwa.

226
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,041
Lord Babalun.

227
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,416
What is going on?

228
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,291
What is the meaning of this
attack on the Holy Land?

229
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,708
A silly question...

230
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
You know as well as I do
what's happening, Queen Flora,

231
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,958
so don't play
the fool with me.

232
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,125
Just be warned...

233
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,666
we won't stop till
we've achieved our goal.

234
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,708
Well, I have to admit...

235
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,750
I figured as much.

236
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,250
After all, when someone
wages war in the Holy Land,

237
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,625
it must be for some
greater purpose, right?

238
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,916
Lord Babalun...!

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,583
A massive object is coming
straight towards us!

240
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,125
What's that?

241
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,291
All canons are ready...
waiting on your command!

242
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,583
Commence attack please.

243
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,541
I will make
her pay for this.

244
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,291
Principal...

245
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,416
I haven't spoken
to you in ages.

246
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,791
Yet another
grand entrance.

247
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,416
You know me...

248
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,458
I'm happy to take as many
of the students and faculty

249
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,500
as I can hold...

250
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,333
Open the tracks
when you're ready.

251
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,625
Thanks so much...
It means a lot.

252
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,958
Hurry up... Everyone keep
moving and make for the train!

253
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,250
Whatever you do,
just keep going!

254
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,291
Watch out for the
Sacred Mechanoids!

255
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,708
Don't worry,
you're almost there!

256
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,125
Well,
this is fun!

257
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,583
Wait!

258
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,833
Miss, what are you doing?!

259
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,791
It's too dangerous...!
Please, don't do this!

260
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,708
I have to...! I can shield
them while they run for cover!

261
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,291
There are too many,
you could be killed!

262
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,708
Hey, it looks like the Student
Council President's gonna get

263
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,458
in a mechanoid!

264
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,750
How about that?

265
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,916
Lady Lithia wants in
on the action, too!

266
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,125
Careful
what you wish for!

267
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,291
Are you
all right, Miss?

268
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,458
You big coward! You should be
ashamed of yourself!

269
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,541
I'm gonna make you regret
ever calling me that!

270
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,833
Lapis! You can't!

271
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,583
Yes, I can...!
I'm protecting you.

272
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,916
Stand back!

273
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,666
Ha!

274
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,125
Serves you right!

275
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,125
Look...
What's that?

276
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,500
It's that kid!

277
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,541
That guy...?

278
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,041
Wait, isn't he
Lashara's attendant?

279
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,000
You're not hurt,
are you?

280
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,041
I'm okay, I'm just
a little shaken up...

281
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,541
Lapis, why are you crying?
What's wrong?

282
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:55,125
Oh... I'm fine, I'm just glad
you're okay, Lady Lithia.

283
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,750
Can you stand up...?

284
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,375
Quick... We have to move,
it's not safe here!

285
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay.

286
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,625
It's horrible.

287
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,125
Don't cry, you'll be fine...
I'm gonna take care of this.

288
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,083
Princess Aura... I'm leaving
this Mechaworker to you!

289
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,208
Where exactly do you
think you're going?!

290
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,916
Kenshi, wait!

291
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,083
The kid's making
a run for it!

292
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,625
Calm down...
Everyone, please.

293
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,583
The coliseum's built to
withstand attacks like this.

294
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,875
You're safe.

295
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,208
It's impossible
for the Mechanoids

296
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,958
to pass through
Ena's draft.

297
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,416
Let's get a headcount and
figure out who we're missing.

298
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,458
Once that's done,
classes one through four

299
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,000
go to the
Church's battleship

300
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,083
using Underground
Passage sixteen.

301
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,583
Classes five through eight,

302
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,166
use passage twenty-nine to
reach Princess Lashara's SWAN.

303
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,125
The rest of you go to Queen
Flora's armored train

304
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,541
through passage seven...

305
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,750
and make sure to stick to
your evacuation routes.

306
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,250
Yes, ma'am!

307
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,375
Line up according to
your seating number...

308
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,666
Come on you guys, I'm counting
on you so let's move out!

309
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,208
Oh Dagmyer...

310
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,625
Tell me this
is all a big lie.

311
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,125
I knew this would
happen eventually.

312
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,041
Sis... Where
have you been?

313
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,666
You're Empress Lashara's
personal bodyguard...

314
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,875
He belongs to the Mesuts.

315
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,125
Yes, I know that...
and I always have.

316
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,041
Miss Mexiah!

317
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,166
Everybody's here
and we're ready to go!

318
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,166
One by one, all the
classes are escaping

319
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,708
through the three
different passageways!

320
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,875
Great, thank you for
keeping me informed...

321
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,083
You should go and join the
rest of your classmates.

322
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,541
Yes ma'am!

323
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,000
Hey...
Is that Kenshi?

324
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,916
Kenshi, no!

325
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,708
What in the world
is that idiot doing?!

326
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,833
If you ask me,
all the attention

327
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,750
he's been getting
went to his head.

328
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,250
He's just an attendant...

329
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,583
He's not a real Sacred
Mechamaster like we are!

330
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,875
Stop him!

331
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,708
Move it!

332
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,041
Die!

333
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,291
All right...! That's
what I'm talking about!

334
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,708
It appears that everyone from
this block managed to escape.

335
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,416
Yes. I can't
believe Mother...

336
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,250
A shoot out between a battleship
and an armored train

337
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,125
in the Holy Land
has never happened before.

338
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,000
Yukine, what's the matter?

339
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,958
Dagmyer!

340
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,250
Wait a second...
That's Kenshi!

341
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,458
What could he be doing?

342
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,416
Be careful!

343
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,416
It's too late!

344
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,916
That little brat!

345
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,166
It's Kenshi!

346
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,250
That jerk.

347
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,125
Oh... Wow.

348
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,291
A total of one thousand,
one hundred forty-nine students

349
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,333
and faculty have taken
refuge in the SWAN.

350
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,750
So far, everyone
is holding up well.

351
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,041
The majority of the injuries
sustained were minor.

352
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,500
Unbelievable...

353
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,833
We've never seen anything
like this before in our lives,

354
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,291
that's for sure.

355
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,541
Queen Flora has some
fight in her yet.

356
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,125
What's going on?!

357
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,708
Would you care
to explain?!

358
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,791
Wait!
Explain what?!

359
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,625
Him...! Him!

360
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,083
Oh my! That's Kenshi...!
But it can't be!

361
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,125
I think I'm gonna be sick!

362
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,375
Can it be...?
Is he really a light-type?

363
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,625
What's a light-type?

364
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,083
The sacred texts of
the Church tell us,

365
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,583
"He who is garbed in light shall
be the savior of the world...

366
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,541
While he who dons the robes
of darkness shall be bent

367
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,041
on its destruction."

368
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,375
Darkness...
And light?

369
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,041
Both of these forces
are interconnected.

370
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,583
Light can take the
shape of darkness,

371
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,250
and darkness can take
the shape of light.

372
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,375
A real white
Sacred Mechanoid.

373
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,000
Wow.

374
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,875
I'm not surprised,
I always knew Kenshi

375
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,458
was made to pilot
that Sacred Mechanoid!

376
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,875
Amazing.

377
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,333
Kenshi's
a Sacred Mechamaster?

378
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,500
Oh no... Quick,
defend yourselves!

379
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,541
Don't kill me...!
Please don't kill me!

380
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,791
Coward!

381
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,041
Will you get back here?

382
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,333
No...!
You can't stop me...!

383
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,041
Be gone!

384
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,375
Sir Dagmyer!

385
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:53,208
Oh no!

386
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,875
Wahan...! Help him!

387
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:58,041
Sorry, but my hands are
a little full right now!

388
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,916
That idiot, he fell
for it...! Finish him!

389
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,333
Kenshi, no...!
It was a trap!

390
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,708
It doesn't matter
how strong he is!

391
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,458
He's got
a big disadvantage!

392
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,166
He's completely outnumbered!

393
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,000
They've got him cornered in
there like a poor little Koro.

394
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,333
What'll he do?

395
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,833
Hey.

396
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,541
Where'd Mexiah go?

397
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,333
With all these pillars
so close together,

398
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:44,791
he'll have
zero maneuverability.

399
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,333
Found him.

400
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,958
No way!

401
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,000
No!

402
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,500
Squeeze him
from both sides!

403
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,291
He's gone?!

404
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,750
Cordyline!
Be careful!

405
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,375
That's good,
come this way...

406
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,208
Just a little closer.

407
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,791
I'm gonna
treat you real nice!

408
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,208
No!

409
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,000
Curse him...
The brat!

410
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,833
Oh wow.

411
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,416
Unbelievable.
Who's piloting that thing?

412
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,333
I've never heard of a pure
white Sacred Mechanoid.

413
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,291
Oh...? I guess you
don't know then?

414
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,375
It's Kenshi Masaki,
he's the one responsible

415
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,458
for fighting the bad
guys and saving the day!

416
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,833
What...?
Like, for real?!

417
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,583
You mean Empress
Lashara's attendant...?

418
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,083
It's that Kenshi?

419
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,458
I saw him enter the cocoon
with my own two eyes!

420
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,708
Isn't that nuts?

421
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,416
Kenshi's piloting
the White Mechanoid!

422
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,875
Is it really Kenshi?

423
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,375
Oh yeah, it is definitely him!
That's Kenshi down there!

424
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,291
Kenshi...
He's our hero!

425
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,625
That is so amazing!

426
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,583
They are enclosed
by the Draft

427
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,375
as they fight
around those pillars...

428
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,166
It is terrifically
difficult.

429
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh... Well, it doesn't really
look all that hard to me.

430
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,875
What an idiot.

431
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,291
Mexiah?

432
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,125
Many great Sacred Mechamasters
who were hailed as 'experts'

433
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,958
have fought right here
on this hallowed ground,

434
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,250
but not a single
one of them

435
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,958
was able to use
moves like he just did.

436
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:05,125
The boy exceeds all
our expectations.

437
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,250
Dagmyer...

438
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,375
We should retreat
while we still can!

439
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,666
Coward...

440
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,166
There's no way I'll show
my back to that wretch!

441
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,000
We're not done!
Where are you?!

442
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,583
Cliff, no!

443
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,041
Come on!

444
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,458
The little jerk knew
exactly what he was doing.

445
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,333
He lured us right into
his hunting grounds!

446
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,750
Mother!

447
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,833
Yukine,
I owe you big time...

448
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:15,416
Thank you for bringing my
baby back to me in one piece.

449
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,458
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:20,125
This day certainly has
been full of surprises.

451
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,291
Can you believe he's
a Sacred Mechamaster?

452
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,833
Amazing!

453
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:28,000
It's hard to imagine someone
wielding that amount of power...

454
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,500
One of these days,

455
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,333
I'll make that niece of mine
give me the inside scoop.

456
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,833
Thanks to Kenshi,

457
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,333
the majority of the enemy Sacred
Mechanoids are inoperable...

458
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,708
If we keep
pushing forward

459
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,083
we should be able
to make them retreat.

460
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,666
I wouldn't be so certain.

461
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,166
Babalun's still got
something up his sleeve.

462
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,083
Don't count him out yet.

463
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,125
We're here.

464
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,500
BABEL has reached its target
location, adjusting for errors.

465
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,083
I have just confirmed the
barrier, Prime Minister...!

466
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,750
Commencing scans.

467
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,416
Constructing the
anti-barrier circle!

468
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:34,041
What in the world
is he up to?

469
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,875
Don't tell me Babalun
is after that!

470
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,125
Why?

471
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,166
This can't be!

472
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,708
Dagmyer!

473
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,250
Time to get outta here!

474
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,416
We can't...
She's still out there!

475
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,083
Cordyline will be all right,
she knows what she's doing!

476
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,083
There isn't anything I can do
against a monster like this!

477
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:16,250
Mexiah...!
What is wrong with you?!

478
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,250
Say something...!
Can't you hear my voice?!

479
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,458
Please...!
Will you just answer me?!

480
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,000
Mexiah!

481
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,666
It has been quite
a while, Chiaia.

482
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,500
What is going on...?

483
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,833
Tell me, what have you
done to my sister?

484
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,041
You'll find out
soon enough.

485
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,083
Stand back.

486
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,625
The Sacred
Mechalord Pedestal!

487
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,916
Something isn't right.

488
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,083
Mexiah.

489
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,583
Barrier
analysis complete.

490
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,458
Synching now.

491
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,875
What's going on?

492
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,416
It can't be!

493
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,541
That's right...
Come to life!

494
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,541
Let her go!

495
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,875
Hear me, Chiaia...

496
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,416
It's time you learned
Mexiah is not your sister.

497
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,166
Your father excavated her
body from the same ruins

498
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,666
where he discovered
the Sacred Mechalord...

499
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,625
Your 'big sister' was made
by the ancient civilization.

500
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,208
That's impossible.

501
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,250
See for yourself then.

502
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,125
Miss Mexiah!

503
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,291
Is that... Doll?

504
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,875
It can't be real...

505
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,041
There's no way.

506
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,375
Put me on a direct
line with the Pope!

507
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,250
No, this can't
be happening.

508
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:45,833
I don't know how things
could possibly get worse!

509
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,000
The ways of old
are resurrected!

510
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,375
Sister!

511
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:14,041
I'd hurry and get those
kids out of here...

512
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,958
Unless of course,
you want them to die.

513
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:19,000
No, wait...!
You don't have to do this!

514
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,166
Mexiah, don't go...!
Please stop!!

515
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,208
I hate pillars.

516
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:59,500
Don't touch them!

517
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,625
He's strong...

518
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,916
Especially for a mere
Sacred Mechanoid.

519
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,416
Its not safe here...
Get inside!

520
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,708
I'll follow
right behind you,

521
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,541
as soon as I do one
last head count!

522
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,583
We're not leaving
without you!

523
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:14,125
Thank you, but I can't abandon
that idiot and my sister!

524
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:18,500
Whatever you do,
just get out safely.

525
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:32,208
It would appear
this is the end.

526
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,500
What are you doing?
Take your shot!

527
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,041
I don't get it, why
can't I attack him...?

528
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,166
Is it Mexiah's personality?

529
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,208
Or something else?

530
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,875
But no... I have orders
and I have to follow them!

531
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,833
The deterioration
of the frame is worse

532
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,041
than I originally
anticipated.

533
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,958
Chiaia!

534
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,583
All the students are safe.
There are no more stragglers!

535
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,958
I think it's about time
we sought refuge ourselves!

536
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,500
Not yet, Kenshi
is still out there!

537
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,583
I'm sorry...

538
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,708
but there's nothing
we can do.

539
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,250
What if we create some
kind of diversion?

540
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,333
If we're unable to retreat
at the right moment

541
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:11,541
we could be killed...

542
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,083
And besides...

543
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,833
It's very likely we would end
up getting in Kenshi's way.

544
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,750
We need
to get moving...

545
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,208
I know Kenshi can
take care of himself.

546
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,416
Kenshi...

547
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,416
please...

548
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,708
save her.

549
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,041
Please, snap out of it,
Big Sis Mexiah!

550
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,041
No use wasting your breath.

551
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,041
Mexiah and I have
merged into one being.

552
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,291
Her experiences
are mine now...

553
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:41,375
I remember all the times
we've spent together.

554
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,166
I remember all
sorts of things.

555
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,875
Not sure
if it's possible,

556
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:49,750
but if you could forget some
of that stuff, that'd be great.

557
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,958
I really did enjoy
my time here...

558
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,833
And I'm sorry,
but I can't stay.

559
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,583
But if you wanted...

560
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,958
you could come with me.

561
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,583
I really wish I could,

562
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,916
but my place was
never on that side...

563
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,458
But what if you came with us
instead of going with them...?

564
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:10,333
I could make a nice home
for you here if you'd let me.

565
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,833
I can't do that.

566
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,708
I'm 'Doll,' remember...?

567
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,916
Fighting is my only
reason for existing.

568
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,083
It's how I was created,
and how I'll always be.

569
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,875
Are you okay with that?

570
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,833
This is my destiny, Kenshi...

571
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:29,875
I've no choice.

572
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,375
Principal,
I've confirmed

573
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,875
that all students
have made it out safely!

574
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,666
That's excellent news...

575
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,416
Prepare to launch immediately!

576
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes, ma'am!

577
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,875
Thank goodness,
you're safe!

578
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,666
Damage report.

579
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,791
Thanks to Kenshi, we were able
to rescue all of our team!

580
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:50,583
Good...

581
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,958
Then let's prepare
to launch at once!

582
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,875
Queen Flora... We've
been able to accommodate

583
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,833
all of the refugees
who fled this way.

584
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,291
There were some
minor injuries,

585
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,833
but all two hundred
and twenty-one students

586
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,250
made it safe and sound.

587
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,125
Excellent.

588
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:12,458
Stand by...
Arm the cannon!

589
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,208
Mother! No...!

590
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,416
Kenshi's still out there,
you could hurt him!

591
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,791
Oh, don't worry, something
tells me he'll be fine.

592
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,000
Right... Yukine?

593
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,208
The main cannon
is ready to fire.

594
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,416
Waiting on your
command, Queen Flora!

595
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,833
All right then... let's
retreat to a safe distance.

596
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,250
After firing
the main cannon

597
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,333
have the front
cars self-destruct.

598
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:49,500
With any luck we can cut off
anyone trying to track us!

599
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,291
Put me through now... Kenshi!

600
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,916
It can't end like this.

601
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,708
Kenshi!

602
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,208
Wait, Princess Maria?

603
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,791
My mother is about to do
something incredibly stupid...

604
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,458
so look out!

605
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,250
Aw man,
this sucks!

606
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,791
There he is!

607
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,458
Hey, are you okay?!

608
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,125
Mexiah.

609
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,083
For now, that is
the best we can do.

610
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,458
We are simply too weak.

611
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,333
They'll be overtaken
soon, though.

612
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:57,791
Fine, but we should go back
to the barrier workshop!

613
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,916
It's a
one-in-a-million chance

614
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,666
the Sacred Mechalord
is ever activated.

615
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,125
And in that event...

616
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,541
Naua said we should
definitely go and see him.

617
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,083
My dad said that?

618
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,625
Well, all right then...

619
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,291
Wait a second, Wahan,

620
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,791
this means you're finally going
to tell us everything you know,

621
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:12,833
doesn't it?

622
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,166
It does.

623
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,916
But hold on... Look.

624
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,416
Kenshi...!
Take them out!

625
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,375
Right!

626
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,041
The frame
is breaking down...!

627
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,333
I guess Kenshi's power
was too much for it!

628
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,750
It can fight though,
can't it?

629
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,250
No, it won't even morph!

630
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,541
This is not good.

631
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,916
It's time the bad guys
went... bye-bye.

632
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,458
We are going
to kill you, Aunt Flora!

633
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,875
The nerve of that
stupid old bag!

634
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:59,416
She doesn't ever think!

635
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,958
What if we had been caught
in the middle of all that?!

636
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,333
Relax, at least we get
a happy ending, right...?

637
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,625
This day could have
been so much worse.

638
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,541
Oh no!

639
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,208
Kenshi...?
What's wrong?

640
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,833
I left behind
all my crystals!

641
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,541
Aw man!

642
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,916
Aw... I worked
so hard for those.

643
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Kenshi!
Look at me.

644
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,416
Correct me if I'm wrong,

645
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,166
but I seem to remember
you telling me

646
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,666
you weren't going to
dig up crystals anymore.

647
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,958
So tell me about this...

648
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,500
in greater detail,
you little twerp!

649
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,500
Mew, mew, mew, mew.

650
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,708
Come back here!

651
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,250
I'll make you
pay for this!

652
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,583
Yep.

653
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,875
Moron!

654
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,291
Glad to see some
things never change.

655
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,791
Yeah!

656
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,125
Hey, Dagmyer...

657
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,916
There's no reason
to be down in the dumps...

658
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,333
Your plan was
a complete success.

659
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,083
Yes, I'm aware of that.

660
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,458
Promise you won't
do anything crazy...

661
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:04,750
'Cause who knows...?

662
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,375
Next time I might not
be there to help you out.

663
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,083
Well, how did
everything turn out?

664
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:14,666
She snuck right in,
no one saw her.

665
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,375
Everything's on schedule,
just as planned.

666
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:19,083
Excellent.

667
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,291
Stupid us!

668
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,083
Here we were thinking the
only thing we had to worry

669
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,583
about was Babalun...!

670
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:15,333
Okay... First let's head
to Aura's country...!

671
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,375
Next on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

672
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,958
"Expectations"...

673
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:21,625
This time we'll return her to
her old self, no matter what!
