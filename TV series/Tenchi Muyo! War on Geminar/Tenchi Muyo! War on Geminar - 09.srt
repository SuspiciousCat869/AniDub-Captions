1
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:57,875
I have been waiting for this
day to arrive for ages...

2
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,250
It's been far too long...

3
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,875
Shield of Gaia.

4
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,833
Brother!

5
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,625
The damage to
the Sacred Mechalord

6
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,666
is worse
than we thought.

7
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,208
It doesn't matter now...

8
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,708
I've obtained
the Shield of Gaia.

9
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,708
And Kenshi?

10
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,000
What about the boy...?

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,291
What are we going
to do with him?

12
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,583
His power is immense.

13
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,708
Greater than
I ever imagined.

14
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,083
You laugh?

15
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,333
Ignore him...

16
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,333
His so-called "power"
is no longer relevant.

17
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,916
But if you're
still worried,

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,833
have Dagmyer play
with the child.

19
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,333
Sorry for
the wait, guys...!

20
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,083
The food's ready!

21
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,791
Thank you!

22
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,833
Hey, Kenshi?

23
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,750
So, you're a
Sacred Mechamaster?

24
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,000
That's nice.

25
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,416
And you're a really
powerful one at that!

26
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,916
You're so cool...

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
I really hope I'll get the
chance to marry you some day.

28
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, yeah,
same thing here...!

29
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,500
I don't even wanna get married
if it can't be to you.

30
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,583
I've wanted
to marry you more

31
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,125
than I've wanted
to marry anyone,..

32
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,541
I didn't think he could get more
popular than he already was.

33
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,833
After showing how powerful
a Mechamaster he is,

34
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,833
it was bound to happen.

35
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,166
Dagmyer...

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
Chiaia?

37
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,541
Here, you haven't
gotten any food yet...

38
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,791
Oh...

39
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,791
You all right...?
You seem kinda down.

40
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,083
I'm just perfect...

41
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,916
Now, quit
procrastinating, okay?

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,250
You need to be
focusing on your work.

43
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,833
Right...

44
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,208
What are you doing here?.

45
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,833
What's going on?

46
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,791
How could he attack
the Holy Land?

47
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,541
Curse Babalun!

48
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,250
No one expected this.

49
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,583
Agreed...

50
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,333
We personally believed he
was only after Shtrayu.

51
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,041
We must admit,
we're impressed.

52
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,041
I don't like the
sound of that.

53
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,250
Although, no matter
how you look at it,

54
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,958
this is sheer madness...

55
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,125
He's turned the Church as well
as the world against him...

56
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,375
He's also activated
the Sacred Mechalord.

57
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,083
We can't just dismiss
that as madness.

58
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,750
And why not...?
What are you not telling us?

59
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,625
You'll have to ask Master
Naua for that information...

60
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,416
I'd still like to have the
real scoop on Kenshi, though.

61
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
I would appreciate

62
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,375
an explanation
about him, as well...

63
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,875
Miss Lashara.

64
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,666
Naturally...
The truth is...

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,666
Kenshi's
from another world.

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,000
I had a feeling that
might be the case.

67
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,083
But how could
it be possible...?

68
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,333
Even if he'd been in hibernation
in the Barrier Workshop,

69
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,791
there'd be no way he
could still look so young.

70
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,000
Had he been summoned here,
that would be the case.

71
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,750
However, considering
everything he's told us,

72
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,750
'tis more likely he was sent
to our world instead.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,250
Yeah, well I think we oughtta
leave this little issue

74
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,875
to Master Naua, too.

75
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,375
You're late...
What's wrong?

76
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,958
You don't look well.

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,083
Are you tired?
You're not sick, are you?

78
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,375
No... I feel fine.

79
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,750
I'm good, I promise.

80
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,958
That's wonderful.

81
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,458
Empress Lashara...

82
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,083
The Church has informed us
they will take the refugees

83
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,041
we have aboard the SWAN
at the next checkpoint...

84
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,375
Also...

85
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,708
They want to question
us, do they not?

86
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,041
They do.

87
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,083
Right outside the Draft,
we're surrounded by trees.

88
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,291
Our location for the forward
base couldn't be more perfect.

89
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,833
First the Holy Land.

90
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,750
Next up, Shurifon
followed by Havoniwa.

91
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,458
I'm hearing rumblings we have
fighters that want to quit...

92
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,000
We've had a couple
of deserters already.

93
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,708
I don't need anyone here who
has lost the will to fight...

94
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,750
They are all free
to do as they wish.

95
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,041
Well... I can't exactly
blame them for being scared.

96
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,458
Not after seeing
a fight like that.

97
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,458
He'll be our
first target?

98
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,833
Absolutely.

99
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,333
Good.

100
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,708
But be careful...

101
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,041
That boy will be our
greatest obstacle.

102
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,791
Hey, Dagmyer...

103
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,750
Is it really the smartest
move to make an attack

104
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,416
on such a large scale?

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,083
Don't worry about it.

106
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,916
I just want to make sure my
reward stays in one piece...

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,666
Don't take your
anger out on my ship.

108
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,791
Oh, I won't...

109
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,291
But you'll have to finish your
job before you get anything.

110
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,125
They went a little
overboard latching us down,

111
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,458
don't you think?

112
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,750
I wonder how long they're
planning to hold us here.

113
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,166
Classic war chest funding
and post war management...

114
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,041
They most likely
only need us to consent

115
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,583
to a bunch of different plans
they're wanting to make.

116
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,583
How much information do you
expect them to ask for, Empress?

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
Right now, we're far
more concerned with

118
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,083
who will be granted
the right to own Kenshi.

119
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,250
Hopefully... that won't
even be brought up.

120
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,125
I wonder what Empress Lashara
and her crew are going to do.

121
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,666
Do you think we'll ever
get to see them again?

122
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,750
You have a lot on
your mind, dear...

123
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,250
but we have more important
work we need to worry about now.

124
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,375
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,750
We'll see them again...

126
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,291
All the Empress's ladies...

127
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,000
as well as that
Wild Beast of hers.

128
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,916
Oh, good!

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,500
Compressed bullets?
Um, what are those?

130
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,250
Are you seriously
telling me you don't know

131
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,666
what compressed bullets are?

132
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,166
Shut up!
I've never held a gun

133
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,708
while piloting
a Sacred Mechanoid!

134
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,250
Since you're a
Sacred Mechamaster,

135
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,666
you're gonna need to eventually,
so I might as well...

136
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,541
Okay then!. I'll teach
you all about them.

137
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,250
Go ahead and pick up
anything you want.

138
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,291
Like, just anything?

139
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,208
Now use Aho to trap
Ena inside of it.

140
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,208
Give it a shot!

141
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,208
Okay...

142
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,291
That was so fast...

143
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,125
He's incredible.

144
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,291
Kill Kenshi?

145
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,791
To be honest with
you, Chiaia...

146
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,416
I don't want
to be your enemy.

147
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,375
Yours or Empress Lashara's.

148
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,083
They why would you
attack the Holy Land?

149
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,958
They might
go easy on you...

150
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,291
I think you should
just turn yourself in.

151
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,708
I will not
betray my father...

152
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,333
I have no choice
but to move forward.

153
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,208
You're only headed
towards destruction.

154
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,125
Despite being
a "Male Mechamaster"

155
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,416
and the privileges
that come with it...

156
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,250
I am not,
in actuality, free.

157
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,916
Please...

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,166
Do not assume my father attacked
the Holy Land without reason.

159
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,333
The Sacred Mechalord...

160
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,083
Yes...
and Doll...

161
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,791
Mexiah...! Please,
tell me what happened...

162
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,416
What happened
to my sister?

163
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,875
I'm...

164
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,500
mostly kept in the
dark about that.

165
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,291
But why Kenshi?

166
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,333
There is a possibility he could
pilot the Sacred Mechalord.

167
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,541
In that case...

168
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,750
why not just catch him?

169
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,333
He wouldn't be a problem
if he were easier to catch.

170
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,208
I'm not forcing you
to do anything, Chiaia...

171
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,125
I'm asking.

172
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,916
Please, help me.

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,041
I need you.

174
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,333
Why didn't you kill him?

175
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,291
Empress Lashara...

176
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,708
One should always pursue

177
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,375
whatever brings them true
happiness, don't you think?

178
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,000
He has the sharpest senses
of anyone I've ever met.

179
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,458
But when I pointed my sword
at him, he didn't wake up.

180
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,833
He didn't move at all.

181
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,125
No matter what I say,
he keeps digging up crystals.

182
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:20,333
He even apologizes
to me for it in his sleep.

183
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,666
It sounds to us...

184
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,541
like he is rather
afraid of you Chiaia.

185
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,541
What's happened to Dagmyer? .

186
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,875
He's so different than
when we were young.

187
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,458
I don't understand
why he changed...

188
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,250
His smile used
to be so gentle...

189
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,458
And now...

190
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:40,250
'tis soulless and empty.

191
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,916
We suppose since he did not play
the hostage card with Mexiah,

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,416
he's trying
to prove something...

193
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,708
Perhaps he
wants to show

194
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,708
how magnanimous he
can be as a ruler.

195
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,000
What...?!
Chiaia's gone?

196
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,833
We are also missing
one air bike, Empress.

197
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,041
Really! There's
no helping that girl...!

198
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,625
Well... Were you able
to plant it in time?

199
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,875
I did as you instructed.

200
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,541
You're sure this
is the right way?

201
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,833
Of course...

202
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,666
But are you sure
about returning...?

203
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,541
There will be no room
for you since you failed.

204
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,916
You don't have to go back...
We can still turn around.

205
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,333
Come on, don't
do anything stupid!

206
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,250
Breaking the seal is a serious
breach of international law!

207
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,833
Is that clear?

208
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,083
Are you sure about this?

209
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,416
Yes!

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,291
It's the SWAN!

211
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,958
Well, perfect.

212
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,625
Okay, listen up...! Ready
the ships to give pursuit!

213
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,083
You might as well go ahead
and write up a bill

214
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,708
charging for the broken
dock instead...

215
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,708
That'll be more effective.

216
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,041
So, where are
we off to now?

217
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,458
Well, we have
a rough idea,

218
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,750
but we're not sure
of the exact location.

219
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,583
What is it
with that reaction? .

220
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,291
Just relax. We have
everything under control!

221
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,416
I just, you know, maybe
it wasn't the best idea

222
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,708
to force a takeoff
like that...

223
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,833
It might cause
a few problems...

224
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,750
and we're kinda packed
full of problems right now.

225
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,625
We had no way
of knowing for sure

226
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,083
if they would listen to our
explanation of the situation...

227
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,208
What could we do?
We'd no time to waste.

228
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,458
Being assertive was our
best if not only option.

229
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,416
Is that what you
call assertive?

230
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,125
Who are you?

231
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,250
It's you.

232
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,541
So you have failed
to kill Kenshi...

233
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,125
Please, you
cannot do this...

234
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,875
It's not too late
to change your mind!

235
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,625
I have no intention of debating
what I do with you,

236
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,708
nor do I intend
to change anything.

237
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,000
But why did it have
to go this far?

238
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,291
We Sacred Mechamasters

239
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,416
may receive rather impressive
privileges, but the truth is,

240
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,208
we're nothing more than
our rulers' livestock.

241
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,791
We are forced to carry the
shrines of selfish brats

242
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,708
like your
so-called Empress.

243
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,750
That's not true...

244
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,125
I'm not even free
to choose whom I love.

245
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,041
Can you imagine what
that's like for me?

246
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,416
So why not become sovereign
and do what you want...?

247
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,250
Is that about right?

248
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,750
That is right...

249
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,000
Those who have the power
are the ones that rule...

250
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,250
Pardon the cliché,
but it's still the truth.

251
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,583
Empress Lashara?

252
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,458
So this is not
about eliminating

253
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,833
the Sacred
Mechamaster Class?

254
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,791
I'm too much of
a realist to try that.

255
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,583
Good. We feel
better now...

256
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,666
If you started spewing
childish ideals at us,

257
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,291
we would have been far too
embarrassed to fight you.

258
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,625
Now, we'll be
able to tear you

259
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,541
apart without
feeling conflicted!

260
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,833
Sounds good to me!

261
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,458
We don't have to be
the bad guys that way!

262
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,875
Look, stupid...!

263
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,250
We are trying
to be tough here!

264
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,083
Woah...! Did that fly over
the forest outside the Draft?

265
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,208
The SWAN?!

266
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,208
I don't think she understands
I lured her to me.

267
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,291
She's not very bright.

268
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,875
What is that?

269
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,083
What happened?

270
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,500
We created
an Ena-Void Zone.

271
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,583
The Aho Barrier Reactors
we planted underground

272
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,750
consume all of their Ena.

273
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,625
You planned this
from the start?

274
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,500
Destroy the SWAN's
barrier reactor!

275
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,750
That's about
to be my ship.

276
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,416
So try not
to wreck it, okay?!

277
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,250
Empress Lashara!

278
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,666
Let go of me!

279
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,458
Keep her still until
we're finished with them.

280
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,458
How could you?

281
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,500
This is too easy!

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,833
Alan!

283
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,750
Gunpowder?

284
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,875
I love this stuff!

285
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,375
Eliminate her Mechaworker!

286
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,708
Destroy that thing!

287
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,125
What are they doing?

288
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,625
Everything is right
in front of them...!

289
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,916
Stop screwing
around already!

290
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,208
You'll pay for that!

291
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,708
Man, fighting alone is
kinda really totally hard.

292
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,750
Kenshi... hurry
it up, please.

293
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,041
Empress Lashara...

294
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,041
Watch out!

295
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,500
You son of a-!

296
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,208
Him again.

297
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,625
Kenshi?

298
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,541
Why, you little-!

299
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,791
Chiaia!

300
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,333
No! Wait!

301
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,958
Chiaia!

302
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,125
Are you
all right, sir?

303
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,125
Capture him,
i mmediately!

304
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,833
Kill him!

305
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,125
Not yet!

306
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,458
The SWAN is almost mine...!
I'm not finished with you yet! .

307
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,916
I will have her!

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh...
Dagmyer...

309
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,916
Kenshi...
The SWAN!

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,041
Yeah, I know, don't worry.

311
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,208
I'll take care of it.

312
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,125
But first, we need
to make a little detour.

313
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,125
What kind of detour?

314
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,833
I found something
pretty cool down here.

315
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,541
You're finished!

316
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,125
What's that?!

317
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,583
Go Kenshi!

318
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,500
A white Sacred
Mechanoid...

319
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,916
I hate
that guy so much!

320
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,666
Where's he going?

321
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,250
The Barrier Reactors...!

322
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,958
Stop him!

323
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,958
Where are they?

324
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,250
I found one!

325
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,625
Not so fast!

326
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,333
Cliff, no!

327
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,333
Well, it took
you long enough.

328
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,916
Get them, Kenshi!

329
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,166
You're going down!

330
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,125
This is ridiculous...

331
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,375
There's no way we can
beat him in a fair fight.

332
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,833
Great!

333
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,666
Now counterattack!

334
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,541
Come on, what is it now?

335
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,250
The black Sacred Mechanoid?

336
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,916
A black Mecha...

337
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,458
It must be Doll.

338
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,041
Mexiah...

339
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,250
No way!. Don't tell me that
thing's the Shield of Gaia!

340
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,541
So not good news.

341
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,208
We came to rescue Chiaia...

342
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,125
and we succeeded...

343
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,250
Luckily, it opened an
escape route for us...

344
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,666
Let's get out of here!

345
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,666
Don't have to tell me twice!

346
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,791
My ship is getting away!

347
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,333
Curse you, Dagmyer...

348
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,000
You just can't do
anything right.

349
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,083
She's not following.

350
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,083
I think that's a good sign.

351
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,875
Doll!

352
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,791
Why are you just
sitting there...?

353
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,958
Go after them!

354
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,791
How long do you
think it took for...

355
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,958
For me to get all
the way here to you?

356
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,416
You're at your limit,
already...?

357
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,125
What good are you to me?

358
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,791
I have a feeling you
wouldn't say that to me

359
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,625
in front of your father.

360
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,208
You're nothing but a
pet to him...! Pathetic!

361
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,750
Try again, Dagmyer...

362
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,916
I don't have to say
I got here in time.

363
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,333
Please...
forgive me...

364
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:53,041
I am willing to accept whatever
punishment you wish, Empress.

365
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,083
Well, have you put
your thoughts in order?

366
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,291
I have.

367
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,291
We won't let
you off again!

368
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,416
Right!

369
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,166
We are done!

370
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,375
Isn't that great, Chiaia?!

371
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,583
Yeah, it's great...

372
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,458
I'm still amazed you
all knew it was a trap.

373
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,083
Someone named Neizai
warned us about everything.

374
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,125
Who's Neizai?

375
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,291
She's an acquaintance
of Kenshi's.

376
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:22,291
But, even so, she appears to be
on the side of the enemy...

377
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,916
which we find quite odd.

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,166
Then why warn us?

379
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,291
Our best guess is they
aren't solidly united.

380
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,541
That makes sense...

381
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,041
So what's the plan now?

382
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,541
Well, considering Empress
Lashara's current situation,

383
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,500
I think it would be best
if she went into exile

384
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:39,166
and spent the rest of her
years in quiet isolation.

385
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,875
Do you think we would
simply allow things

386
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,500
to stand the way they
do now forever?

387
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,791
Do you have something
particular in mind, then?

388
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,958
That incident in the Holy
Land the other day...

389
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,208
Was it not the most wonderful
coming-out for Kenshi?

390
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,625
That's true.

391
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,416
I guess Sacred Mechamasters
from all over the world

392
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,291
got a chance to see him
battle pretty impressively

393
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,958
in the coliseum.

394
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,625
If you use Kenshi's 'duties'
as a bargaining chip...

395
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,916
Getting help
from other nations

396
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,166
will be a piece
of cake for us!

397
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,833
Before we
bargain my duties,

398
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,125
don't you think
we should come up

399
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,875
with some sort of excuse
to tell the Church?

400
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,791
Why would we need
an excuse for the Church...?

401
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,541
Although, I guess the SWAN was
technically under their custody.

402
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,375
What did you guys do?

403
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:33,083
I never imagined Lord Babalun
was after the Shield of Gaia.

404
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:36,750
It was naïve of us to assume
he was only after Shtrayu.

405
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:40,375
I'm still quite surprised
Mexiah was one of them.

406
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,791
Summon Lord Naua
here immediately!

407
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:46,125
We don't need a scapegoat, we
need to address this Gaia issue!

408
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,833
How do we do that...?

409
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,625
It was responsible
for the downfall

410
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,333
of our previous
civilization.

411
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,416
According to our reports,

412
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,291
the Sacred Mechalord
has deteriorated,

413
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,083
limiting its
maneuverability.

414
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,375
Which means
we should strike!

415
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:00,000
How can we? The Holy
Land's a solid fortress!

416
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,041
With enough force,
we can still topple it.

417
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,500
But coordinating all
countries will take time.

418
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,000
There's no other way.

419
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,291
Meanwhile, they could be
repairing the Sacred Mechalord

420
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,916
while we stand
here debating!

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,541
Our current forces
just aren't enough!

422
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,875
It's too late.

423
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:17,000
Gaia's seal has
already been broken.

424
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,875
It would seem our only
option at this point

425
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:21,208
is to deploy a special
demolition team.

426
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,083
A white Sacred Mechanoid was
sighted in the Holy Land...

427
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,166
Do we know who that was?

428
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,541
I've heard it overpowered
Babalun's Mechas...

429
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,500
Even held its own against
the Sacred Mechalord.

430
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,583
That information is
convoluted at best,

431
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,625
so I'm cautious to trust it.

432
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,166
Considering our current
predicament, we cannot rely

433
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,875
on unconfirmed intelligence.

434
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:51,666
It appears the necessary repairs
are going to take a while.

435
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,666
I doubt the Church is going
to stay quiet much longer...

436
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,833
What would you like
to do, brother?

437
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:03,333
They will need to amass
strong forces to overrun us...

438
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:05,625
Fortunately, it will take
some time for the Church

439
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:09,041
to unify all of the
nations with them.

440
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,541
They'll most likely try
to destroy it in the interim...

441
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,333
I would do the same
if it were me.

442
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,833
Well, let's
buy some time.

443
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,416
We could stand
a little entertainment.

444
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,750
What exactly is this?

445
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,708
It is a bill received for the
damage done to the checkpoint.

446
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,000
And where did they come up
with these outrageous numbers?!

447
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:31,666
I suppose we could repair
the checkpoint ourselves.

448
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,958
We can worry about stupid bills
that have no due dates later...

449
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,375
Stick with the plan
to see King Shurifon!

450
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,750
King Shurifon?

451
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,000
He's Princess Aura's father.

452
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,625
Shurifon's a big country
that's every bit

453
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,041
as powerful as Shtrayu...

454
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,583
With any luck, they'll
give us some supplies.

455
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,000
Although, by invading
the Holy Land,

456
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,625
Shtrayu issued a
challenge to everyone.

457
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,500
So I am not gonna
get my hopes up.

458
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,708
Which means we'll need
your Mechaworkers

459
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:56,500
to work like
nobody's business!

460
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,375
That's right.
You wanna help me with 'em?

461
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,958
Sure...! I'm in.
Whaddya want me to do?

462
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,416
Still pouting, are we?

463
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,000
If you want to
apologize to Kenshi,

464
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,666
why don't you just
do it already?

465
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,625
No... I um...

466
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,625
I really don't know.

467
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,625
Well, I'll see you later!

468
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,166
We swear, she
will never learn.

469
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,375
Another world?

470
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,625
This Kenshi Masaki I've been
hearing about is actually

471
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,250
from a different planet?

472
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,041
Was he summoned at birth?

473
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,291
It would appear rather
than being summoned...

474
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,416
his home world must have
found a way to send him to us.

475
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,000
Well...

476
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,375
Could it be so?

477
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:46,291
I believe that is more
likely than not, sir.

478
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,333
Let us leave this
matter to Lord Naua,

479
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,166
he will know what to do...

480
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,500
Amazing...

481
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,500
I never imagined the
one of light would be little

482
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,583
more than a child.

483
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,791
He's not a child at all!

484
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,041
He's a wild beast!

485
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,250
He is crude, rowdy
and insensitive! .

486
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,791
I won't even get into
what he did to me...

487
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,083
After all,
I'm still recovering

488
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,375
from that horrifying
experience...

489
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,000
However, he is a hard
worker, I guess...

490
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,666
And he has provided
significant help...

491
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,958
But still!

492
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:18,291
It is unusual to see you so
talkative, Lithia, my dear.

493
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,791
If I may, Kenshi is
unbelievably kind...

494
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,625
Everyone adores him, sir! .

495
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,916
In fact, Lady Lithia only
started feeling better

496
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,500
thanks to an herbal tea he
made especially for her.

497
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,041
It's the truth!

498
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,750
He is a good boy...

499
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:35,333
Reminds me of a Koro running
around and playing in the sun.

500
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,500
I understand.

501
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,625
This is the Shurifon Guard...

502
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,708
We are happy to guide
you to the dock.

503
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,833
Please follow us.

504
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,958
We would be delighted.

505
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,041
The Church did?

506
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,166
Yes... They have
requested all nations aid

507
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,250
in reclaiming the Holy Land.

508
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,791
Unfortunately, as you
can see, there is no need

509
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,041
for Your Excellency to
become involved.

510
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,833
And what will happen to
Shtrayu after they succeed?

511
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,000
To cover war expenses...

512
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,791
the various nations would
obtain joint control over it.

513
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,500
Oh...

514
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,333
Of course they would.

515
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:37,166
You will be permitted to speak
with the King tomorrow...

516
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,958
Because there was a time when
you saved the Princess...

517
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,791
We welcome you to stay in
Shurifon as our honored guests

518
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,458
for the time being.

519
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,833
Wonderful.

520
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,333
Shurifon would fall under
their joint control?

521
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,875
That's horrible!

522
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,875
Um, what's 'joint
control' mean?

523
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:58,125
To be blunt, it means
Shtrayu would cease to exist.

524
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,041
We do not care about
Shtrayu anyway!

525
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,916
There's no way
you're serious...!

526
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,500
Unless you're fine with our
country completely collapsing.

527
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,375
Luckily, Shtrayu is an
extremely rich country...

528
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,541
Yes, it may end up
under joint control...

529
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,166
but the Church would
still supervise it,

530
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,541
so no one would do
anything inappropriate...

531
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,541
And as far as the civilians
are concerned,

532
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,375
they would just be
getting a new ruler.

533
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:19,583
Sure you don't care, 'cause
you look like you might.

534
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,500
It does seem weird that
you'd be so willing

535
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,791
to give your crown away.

536
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:25,083
Idiots...! We have never
intended to rely solely

537
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,041
on our parents' assets! .

538
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,291
We are merely frustrated

539
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,666
we won't be able to thrash
Babalun ourselves!

540
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,750
Yeah, that makes
perfect sense.

541
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,500
Empress, I've always
wondered this...

542
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,833
Are you twelve...

543
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,125
or are you really,
like, way older...?

544
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,791
Because one of my sisters
looks young like you do...

545
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,500
But she's like super old.

546
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,625
Shut up, Kenshi...!

547
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,791
We are definitely
a blooming young teen!

548
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,708
Oh look,
she's blooming now.

549
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,416
So back to the point...

550
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,750
I don't think it will be easy
to convince King Shurifon

551
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,250
to help us out.

552
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,208
It might be easier if Aura
put in a good word for us.

553
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,541
Well, I seriously doubt
they'll let us see her

554
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,666
while we're here...

555
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,166
And since we're
under house arrest...

556
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,541
it isn't like we
can break out.

557
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,791
That's true. I mean,

558
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:09,916
the castle is probably
crawling with guards.

559
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,833
If only there were some way
we could let her know

560
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,083
we wanted to talk to her.

561
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,458
Wow!

562
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,833
This place is so cool!

563
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,500
Found 'em!

564
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,083
And so, there you have it.

565
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,041
Would you mind putting in a
good word with your father,

566
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,291
so he might offer
us assistance?

567
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,083
We would greatly
appreciate it.

568
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,208
Kenshi... Why did he not
just tell me the truth?

569
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:23,208
We explained everything
to you, Princess Aura...

570
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,666
Now it is up to you
to make a choice

571
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,333
on what you will
tell the King.

572
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:31,166
Was he trying to deceive
me this whole time?

573
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,208
Are you blind and
never told me...?

574
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,166
What have you personally
witnessed him do...?

575
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:41,041
Quit trying to convince yourself
he is someone he's not.

576
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,750
Do you even think him
capable of deceit?

577
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,083
Please...

578
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,833
Why don't you picture
that silly face of his

579
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,541
and actually
think about it.

580
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,500
I sense your
determination, Empress.

581
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,291
But I am apprehensive.

582
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,583
Are you saying Kenshi
isn't good enough for you?

583
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,666
I have received reports

584
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,875
on what happened
in the Holy Land...

585
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,708
However, unlike other lands...
...

586
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,958
no one in Shurifon would
entrust their life

587
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,583
to a talented
male Mechamaster.

588
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:33,333
He must be a
talented 'man' first.

589
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,958
Well, you haven't changed...!

590
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,250
But 'tis not all
that surprising.

591
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,958
In that case, Father, why not
judge Kenshi with your own eyes?

592
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,250
Oh?. Is that what
you think I should do?

593
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,625
Facts speak
louder than words.

594
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,875
As you wish.

595
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,708
Empress, are you sure having
Kenshi race is the best idea?

596
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,500
We are...! From what we gather,
this will be rather similar

597
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,416
to that long-distance race he
ran during the tournament...!

598
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,958
He easily defeated Aura,

599
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,833
so there should not
be any problems.

600
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,000
'Kay...

601
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,500
Plus...!

602
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,125
With Princess Aura's attendants
showing him the course,

603
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,250
he'll at least have an idea
of what he's getting into...

604
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:14,791
Each of the four forest
courses is unique unto itself.

605
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,041
The First Forest doesn't have
any traps or attackers...

606
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:20,666
The point is to race through
here as quickly as possible.

607
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,458
The Second Forest
has traps...

608
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,791
And you'll
be disqualified

609
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,416
if you take more than a
certain amount of damage.

610
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,083
On top of traps, the Third
Forest also harbors attackers,

611
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,125
and they are very
good at their job.

612
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:35,166
The Fourth Forest is basically
the same as the Third,

613
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,208
but the attackers
are more skilled,

614
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:40,916
and there's a lake that
covers most of the land.

615
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,291
I guess that'll
limit where I can go.

616
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:48,833
You know, just walking
through this course

617
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,458
is exhausting
enough on its own.

618
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:54,416
Yet he is still as full of
energy as when we started.

619
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,291
Oh, and Kenshi,
the Princess wants

620
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,666
you to attend
a trainer's lecture

621
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,375
on how to tackle the courses
to improve your time.

622
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,083
Sure... I'll go...

623
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,166
but I don't actually
have to win, right?

624
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,333
That's correct, but still...

625
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:10,041
If the King wants to see what
type of man I really am...

626
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,291
Shouldn't I just act
like I normally do?

627
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,541
Uh...

628
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:19,291
Where are you going?

629
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,333
All right!

630
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,958
What are you doing?

631
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,791
Check it out!

632
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,166
What? They want
to hold it tomorrow?

633
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,333
Correct. They said they
had a tight schedule to keep.

634
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,250
Oh, they're
underestimating us...

635
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,333
Perhaps assuming we
couldn't get ready.

636
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,833
Fine, let's do it!

637
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,708
Yes, sir!

638
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,000
We'll introduce them to
our traditional sport...

639
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,333
and see if he survives.

640
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,083
Where are you heading
to so late, Kenshi?

641
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,625
Hold on, why don't I
take a wild guess here...

642
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,666
You're on your way to find
crystals in the forest.

643
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,291
Fine, I'll
go back to my room.

644
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,916
Wait just a minute.

645
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,750
Actually...
I need to...

646
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,875
say, um...

647
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,625
Well, it's just I...

648
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,125
Your pendant?

649
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,083
It must've fallen out
when I jumped down.

650
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,291
Didn't one of your
sisters give it to you?

651
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,166
That's why you like
it so much, right?

652
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh... yeah...

653
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,458
Red cords are an
expression of love.

654
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,708
It's a symbol...

655
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:34,416
Two bodies that are
forever intertwined.

656
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,250
I mean, no!

657
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:40,625
I also really like this
cord, so leave me alone!

658
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:43,916
Then I promise I won't tell
you to swap it out ever again.

659
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,875
Thank you.

660
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,750
Isn't the moon
pretty tonight?

661
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,333
Yeah.

662
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,291
Do your best
tomorrow, okay?

663
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,833
Totally!

664
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,375
Obviously,
the King will win.

665
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,458
Yes, most certainly.

666
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,708
Now, now...

667
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:04,750
Hoyun's
pretty good, too!

668
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:09,208
We want to put all
of it on Kenshi!

669
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,625
I'm betting on the King!

670
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,875
And why am I not surprised?

671
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,666
I didn't expect this
many runners out today

672
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,250
since the race is
so last minute.

673
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,333
Not that it bothers
him in the least.

674
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,000
Of course not.

675
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,166
Is this like a Shurifon
holiday or something?

676
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,833
Hello.

677
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:30,000
You seem rather carefree...
Not worried at all?

678
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,666
You must be one
of those imbeciles.

679
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,416
The King of Shurifon just told
Kenshi he was an imbecile...

680
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,583
Normally one would refrain
from being so blunt,

681
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:42,666
but not Aura's father...

682
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,083
He didn't even ask.

683
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:48,125
He stated it like it was
a commonly known fact!

684
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:51,583
Well... I guess there's no point
in denying the truth, is there?

685
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,875
Okay...! It's time
to start the race!

686
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,208
So, how do you think
this is gonna turn out?

687
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,666
Well, knowing Kenshi...

688
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,333
I doubt we need to worry.

689
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:21,250
You are currently in
second place, Your Highness.

690
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,125
I am?
Second...

691
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:26,791
I wonder if that means
Hoyun is out in front...?

692
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,916
I'm proud of him.
He's getting pretty good!

693
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,083
Sir... Kenshi's the one
in first place.

694
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,291
What?!

695
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,916
He set a new record
for the First Forest.

696
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,416
I doubt he'll be able
to keep that pace.

697
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,333
I'm surprised there
aren't any signs of traps

698
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:46,166
having been set off.

699
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,500
What's going on...?

700
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,208
I don't feel that
boy's presence at all.

701
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,791
In fact, the forest doesn't even
feel as though it's on alert.

702
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,666
It's amazing.

703
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:07,375
Instead, it's almost
like the forest is happy.

704
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,958
It feels fresh...

705
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,333
Rather reminiscent
of spring in a way.

706
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,500
Fascinating...

707
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,458
Has Kenshi Masaki
passed through, yet?

708
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,833
Yes.

709
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,541
Is there any
indication of cheating?

710
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,791
No... not according
to the beacon's records,

711
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,416
Your Highness.

712
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:36,916
They might as well just tell
me where they're hiding.

713
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,333
They aren't quite ready to
be considered adults, yet.

714
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:46,833
There's the Third
Forest's checkpoint.

715
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,250
Good job, you two!

716
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,666
You're almost ready to move
on to the Fourth Forest.

717
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,791
Thank you,
Your Highness!

718
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,625
Have either one of you
seen that Kenshi boy?

719
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,875
Oh...
No, sir, not yet.

720
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,333
Interesting.

721
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,083
He's already passed by?

722
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,291
Yes, sir...
Not long ago, in fact.

723
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,708
I see.

724
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:14,875
I'm sure the Fourth Forest
won't be so easy for him!

725
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,458
What happened to you two?!

726
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,875
We were tied up like this
before we even knew what hit us.

727
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,125
A thousand apologies,
Your Highness.

728
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,166
Those men could have defeated
me if I let my guard down,

729
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,958
yet he took them out
like it was nothing.

730
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,875
I give up, sir.

731
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,916
You are much improved, son.

732
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,750
But he is still green
compared to the other men.

733
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,625
Kenshi Masaki...

734
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:51,375
Are you superior to me
in both stealth and combat?

735
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,083
Father!

736
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,041
Where is Kenshi Masaki?!

737
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,000
He...
isn't here yet.

738
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,833
How is that possible?

739
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:16,041
That idiot has done
it to me again!

740
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,375
Hey...
it's Kenshi!

741
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,875
We'll kill him!

742
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,541
Oh no, don't
tell me I lost.

743
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,208
You!

744
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:27,458
We are going to murder you until
we cannot murder you anymore!

745
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,791
Well, what do we have here?

746
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,458
Hey...!
Give that back!

747
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,166
You gotta be kidding me.

748
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,625
You better listen to us,

749
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,208
or we'll rearrange your
stupid face one eye at a time!

750
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,625
Oh. Of course he did.

751
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,791
Kenshi... did you get
those during the race?

752
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,041
I'm sorry... I...
I couldn't help myself.

753
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,875
It was instinct!

754
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,833
I knew it wasn't the
best idea to take detours,

755
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:55,083
but I left my stash in the
Holy Land, so, you know...

756
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,375
What are you? A Koro
stocking up for the winter?!

757
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,958
Oh...!
I almost forgot!

758
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:03,416
Don't you eat this
mushroom at celebrations?

759
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,416
Everyone I've met from
here seems really happy

760
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,791
when I find them,

761
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,125
and you've put up with
Empress Lashara's selfish--

762
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,458
I mean, you've helped
her out and stuff...

763
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,500
So, I figured I could
do something to repay you.

764
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,291
We should have bet on how
fast you could flap your lips.

765
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:15,916
I said I was sorry!

766
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,250
I've lost...!

767
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,333
Yes, I have lost to you,
Kenshi Maski!

768
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:30,250
The trees seem happy and
excited when you're around.

769
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:34,750
It's as though you are the
very spirit of the forest.

770
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:37,333
I have to say,
no one's more suitable

771
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,458
to be my daughter's
husband than you.

772
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,000
Her husband?!

773
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,000
Kenshi, my husband...?
It's so sudden...

774
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,291
Oh, Father...

775
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,333
This is all so
very unexpected.

776
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,458
We knew you'd be able
to do it, Princess Aura!

777
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,958
This is perfect!

778
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:55,375
We couldn't hope for a
better spouse for our Kenshi!

779
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:59,083
You have an incredible amount of
power for one so young, Kenshi.

780
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,625
I assume you must
have been trained

781
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,666
by a skilled instructor
from an early age.

782
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,458
That's the Koro alarm!

783
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:18,291
Who knew something like this
was hidden within the Church?

784
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:21,416
The tricky part now is that it
can only be used one time...

785
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Take down the castle!

786
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,500
What are we
supposed to do now?

787
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,166
We have nothing we can say
to make you stay with us.

788
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,833
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

789
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:15,916
"Home."

790
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,458
Kenshi... Kenshi...

791
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,250
Kenshi...
