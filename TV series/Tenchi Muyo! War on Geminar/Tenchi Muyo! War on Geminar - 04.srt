1
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,041
Yes, very good...
A little farther!

2
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,541
At this rate, we'll finish
by the end of the day.

3
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,833
I can't believe how much
we have accomplished.

4
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,708
"We've accomplished?"

5
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,083
Pardon me, but I think only
those who actually worked

6
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,541
should talk like that.

7
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,125
They insisted we leave
because we were in the way...

8
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,541
'Tis not our fault.

9
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
Yes, knowing when
to gracefully retire

10
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,000
is the most
important job of all.

11
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,833
With all due respect, laziness
is not something to brag about.

12
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,625
You are in no
position to criticize.

13
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,250
You were so invaluable they
gave you the earth-shaking task

14
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,833
of setting the table!

15
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,875
Apparently,
the 'ever-so-competent'

16
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,583
Student Council President is not
all she's cracked up to be.

17
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,958
I'd say it's hardly my fault
I have a gift for table décor.

18
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,083
All done!

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,958
A hot bath after
a hard day's work...

20
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,958
It doesn't get much
better than this.

21
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,666
Oh, come now...

22
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,625
You don't really believe
you did work today, do you?

23
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,375
We suppose we could
ask you the same thing.

24
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,916
There's nothing more relaxing
than a big bathtub, though.

25
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,291
All things considered,
I'm still amazed

26
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
at how quickly
we got done.

27
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,958
Well, personally...

28
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,458
this incident has taught me
to have a newfound respect

29
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,875
for how hard all the staff must
work to maintain the dorms...

30
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,500
It was an excellent
experience.

31
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,750
I'm happy I was finally able
to shed most of the useless data

32
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,750
off my Mechaworker.

33
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,125
Lithia! What is
the matter...?

34
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,125
You seem like you
are rather upset.

35
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,416
Dame Chiaia
and Dame Yukine.

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,083
It's rude
to isolate yourself.

37
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,291
Join us at once!

38
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,291
I find your lack of
modesty exasperating.

39
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,458
The wild beast that caused
such a catastrophe the other day

40
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,208
is right there!

41
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,166
How can you sit out in the open
with your whole body exposed?!

42
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,833
Please, he's harmless.
You need to relax.

43
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,416
Besides, he's been working
here for several days now

44
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
and is earning
a good reputation.

45
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,958
That's right...
Kenshi's a hard worker,

46
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,333
and his technique
is totally flawless!

47
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,250
I shouldn't have to
remind you that we're here

48
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,666
to have a meeting about the
completion of the repairs...

49
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,250
We do not need
someone to bathe us...

50
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,416
So do us
all a favor,

51
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,791
and tell that wild
animal to leave at once!

52
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,500
I agree...
Dressed the way we are,

53
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,833
even allowing him to
innocently wash our backs

54
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,875
could be a
risky proposition.

55
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,208
I guess you're
right about that...

56
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,541
Kenshi...

57
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,375
Sorry, but we don't need
help bathing anymore.

58
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,708
That's okay by me...

59
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,916
If it's cool,
I'll be going now.

60
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,166
Wait.

61
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,208
Considering this meeting
involves you directly,

62
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,416
it's probably a good idea
if you stick around...

63
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,583
Come on now, why don't
you take off those

64
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,416
constricting clothes
and strip down.

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,666
Uh... I can't,
this is the girl's bath.

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,375
Oh please, stop worrying
and get comfortable.

67
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,333
We give you our
permission, Kenshi.

68
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,541
The rest of us
don't mind either.

69
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,416
After working with him on
several projects, I admit...

70
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,375
I admire his skill.

71
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,291
I cannot believe the words
I'm hearing right now!

72
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,708
Now that I think of it,
we owe Kenshi big time

73
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,250
for those massages.?

74
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,583
Excellent point.

75
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,541
In that case, I would
like to officially retract

76
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,958
my previous objections.

77
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,291
Great...! So shall
we give it a go?!

78
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,958
Okay!

79
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,833
Since that's out of the way we
can get the meeting started...

80
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,208
Well.

81
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,666
We received word
from the Principal.

82
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,375
Starting first thing tomorrow,
school will resume.

83
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,791
And that's all.

84
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,083
Are you kidding me?

85
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,416
I put up with all this
just to hear that crap?!

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Next time, just tell me,

87
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,541
instead of stripping my clothes
off like a buncha lunatics!

88
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,125
Yes. To make it up,
you could take my clothes off.

89
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,250
Too bad for you I'm only
wearing this one layer.

90
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't win, can I?

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,916
Oh, this is
so relaxing.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,416
I'm glad
I thought of it.

93
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,416
Oh, shut up.

94
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,791
You've got scrapes and
bruises all over your hands.

95
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,041
What gives...?

96
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,375
How in the world did
that happen to you?

97
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,875
Oh... Well,

98
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,791
I got banged up when I was
cleaning all the rubble...

99
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,541
Don't worry
though, I'm okay.

100
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,958
Oh my...

101
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,625
You're hurt.

102
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,250
I'll be all right.

103
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,958
What exactly were you
looking at pervert?

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,166
So the SWAN is
covered with holes?

105
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,166
What about all the Koros
who live around here,

106
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,625
maybe they're the
ones responsible?

107
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,125
No, the holes are
far too big for that.

108
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,708
Are they occurring
with more frequency?

109
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,291
All we can say for sure is
that there were no indications

110
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,625
of any traps...

111
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,833
As far as we know, the
appearance of these holes

112
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,500
is nothing but
random coincidence,

113
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,541
though it's hard to imagine
why this would happen.

114
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,541
Oh, who knows?

115
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,375
Perhaps someone is
searching for something.

116
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,708
It might be best to consult
with the Holy Land's security.

117
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,666
Hey, wait just a second!

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,000
What's wrong,
you have an objection

119
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,125
to bringing this
matter to the authorities?

120
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,375
We don't need security
to trap one measly Koro.

121
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,833
And that would mean...?

122
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,541
You're quite the
cautious one, aren't you?

123
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,083
We need to be extra careful
so he doesn't spot us.

124
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,958
Otherwise we won't be able
to catch him in the act.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,291
That little-
The rat even used camouflage.

126
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,625
That moron!

127
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,250
I guess it was a
Koro, after all!

128
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,875
Awesome.

129
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,125
Someone's a big fan of
stones, aren't they?

130
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,916
It's not a stone;
it's a crystal.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,666
That isn't the point,
you imbecile...

132
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,916
Tell us right now, why you're
filling a SWAN with holes...?

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,291
If we hadn't intervened,

134
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,375
you could've compromised
its external strength!

135
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,708
No way...

136
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,541
I made sure that every
hole I made was blocked,

137
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,708
to keep the SWAN safe.

138
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,375
Just keep your mouth
shut, Captain Koro!

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,291
It's so pretty...

140
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,750
This is the first time
we've seen a raw gemstone...

141
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,625
Just be honest, there
must be some reason

142
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,833
you're so obsessed with them.

143
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,791
Why don't you tell us
what this is about.

144
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,791
Well, back when I
was a little kid...

145
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,250
My big sister had a
spaceship made out of crystal

146
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,083
and she used to take off in it
from my brother's house...

147
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,833
And I'd watch it lift
up out of the pond.

148
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,166
It was really cool.

149
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,541
I'll never forget
how the crystal sparkled

150
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,416
when the sun set.

151
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,000
You're right;

152
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
'tis a beautiful thing
at which to look.

153
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,750
Wait a second!

154
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,166
Did you just say your big
sister's spaceship...?

155
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,458
Let us get this straight:

156
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,250
You're saying you
actually have a sibling

157
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,625
who owns a craft
that can fly in space?

158
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,833
Yeah, that's right.

159
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,541
Empress Lashara,
what is it?

160
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,875
Kenshi... Tell us:

161
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,416
is it really normal
for other beings

162
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,916
where you come from to have
their own personal spaceships?

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,541
No, don't be ridiculous,
of course it's not normal...

164
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,666
Besides, our ships are
just over-sized rockets;

165
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,916
they're really not
that big of a deal.

166
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,125
Why in the world does my
family have a spaceship?

167
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,958
What... exactly
are you getting at?

168
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,333
According to
reports from those

169
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,083
who have
explored the galaxy...

170
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,875
Even the most sophisticated
civilizations,

171
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,333
with the most
advanced sciences

172
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,666
can barely send their
own to nearby moons,

173
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,791
much less travel
freely through space.

174
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,125
Ships like that...

175
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,708
simply do not exist.

176
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,250
Hold on, I still don't get it.

177
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,708
Are you saying Kenshi
must've come from the future?

178
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,875
Sometimes children's
memories can mix up dreams

179
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,416
with reality...

180
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Are you absolutely positive
this story you told us happened?

181
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,208
Yeah, I'm sure of it...

182
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,000
I even remember riding
inside of it a couple times.

183
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,958
And that never struck
you as curious or odd

184
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,583
until just a moment ago...?

185
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,083
What about everyone else;
how did they react to it?

186
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,541
Well, obviously I didn't
tell anybody about it...

187
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,750
My sis... She made me promise
her I'd always keep it a secret.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,125
That mad scientist...!
Damn, her!

189
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,083
Is that how she kept it
a secret from everyone,

190
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,791
by hypnotizing you?

191
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,250
That could also explain why
you succumbed so easily

192
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,416
to Mexiah's hypnosis.

193
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,083
At any rate,
it seems you come

194
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,666
from a very complex
family life, as well.

195
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,458
That's all
beside the point!

196
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,166
And let's not forget
about the crystal!

197
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,583
You even had the nerve
to make yourself a pendant!

198
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,000
I did not...! My sister
gave that to me as a gift.

199
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,791
It's part of her ship!

200
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,625
Oh no.

201
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,750
Uh...
My fault...

202
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,000
I did not mean
for that to happen.

203
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,375
Hey... Come on,
it's not worth crying over.

204
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,458
Don't worry about it.

205
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,083
I promise I'll fix it.

206
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,583
Are you sure...?

207
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,791
You're pretty much the clumsiest
person that I've ever met.

208
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,041
Relax, I'll find someone

209
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,833
who's able to take
care of the repairs.

210
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,916
Oh, would you
quit crying already,

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,875
If the story he just
told us is true...

212
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,750
Then perhaps he wasn't
summoned here after all?

213
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,750
Could he actually
be from the future?

214
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,000
Unfortunately,

215
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,083
I am afraid there's nothing
I can do for you at this point.

216
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,666
In order to fix this, you
will need to send it home

217
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,041
and enlist the aid of one
of Empress Lashara's jewelers.

218
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,583
Well, that's too bad.

219
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,625
If the matter
is pressing...

220
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,000
You could talk to a jeweler
in the Holy Land...

221
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,041
I suppose it's possible they
would be able to assist you.

222
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,708
So how does it look?

223
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry, but this
is beyond me...

224
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,958
There was a guy who specialized
in this kind of stuff,

225
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,875
but he retired
last year.

226
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,333
Well, that's too bad.

227
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,375
Sorry I couldn't
help you, miss.

228
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,333
What should I do?

229
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,666
It's hard to say...

230
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,833
You're only shred of hope
would be to ask a jeweler

231
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,291
who serves a
Sacred Mechamaster.

232
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,000
Where am I supposed
to find a jeweler

233
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,000
who serves a
Sacred Mechamaster...?

234
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,500
I might as well
just give up now.

235
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,083
Chiaia...!
Hello, there!

236
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,125
Is everything all right?

237
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,291
You seem frustrated today.

238
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,875
Of course!

239
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,333
Well...
How does it look?

240
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,291
I've never seen workmanship this
intricate in my whole life...

241
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,333
At this point, I'm not even
certain what it's made out of.

242
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,458
Unfortunately, fixing it
is going to take some time.

243
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,500
I can't exactly say I'm
surprised, I've often heard

244
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,208
the highlands use different
techniques than we do...

245
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,125
But whatever the case,
I'll give it my best shot.

246
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,833
This is indeed one
incredibly unique crystal.

247
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,000
Dame Chiaia...

248
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,750
The only sensible
solution is for someone

249
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,333
from Kenshi's
homeland to fix it.

250
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,916
Yeah... That might be
my only option.

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,541
If you need
something in a hurry,

252
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,750
maybe replacing
it's a better option.

253
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,500
Why don't you fashion
him a braided cord?

254
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,833
Like from Havoniwa?

255
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,250
Yes, why not?

256
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,000
The cords from our country
hold different meaning

257
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,541
depending on their style,
color, and design...

258
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,916
The most common
way they're used,

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,541
though, is a charm to
tell someone how you feel.

260
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,458
I can't think of a better
way to convey your remorse

261
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,166
over breaking his chain.

262
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,625
Yeah but I
wouldn't even know

263
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,875
how to begin making
something like that...

264
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,083
and besides...

265
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,625
I'm too clumsy.

266
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,583
No reason to fret over not
knowing how, we'll teach you...

267
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,541
Isn't that right, Yukine?

268
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,750
Yes.

269
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,500
I can't.

270
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:56,250
All right, fine...!
I'll do everything I can!

271
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,291
Uh...

272
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,791
Mr. lyte?

273
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,875
Is something wrong?

274
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,666
Regarding the 'packages'
you inquired about?

275
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,083
They have
all arrived, sir.

276
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,666
I'm much more concerned

277
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,500
with the status
of the other arrangements.

278
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,333
Right... I will
handle it, sir.

279
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,333
Kenshi!

280
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,791
Somebody's in a
good mood today!

281
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,041
Good luck
with all your work!

282
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,041
Thanks!

283
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,041
See you later!

284
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,958
Oh, what an eyesore.

285
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,666
He went to bed
like a good boy.

286
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,166
Oh wow,
that was perfect,

287
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,208
who knew there was
another entrance nearby?

288
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,916
It doesn't get any luckier
than that, does it?!

289
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,750
Who are you?

290
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Whoa, you're a woman.

291
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,291
Hey, wait...!
That lady was just a decoy.

292
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,250
I gotcha.

293
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,958
There are ruffians out
in the street tonight.

294
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,041
I know... I'm chasing someone;
did they just run by here?

295
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,250
Yes... They went that way.

296
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,000
Thank you very much.

297
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,416
Wait, what're you doing?!

298
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,541
He's an animal,
that one.

299
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,708
Well, did you get it?

300
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,500
Yes, here it is, sir.

301
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,166
Good.

302
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,333
Found her!

303
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,583
Man... It's
just the decoy...

304
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
But there's no point
goin' back now!

305
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,208
In that case!

306
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,541
Tell me... Are you
from another world?

307
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,000
Why do you ask that?

308
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,375
I'm not... uh...

309
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm from the highlands,
why are you-

310
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,791
Come back!

311
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,625
He's chasing me...

312
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,208
I can't believe it!

313
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,375
She vanished...

314
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,375
What gives?

315
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,833
Well, well...

316
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,958
What are you doing
out at this hour?

317
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,083
I could ask you
the same thing.

318
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,000
I received word a burglar was
out and look who I find...

319
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,625
So then are you the culprit?

320
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,083
No way...!

321
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,833
I was chasing
the burglar and then-

322
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,541
Oh, just calm down...

323
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,958
I was taking a bath...

324
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,708
This is the girl's
dorm, you know.

325
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,375
Yeah, well, guys happen
to work here, too.

326
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,250
It was an emergency; there
was no time for clothes!

327
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,708
Come on, the robber might
be hiding somewhere nearby.

328
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,958
Kenshi,
don't be so shy...

329
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,958
Why don't we take a
bath together later?

330
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,916
Dagmyer really
retrieved that?

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,541
Yes... He seemed acutely
proud of himself.

332
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,375
Naua's pupil,
hunh...?

333
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,166
Certainly seems like
the work of a highlander,

334
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,583
wouldn't you agree...?

335
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,750
If they were practical, they
could be extremely useful

336
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,041
when we seize castles
outside of the draft.

337
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,750
Unfortunately, though,
they're not practical.

338
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:45,625
I'm amazed he created such a
stir over something like this.

339
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,041
He is your heir after all,

340
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,541
and if you take
that into consideration,

341
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,750
it makes sense he might
want to use it one day.

342
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,125
Even if he will need it,

343
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,541
there are other ways
to go about these things...

344
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,291
Make sure he fully
understands that.

345
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,583
He's still very
young, my Lord...

346
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,166
But as a male
Sacred Mechamaster,

347
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,958
he's extremely talented.

348
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,333
Ridiculous child...

349
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,083
He wants to succeed my
lordship more than anything.

350
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,583
But he cares nothing for
cultivating his talents.

351
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,250
That's very true...

352
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,166
Especially since Lashara is just
about ready to give up on us...

353
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,208
Ah well, such is the way
of our world, I'm afraid.

354
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,000
That's very disconcerting.

355
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,208
Are you positive
nothing was stolen?

356
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,166
Yep... They definitely rummaged
through my research data,

357
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,375
but everything is accounted for,
so it doesn't look like it...

358
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,541
Luckily, none of it was highly
classified information,

359
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,708
so we are
in good shape.

360
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,250
Wonderful.

361
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,708
Given the circumstances
I think it's definitely best

362
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,541
we handle the investigation
for breaking and entering...

363
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,833
Any issues with that?

364
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,750
That will be fine.

365
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,083
Sorry... I'm totally
running late.

366
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,708
Oh, that's perfectly fine.

367
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,458
I admit, I'm curious as to why
Lashara isn't more concerned

368
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,125
about potential threats.

369
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,333
Well, obviously,
it was a huge mistake

370
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,000
to leave it so vulnerable in
the academy's locked barrier.

371
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,625
To tell ya the truth,
I had no idea

372
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,000
someone would be interested
in something like that.

373
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,708
I'd be very interested
in something like that.

374
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,666
But Princess Maria, nothing of
any consequence was stolen,

375
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,416
so really, there's no
reason to be concerned...

376
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,416
Don't worry.

377
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,833
Tell me then...

378
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,125
Could you make the Mechaworker
fit for practical use?

379
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,833
Thanks to Empress Lashara,
I got some in-combat data...

380
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,541
I- I think I can
drastically increase

381
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,958
its operational efficiency...

382
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,541
But if you wanted
it to fight

383
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,666
wired Sacred Mechanoids
outside the Draft...

384
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,000
You're gonna run into
issues with its power,

385
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,791
as well as duration
of operability.

386
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,333
We are currently seeking
out a Sacred Mechamaster

387
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,666
who has the skill to create
quality-compressed bullets.

388
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,541
One of this year's new
students would be preferable.

389
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,958
That's a good idea,

390
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,083
since they get tails once
they become upperclassmen...

391
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,000
You know, like Chiaia
and Aura both did.

392
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,750
Don't forget...
You did too.

393
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,250
To be honest, I'd prefer
if you'd leave me out of this.

394
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,833
The maneuverability
would suffer,

395
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,791
but I'm thinking about
making a Mechaworker

396
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,291
that co-functions
as a charger.

397
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh boy...

398
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,833
Those two Sacred Mechanoids
were like beyond incredible...!

399
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,250
I wish I had
some like that.

400
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,250
You are referring
to the Sacred Mechanoids

401
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,208
that attacked
Empress Lashara?

402
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,625
Right.

403
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,583
Honestly, I have doubts about
what they really were...

404
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,750
I'm not convinced they
were Sacred Mechanoids.

405
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,541
Well, of course they were!

406
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,500
What kind of Sacred Mechamaster
could've done that to you...?

407
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,541
I, for one, have never
seen anything like it.

408
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,291
I bet she's a monster,

409
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,458
twice the size of a normal woman
and twice as strong, too.

410
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,083
She may very well be.

411
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,916
I wonder why someone would want
to break into the vault.

412
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,791
It's impossible
for us to say.

413
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,166
These things just
happen sometimes.

414
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,583
While we're
on the subject...

415
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,291
Wanna tell me what you were
doing by the girl's dorm

416
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,875
last night?

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,875
Walking.

418
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,583
By the way, Chiaia what's
going on with my pendant...?

419
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,750
Did you fix it yet?

420
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,916
Hey, I'm doing
the best I can...

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,791
Why don't you
just take it easy?!

422
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,750
I told you I would
fix it, you jerk!

423
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,166
Hi, Kenshi!

424
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,666
You seem to be
feeling better

425
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,000
since you started taking
Kenshi's medicine.

426
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,333
To tell you the truth,
I still can't believe it

427
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,666
He truly is a mysterious boy.

428
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,125
Little by little...

429
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,208
A ring of supporters has
started to form around him.

430
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,333
But if we are to stand on
equal terms with him,

431
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,500
that won't be enough.

432
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,666
You are correct...

433
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,000
In that case,
maybe it's time

434
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,666
I put him somewhere
out in the open,

435
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,333
where he'll
stand out even more.

436
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,083
Oh, my God look at that.

437
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,708
Keep up the
good work, Kenshi!

438
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, you're doing great!

439
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,500
Thanks!

440
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,416
Thank you for
coming, Empress.

441
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,208
I have some questions for you,
regarding Master Masaki.

442
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,500
Wait, this
is about Kenshi?

443
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,791
That's correct...

444
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,833
I heard a rumor that
has me quite concerned.

445
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,833
Supposedly, the boy
has not completed

446
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,250
his compulsory
education.

447
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,041
Although
I am very aware

448
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,583
the highlands have
completely different

449
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,875
educational standards...

450
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,541
Since he resides
in the Holy Land,

451
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,541
I cannot allow
this to slide.

452
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,208
Of course not...

453
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,875
We've given this exact issue
some serious thought ourselves.

454
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,583
I see...

455
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,208
One more thing...

456
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,958
I understand that in order for
him to take care of himself,

457
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,916
you're to pay him for
the work he's doing...

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,375
Perhaps then,
you can explain to me

459
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:30,625
why he has yet to receive any of
the funds paid to him thus far?

460
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,041
He told us...

461
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,666
"Don't worry, I'm fine,
they've been feeding me

462
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,708
and for everything else I can
fend for myself in the forest."

463
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,708
You can imagine my surprise when
he laughed the whole thing off,

464
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,833
without a hint
of resentment.

465
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,000
We can picture it now.

466
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,458
So... All joking aside,
for the record,

467
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,833
do you care
to explain to me

468
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,791
why your attendant is forced
to pay for his own food?

469
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,000
The thing about that is...

470
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,000
We know... He's
saving for tuition.

471
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,791
Because after all,
he can't go to school

472
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,125
while he's
in the Holy Land.

473
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,833
I see...
In that case,

474
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,375
why doesn't
he just enroll here?

475
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,583
What...?!

476
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,125
Wait, but this is -

477
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,041
True... Aside from Sacred
Mechamaster candidates,

478
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,541
only royalty and
nobility may enroll...

479
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,000
But we do make exceptions
if the Church approves.

480
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,041
All of the instructors
who have seen him work

481
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,125
at the dorms have offered
recommendations.

482
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,958
I doubt there would be
any objection

483
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,625
should he try to enroll.

484
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,166
Perhaps, but-

485
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,916
And as for the tuition...
we'll allow him to pay for it

486
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,416
after he graduates.

487
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,041
Although...

488
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,041
Considering the amount
of work he's willing to do,

489
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,166
he could enroll and work
off his tuition in the dorms

490
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,208
within one year.

491
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,250
But, he's not smart enough
to go to this school.

492
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,250
Actually, we just gave him a
test to gauge his abilities...

493
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,125
The results indicate he'll
perform well above average.

494
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,583
When did you do that?

495
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,750
His knowledge of history
leaves something to be desired,

496
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,375
and he lacks basic
reasoning skills...

497
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,958
Of course that is to be expected
being from the highlands...

498
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,041
Well then...

499
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,916
Do you give permission?

500
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,041
Yes, very well.

501
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:06,958
Yeah but.

502
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,500
Do you think it's
smart to throw him

503
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,875
into the academy
like this?

504
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,458
We don't know,
but all the instructors

505
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,833
gave him glowing
recommendations.

506
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,750
It's the source of the
rumors I'm worried about.

507
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:21,416
Yes, and we can already guess
what many of the rumors will be.

508
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,625
As long as no one discovers
he's a Sacred Mechamaster,

509
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,208
everything
should be fine.

510
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,583
All you ever do is cause
the rest of us problems,

511
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,750
do you realize that?

512
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,208
Yeah, but I just-

513
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,166
At the academy, there'll
be even more opportunities

514
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,000
to talk to individuals
from other countries...

515
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,750
So you'll have to be
extra careful, got it?

516
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,791
Got it!

517
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,291
Perfect.

518
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,666
I can't help but think the
timing of this whole ordeal

519
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,791
is a bit suspicious.

520
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,750
Now I simply have to
hope that nothing happens

521
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,833
until everyone
accepts Kenshi as mine.

522
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,416
...Would you please relax?!

523
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,625
We forgot to ask you,
what class are you in?

524
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,250
Let's see...

525
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,625
I'm in beginner's class two.

526
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,166
That's Maria's class...!

527
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,125
No, there must
be some mistake!

528
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,458
Look... Your little
'thing' for Yukine...

529
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,916
it doesn't mean you get to
let Maria win you over, okay?

530
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,708
You're forbidden
to talk to her...

531
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,291
Only ignore her

532
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,333
If she does attempt to engage
you in conversation,

533
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,500
just walk away.

534
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,041
We did not say
you could go...!

535
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,625
We are not done
speaking with you!

536
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,500
Come back here!

537
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,083
There he is!
That's him, right?

538
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:34,208
Huh... Wasn't expecting
him to look so normal.

539
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,250
Wanna know what I heard from
some of the upperclassmen?

540
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,583
You've gotta be kidding!
That's crazy!

541
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,250
I just don't think enrolling
him is a good idea...

542
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,083
Have you considered
this moron might do something

543
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,541
really stupid and damage
your reputation?

544
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,625
Come now, you can't actually
think we're concerned

545
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,250
with such trifles as that?

546
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,500
Fine...
Your call.

547
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,041
Pardon me, Empress.

548
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,666
Kenshi, I hope
it's all right,

549
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,666
but I've been ordered to give
you a tour of the school...

550
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,750
Remember me?
I'm Lapis.

551
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:02,333
A tour...?
Why yes, of course.

552
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,500
Wait...
Aren't you-?

553
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,208
Well then,
let's get going...

554
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,625
You ready?

555
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,625
Are we seeing things,
or does he know her?

556
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,833
It sure seems
that way to me.

557
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,625
Come on, Chiaia!
We're going to follow them!

558
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,166
What...?
Like right now?

559
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,541
Yes, we can't let him
run free, after all.

560
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,458
I think it's sweet
you remember me.

561
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,750
Thank you for that.

562
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,875
Yeah. Have you
had any more...

563
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,875
you know, problems...
with um... uh-

564
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,291
Oh... that happens
all the time here.

565
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,208
But no need to worry,
I'm okay now.

566
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,750
Well, they seem pretty
close, don't they?

567
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:48,000
Yes... He is surprisingly
quick with the ladies.

568
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,291
So, see that building
right up ahead?

569
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,083
That's for
the upperclassmen.

570
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,083
But the courtyard
just across the way?

571
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,875
The underclassmen
get to use that area.

572
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,750
Aw, cool!

573
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:04,333
Hey! Aren't you
two underclassman?!

574
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,166
You don't have any
business being here.

575
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,791
This area's off limits.

576
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,750
Uh... Yes,
I know that...

577
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,375
Sorry, I was assigned to give
our new student a tour.

578
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,750
Oh...! Kenshi,
it's you!

579
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,083
Good morning.

580
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,541
Oh... If we'd known you
were friends with Kenshi,

581
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,125
then we wouldn't
have bothered you.

582
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,333
Welcome! I'm really excited
to see the rumors

583
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,208
about you coming
to school here are true.

584
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,708
I'm looking
forward to it.

585
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,458
Hi!

586
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,208
Keep up
the good work!

587
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,041
Excellent sneaking,
no one saw us creep in.

588
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,333
Wait a second, isn't that
Empress Lashara up there?

589
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,458
Yeah but this is where
you're supposed to pretend

590
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:44,250
you don't see anything.

591
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,833
The upperclassmen
were so nice.

592
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,208
I'm surprised
they were friendly.

593
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,208
I was expecting them
to be upset with us.

594
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,291
And why is that?

595
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,375
Well, for one thing,
the upperclassmen

596
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,458
have all been knighted
as Sacred Mechamasters...

597
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,250
That puts them in a
different social standing

598
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,958
than the underclassmen.

599
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,541
Although, I guess that
doesn't really apply

600
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,750
to male underclassmen,

601
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,500
since they're already
Sacred Mechamasters.

602
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh.

603
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,791
That goes for
you too, Kenshi.

604
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,041
For me...?

605
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,666
Yeah, but I'm not
a Sacred Mechamaster.

606
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,250
Well, then you're absolutely
the exception to the rule...

607
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,291
The attitude of the
upperclassmen says it all:

608
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,833
You're very special.

609
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,666
Uh, you sure...?

610
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,791
Chiaia doesn't think that, she
says I'm no better than a Koro.

611
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,333
A Koro?

612
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,125
Well, she may be
kinda right...

613
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,833
You're as cute as a Koro.
I can see that much.

614
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:36,416
Going by this, there
shouldn't be any problems.

615
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,833
No way, this is where
all the problems begin.

616
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,541
Are you sure?
Classes are gonna start soon.

617
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,291
We are not going!

618
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,500
Shame on you,
Empress.

619
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,250
Miss! We can explain!

620
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,541
I heard there was a
suspicious duo lurking about

621
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:49,833
and look who I found.

622
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,791
As his master, we were
simply making sure

623
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,125
he did not do
anything weird.

624
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,166
Yes and as your teacher
I'm simply making sure

625
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,333
you don't do anything
weird, understand?

626
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,666
What are you doing?!
Let us go!

627
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,958
Let us go right now!

628
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,833
You'll pay for
doing this to us!

629
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,416
Hey, did you hear?
All the scary upperclassmen?

630
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,708
They're nice to him;

631
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,500
they treat him like
he's royalty or something.

632
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,958
A couple of
the upperclassmen

633
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,875
I know have been excited about
him coming here for days.

634
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,250
Quiet down,
everyone...!

635
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,583
We have a
brand new student

636
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,333
who'll be joining
our class today...

637
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,875
His name
is Kenshi Masaki.

638
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,208
Hi, everybody...

639
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,083
I'm glad to be here.

640
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,333
Now... I hate to disappoint you,
but the test is still on.

641
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,458
Those who need
to prepare...

642
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,416
Go ahead
and move out.

643
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,750
And Kenshi...

644
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,333
You can just stay put,
you'll be studying in here

645
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,166
with all the other boys.

646
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
Right.

647
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,208
Now then.

648
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,958
Hold on.

649
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,250
Listen up...!

650
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,583
After your teacher
announces you to the class,

651
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,250
give male
students, royalty,

652
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,875
and high nobility
a personal introduction.

653
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,083
It's a pleasure to study
with you, Princess.

654
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,083
Oh... The pleasure's
all mine, Kenshi...

655
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,541
I look forward
to this year.

656
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,791
Unfortunately, it's past time
I headed out to prepare...

657
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,333
Let's meet up
again very soon.

658
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,166
I'm Kenshi Masaki...

659
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,916
It is a pleasure
to meet you guys.

660
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,916
So... You're Empress
Lashara's attendant...

661
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,875
Lucky for you.

662
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,666
Let's see, where
was my desk again?

663
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,791
Are we getting a break?

664
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,333
Kenshi!

665
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,958
He's one...
big... jerk!

666
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,458
My name's Ceres Taito.
How're you?

667
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,583
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Noble Lord.

668
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,833
Hey, knock it off...

669
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,333
Boys here don't
address each other

670
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,833
with fancy
titles like that,

671
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,416
and you don't have
to either, so relax.

672
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,083
Oh yeah. Try not to let those
jerks get to you, okay...?

673
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,166
That's just how they
are, they all suck.

674
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,291
So where is everybody
headed off to...?

675
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,166
The teacher
mentioned a test?

676
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,583
This academy has special
classes for wife training,

677
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,583
such as tea ceremonies,
flower arranging,

678
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,333
and various
types of dancing.

679
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,791
Aw, man...

680
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,083
I got bad news; I'm not
equipped for that type of thing.

681
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,208
No, no, all we have
to do is watch.

682
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,833
What do you mean?

683
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,041
I mean, we get
to sit back and judge...

684
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,958
Having taste in the
arts is part of our job

685
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,916
as Male Sacred Mechamasters.

686
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,583
Riiight.

687
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,333
Aw, man...
This is crazy!

688
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:57,208
You're pretty much the
clumsiest person I've ever met.

689
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:00,958
Ah, forget about him,
I can do this!

690
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:04,666
What are you working
on so fervently?

691
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,708
Oh, hello, Dagmyer.

692
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,083
Well...
That is unusual.

693
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,500
Quite a project.

694
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,583
Uh... No, there's
a reason I'm doing this!

695
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,583
It's Kenshi's, I had to!

696
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,916
Kenshi...?

697
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,916
You'd go to such trouble
for a mere attendant?

698
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,916
Oh... Well...

699
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,041
It's just this is
a special thing.

700
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,416
Umm...

701
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,208
I don't mean that Kenshi
is special or anything, but-

702
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,750
Dagmyer.

703
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,250
Sorry, but... he would like
to borrow you for a minute.

704
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,708
I see...

705
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,208
Well, goodbye for now.

706
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:33,625
Okay.

707
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,291
Since this is your
first time, Kenshi...

708
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,166
don't fret over
what score you give.

709
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,708
Okay.

710
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,000
Yes, I agree.

711
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,083
He's working out
better than expected.

712
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,000
Tell me, what do you think
of this new crop of students?

713
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,333
They're about the same as
they are every other year...

714
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,458
Well, except for
Kenshi Masaki, that is.

715
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,208
Honestly, I was
quite surprised...

716
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,375
The kid may be brand new, but
his marks are as good as ours.

717
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,125
That's quite impressive
for his first day.

718
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,750
Indeed...

719
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,583
His numbers are, by far, the
most accurate we have ever seen.

720
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,916
But still...
I don't think

721
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,166
it's wise to ignore
the possibility

722
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,083
this is nothing but
a simple anomaly...

723
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,750
He did just arrive here,
so time will be the judge.

724
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,458
Take as much time
as you'd like.

725
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:27,333
In my humble opinion,
he's our top male student.

726
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:28,583
Trust me Principal,

727
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,500
you can look forward
to great things from him.

728
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,875
Now Kenshi...

729
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,166
Since this is your
first day with us...

730
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,333
I'd like to get a sense
of your skill level.

731
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,916
Sure thing,
Ms. exiah.

732
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,708
Oh... How
very intriguing.

733
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,125
Is something going
on over here? ...

734
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,083
Is that... .?

735
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,416
L ooks like he's managed
to snake his way in here.

736
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
He truly is
a wild creature.

737
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,333
It's just what I thought.

738
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,166
I'm ready whenever you are.

739
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,041
All you have to do is block
my attacks, understand?

740
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,666
Amazing.

741
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,166
I thought as much.

742
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,125
So annoying.

743
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,208
Have you studied
swordsmanship under someone?

744
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,458
My grandpa.

745
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,583
Is he a skilled
martial arts master?

746
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:24,916
No way...

747
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,500
He's just an old man who
lives in the country.

748
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,083
Very well then.

749
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,541
I want you to observe
the rest of the class.

750
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,791
Okay.

751
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,250
Excuse me?

752
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,375
Since our class is still
at the beginner's level...

753
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,291
Could he start
studying with us?

754
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,416
Oh, don't you worry.

755
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,458
I'll give him a private
lesson later on.

756
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,666
Oh my!

757
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,208
I'm surprised a low
class guy like him

758
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,000
knows anything
at all about fighting.

759
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,875
This one thinks he's
something special.

760
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,666
I think it's time we give
him a lesson in humility.

761
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,708
Ceres,
come over here!

762
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,541
Pardon me,
Ms. exiah.

763
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm curious to know

764
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,375
why you're not letting
Kenshi participate in class.

765
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,375
Because...

766
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,375
He uses a rather
unusual style...

767
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,333
It's clear he's
a master at it.

768
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:17,833
A master, but how?

769
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,416
Oh, I have no idea...

770
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,750
But if I actually
fought him, I'd lose.

771
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,791
Is he really that skilled?

772
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,958
The gap of ability between him
and the others is immense...

773
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,291
It wouldn't be safe to let
him spar with any of them.

774
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,166
I understand...

775
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,458
You're doing the right thing
for the safety of the children.

776
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,958
Right.

777
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,166
Miss, come quick!

778
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,291
Since Miss Mexiah gave
up on instructing you.

779
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,541
We've decided,
as your classmates,

780
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,041
to do the right thing

781
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,666
and teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

782
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,583
Although...
I should probably warn you,

783
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,833
our teaching style's
a bit aggressive.

784
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:58,375
Oh, is that right...?

785
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,083
Lemme see.

786
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,750
Well, you're pretty good at
running away, aren't you...?

787
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,750
Hey!

788
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,625
You really think you can
dodge all our strikes?

789
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,541
Kenshi, no!

790
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,833
Don't interfere yet!

791
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,791
Let's see
how he handles this.

792
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,625
Don't get in my way!

793
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,166
Sorry about that...

794
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,333
but I've had it.

795
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,458
I can't go on!

796
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,458
Yeah... me neither.

797
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,250
You guys
are so pathetic!

798
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,375
I don't know about you,
but I feel pretty warmed up.

799
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,958
Whaddaya wanna do next?

800
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,416
I suppose it's about time
I put a stop to this.

801
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,666
Kenshi Masaki...

802
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,375
Who do you think
he really is?

803
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,000
According to reports, a bandit
was behind the recent attack

804
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,250
against Empress Lashara.

805
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,875
The white
Sacred Mechanoid...

806
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,666
He's the pilot.

807
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,375
An interesting theory...

808
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,125
I'll admit that would
certainly make the most sense.

809
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,208
But how could there be
a male Sacred Mechamaster

810
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,666
who we've never even heard
of or seen before...?

811
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,333
The only other possible
explanation

812
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,166
doesn't fit time-wise.

813
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,583
You've taken a liking
to him, haven't you?

814
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,291
I have.

815
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,916
Should we steal him then?

816
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,208
Yes.

817
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,000
He is too special to waste
on Empress Lashara,

818
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,791
don't you agree?

819
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,875
Yukine,
come over here.

820
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,083
Hey... what do you think they're
gonna have on today's menu?

821
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,583
Let's just hurry!
They hate it...

822
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,708
Lunchtime.

823
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,166
Oh no!

824
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,958
Hey...!
Kenshi, wait up!

825
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,208
That guy...

826
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,666
I just don't get how
he's so full of energy.

827
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,333
Be quiet... I'm trying
to rest my brain here.

828
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,166
Sorry!!...!
I'm late.

829
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,333
Relax, Kenshi, didn't you
start school today...?

830
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,291
Don't worry; you don't have
to help with lunch anymore.

831
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,541
Huh...?

832
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,333
I guess I came
outta habit...

833
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,416
But I'll help out
since I'm here.

834
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,125
Hey, you're alright...

835
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,833
Thanks a lot, kid.

836
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:53,083
Next we're cooking for
the underclassmen...

837
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,583
Hey kid, quit working

838
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,291
and get back to your
school day right away!

839
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,083
Yeah, okay!

840
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,875
Let me help ya.

841
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,375
Oh, no...
It's okay,

842
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,666
you really don't
have to do that.

843
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,916
But I always
do stuff like this.

844
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,291
Hey, Yukine.

845
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:18,375
Are you taking lunch
to Princess Maria?

846
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,666
I am...

847
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,208
I'm bringing it
to the classroom.

848
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,875
That's where she said
she wanted to eat today.

849
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,250
Then how 'bout
we go together?

850
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,500
Sure.

851
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,750
Look at them...

852
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,166
I bet they've got
something going on.

853
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,541
Have you heard any good
gossip about it, Lapis?

854
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,000
Not really...

855
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,291
Kenshi is Empress
Lashara's assistant.

856
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,500
It makes sense he and Yukine
would get to know each other.

857
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,541
Hey Ceres, can I eat
lunch with you today?

858
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,166
Oh... Yes,
of course...

859
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,916
Please. Kenshi.

860
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,250
You care to join
us for lunch?

861
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,791
I'd love to.

862
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,958
But sorry...
I asked Ceres.

863
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:02,458
Perfect... Then Ceres
will dine as well.

864
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,541
No...
I-I couldn't...

865
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,833
I...
I'm just a-

866
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,375
Of course, I see...

867
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:11,750
Well, since
everybody is here,

868
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,291
why don't we all
dine together today?

869
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,125
After we graduate,

870
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,583
we'll each have our own
unique stations in life.

871
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,291
But right now, we all study
in the same classroom...

872
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,875
So while we're
in the Holy Land,

873
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,708
let's ignore the social barriers
that will ultimately oppress us.

874
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,375
Yeah...
You are so right.

875
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,833
Yeah.

876
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,000
So, tell me, how was
your first day at school?

877
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,958
Oh, I had a really
awesome time.

878
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,416
Kenshi!

879
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:48,875
I'm sorry...

880
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,208
Really.

881
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,375
About what?

882
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,708
Earlier today...

883
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,291
I was so scared of them...

884
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,541
I froze up.

885
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,125
I'm sorry.

886
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,083
I'm just glad you were around
to explain everything to me.

887
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,666
Kenshi!

888
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,250
A little bird told us
you got rather friendly

889
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,791
with Maria at lunch today.

890
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08,125
Huh...?
Wait, whaddaya mean?

891
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,833
You're our attendant and
nothing will change that...!

892
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,958
Do we make ourselves
perfectly clear...?

893
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,791
Stupid!

894
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,958
I'll see you
guys tomorrow!

895
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,125
Here... For you.

896
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,458
Whoa!

897
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,291
You won't be able to
repair the chain properly

898
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,875
until you return
to your homeland...

899
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:34,666
In the meantime,
you can use that.

900
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,000
It's a very
pretty cord...

901
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,916
Thanks...!
I love it!

902
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,541
I'm impressed you
were able to fix it.

903
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,166
Yeah, you and me both.

904
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,416
Lookie!

905
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,250
Ah...
A red cord...

906
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,250
I see.

907
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,291
Is red bad?

908
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,583
No...

909
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,333
It's a supposed tradition
from another world...

910
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:53,583
Between partners, red cords
are an expression of love,

911
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,875
a symbol of two bodies
forever intertwined.

912
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,458
Oh my...

913
00:42:58,541 --> 00:42:59,708
Love is in the air.

914
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:02,041
Kenshi, give that
back right now!

915
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,041
How come?

916
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,416
Don't argue with
me about this,

917
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,125
I'll just give you
a different one...

918
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,500
Just give it back!

919
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,958
Yeah but, I really
like this one!

920
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,833
Too bad! Hand over the cord,
you little freak!

921
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,083
Come on, can't I keep it?

922
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,875
Red is my favorite color!

923
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,416
I don't care what your
favorite color...

924
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,458
Oh, goodness gracious.

925
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:18,250
No way!

926
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,541
Tell me...

927
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,833
How did our
wild beast do?

928
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:30,833
Good... He will definitely
meet the criteria.

929
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,458
Well, well.

930
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,125
They finally decided to put
you on the student council,

931
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,250
Kenshi...

932
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,541
Your big social
debut is almost here!

933
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,166
Next time on Tenchi Muyo:
"War on Geminar:

934
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,416
To be Chased and Pursued."

935
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,791
That vile Maria...!

936
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,500
What in the world
could she be up to?
