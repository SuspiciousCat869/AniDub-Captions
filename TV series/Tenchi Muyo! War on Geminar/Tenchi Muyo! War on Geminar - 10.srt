1
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,291
That's the Koro alarm!

2
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:53,250
Who knew something like this
was hidden within the Church?

3
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,666
The tricky part now is that it
can only be used one time...

4
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,833
Take down the castle!

5
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,041
Concentrate on the keep!

6
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,916
Why didn't we see them coming?

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,916
How could we, sir? It's as if
they appeared out of thin air.

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,875
What could they be after?

9
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,791
The keep!

10
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,458
We're lucky,
if not for the race,

11
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,458
we might've all been killed...
You have my thanks, Kenshi.

12
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,500
You're welcome?

13
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,041
We have some
Sacred Mechanoids

14
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,666
in the Forest
practice grounds...

15
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,000
That should buy us
the time we need

16
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,416
for the civilians to escape.

17
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,375
All right, let's move out...!
No casualties, understood?!

18
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,166
Yes, sir!

19
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,583
Burn it all to the ground!

20
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,916
Nothing walks out
of there alive!

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,458
We've had enough
of your games!

22
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,041
You Mest bastard!

23
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,791
King Shurifon?!

24
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,708
Curse you!
How did you escape?!

25
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,708
Aw, what's wrong?!

26
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,833
I'll show you!

27
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,666
Evacuations are at sixty
percent in the east district!

28
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,708
Seventy-five percent
for the north and south!

29
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,166
I think I should help.

30
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,583
Please don't...

31
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,541
We simply cannot allow a
guest to be put in harm's way.

32
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,291
Among Mechamasters, my
father is one of the best...

33
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,708
so there is no need
for you to worry.

34
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,291
Come on, boy...!
Is that all you've got? !

35
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,958
No, not at all...
Take this!

36
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,833
You can't defeat me
in a test of might.

37
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,541
It can't be...
A Black Sacred Mechanoid.

38
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,958
Doll...
He's all yours!

39
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,625
Be careful!

40
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,666
That one is different
from the others!

41
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,458
I've never seen
anything like this!

42
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,500
And you won't again.

43
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,500
Father!

44
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,000
Quickly, Kenshi...
Save him!

45
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,166
The shock from that hit
paralyzed its nerve system.

46
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,833
It's Kenshi!
Right on time!

47
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,500
It's him. It's, so...

48
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,333
so... beautiful.

49
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,916
Make a run for it!

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,625
Good luck!

51
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,916
Doll.

52
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,166
I've gotta do something
about that shield.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,375
Dagmyer...

54
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,458
We've wiped out most of
the city's infrastructure...

55
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,125
Shurifon is finished.

56
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,333
Well...
That was easy.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,125
All that's left is
to finish him off!

58
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,166
Doll, try to keep
him pinned down!

59
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,708
That's what you
get for butting in!

60
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,083
You idiot...
Get out of my way!

61
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,625
Her shield's so strong...

62
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,958
If that trick didn't work, I
don't think anything's going to!

63
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,791
What an incredible attack...

64
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,875
Even if my shield
can withstand it,

65
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,500
there's no way
my frame will!

66
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,000
Here we go!

67
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,666
This is bad.

68
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,083
Kenshi...!
Pull back!

69
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,500
Princess Aura?

70
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,416
We've evacuated everything.

71
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,416
My father and the other Sacred
Mechamasters are all safe.

72
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,041
On my way!

73
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,416
Doll... Go after him
right now...! Move it!

74
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,500
I see.

75
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,208
A black Sacred Mechanoid
is unable to use the Shield

76
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,166
of Gaia to its fullest.

77
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,125
It's my fault, I'm
sorry I wasn't stronger.

78
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,166
Don't take it all on yourself.

79
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,916
We're safe in this
forest for now.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,166
Yeah, but-

81
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,291
Kenshi, you fought
valiantly back there...

82
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,500
I would be honored if you
would marry my daughter.

83
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,458
In battle, you demonstrated
what your true quality is...

84
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,083
You're a fine man...

85
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,208
In every respect I find
you worthy to be my heir.

86
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,458
What wonderful news.
Kenshi belongs to us, King...

87
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,125
As such, it would be safe to
assume this entire country

88
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,208
will be ours as
well, correct?

89
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,833
Um... I'm
a bit confused.

90
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,750
Surely I'm not meant to take
her statement seriously?

91
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,875
Sorry to disappoint
you, but yeah.

92
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,250
When it comes to money, Empress
Lashara is never joking around.

93
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,500
Well... In that case,
all the repairs of the city

94
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,125
will be your
responsibility...

95
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,958
It's only fair. Babalun is
your Prime Minister, right?

96
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,375
What?!

97
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,041
You give us Kenshi, and we
give you the city as is...

98
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,083
Does that sound like
a reasonable trade?

99
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,416
Uh... We'll have to give
that some more thought.

100
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,666
Your Highness!

101
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,125
What's the matter?!

102
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,125
The Church and Havoniwa
have just been attacked!

103
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,250
This is a disaster!

104
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,958
We are currently disposing
of the teleportation ports

105
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,375
in all of the churches,
Your Eminence...

106
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,916
Unfortunately... some
of them are short on staff.

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Give the world
leaders a full account

108
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,250
of what has transpired...
We need their aid!

109
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,375
But if we do that, we'll-
Gaia's already on the move!

110
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,666
If doubt about us begins to
fester it would be disastrous!

111
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,166
That last attack turned
Shtrayu and Shurifon

112
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,291
into shields for
the Holy Land...

113
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,125
If something were
to happen to Havoniwa,

114
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,083
executing our plans
would be nearly impossible.

115
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,583
It doesn't make sense.

116
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,250
How did Lord Babalun come
by all this information...?

117
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,041
Even if he does descend
from a long line

118
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,333
of Sacred Mechamechanics,
he knows far too much!

119
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:39,000
However disconcerting,
it does not change our plan.

120
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,625
Because this Mechamaster
intervened and suppressed Gaia,

121
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,708
there were no casualties...

122
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,250
from the King down
to the civilians.

123
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
No, wait...

124
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,125
Considering their
current location,

125
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,541
it would take them far too long
to rendezvous with the team.

126
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,458
Since he did stand toe-to-toe
with Gaia, as far as the enemy

127
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,833
is concerned, Gaia is the
only weapon they have

128
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,666
that can oppose the White
Sacred Mechanoid.

129
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,083
So we use him as a decoy?

130
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,750
Then we should send an
intelligence officer

131
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,333
to visit Lashara immediately!

132
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,833
This is awful!

133
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,833
Moments ago,
Havoniwa was attacked

134
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,041
by one of Babalun's lackeys!

135
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,875
A black
Sacred Mechanoid teleported

136
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,500
into an abandoned church...

137
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,375
It completely destroyed Havoniwa
Castle before disappearing!

138
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,000
This is a disaster...

139
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,791
We can never take
the Holy Land now.

140
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,125
Are we under attack?

141
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,375
What was that?

142
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,083
Switch the image to
display our headquarters!

143
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,583
That's where we keep
the supply transport.

144
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,125
Gaia has returned.

145
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,416
I assume you'll be leaving
with Empress Lashara.

146
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,708
Of course...

147
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,083
Lord Babalun needs
to be stopped immediately...

148
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,291
He has devastated
our capital...

149
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,375
Shurifon's answer
must be firm.

150
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,125
Or is it that you'd rather
spend time with your groom...

151
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,458
perhaps?

152
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,708
What...? No!

153
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,833
I can't tell you enough
how much I approve.

154
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,833
He's a great
reason to go...

155
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,833
Besides. You've got quite
a bit of competition.

156
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,375
Follow your heart
wherever it takes you.

157
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,208
Do you mean that?

158
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,375
Just don't lose.

159
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,708
Yes, sir.

160
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,291
Strength and
courage be with you!

161
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Kenshi...!

162
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,250
Take care
of our Princess!

163
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,166
Now then... Let's prepare
for a counter attack!

164
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,416
Right!

165
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,666
So... What's the situation at
the Church's headquarters?

166
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,458
Well...
The good news is,

167
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,833
the Pope wasn't hurt in the
attack... And they were able

168
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,166
to maintain minimal
operability over their system.

169
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,916
But still...
Our usual sources

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,666
of intelligence
have no information.

171
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,791
All right. Then we
will stop in Havoniwa

172
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,041
on our way to
the Barrier Workshop.

173
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,791
But do you really
think that's wise?

174
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,916
Well, in the event that
we just so happen to get

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,708
into a big fight
with Lord Babalun,

176
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,291
we can do so without worrying
about disturbing other nations!

177
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,125
Can we really wage a war
in Princess Maria's land?

178
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,166
Yes... As a way
of paying homage,

179
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,666
we will have to leave
a flower by her grave.

180
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,583
You do realize you
don't actually know

181
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
if she's dead
yet, right?

182
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,833
It's a Church ship.

183
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,916
We can see right
through that camouflage.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,750
What are those
idiots thinking?

185
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,583
Judging by their course...

186
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,000
I would guess they're planning
a rendezvous with the SWAN.

187
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,833
Um... Why don't we take
advantage of that?

188
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,416
Good idea...
Do it.

189
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,750
Leave them be.

190
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,791
Hey, how 'bout you
give it a rest, Dolly!

191
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,375
Don't lose sight
of that ship!

192
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,916
Lady Rea! Those are Lord
Babalun's Mechanoids!

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,875
I thought
they might show up.

194
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,416
Take out
the power reactor...

195
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,958
Just try to minimize the
damage when seizing the ship!

196
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,375
I'm all over it!

197
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,041
The engine has been hit...!
Power is starting to shut down!

198
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,625
Fire a distress signal, now!

199
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,791
It's a distress signal...
That Church ship needs help!

200
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,958
Chiaia...!
Kenshi!

201
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,833
Hurry...! Seize that ship
before they get here!

202
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,666
You've done well.

203
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,458
Surrender
as soon as I eject.

204
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,916
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,916
Heads up, you guys!
It's an escape pod!

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,750
Shoot it...
Take it down, now!!

207
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,833
No luck!
It's way too fast!

208
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,125
You idiots...

209
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,333
Now they know
what your plan is.

210
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,625
The ship is yours,
we surrender...!

211
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,791
Please cease-fire!

212
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,000
Kill them...
Kill them all.

213
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,208
We surrender.
The ship belongs to you!

214
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,125
They'd already surrendered!

215
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,916
Please, it's not like we
could take it with us.

216
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,958
Chiaia, I think something's
moving in our direction.

217
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,791
Whoa, what was that?

218
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,000
An escape pod!

219
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,958
... Hey, wait!

220
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,791
What is she doing?

221
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,833
That was close.

222
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,708
Kenshi...
Is anyone hurt?

223
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,500
No, she's just passed out.

224
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,416
Oh... Good.

225
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,125
Chiaia!

226
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,833
We confirmed
that there was an explosion

227
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,875
near the distress signal...
I need your help!

228
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,333
Got it...
I'm on my way...!

229
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,750
Kenshi, can you handle taking
her to the SWAN yourself?

230
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,916
Yeah...
No problem!

231
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,958
How are you feeling,
are you okay?

232
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,208
This place.
Is it the SWAN?

233
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,333
Lashara's ship?

234
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,416
It is.

235
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,291
I thought so.

236
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,875
Hey, maybe you
should lie down.

237
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,333
Ow...! No, please
stop...! No, really...

238
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,666
Well, I'm glad to know
that this isn't a dream.

239
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,916
I guess you're
feeling better then?

240
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,458
I'm perfectly fine...
I just passed out from shock.

241
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,875
I appreciate you
saving my skin...

242
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,041
Fainting was not
part of my plan.

243
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,416
My name's Rea Second, and I've
been sent here by the Church

244
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,750
to speak with
Empress Lashara.

245
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,250
I think we can arrange that...

246
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,500
But first could you maybe,
uh, let Kenshi go?

247
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,083
Oh... So sorry.

248
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,166
Also... Do you know what
happened to the ship I was on?

249
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,041
By the time we got there
it was already destroyed...

250
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,416
We were too late.

251
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,916
I understand.

252
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,958
Why does that
lady hate me?

253
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,916
This doesn't make sense.

254
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,083
Can you explain to us
why they want him now...?

255
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,750
We understand that
you were attacked...

256
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,250
But the Church hasn't lost
its ability to function, has it?

257
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,833
No, but that wasn't
Babalun's intention either...

258
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,416
If he had wanted to,
he could've taken us out...

259
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,666
The Church's Headquarters
and all our operational systems

260
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,000
were completely vulnerable
during the attack.

261
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,625
Babalun had other motives.

262
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,166
The attacks on Havoniwa,
Shurifon and the Church

263
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,833
were meant to send a message
to the other nations.

264
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,000
He's proved they can no longer
remain peaceful bystanders...

265
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,166
Not anymore, at least.

266
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,083
Yes.

267
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,166
Even if we destroy all of the
Church's teleportation units,

268
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,458
he's just going
to try something else.

269
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,958
If all the other nations
are using military forces

270
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,083
to defend their lands, they
won't have enough fighters

271
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,083
to launch a
successful invasion.

272
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,125
With the Holy Land's
three bordering nations

273
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,583
being used as a shield...

274
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,041
it would require an even
larger force than before.

275
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,041
Babalun's army may be small,
but it's extremely deadly...

276
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,958
Because he still has Gaia.

277
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,166
Gaia's the only weapon Babalun
has that can stand up to Kenshi,

278
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,416
but we can't let them
fight one-on-one...

279
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,750
Well, not yet.

280
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,166
Yes...
I am fully aware.

281
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,500
Sir Kenshi, or rather
his Sacred Mechanoid,

282
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,458
is not up to the task.

283
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,916
I think it's time for you to pay
a visit to the Barrier Workshop.

284
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,125
Have we received a report
from the liaison?

285
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,291
Unfortunately we have
not yet heard back

286
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,666
from anyone
we have sent.

287
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,166
I see...

288
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,041
And what of our
transmissions?

289
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
Both our headquarters
and broadcast systems

290
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,541
are inoperable...

291
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,583
If only SWAN
had a marker.

292
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,166
Well... Too bad...

293
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,375
We've no choice but
to continue with the plan.

294
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,916
No, we can't.

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,875
There simply isn't time
to debate this any further...

296
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,333
If we don't act now,
things could get much worse.

297
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,750
Do you have a second?

298
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,333
Sorry to interrupt...

299
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,625
but I'm just so happy,
I couldn't help myself...

300
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,333
You know...

301
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,416
We can't talk with you all
the way over there, can we?

302
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,666
No... Miss Second.

303
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,416
You can call me Rea
if you like.

304
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,750
Uh... Okay.

305
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,291
If it makes you
feel uncomfortable,

306
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,750
you don't have to.

307
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,458
Oh no... That's
not it exactly...

308
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,291
It's just... The thing is,
that's my mom's name too,

309
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,500
so it's kinda weird.

310
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,708
Is that so?

311
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,125
Nothin' against you,
or your name, I swear.

312
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,583
I understand... I would love
to hear about your mom sometime.

313
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,791
Okay.

314
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,791
Families have always
interested me...

315
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,291
Parents are our
link to the past,

316
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,166
and we're their
link to the future.

317
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,000
What about your dad? I bet
he was a pretty neat guy.

318
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,666
He's just a weird
old man, really.

319
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,125
I don't get it.

320
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,875
Do you and your father not
get along or something?

321
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,583
No, I love him...!
He's a funny guy.

322
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,333
Funny, huh...?
That's sweet.

323
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,916
Hey, if this conversation's
getting you down,

324
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,458
we can talk about
something else.

325
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,916
No, I'm all right...

326
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,750
I'm just a little
jealous, that's all.

327
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,791
Oh... sure.

328
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Look what we have here.
Do you care to tell us

329
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,083
what you ladies are doing
hiding behind that tree?

330
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,500
Nothing.

331
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,166
Sure doesn't look like
nothing... It's not nice to spy.

332
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,666
And besides, Kenshi's only
trying to get some info.

333
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,250
Yeah, well, maybe that's
all we're trying to do, too.

334
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,500
Besides, how do you know
she's not here to kidnap him?

335
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,791
Oh, please...

336
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,875
a Male Sacred Mechamaster
is completely capable

337
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,416
of protecting himself.

338
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,291
That's exactly why we can't
let her get too close to him.

339
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,625
It's great that
our business with him

340
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,666
is prospering like this!

341
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,041
But what if the Church were
to take him away from you?

342
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,250
What would you do then?

343
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,291
Wait, what?

344
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,750
Generally speaking,

345
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,500
the summoner owns anyone they
bring from another world,

346
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,791
but in Kenshi's case
there is no summoner...

347
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,166
The long and short of it is...

348
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,833
it's up to Kenshi to decide
who he'll side with.

349
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,541
You see them, right?
I wonder what they're up to?

350
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,458
Beats me.

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,083
I'm very pleased you
could make it today.

352
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,125
Depending on your performance,
I will consider

353
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,833
making you ranking officers
in Shtrayu's army.

354
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm expecting a lot
from all of you.

355
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,541
Keep your eyes
and ears open!

356
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,416
Are you sure
about this...?

357
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,375
The majority of them
are second-rate ronin

358
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,125
and money-hungry
bandits.

359
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,500
You got a problem
with bandits, girlie?

360
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,208
Because we're way better
than a twit like you,

361
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,000
that's for sure.

362
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,833
Bandits have
seen more combat,

363
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,250
and at the moment, that's
what I'm looking for...

364
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,208
But if I were you, I wouldn't
forget your place, Lan.

365
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,333
Yeah, yeah. You're
gonna use us like pawns...

366
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,000
But don't worry, I guarantee
you'll get your money's worth.

367
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,416
I can't thank you enough...
It was a big help...

368
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,708
I hear you did a
number on Havoniwa.

369
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,250
So does it feel
good being done

370
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,000
with that council
of idiots, Uncle?

371
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,541
Hey, watch
your mouth...

372
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,666
Or you're not gonna get the
gift I'm about to give you...

373
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,291
I've got some information
about a Male Sacred Mechamaster

374
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,000
who fled
from the Holy Land...

375
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,916
I can tell you
exactly where he is...

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,375
His name though...
I forget.

377
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,541
Ceres?

378
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah, that's it...
How did you know that?

379
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,250
Well, well. Looks like
luck's finally coming my way.

380
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,708
Havoniwa's
border's up ahead.

381
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,208
Let's all cross
our fingers

382
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,416
and hope they haven't
hijacked METEOR FALL.

383
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,041
What's METEOR FALL?

384
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,083
It's a defensive weapon that
protects the Havoniwa border.

385
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,000
Any bad guys who try to break
through will have to deal

386
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,208
with METEOR first...

387
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,583
If they cross the border
on a ship like so...

388
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,083
it drops a big boulder on them
from way up in the sky like BAM,

389
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,875
"Take that, bad guys!"

390
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,833
That's really
all it does?

391
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,333
Primitive. But its destructive
powers are tremendous...

392
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,833
Making the border quite
hard to penetrate.

393
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,541
That must be why the
Black Sacred Mechanoid

394
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,833
chose to teleport inside instead
of trying a frontal attack...

395
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,708
Going head-to-head with
METEOR FALL is way too risky.

396
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,416
Are there any ways around it?

397
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,291
This is the only
path large ships like ours

398
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,583
can pass through...

399
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,708
It's easier to keep an
eye on things that way.

400
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,916
Yeah, that makes sense.

401
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,041
Stupid old Maria, she is
about as smart as a Koro...!

402
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,291
The audacity of the
incompetent moron

403
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,791
to protect her country's border
with such a silly trap...

404
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,458
She is incomprehensible!

405
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,000
Empress...!
METEOR FALL is missing!

406
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,375
No...!
That can't be!

407
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,083
This is where METEOR
would normally stand.

408
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,875
Do you think
they destroyed it?

409
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,583
No way, there's
no debris at all.

410
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,333
At least we don't have to worry
about passing through, now.

411
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,041
Still. I should scout
out the area first.

412
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,458
Good idea... Kenshi, you
should go along with Aura!

413
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,291
Sure thing!

414
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,333
This is weird. I don't
see anything out here.

415
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,125
You're right...
I do not foresee any issues.

416
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,750
Look...
Over there!

417
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,000
Yet another place
has been destroyed.

418
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,416
Judging by this...
we doubt she is still alive.

419
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,791
Rest in peace,
cousin...

420
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,458
We will take your
country for ourselves

421
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,041
and rule it
in your place.

422
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:53,041
Slow down... We're not even
sure if Maria is dead yet.

423
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,500
Kenshi... I know that
old bag was fond of you.

424
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,791
I hope you're not
taking this too hard.

425
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,125
Flora might still
be alive, too.

426
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,500
Seriously, think about it:
How do we know Queen Flora

427
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,875
didn't flee this place
with Princess Maria?

428
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,333
Because our aunt is
extremely stupid...

429
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,291
She would not have
the sense to flee.

430
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,333
Right.

431
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,250
We've never been
here before...

432
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,958
It's kind of unusual...

433
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,458
The city doesn't seem
very residential, does it?

434
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,333
That's because civilians
didn't live in this area.

435
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,333
This was a government
district...

436
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,125
It used to be the heart and
soul of Havoniwa politics.

437
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,875
Oh, wow.

438
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,625
Increase speed now!

439
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,458
Not good.

440
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,541
They have got us cornered.

441
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,125
Uh-oh... Guys, look!

442
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,083
What's that?

443
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,041
That is METEOR FALL.

444
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,125
All right...
Let her rip, boys!

445
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,166
Our escape route
is blocked.

446
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,875
The SWAN will be
in big trouble

447
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,500
if we sustain
a direct hit from them.

448
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:53,000
Hey, but what about
all my buried crystals?!

449
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,500
Are you kidding
me right now?

450
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,958
Crystals...?

451
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,708
They'll be destroyed,
along with all of the SWAN.

452
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,375
I'll stop the
boulder dropper!

453
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,333
METEOR FALL is kept in the air
by the suspension systems

454
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,250
located on each
of the four legs.

455
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,416
So then there's a chance we
can escape if we destroy

456
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
at least one leg...!

457
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,708
Concentrate your attack!

458
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,166
No luck.

459
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,916
The stone
is far too thick...

460
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,125
In order to damage it,
we need to move in closer.

461
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,541
We can't... Any closer
and the Ena gets thin,

462
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,375
preventing our output
from working properly!

463
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,625
Plus, my Mechaworker

464
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,083
isn't supposed to be
up this high at all!

465
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,333
Do they really think I'll
let them destroy this...?

466
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,250
Give 'em a shot
across the bow!

467
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,250
You got it!

468
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,333
Chiaia...!
Look out!

469
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,250
If we don't do something,
the SWAN is done.

470
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,583
Yes, but what can we do?

471
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,083
Nearing target.
I'll be there soon.

472
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,958
Oh wow, this is the most
pathetic thing I've ever seen.

473
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,416
Come on, let's go
ahead and finish them.

474
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,083
METEOR FALL...
It's moving towards us!

475
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,291
Well...
this is unfortunate.

476
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,625
Whaddaya think,
Wahan? Ideas?

477
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:38,416
I sure wish I did...
But I don't.

478
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,833
Get closer... But how am
I supposed to do that?

479
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,291
Take 'em out, now!

480
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,208
Boss...! There's
something headed our way!

481
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,666
What...? Hurry up
and show it to me!

482
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,458
A Sacred Mechanoid?

483
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:55,916
Who's that?

484
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,375
I've reached my
operational limit.

485
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,916
You guys... The reactor
output's down...!

486
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,166
Let's go!

487
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,625
All right!

488
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:18,375
Is he going to compress
the entire boulder?

489
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,041
But we're
outside the draft!

490
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,041
Oh no!

491
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,083
At least we'll get
the SWAN. Oh no.

492
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,291
Hey, you saved
our lives...!

493
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,916
Thanks a lot.

494
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,416
Did they hurt you?

495
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,291
Yukine!

496
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,083
Where'd you come from?

497
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,791
I thought I recognized
your frame...

498
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,958
We're glad to see you.

499
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,958
Oh, thank goodness...
You're safe.

500
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:42,250
Good timing.
You just barely made it.

501
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,166
Dagmyer!

502
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:53,375
Wait, when did this happen...?
What happened to Cordyline?

503
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,791
No word yet... We lost
all contact with them.

504
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,916
You screwed up,
Mom... Way to go.

505
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, wow.

506
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,625
Welcome to Havoniwa's
underground city.

507
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,375
I'm so thrilled to see you
all here safe and sound.

508
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,833
You've had
quite a journey!

509
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,375
Great! We wasted a whole
bouquet of flowers over you...!

510
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,916
We'll be submitting an invoice
for that expense presently!

511
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,625
If it weren't for Yukine, those
flowers would've been for you,

512
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,166
and don't forget it!

513
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,541
Oh how nice. It really is great
to see them back together.

514
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:01,125
Yeah, and at least I don't have
to worry about her anymore.

515
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,291
Kenshi!

516
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,333
There you are, darling!

517
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:09,000
Long time no see, Flora.

518
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,750
Oh, that's right...
My apologies.

519
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,791
I have to call you Sir Kenshi
from now on, don't I?

520
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,916
I'll admit, never
in my wildest dreams

521
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,416
did I think you were
a Sacred Mechamaster.

522
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,791
Yeah...

523
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,875
Sorry for not
telling you earlier.

524
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:26,333
Please, I forgive you...
But only if you marry me.

525
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:30,291
Aunt Flora...! We need to
speak with you right now!

526
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,291
Maria!

527
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,833
Mother?

528
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,000
From this moment forward,
you're officially in command.

529
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,583
Me?

530
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:39,458
One day the fate of our country
will rest on your shoulders.

531
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,708
Get some practice.

532
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,708
Really?

533
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,333
Now. Where were we...?

534
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:46,125
Whaddaya say we leave the hard
stuff to these girls here.

535
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:49,333
And we go rekindle
that old flame! Let's go!

536
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:54,125
I see... The rumors
about this family are true.

537
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:58,291
Oh, good grief...!
Will someone stop her?!

538
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,458
The situation in the area
surrounding the Holy Land

539
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,833
is bad to say the least.

540
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,375
Yes, it is.

541
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,916
This is certainly
unfortunate news to receive.

542
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,791
Since the Church cannot be
relied upon to form an alliance,

543
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,708
we have no other choice
but to act ourselves.

544
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,041
Havoniwa
is no different

545
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,833
than any other nation
you've mentioned.

546
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:18,666
First and foremost, we must
protect our own borders.

547
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,041
The capital has already
been decimated...

548
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,916
And there's no guarantee
Babalun won't attack us again.

549
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,500
We-

550
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,500
We must determine how many
of our forces we can dedicate

551
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,791
to an offensive strike.

552
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,625
Defending our
borders matters...

553
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,791
But we can't sit by
and ignore this threat.

554
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,000
We should also evacuate
vulnerable areas...

555
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,291
And move those civilians
to a safer place.

556
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,583
If we do, we can dedicate
all our Sacred Mechanoids

557
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,291
to the cause.

558
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,708
The farms in the highlands are
a great place for the refugees.

559
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:47,333
Martial law has already been
declared in acceptable areas...

560
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:50,166
On your order we could begin
relocating them tomorrow.

561
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,000
Let's change the timetable for
the railway to the highlands.

562
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,916
If you're willing to give
the order, we could open up

563
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,666
our supply base as well.

564
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,166
Our opinion of Havoniwa
just improved quite a bit!

565
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,125
It's very different from where
you're from, that's for sure!

566
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,458
Yes, indeed, we're
not so selfish here...

567
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,041
We don't think only
of our own interests,

568
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,750
and flee for safety
after being attacked!

569
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,166
Now that is enough!

570
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,750
You have already reached
a resolution, haven't you...?

571
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:14,375
You set this whole
farce up just to gloat.

572
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,875
This is about more than
rubbing it in your face...

573
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,708
Before a resolution
is reached...

574
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,500
...there is much more
to be discussed...

575
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,416
The issue is
ownership of Kenshi.

576
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,458
No...! What?!

577
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:30,083
Of course... It all
makes perfect sense.

578
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,583
Indeed.

579
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,125
No way.

580
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,125
Kenshi is vital to
a Holy Land strike...

581
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,125
Depending on him, our military
strategy and line of authority

582
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:43,416
could change dramatically.

583
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,750
It is unclear who is allowed
to give him orders in combat.

584
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,666
At Shurifon, this
was left ambiguous.

585
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,208
But we must reach
a decision now.

586
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:00,458
Empress?

587
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:03,041
Everyone.

588
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,458
I'm sure Sir Kenshi needs
some time to think...

589
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,125
And we will
grant him that...

590
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,083
We will hear your
decision tomorrow morning.

591
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:14,208
Is that acceptable...?
Sir Kenshi?

592
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,916
Uh... Yeah,
all right.

593
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,000
Poor Lashara...
I hope she's okay.

594
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:50,708
Oh... Don't worry about her,
she's gonna be just fine.

595
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:56,125
Still... If Kenshi ends up
going a different way,

596
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:59,541
it has the real potential
to completely devastate her.

597
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,791
Getting Kenshi was like
striking gold, but now,

598
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,875
all of a sudden, she's on
the brink of losing everything.

599
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,041
Please, Empress...

600
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,166
Could you at least
eat one bowl of soup?

601
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,125
Maybe she's asleep?

602
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:27,500
Let's give her space and
leave her be for a while.

603
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,291
Can I talk to you?

604
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,958
Okay.

605
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,041
At any rate, there's no
point standing in the hall

606
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,583
like a bunch of morons.

607
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,250
Let's go.

608
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,291
Yeah, you're right...

609
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,208
This isn't something you can
decide at the drop of a hat,

610
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,000
it's a big decision.

611
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,041
But. I can tell by
the look on your face

612
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,166
that you still
don't have a clue...

613
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,041
You've got friends,
so go ask them. Who knows?

614
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,958
Maybe they can help.

615
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,458
You're wavering?

616
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,708
This is the type
of decision

617
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,916
that you must
make for yourself...

618
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,250
Just know wherever you choose
to go, I will be right there.

619
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:45,166
You should do whatever
makes you the happiest.

620
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,916
Follow your heart
and you can't go wrong!

621
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,625
Do whatever you want to,
we just want you to be happy,

622
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,666
that's all...

623
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,500
Right...?
Yukine?

624
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,541
Or... Follow
your instincts

625
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,666
and do what gives
you the most pleasure.

626
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,291
By that I mean, pick me!

627
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,083
Mother, stop!

628
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,041
You're not being helpful,
not even a tiny bit!

629
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,583
Kenshi...

630
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:10,083
What's important now is not
to ask, "What should I do?"...

631
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,291
That's nothing...

632
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,083
Instead, just ask,
"What do I want?"

633
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,250
You should have said
that to begin with,

634
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,125
then maybe everyone wouldn't
call you the Horny Queen.

635
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,833
They do?

636
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,291
What do I want? Huh.

637
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,458
Hey, there she is.

638
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:46,041
Empress Lashara!

639
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,375
Oh, you big idiot!

640
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,041
You realize this is exactly why
Lithia calls you a wild animal.

641
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,416
What are you doing
out here so late?

642
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,708
Looking at...
the moon.

643
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,458
That's amazing...

644
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:12,000
Actually, it reminds me of
another full moon I saw once.

645
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,333
It's gorgeous. Sometimes
life gets so crazy,

646
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:24,291
it's easy to forget how
beautiful this world really is.

647
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,333
So, have you made
up your mind?

648
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,083
I'm getting close, but
I haven't had the chance

649
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,166
to hear you out yet.

650
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,208
You should decide
for yourself...

651
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,375
Isn't that what
everybody else told you.

652
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,166
Well, yeah...
That is sorta how it went.

653
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,125
We have nothing
to say to you then...

654
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,500
No!

655
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,375
Nothing at all.

656
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,666
Even though we're
still very young,

657
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,500
childhood never
really happened for us.

658
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:04,375
To become royalty, childish
things were sacrificed...

659
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,625
And for what?

660
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,916
We didn't do anything
to earn what we are today.

661
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,375
Nothing...

662
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:14,916
We did not choose or ask
to be born into this life...

663
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Like a flower
forced to bloom,

664
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,291
but having no clue
how to survive.

665
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,958
Please don't leave.
We're begging you not to go.

666
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,333
When I first came to
this world... I was alone.

667
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,791
But then you took me in and
you gave me a real home...

668
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,958
and I'm so
grateful for that.

669
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,750
Oh! There's something
else I wanna ask you.

670
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,333
Well...
What is it?

671
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:12,291
Would you be willing
to sell me the SWAN?

672
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,541
Say wha?

673
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:16,000
Like I said, I'd like
to purchase the SWAN.

674
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,708
But the thing is,
I don't have any money,

675
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,625
so I'd have to pay
you for it later.

676
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,083
Are you... stupid?

677
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,541
Here's the deal!

678
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,458
I officially have
no intention of allying

679
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,458
with any nation or becoming
anyone's property.

680
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,583
So the SWAN will
become my kingdom!

681
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:35,083
And I'll fly my ship
anywhere I want!

682
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,750
But I'm gonna need help.

683
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,166
Mainly a crew
of individuals

684
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,875
willing to make sure
the thing doesn't crash!

685
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,833
Who here wants to sign up to
be a part of something great?!

686
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,333
Uh...
Show of hands...?

687
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,041
Anyone?

688
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,708
Oh, man... Yes.

689
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,291
So I take it the Church
has no objection to this?

690
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,875
Not at all.

691
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,916
Well... In that case,
we are coming along!

692
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,916
Me too!

693
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,541
I wouldn't miss
it for the world!

694
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,708
Neither would I.

695
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,916
If you go, Yukine,
I could be convinced.

696
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,708
Hey...!
Don't forget me!

697
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,958
I'm sorry,
but you can't go!

698
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,916
No... Please!
Why can't I go?!

699
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,375
This is for
your own good!

700
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,000
What a relief...

701
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,666
I don't think my new country
would make it with her there.

702
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,416
Now that you've declared
your independence,

703
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,208
and since you were nice enough
to allow us to join you,

704
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,500
it's only fitting we hold
the first emergency session

705
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,291
of the National Congress.

706
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,500
Sounds good...
What's on the agenda?

707
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,000
Just one thing...

708
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:52,125
I propose we make crystal
excavation on the SWAN illegal.

709
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:54,541
This is a terribly
important proposal.

710
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:55,916
It sure is.

711
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,166
And it's one that must go
into effect immediately.

712
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,791
I do feel for you...
But it just cannot be helped.

713
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,208
Then let's put it to a vote!

714
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,625
Uh... Wait, not yet!

715
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,541
Raise your hand
if you agree.

716
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:13,041
Well then... It looks
like the motion carries!

717
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,625
No way, I object...
Besides, this is my country!

718
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,291
Oh, shut up...!

719
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,416
We can't let you destroy the
only country you currently own,

720
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,583
you big moron!

721
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,500
No fair!

722
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:26,416
Quit your whining, we got
a barrier workshop to visit,

723
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,791
so let's get
a move on, everyone!

724
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,458
I think I've made
a huge mistake!

725
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,541
I guess nobody
told you, did they...?

726
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,833
It's not easy being King.

727
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,125
Kenshi...

728
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,166
All of our questions
should be answered here...

729
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,416
Including why you
came to our world...

730
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,083
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

731
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,625
"Barrier Workshop"...

732
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,416
We'll make a fortune
if we can figure out

733
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,458
how to summon beings
from other worlds!
