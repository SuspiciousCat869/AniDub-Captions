1
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,708
I've never seen anything
like this before...

2
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,958
After they lost contact
with the Church,

3
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,166
the countries took up
defensive positions

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,333
'cause they're all scared of
the Black Sacred Mechanoid.

5
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,083
We have to take down
the SWAN no matter what!

6
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,708
Once we've beaten them,
Shurifon, Havoniwa, Shtrayu

7
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,041
and the Holy Land will have to
bow down and follow Babalun...

8
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,833
Then we'll get the money and
respect we've got coming to us.

9
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,833
RONIN can officially
join the army

10
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,500
and earn the name
Sacred Mechamaster.

11
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,125
And you're positive you
can deliver on that?

12
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,291
If the three nations
and the Holy Land merge,

13
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,666
we have a real shot at
conquering the continent.

14
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,291
Keep your eye on the prize.

15
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,458
Are you sure it's a good idea
to let her take the lead?

16
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,916
Oh, I'm fine with it...

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,916
It's not like Dagmyer can
be of any use to us now.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,958
She's a loose cannon and
I don't trust her judgment...

19
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,333
Something has to be
done about it at once.

20
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,250
She's partially responsible for
us losing the barrier reactor,

21
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,500
but so what...?

22
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,875
It's not like we've
been able to figure out

23
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,708
how to use it anyway.

24
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,916
You two can stay here
and get some R &amp; R...

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,250
It would suck
if something happened

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,958
to our Male Sacred
Mechamasters.

27
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,833
Just calm down,
Chiaia...

28
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,125
Doll, or... Mexiah,

29
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,041
we guess we should say,
clearly didn't come here

30
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,250
just to do harm
to your father.

31
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,208
Yes but still-!

32
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,958
Do we have any information on
what exactly this Neizai stole?

33
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:36,291
She took a device that
deletes Core Crystal data.

34
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,500
The thing is, if the
Central Core Crystal inside

35
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,916
an artificial
being can be reset,

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,750
then there's no one to pilot
the Sacred Mechalord.

37
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,625
As far as I know, it's the
only sure-fire way to defeat it.

38
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,833
I see, but what
happens if we do that?

39
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,583
If we go that route,
Mexiah would be gone forever.

40
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,375
You guys...
We can't.

41
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,250
Hey, this wasn't an easy
decision for Naua either.

42
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,625
That's horrible.

43
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,208
They needed two
Sacred Mechalords

44
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,083
to defeat Gaia
the last time!

45
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,750
And those two were the
most advanced machines

46
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,291
the previous civilization
ever created...

47
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,416
Even as powerful
as Kenshi is-

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,250
As things stand now,
he can't win.

49
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,416
No luck. We tried
to use Kenshi's bullets,

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,083
but they're insufficient
as an energy source.

51
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,750
Surely the issue isn't that
they aren't strong enough?

52
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,125
It's just the
opposite, actually.

53
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,541
We're unable to mount them...
They're too strong...

54
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,041
In fact, we can't
even scratch them.

55
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,875
Yeah... that's my bad,
I'm sorry about that.

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,125
I think I got it!

57
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,791
She's right.

58
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,708
Kenshi can use his compression
abilities to make a weapon.

59
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,250
Even though they were replicas,
his compression bullets

60
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,500
blasted through those shields
like they were nothing.

61
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,000
We might be able to use
that power against Gaia!

62
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,375
It could really work.

63
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,875
The issue is finding
the materials we need.

64
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,791
Couldn't he gather up
a whole bunch of boulders,

65
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,000
rocks and debris that
are lying around unused?

66
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,791
No, that won't work, the
weapon'll be too brittle...

67
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,000
What we're gonna need
is one massive rock.

68
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,708
Do you mean like
a metal ingot?

69
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,458
Exactly like that...

70
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,166
One that's
as huge as the SWAN!

71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,916
How...? Something that
big doesn't exist.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,041
Yes it does, and we're all
flying on it right now.

73
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,458
No... No way!
The SWAN's my country!

74
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,791
The fate of the entire
world rests on this, Kenshi!

75
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,000
Could you at least wait till
I dig up all the crystals?

76
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,583
You idiot! That would
tear the SWAN apart!

77
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,625
I don't wanna!

78
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,000
The SWAN might be on
the small side actually.

79
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,166
Really?

80
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,500
Well... Then how big
does it need to be?

81
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,708
If we use stone, hundreds
of times larger than the SWAN.

82
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,208
What...? Where are we supposed
to find something like that?

83
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,791
I know.

84
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,666
Yukine...?
Are you sure?

85
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,416
The SWAN changed course.
Any idea what that's about?

86
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,083
Very peculiar.

87
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,541
It doesn't appear that
they're going to hook up

88
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,750
with the Havoniwan army.

89
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,916
Oh, who cares...? Wherever
they go, I'll follow 'em there.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,958
We're gonna finish them off
this time for sure!

91
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,000
I promise!

92
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,250
That's correct! If it's not a
horrible inconvenience to you,

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,166
I would like to use that
facility as a meeting point.

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,416
Naturally, we wouldn't
cause any problems at all...

95
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,666
And the Pope's already
given us permission.

96
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,750
I'm very surprised
you gave approval.

97
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,916
I didn't have a choice.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Considering the situation
we find ourselves in,

99
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,666
the priority of the Church

100
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,291
must be recovering
our functionality.

101
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,958
If she calls this an extension
of student council affairs,

102
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,708
you must give your
approval then too, yes?

103
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,875
That sounds like an...

104
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,416
Yes, that's true.

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,458
I have to ask you, who is this
Kenshi Masaki to push Lithia

106
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,083
to such great lengths?

107
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,041
He's had the same effect
on all the students here,

108
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,208
as a matter of fact.

109
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,833
Hang tight,
almost there!

110
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,041
Done and done.

111
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,208
Well, I'm so glad
to hear that.

112
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,458
He's a good boy,
that's all.

113
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,916
I am so terribly sorry
to put you out like this,

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,916
but I just-

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,958
Lithia...!
Lady Lithia!!!

116
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,125
What is wrong with you?
I'm standing right here!

117
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,625
What's the matter...?
Why are you yelling at me?

118
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,750
Uh...
Hello there.

119
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,291
Hey Lapis, isn't she the old
student council president...?

120
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,875
That is her, right?

121
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,083
Yeah... Her name
is Dame Morga.

122
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,083
You two... Please stop your
gossiping and get back to work!

123
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,083
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,708
Now...
Lady Lithia...

125
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,791
Would you care
to explain exactly

126
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,708
why you never bothered
to contact me?

127
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,125
Because you're serving

128
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,250
as the Trible Royal Court's
Sacred Mechamaster.

129
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,875
I just assumed you had more
important things to do.

130
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,166
Well, there's no point
fretting over one country

131
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,250
when the entire world is
on the verge of destruction.

132
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,000
Besides, I consider it a
high honor to gather arms

133
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,708
under a Sacred Mechamaster
from another world!

134
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,416
Wait, how do you
know about that?

135
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,916
Even though
I'm just an alumni...

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,791
I still keep tabs on my
precious alma mater...

137
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,375
No matter what the danger,
I will always...

138
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,000
This sorta reminds me of the
'not so good old days.'

139
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,333
Yeah, me too.

140
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,833
Oh, calm down...
Just leave this to me, okay?

141
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,250
I can handle
everything from here!

142
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,333
No, I will not!

143
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,166
Great...!
I have to go prepare...

144
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,208
I'll see you soon!

145
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,375
Morga, stop...
Hold on!

146
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,791
Lapis?

147
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,583
Yes, ma'am?

148
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,125
Send the transmission to King
Trible right away, please.

149
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,625
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,000
At the very least,

151
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,583
that should help buy us
a little more time...

152
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,958
I'm in for it...

153
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,000
That woman may
have some talent,

154
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,500
but she never did quite learn
how to play well with others.

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,833
Wow, it's so big...
Just unbelievable.

156
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,375
Here in Yukine's hometown,

157
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,458
it's worshipped as
their guardian deity.

158
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,791
Occasionally, they conduct
rituals, ceremonies,

159
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,083
and important summits here.

160
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,875
So that's gonna
be our weapon?

161
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,666
Over my dead body!

162
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,208
This structure is sacred.

163
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,750
We won't sit back and
watch you destroy it!

164
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,750
But we have to!

165
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,916
Yukine...

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,583
you're from a long
line of priestesses

167
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,750
who swore to protect
this place...

168
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,791
We won't let this ruffian
desecrate our shrine

169
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,791
and use it in
someone else's war!

170
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,208
Please sir, you
must see reason...

171
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,000
If we don't do something,
this world is doomed forever!

172
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,958
Princess Maria, not you too...!
Oh, this is a nightmare...!

173
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,583
Your mother would
never even consider

174
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,416
such a deplorable measure!

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,625
Oh, she would
do it all right,

176
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,583
she just wouldn't
tell you first.

177
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,125
Would you let me
ask the goddess?

178
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,083
Ask her...?
Yukine.

179
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,166
Impossible...!
Have you already forgotten

180
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,166
that you were unable
to enter the barrier?

181
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,791
You can't... No one's been
able to for fifteen years now...

182
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,875
Not since your
grandmother passed away...

183
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,500
Not a single soul
has done... What?!

184
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,833
Hey, you! You're not
allowed to go in there!

185
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,166
Uh... I'm sorry!

186
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,458
What are you doing...?

187
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,708
Are you trying
to embarrass us?

188
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,125
What... in
the heck was that?!

189
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,458
I swear... The kids these
days have no respect.

190
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,500
Uh...
Do you see that?

191
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,875
They treat this place
like it's nothing

192
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,541
but a tourist attraction.

193
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,041
Please, look.

194
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,333
You... I am so disappointed,
you should know better!

195
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,083
Please look.

196
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,416
Little brat...! I told you
not to go in there...!

197
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,541
You come right back
here this minute!

198
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,541
Don't you know what
forbidden means...?

199
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,708
You crossed the barrier!

200
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,958
Well, he seems to have
finally caught on.

201
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,333
A miracle!

202
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,500
Um... what?

203
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,625
What are they doing
in a place like that?

204
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,750
Well, go on.

205
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,375
This new Mechanoid can move in
bursts, even with a low output.

206
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,916
And its operational limit
has been upgraded big time.

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,041
I wish I had enough ready
for everyone right now,

208
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,375
but don't worry, they'll be
done in time for our siege

209
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,166
on the Holy Land...

210
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,916
At any rate, one
goes to Kenshi...

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,958
and we can all take turns
using the other two.

212
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,500
Sounds good!

213
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,166
Kenshi... Don't compress it more
than twenty 'm' in one go...

214
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,916
Otherwise your powers
will fry the knight frame.

215
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,458
Now...
Let's do this!

216
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,416
I'm all over it.

217
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,875
All right...

218
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,791
Here's to hoping
no enemies show up

219
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,166
until we've finished
compressing that monolith.

220
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,208
A sword...?
What do you mean?

221
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,000
Lan, look!

222
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,750
No way...
What's that?

223
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,166
Amazing... He did
it in one try.

224
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,166
What the-?

225
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,916
Incredible!

226
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,833
Kenshi... This anti-gravity ring
will indicate when you're done.

227
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,041
Did you see that? What in
the world are they up to?

228
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,416
It seems to me as though
they're compressing

229
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,625
that monolith in
an attempt to make a sword.

230
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,375
That big rock?

231
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,750
The battle at
the Barrier Workshop

232
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,666
should have been
documented for reference...

233
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,666
especially with regard to
Kenshi's compressed bullets.

234
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,583
Oh, that.

235
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,250
Is something the matter?

236
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,291
It looks like he's
taking a little break...

237
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,291
He just swapped out
with the other two.

238
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,791
That's weird...
He's leaving.

239
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,958
I think they're
holding it up for him.

240
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,750
I can't begin to imagine
how heavy a stone structure

241
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,083
of that size must be...

242
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,958
If they try to set it down,
even for a moment,

243
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,625
it will sink
into the surface.

244
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,083
Say, uh... If we let them turn
that thing into a sword,

245
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,083
that's bad news
for us, yeah?

246
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,791
Do you really think you stand
a chance against Kenshi?

247
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,083
Who do I look like,
Dagmyer...?

248
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,791
Just 'cause he's weak,
doesn't mean I am, too.

249
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
No, not again.

250
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,583
Oh, come on,
get up...

251
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,916
If you're going to sleep,
please do so in your room!

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,791
No, thank you...
I'll just stay here.

253
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
We never cease
to be amazed by him.

254
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,416
I think it's best we leave
Kenshi alone, Empress Lashara.

255
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,666
Why's that?

256
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,250
Wait, what are
you talking about?

257
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,291
I've heard in the previous war,
Sacred Mechamasters slept

258
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,291
on the ground upon reaching
their operational limit...

259
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,916
According to legend, it helped
them recover more quickly.

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,500
We've never heard
that story before.

261
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,708
It was an emergency measure
used only on the front lines...

262
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,000
Back then, the rotations
of the Sacred Mechamasters

263
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,041
were far worse than what
they are up against today.

264
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,333
All right...
Fine then...

265
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,625
This seems as good a place
as any to set up camp.

266
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,916
As you wish, Empress.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,333
Hey... What's the
game plan, Lan?

268
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,125
It's simple enough.

269
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,958
We wait for
the perfect moment.

270
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,791
Looks like
they're struggling.

271
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,875
The rock is definitely
getting smaller,

272
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,000
but the weight is going
to stay the same.

273
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,416
Even though they're taking
turns, they must be exhausted.

274
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,625
You should go and
get some more rest.

275
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,458
No, I'm fine.

276
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,541
You're not fine.
You need sleep.

277
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,541
Just focus
on compressing it.

278
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
But you're exhausted.

279
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,875
I'm okay... Can we hurry
it up though, please?

280
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,083
Looking good...

281
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,333
This was well
worth the wait...!

282
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,333
All right, guys,
let's move out!

283
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,083
They're much too slow.

284
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,125
This is no good.

285
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,833
Oh no!

286
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,875
Should we attack the ship?

287
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,208
No way, we're gonna get
an even bigger reward

288
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,708
if we can manage to take
that sword of theirs away!

289
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,416
Enemy crafts
approaching rapidly!

290
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,083
Kenshi!

291
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,625
Yukine! That's just a regular
Sacred Mechanoid, so be careful!

292
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,916
All right, boys,
let's do this!

293
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,333
Guys...!
Watch your backs!

294
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,958
Look out!

295
00:17:59,041 --> 00:17:59,750
No!

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,333
Like I thought... it takes
all the energy they've got

297
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,125
just to support the rock!

298
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,416
We're almost there!

299
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,875
Come on... Drop it
already, you jerks!?

300
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,875
It's Yukine!

301
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,458
Keep going...!
I'll take care of them!

302
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,916
No, you can't...

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,625
You're in no condition
to fight all on your own!

304
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,208
Wait, where are
the rest of them?!

305
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,125
On the way!

306
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,458
Great,
Sacred Mechanoids!

307
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,291
Don't waste time on her...!
Make them drop the boulder!

308
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,583
The Ena is thin!

309
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,916
Oh, you're just useless,
that's why you're a lowly RONIN!

310
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,791
Don't come near them!

311
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
Well, this should
be interesting.

312
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,583
I'm okay!

313
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,583
Yukine!

314
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,750
Kenshi...!
Hurry up!

315
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,750
They won't be able to
hold out for much longer!

316
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,833
We have to power
through this,

317
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,333
if they don't compress
it right now,

318
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,625
we won't get
another chance!

319
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,041
Yukine...
Just hang in there.

320
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,041
There are too many of them,
there's nothing I can do!

321
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,916
Reached your
operational limit?

322
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,666
Yukine! No!

323
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,583
I'm fine...! Don't stop,
we need that sword!

324
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,083
Attack!

325
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,500
You guys...!
Hang on!

326
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,208
Yukine?

327
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,000
This girl
doesn't give up.

328
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,250
It's no use!
Not at this rate!

329
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,791
Keep pushing on!

330
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,125
We can't.

331
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,041
Yes...
We need this sword...

332
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,250
Keep going!

333
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,916
We have to...
To defeat Gaia.

334
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,458
Yukine!

335
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,125
Finish them!

336
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,083
Go ahead and get it over
with, you wild beast!

337
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,708
Who's that?!

338
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,583
This can't be...!
Who are they?!

339
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,875
Awesome.

340
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,125
Amazing...
It's going to work.

341
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,333
Yes!

342
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,750
I was so close,
I could taste it.

343
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,708
Yukine...
Are you okay?

344
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,416
Yes, I'm all right...
I'm glad we made it.

345
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,958
All right, Kenshi!

346
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,583
Oh... Hey, you guys!

347
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,791
Long time
no see, Kenshi!

348
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,916
No, no, Gryno...
You call him Sir Kenshi now.

349
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,208
I'm glad to see
everyone is all right.

350
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,458
Principal!

351
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,291
These ladies insisted on
being there by your side

352
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,125
to fight with you.

353
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,583
Lady Lithia... Lapis.

354
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,125
If you'll let us, we will
follow wherever you go...

355
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,208
Sir Kenshi Masaki.

356
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,541
Why did you
come here, Uncle?

357
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,875
Is it to laugh at me?

358
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,166
Oh no... I imagine that you've
had your fill of that...

359
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,333
But in the end, you still want
to be a Sacred Mechamaster,

360
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,500
don't you?

361
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,041
Ends don't justify
the means...

362
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,333
In matters such as these,

363
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:08,000
the process will always
outweigh the outcome.

364
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,416
Yes, but-

365
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,958
I wanted to beat him
so badly... That's all.

366
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,458
But I have failed.

367
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,750
Don't worry, the Sacred
Mechalord will revive

368
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,833
soon enough.

369
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,458
Be proud...

370
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:30,583
Your original mission to buy us
time was a resounding success.

371
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:34,291
I see, so you're done with
me now, is that about right?

372
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,500
I have prepared the Sacred
Mechanoid I made for Doll...

373
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,083
Oh... I suppose I should
say I prepared a frame

374
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,958
that utilizes
Mechaworker technology.

375
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,541
I understand...

376
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,791
After all this, you want me
to go down with him, don't you?

377
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,333
Come on, don't you think

378
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,041
it's about time you got to do
what you wanted, my nephew?

379
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,708
Are you serious?

380
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,166
Wow.

381
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,958
I've never seen anything like
this before, it's amazing.

382
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,333
So hey, Wahanly...

383
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,041
Even though it's compressed,
the mass of the rock

384
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,500
is still the same, isn't it?

385
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,125
Yeah, of course it is!

386
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,458
That's awesome!

387
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,625
I can't believe that ring
can support its weight...

388
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,083
Even Hazuki
can get near it,

389
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:24,083
so obviously, the ring must
have a low output reactor.

390
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,916
Master Naua gave us a special
ring he found in the ruins.

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,416
If this was a normal one,
it would snap right in two.

392
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,083
Wait, that's the
original ring...?

393
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:34,375
I'm surprised he's letting
us use something like that.

394
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:37,333
Yeah, me too. Must be
a sign of the times.

395
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,625
Sorry for the wait...

396
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,333
So tell me,
what can I do for you?

397
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,708
Oh...! The walk-in
refrigerator's temperature

398
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:43,708
is going up.

399
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,375
Oh. How terrible.

400
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,500
My, my...

401
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,708
We've become quite
the party, haven't we?

402
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:17,958
Thank you for all your
help back there, Lapis...

403
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,041
You saved us.

404
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,416
Oh, well...

405
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,833
I didn't do much, but that's
very nice of you to say.

406
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,916
Without your help, we
wouldn't have succeeded.

407
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,625
It was an excellent battle...

408
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,958
And it showed great
leadership on your part.

409
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,541
Wow, Kenshi, you really are
full of surprises, aren't you?

410
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,791
First a Sacred Mechamaster and
now you're King of the SWAN!

411
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,000
We think you're
incredible!

412
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,666
It's true.

413
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,958
And now all of us get to work
together one more time.

414
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,583
I never dreamed
this would happen.

415
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,958
Yeah, don't you get it,

416
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,958
you're the reason everyone
has gathered here!

417
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,791
Hail, King Kenshi!

418
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,416
Uh.

419
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,375
Kenshi,
are you all right?

420
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,791
Yeah...
I'm fine...

421
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,500
It's really nothing.

422
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,666
We love you,
King Kenshi!

423
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,625
Sacred Mechamasters
from around the world

424
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:05,666
are coming to serve
Empress Lashara and Kenshi.

425
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,750
Although, I wasn't sure
if you were right...

426
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,791
you certainly called it.

427
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,291
His physique and mannerisms
are rather unique.

428
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:17,666
We may have just borne witness
to an historical moment, ladies.

429
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,208
I have no idea how you knew,
but I'm impressed.

430
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,375
Yes, I am too.

431
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,541
Are you sure you're
all right, Kenshi?

432
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,416
You really don't
look so good.

433
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,166
Yeah... I'm okay.

434
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,166
Yes, we understand...

435
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,291
Use the compressed bullets
to cross the highlands...

436
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,750
But still.

437
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,333
Only three of our knight
frames will be able

438
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,791
to make that trip...

439
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,833
If Doll shows her face,
Kenshi will have no choice

440
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,208
but to fight her...

441
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,708
And that will leave us only
two frames to ward off

442
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,125
the rest of the enemy's
main forces...

443
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,500
With odds like that, there's
no guarantee we can prevent

444
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,125
the Sacred
Mechalord's revival.

445
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,291
Our odds will increase
if we take them by surprise.

446
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,833
But Rea...
No...

447
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,916
Neizai can see
right through us...

448
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,500
Don't discount her yet.
She's still a major problem.

449
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,333
Even so, of all our options,

450
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,000
this one seems
most likely to succeed.

451
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,500
The question now is how
quickly can our main forces

452
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,916
break through
the enemy's defenses,

453
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,916
complete their mission,
and regroup with us.

454
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,958
Oh yeah...
There's that.

455
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,291
What's the matter,
Empress?

456
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,916
Is there something
bothering you?

457
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,250
Oh my goodness!
King Kenshi! Are you okay?

458
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,916
What's going
on down there?!

459
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,291
Is that Kenshi?!

460
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,416
It's a fever,
he's burning up!

461
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I wouldn't worry, it's probably
brought on by exhaustion...

462
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,041
He just needs to rest.

463
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,083
Poor guy.

464
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,625
It's hardly surprising.

465
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:54,291
Since we fled the Holy Land,
he's not had a moment's rest.

466
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,750
Then to top everything off,

467
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,833
he had to compress that
huge monolith all by himself.

468
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,583
Weird...

469
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,666
I feel like I've been
in this position before.

470
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,333
Wipe that creepy smile off
your face and get some sleep!

471
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,583
Oh no, the fever's
made him delusional!

472
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,083
Ladies, please
try to keep it down

473
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,791
when you're sitting
by a sick boy's bed.

474
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,708
We're not
kidding around...

475
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,875
You need to rest.

476
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,666
Time to go, Yukine.

477
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,875
Keep an eye on him and let
us know if you need anything.

478
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,583
I will.

479
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,083
That Ulyte jerk is a
slave driver, isn't he?!

480
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:54,708
It is what it is, so stop
complaining and keep working!

481
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:58,416
We failed our mission.
We deserve it!

482
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,958
You'll get another chance...

483
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,666
We're transferring to
the front line of defense.

484
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,125
Ulyte. I take it
everything is in order.

485
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,166
Yes, brother,
of course it is.

486
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,541
The bandits
used Mechaworkers

487
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,583
to tear apart Havoniwa's
railway system...

488
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,708
Their route to the
highlands is now cut off.

489
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,541
My concern at this
point is the ability

490
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:29,083
of their Sacred Mechanoids to
function outside of Ena's draft.

491
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,666
Right. There's good
news on that front.

492
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,833
Compressed bullets are their
current energy source,

493
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,833
and even if they had a whole
arsenal of Mechanoids,

494
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,250
they would barely
have enough power

495
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,791
to successfully send three
of them across the border.

496
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:40,750
Although...

497
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,416
It would be enough energy

498
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,708
to send Kenshi's White
Sacred Mechanoid through.

499
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,833
And?

500
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,833
Both its operational
time and capabilities

501
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:52,041
outside of the Ena Ocean
have improved significantly...

502
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,708
With the Black Sacred
Mechalord inoperable,

503
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,125
he has the power
to obliterate us.

504
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,166
Then all I need to do
is turn their ray of hope

505
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,750
into fear and despair.

506
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,208
I'm really worried
about Kenshi.

507
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,750
I hope he
gets better soon.

508
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,916
Yeah, me too.

509
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,666
Looks like
your fever's down.

510
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,041
How did you manage
to get in here...?

511
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,750
Did anybody
see you come in?

512
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:52,208
Habits don't usually change
and they're no exception.

513
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,958
Sneaking in was even easier
than I thought it would be.

514
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,708
So what, have you
come back for good?

515
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,458
No... But I have something
I would like to tell you.

516
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,250
Okay, but you'd
better hurry.

517
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,750
Of course...

518
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,041
I went to the Barrier
Workshop to learn something...

519
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:09,125
Something only my father
would be able to confirm.

520
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,708
And I was right...
Everything I thought was true.

521
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,541
Tell me, Father.

522
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,791
During the age of the
ancient civilization,

523
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,833
the artificial beings created
to defeat the Sacred Mechalord

524
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,708
possessed such
advanced faux bodies

525
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:33,958
that they were fully capable of
procreating with actual beings.

526
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,250
Naturally...

527
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,833
This wasn't exclusive
to beings from our world.

528
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:41,750
There was a possibility that if
one bred with an other worlder,

529
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,208
the child of mixed blood
would end up stronger

530
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,583
than both parents...

531
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,958
Though unions such as these
never actually happened,

532
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,583
and these mixed
children didn't exist.

533
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,333
The Gaias were fierce...

534
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,291
And they attacked
other worlds...

535
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,625
Any beings that could
pilot a Sacred Mechanoid

536
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,750
were always the
primary targets.

537
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,791
The timeframe for summoning
did not fall in that dark era...

538
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:11,125
As a result, they were unable
to summon more other worlders.

539
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,541
But... Inversely,
they did have the ability

540
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,458
to send their own kind
to other worlds...

541
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:17,208
As such, the only
safe option

542
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,458
was to send an artificial
being in their place...

543
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,500
The being would procreate
and then after some time

544
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,583
had gone by, they would
summon the child back.

545
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,333
And so you were created and
sent here from another world.

546
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,125
No... that can't be true.

547
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,833
The way the Sacred
Mechanoid reacted to you...

548
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:38,583
The incredible
powers you possess...

549
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,208
The simple fact that,
even now, I am still unable

550
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,666
to attack you is all
the proof you need, Kenshi.

551
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,625
But how come you
can't attack me?

552
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,833
An artificial being's unique
biowaves cannot be bred out...

553
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,500
We have no choice
in the matter.

554
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,833
Don't you see...?

555
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,541
We are programmed
not to attack anyone

556
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,166
who emits those waves...

557
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,458
That's not all...

558
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,708
This fever and the
fatigue you're feeling.

559
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:08,375
It doesn't have anything
to do with me...

560
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,541
And it has nothing to do with
your resistance to harming me.

561
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,166
Yes... You and I
are the same...

562
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,458
In this whole world, there's
no one else like you and me.

563
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,791
Strange, isn't it?

564
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,666
It's Babalun!

565
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,083
Wait, what are you doing?

566
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,791
I'll admit, I was
concerned about you...

567
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,583
But once you're
properly disposed of,

568
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,833
there'll be no one
left to defy me.

569
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:40,916
Slave...

570
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,375
Accept my orders or die!

571
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,208
So... What are
we gonna do now?

572
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,750
Wait, what are
you talking about?

573
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,583
She means, if the
worst comes to pass,

574
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:52,833
how are we
going to fight them

575
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,375
without the Wild
Beast in our corner?

576
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,833
We're not fighting!

577
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,041
Well, we can't
just do nothing... Can we?

578
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,875
Oh Aura, not you, too.

579
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,458
He is from another world.

580
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,625
In the end, the outcome of
this war is our burden to bear

581
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,500
and no one else's,
especially his.

582
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,000
She's right...

583
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,666
This is something the
citizens of our planet

584
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,791
should fight to resolve.

585
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:15,458
We can't just
rely on Kenshi...

586
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:19,500
But one fact still remains.
He is the only chance we have.

587
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,083
It sure is
pathetic, isn't it?

588
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,291
Mother, it's you!

589
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,666
And my father, too?

590
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,833
We weren't so foolish

591
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,666
as to think you two
would not show up...

592
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,000
But we did not
expect you so soon.

593
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,500
And I'm happy to see
you as well, Lashara...

594
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,791
I just got word that my future
son declared his independence.

595
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,958
No... He isn't
your future son,

596
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,625
he is my daughter's
future step-father.

597
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,791
Mother, will you stop?

598
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,666
Your radical notion
has left that

599
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,166
daughter of yours speechless...

600
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,833
Although, it's really
not an awful idea.

601
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:58,833
But, Father!

602
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,250
Well, well.

603
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,958
Now they both seem
to be in complete

604
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,458
and utter bewilderment,
don't they?!

605
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,875
If they're thinking what we're
fairly certain they're thinking,

606
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,833
any reasonable being
would be in shock.

607
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,541
So that's why you're here...

608
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,708
To poke fun and mock
us to our faces.

609
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,750
On the contrary,
we'd like to demonstrate

610
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,375
how mature we both can be.

611
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,791
I'll never obey you!

612
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,541
There's simply no point in
you resisting any further...

613
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,375
You were made to
follow orders...

614
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,916
It's the only
reason you exist...

615
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,291
Give in to your true
nature and bow down...

616
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,000
Become what you
were destined to be!

617
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,166
Shut up!

618
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,958
I don't care
why I'm here...

619
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,250
or why I exist...
I'm me...

620
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,708
And I have a will
that's my own...!

621
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,875
I'll die before I follow
your orders, understand?!

622
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,791
'A will', you say?

623
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,375
Even when that 'will' is nothing
more than a fabrication...?

624
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,583
Does a newborn
babe have free will...?

625
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,250
One's opinion changes
depending on the expectations

626
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,916
set before them...

627
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,875
By opposing me, you are only
meeting Lashara's expectations,

628
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,250
are you not?

629
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,583
But there were others
who planted the expectation

630
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,916
of 'submission'
deep in your heart...

631
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,375
And that, Slave, will
turn you into my doll.

632
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:23,166
There's nothing you can do
in a battle against your fate!

633
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,916
Yes. There is!

634
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,166
Even if someone planned
this whole thing out...

635
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,333
Every choice I made, every
action I took in my life...

636
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,208
Those things were done
'cause I chose to do them!

637
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,708
You wretched doll.

638
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,625
I am not your doll...!
I'm Kenshi...!

639
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,083
And I don't
believe in fate!

640
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,458
Impossible...!
You cannot defy me!

641
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:52,625
You little brat!

642
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,500
Doll...!
Destroy the SWAN!

643
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,875
I'll check on him!

644
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,083
I must say, I'm constantly
impressed by the stunts

645
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,916
you're able
to pull off...

646
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yet...

647
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,000
Hey, what happened?!

648
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,375
Mexiah!

649
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,833
Chiaia,
is something wrong?!

650
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,791
Your sister.

651
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,750
Bye.

652
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,375
Chiaia, wait!

653
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:33,958
What is going on?!

654
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,833
There's an abnormal
mass inside the hangar!

655
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:38,416
Wait, what do you
mean 'abnormal?'

656
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,291
The Tenchi sword!

657
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,708
Its anti-gravity
ring's broken!

658
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,916
Oh no!
That is not good...

659
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,125
You know what
this means, right?

660
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,041
Oh, please tell me
this isn't happening.

661
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,291
No, don't go!

662
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,625
Empress!
We're crashing!

663
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,625
The weight of the
sword is just too much!

664
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,500
We're going down, fast!

665
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,958
Maximize our output now!

666
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,041
If we don't do something
about the Tenchi sword quick,

667
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,166
the SWAN's doomed!

668
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,791
Yukine, I want
you to help her!

669
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,208
Right!

670
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,958
Where's Lapis...
Is she okay?

671
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,666
Yes... We had just
put her to bed.

672
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,500
What about you...? Are you
sure you're all right, Kenshi?

673
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,875
Yeah... I think most of
the numbness is gone now.

674
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,791
I'm good to go!

675
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,916
What's taking
Wahan so long?!

676
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,083
No use!
We're falling!

677
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,625
It's over!

678
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,541
Something stopped it.

679
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,583
Why didn't we crash?

680
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,875
Excellent catch.

681
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,458
This is the awesome power
of his new knight frame!

682
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:47,875
It's so incredible...!

683
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:52,500
We should be calling
it a Sacred Mechalord!

684
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,750
Curse you...! How dare
you not submit...?!

685
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,333
Very well...

686
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:01,875
Then I have no choice but to
crush you with my own two hands!

687
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,125
You'll see, the real
Sacred Mechalord

688
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:06,791
will awaken soon enough!

689
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,125
Now then...
Let's stick to the plan.

690
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,333
Right.

691
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,625
We're all counting
on you, my dear Kenshi.

692
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,208
Don't worry, son.
You'll do fine.

693
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,000
Thank you.

694
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,791
Well, goodbye for now.
I'll see you soon.

695
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,458
Please be careful...
And keep an eye on her, Yukine.

696
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,958
I'm happy to.

697
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,000
Father...
Best of luck.

698
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,083
Remain true
to your husband.

699
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,750
I will.

700
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,333
Let's go.

701
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,500
Right!

702
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,041
Havoniwa and
Shurifon's armies

703
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,875
are gathering around the
checkpoint as we speak...

704
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,750
Our time has come.

705
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,750
Indeed.

706
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,750
At last it's time
for the final battle!

707
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,416
We take it you are ready!

708
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,750
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

709
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:14,916
"Gaia."

710
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,375
If we win this war,
there is bound

711
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,791
to be a flood of girls
dying to marry you.

712
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:21,583
You ready for that?!
We sure do hope so!
