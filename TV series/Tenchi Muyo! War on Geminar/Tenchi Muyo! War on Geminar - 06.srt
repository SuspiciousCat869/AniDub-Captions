1
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,333
Output...

2
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,833
Eighteen percent...

3
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,416
Nineteen percent.

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,625
Twenty...

5
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,875
Twenty one.

6
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,166
You barely broke
twenty percent...

7
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,583
It's the exact
same as last time.

8
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,333
I wasn't finished yet!

9
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,541
I would like to commend you
on your admirable diligence.

10
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,541
But then again, you were
born with that talent,

11
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,916
weren't you nephew?

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,083
No, that isn't true at all!

13
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,083
Come, don't be foolish,
Sir Sacred Mechamaster...

14
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,791
Of course it is...

15
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:18,916
Besides, only the chosen one
may pilot the Sacred Mechalord.

16
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,958
I suppose you believe that
girl is better than me...

17
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,041
She's not!

18
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,958
Although some may
consider it 'noble,'

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,958
especially for a
Sacred Mechamaster,...

20
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,833
you can trust me,
going up against someone

21
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,250
stronger than you
is as reckless as it gets.

22
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,000
If you don't intend
to succeed the throne,

23
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,041
I want you
to tell me now.

24
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,875
You came here
to admonish me.

25
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,166
But there are better
ways to go about it.

26
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,041
Summer is almost here...

27
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,750
You're still a student,
why don't you enjoy

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,625
a little bit of freedom
while you have the chance?

29
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,791
Ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,750
Normally underclassmen are
forbidden to leave campus,

31
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,458
even during
summer vacation.

32
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,083
However, those with
legitimate reasons

33
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,208
may receive
special permission.

34
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,916
So if you haven't
submitted your request yet,

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,208
if I were you,
I'd hop to it.

36
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,500
Summer vacation, wow.

37
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:21,416
That'll be the perfect time
to go after SWAN's crystals-

38
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,041
Oh hey, Ceres, what's up?
What're you reading?

39
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,958
Oh, well I was just thinking
about going on a trip

40
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,666
by myself
for summer vacation.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,083
Yeah, but...

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,875
Aren't you're an
underclassman?

43
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,916
Male Sacred Mechamasters
are exempt from that rule.

44
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,000
A one-man trip sounds like
it would be a lotta fun!

45
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,500
Yeah, I'm pretty
excited about it.

46
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,625
Summer vacation.

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,250
What are you going to do with
your time, Empress Lashara?

48
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,250
We'll sit back and
relax all summer long.

49
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,583
Huh?

50
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,625
It's dangerous out
there, and besides,

51
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,000
we don't intend to waste
money on a vacation...

52
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,875
But don't let us stop
you; do as you wish.

53
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,083
But I can't leave
you, Empress.

54
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,625
I'm your bodyguard!

55
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,166
Oh no, that won't
be necessary.

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,458
After all...

57
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,458
summer vacation is meant
to encourage friendship

58
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,750
amongst the students.

59
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,708
And Kenshi is capable
of protecting us.

60
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,875
If anything I'm worried you're
just going to sit around

61
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,625
while he does whatever
he feels like!

62
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,458
Pardon me.

63
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,041
Take this.

64
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,375
Wow!

65
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,208
Honestly now.

66
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,750
How long are you
going to sit out here

67
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,291
like a little baby and pout...?

68
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,166
Take Kenshi,
for example...

69
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,541
He's having a wonderful time.

70
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,083
Of course he's having
a wonderful time,

71
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,458
he wanted to come.

72
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,583
We were dragged here
kicking and screaming.

73
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,250
Please don't act
so distant, Lashara.

74
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,666
I'm your aunt.

75
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,750
You should feel welcome
to ask for my help anytime.

76
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,958
We would rather meet Babalun
on the field of battle

77
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,000
and die heroically than
ask for your assistance!

78
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,416
We have so much
catching up to do...

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,208
Please, come and spend your
summer vacation with me...

80
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,791
If you tell me 'no' my
heart will break in two...

81
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't let money
be a concern,

82
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,250
I'll obviously
take care of everything.

83
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,166
It looks like Aunt Flora
can read the Empress

84
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,750
like an open book, too.

85
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,375
Lady Lithia, Wahanly,
and Sir Dagmyer.

86
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,375
She certainly pulled some
strings for us, didn't she?

87
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,833
You're more than welcome
to bring that attendant boy...

88
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,750
I look forward to seeing
you all very soon!

89
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,500
So, in other words, she really
only wants to see Kenshi.

90
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,375
Oh, I almost forgot!

91
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,458
If you decide to be obstinate
and refuse my generous offer,

92
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,708
I'll be forced to tell your
friends embarrassing stories

93
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,791
about when you were little.

94
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,250
And to show them
this picture!

95
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,958
This is why we
can't stand her!

96
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,041
Since you made it this far.

97
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,333
You might as well try
to enjoy yourself at least.

98
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,958
Then please, just do
us a favor and go away.

99
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:04,750
[Music]

100
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,791
Those ships are huge!

101
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
They're part of a
transport service,

102
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,333
delivering guests to
and from resorts.

103
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,708
But to prevent potential
accidents in the ravine,

104
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,416
they only travel
one direction.

105
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,166
Wow.

106
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,708
Hey wait...

107
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,750
He's gone...

108
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,083
Oh yeah!

109
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,125
Oh, there he is.

110
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,416
Thanks, Cordyline.

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,833
I've set things up so you
can spend some alone time

112
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,083
without worrying that the guards
will discover your villa.

113
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,000
That means all we have
to do now is get Hazuki

114
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,625
through the gate undetected.

115
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,208
Oh, it won't be a problem...

116
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,791
I've got you covered
on that, too. Now,..

117
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,750
What are they
talking about?

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,041
They're everywhere!

119
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,166
Are you sure about this...?
If they find us out,

120
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,708
you could get in a
whole lot of trouble.

121
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,666
Look, don't worry about me...

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,500
Just promise me this much...

123
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,541
If for some reason we
actually do get caught,

124
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,541
you have to tell them I forced
you to come here, okay?

125
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,083
Kenshi!

126
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,375
It's extremely rare, but
sometimes even mere commoners

127
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,000
are born with an unusually
strong resistance to aho energy.

128
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,333
So, I guess you don't
come from royalty then.

129
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,916
For someone like me, becoming
a 'Sacred Mechamaster'

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,875
means joining a
privileged class...

131
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,250
Everyone always told
me how lucky I was.

132
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,208
But then.

133
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,750
Somewhere down the line, things
started to get warped...

134
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,541
Having money and expensive
things changed my parents...

135
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,500
It changed everybody.

136
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,750
We both knew what it meant when
I became a Sacred Mechamaster...

137
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,791
And we were gonna
stick together...

138
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,250
But of course...

139
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,125
Everyone says the most
horrible things

140
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,833
to try to weaken our
resolve and break us up.

141
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,000
Like Hazuki's only
after my bloodline.

142
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,041
His parents don't
come out and say it,

143
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,500
but I know it's exactly
what they're thinking...

144
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,125
it's not true...

145
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,166
I love him.

146
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,583
Ceres, what's this gate
you were talking about?

147
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,291
It's a ritzy resort so it'll
be really hard to sneak her in

148
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
without getting caught...

149
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,291
We can't let them
see her by my side,

150
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,250
because Hazuki is forbidden
to be anywhere near me.

151
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,458
So promise us...

152
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,833
You can't repeat anything
you heard in here!

153
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,208
I promise you.

154
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,083
In this life, you have to use
force to get what you want.

155
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,000
What a little wimp.

156
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,458
There're two Sacred
Mechanoids...

157
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,958
Oh, man...
This is no good.

158
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,458
You know anything
worth hijacking

159
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,666
is always heavily guarded.

160
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,333
Yeah, I guess that's true.

161
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
The scarier the heist...

162
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,166
The greater the
rewards will be.

163
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,125
The guy who just came out;
do you know who he is?

164
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,041
No, I don't think
I recognize him.

165
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,833
Well, he seems a
little fishy to me.

166
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,708
Don't worry, he's
just some dumb kid.

167
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,625
Hold it!
Look to the right!

168
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,750
I'd bet money that's
Dagmyer Mest...

169
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,041
That one's a gem!

170
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,166
It's another male
Sacred Mechamaster...

171
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,125
This must be
our lucky day.

172
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,416
Wow!

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,000
In ancient times, plants like
those allegedly covered

174
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,833
the entire planet.

175
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,458
But due to drastic
climate changes

176
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:42,083
and the impact of advancing
civilizations, most died off.

177
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,875
This is one of the rare
parts of the world

178
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,208
where they're still
holding strong.

179
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,416
So cool.

180
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,166
Yes, it's truly astonishing.

181
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,083
It's been a long journey,
but I promise,

182
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,458
we'll be there
before you know it.

183
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,791
Maria, do those gigantic flags
mean what we think they mean?

184
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,958
I'm afraid your educated
guess is probably accurate.

185
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,208
It's your mother!

186
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,208
Yeah...! Woo...!
Hello there!

187
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,250
Stop it; you're
embarrassing yourself!

188
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,833
I'm just happy we
made it safely.

189
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,250
Hey Kenshi... Would you mind
helping me situate the cargo?

190
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,750
Listen everyone...

191
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,458
I know you must be tired
from your long journey...

192
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,833
So once you've found your rooms,
feel free to take a nap

193
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,291
and relax until dinnertime.

194
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,208
Or, have a look around
and take in the sights.

195
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,500
Hold on.

196
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,416
Unless I'm mistaken,
one of you is missing...

197
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,666
Correct?

198
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,916
Kenshi is occupied
at the moment...

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,708
We hate to disappoint, but
he is currently helping

200
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,916
Wahan with our cargo...

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,916
So sorry.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,416
Oh my, that's too bad...

203
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,958
I'm dying to see the boy Maria
and Yukine are so fond of.

204
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,541
Almost forgot to ask,
have you seen Ceres?

205
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,125
Uh... Well...

206
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,375
I mean, uh- I wonder if he's
off on some secret getaway?

207
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,458
So I was right then...

208
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,333
Commoners who become Sacred
Mechamasters get torn away

209
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,916
from their lovers and
childhood friends all the time.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's really sad...
dontcha think?

211
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,333
Hey, Wahanly, about Ceres...
please don't tell any-

212
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,375
Job well done!

213
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,583
Tell the truth,
whaddaya think?

214
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,625
Well... It sure
seems a lot faster.

215
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,541
And don't worry, I'll pretend
I didn't see or hear anything

216
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,583
about Ceres, I promise.

217
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,916
You mean it?

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,291
Thanks a lot!

219
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,958
I gotta go!

220
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,375
Every day I'm glad
I'm not a boy.

221
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,625
So that was Kenshi.

222
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,416
Well, he certainly is
something else, isn't he?

223
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,750
Long time no see Queen Flora!

224
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,083
You really didn't have to
come all the way down here.

225
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,916
I was just on my way
upstairs to see you!

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,291
He's quite the charming one.

227
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,166
I can see why Maria and
Yukine have developed

228
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,833
such a fondness for him.

229
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,250
I suppose the same
goes for you, too.

230
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,250
By the way,
Queen Flora...

231
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,250
Just how much of our
conversation did you...

232
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,083
Overhear?

233
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,958
Oh, there's no need
for you to worry at all,

234
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,500
a friend of Kenshi's
is a friend of mine.

235
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,708
Now, let's get work out of the
way so we can enjoy this trip.

236
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,875
I just love summer
vacation, don't you?

237
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,000
Ah, now I get it...

238
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,291
Looks like Ceres is
staying over there.

239
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,875
All right!

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,625
Little brat!

241
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,541
Hey, I'm sorry!

242
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,916
Wait... I think that's the kid
Lan was interested in.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,916
Oh yeah, well, I think
Lan is outta touch!

244
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,250
I'm pretty sure I just smelled
blood on those two guys.

245
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,541
Yeah...

246
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,875
I found another mushroom!

247
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,166
I can't believe this.

248
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,458
She's very well made.

249
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,416
Powerful, sturdy, and she
doesn't make me feel sick,

250
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,083
not one bit.

251
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,708
It can stand up against a high
ranking associate Mechamaster,

252
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,708
even if she's piloting
a Sacred Mechanoid.

253
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,666
How long will it
stay operational

254
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,708
outside of the draft?

255
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,791
My calculations
say ten minutes.

256
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,541
It's wonderful,
and I should've expected

257
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
nothing less
from Naua's pupil.

258
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,083
Thank you very much!

259
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,458
Now then. Let's
go join the others.

260
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,625
Spending some quality time
with Kenshi is the other thing

261
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,708
I'm looking forward to.

262
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,458
Oh, wow, so this is the
villa Ceres is staying in?

263
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,916
It's amazing.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,291
Is that them...?

265
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,083
Ceres needs to get
some curtains.

266
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,041
Those two could probably
use some time alone,

267
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,041
so I'll come back later.

268
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,250
Any idea what this is?

269
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,916
The traditional Havoniwa
welcoming ceremony.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,208
Welcoming ceremony?

271
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,750
It looks more like a
pillow fight set up.

272
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,291
So you've heard of it then?

273
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,166
Welcome all!

274
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,208
I'd like to thank everyone for
traveling so far to be here

275
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,083
on this fine summer night.

276
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,541
Never fear, I've prepared a
more than modest party

277
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,291
for your entertainment
and enjoyment.

278
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,458
But first!

279
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,916
As is our tradition,

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,250
we will now hold
the welcoming ceremony...

281
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,333
Remember, in this
fierce game of pillows,

282
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,041
every single one of us
stands here as equals,

283
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,500
ready to battle...

284
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,625
The rules are simple:

285
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,791
dodge pillows and
throw them at others!

286
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,041
Then just grab your opponents'
sash and give it a pull.

287
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,250
If someone manages to steal
your sash, you are disqualified.

288
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,375
And for the record, it is
considered good manners

289
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,916
to say a certain phrase before
you pull someone's sash...

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,041
Kenshi...
What's wrong?

291
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,291
The phrase... It isn't
'ready or not', is it?

292
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,083
We did not expect you
to know this game.

293
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,625
Those guys really did do
just whatever they wanted.

294
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,958
And the last person
standing gets to marry

295
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,375
whomever their heart desires,

296
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,875
or receive comparable
prizes in money or goods!

297
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,416
And that's not all you'll get.

298
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
The winner will also
receive a hug and a kiss...!

299
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh yes...!
All from yours truly!

300
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,458
Full disclosure.

301
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,250
I'm really hoping Sir
Dagmyer or Kenshi wins!

302
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,875
Now we finally see
what she is up to.

303
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,875
I just cannot
believe that woman.

304
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,666
Well, everyone, this is the
perfect chance to get out there

305
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,375
and blow off some steam!

306
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,375
Now let's begin!

307
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,791
This is ridiculous.

308
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,208
Dagmyer,
are you okay...?

309
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,750
I'm so-

310
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,000
We're equals.
We're equals.

311
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,416
We're equals.
We're equals!

312
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,333
Now we understand why Chiaia's
been so happy on this trip!

313
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,000
Come, Lashara...

314
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,083
Let's you and I put an end
to this once and for all.

315
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,458
Huh?

316
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,791
You're going down!

317
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh my dears...

318
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,208
You dare to defy
me, do you...?

319
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,500
Both of you are so naughty.

320
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,750
Just what we'd expect from
an old hag like her,

321
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,416
she saw right
through our plan!

322
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,041
It appears that the benefits
of age are not wasted on her!

323
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,500
I think a punishment
is in order, ladies.

324
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,500
The right to marry who
I please is tempting.

325
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,875
But not as tempting as
research funds...!

326
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,875
More money...! I know
just what to do.

327
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,750
You can't use your
mechaworker, Wahan.

328
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,250
Kenshi...

329
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,250
Oh.

330
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,833
So sorry.

331
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,916
Hate to be a jerk,
but I've gotta win

332
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,166
so I can get back
to my world...! Okay!

333
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,041
Aim for victory!

334
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,791
Attack from both sides!

335
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,375
Will do!

336
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,625
What?!

337
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,250
Aura, your underwear...

338
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,708
It's gone.

339
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,958
I was told it's customary
not to wear panties, so...

340
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,000
No!

341
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,666
I got him!

342
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,875
Take this!

343
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,833
But how did he-

344
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,375
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

345
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,250
Lady Lithia, Princess
Aura, please forgive me.

346
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,833
You wild animal,
I'll make you pay for sneaking

347
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,250
a peek like that!

348
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,541
He defeated us soundly.

349
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,791
Oh please...

350
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,541
don't wake up.

351
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:19,166
Chiaia... I'm sorry.

352
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,583
I am so sorry!

353
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,916
Don't worry about it,

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,208
besides, we used to bathe
together, remember?

355
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,041
There's no point in
suddenly acting modest.

356
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,583
It's different now that
we're not children!

357
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,916
No, it's the same...

358
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,291
We're both Sacred
Mechamasters, aren't we?

359
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,875
I can't believe a stupid
pillow knocked me out...

360
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,500
How embarrassing.

361
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,375
Wait! Dagmyer!

362
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,166
You beat me...

363
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,625
No matter how much time
passes, it seems I can't win.

364
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,041
Don't worry,
I've almost got it off.

365
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,333
Hey Yukine, I haven't
stolen your sash yet,

366
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,625
so you're still
in the game!

367
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,208
You can fight back,
or kick and scream;

368
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,958
just try to do
something, okay?

369
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,083
Oh, I don't mind losing...
Not to you.

370
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,041
Oh, my dear Yukine...

371
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:19,041
Do you realize the position
you currently find yourself in?

372
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,875
Where did you
come from?

373
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,625
I got ya.

374
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,250
Go on!

375
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,208
Aw, you poor thing.

376
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,208
Now then.

377
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,000
It would appear that you and I
are the last ones standing...

378
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,083
I have to admit,
I'm truly impressed

379
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,166
you managed to make
it this far, Kenshi.

380
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,416
Does Kenshi even
stand a chance?

381
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,708
He may be tough...

382
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,041
But Queen Flora once won a
Holy Land tournament

383
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,750
and was crowned a master
martial artist.

384
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,833
She will destroy him.

385
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,000
Well...
We have a winner!

386
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:05,000
Put your hands together
for our victor, Kenshi!

387
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,958
Hold on, what do you
mean he's the winner?!

388
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,916
I'm the host, not a competitor
in the game, so he wins!

389
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,375
Wait! Doesn't that negate
our disqualification?

390
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,125
Well, obviously, I had to
crush any potential threats.

391
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,375
I'm very tired.

392
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,916
Huh?

393
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,458
Once again, she's humiliated
us with her evil scheming.

394
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,666
It's a minor miracle Mexiah
isn't here to make things worse.

395
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, the two
of them together

396
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,291
would be more than
we could possibly handle.

397
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,375
Is something wrong?

398
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,041
We just thought of
a brilliant idea.

399
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,666
Kenshi?

400
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,208
Sorry! I wasn't swimming!

401
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,833
I didn't just hit my head
because I was swimming around!

402
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:10,500
Please, you can swim in
my tub anytime you want.

403
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,958
Uh, hello, Queen Flora.
What are you doing here?

404
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,666
Why I'm here to give
you a bath, of course.

405
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,750
You're a Queen,
you can't do that!

406
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,166
It is exactly what
you expected, Lashara.

407
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,708
Yes, that's it, Kenshi.

408
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,250
Give that old bag
a hot massage.

409
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,166
Come on!

410
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,625
Kenshi's incredible massage

411
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,041
is going to paralyze
you completely!

412
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,791
Trust me, you have no idea
what's in store for you, mother!

413
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,625
And once your body
is incapacitated...

414
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,625
You'll pay for
what you've done!

415
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, that would
be a travesty...

416
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,416
We can't have that...

417
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,541
Not if I can help it!

418
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,416
Wow, Mom, baby-sitting those
kids must be a pain in the ass.

419
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,958
Oh, Lan...

420
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,541
Not nearly as much
of one as you are.

421
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,083
Fine.

422
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,833
I'll go tuck myself in.

423
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,208
We make our move against
Ceres and Dagmyer

424
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,500
first thing
tomorrow morning.

425
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,500
So make sure you
don't sleep in.

426
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,416
No... Ceres!

427
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,291
We're finished.

428
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,291
It would seem our plan
to get back at mother

429
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,875
has severely backfired.

430
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,875
I don't understand, how could
my mother be so scandalous?

431
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,541
It doesn't surprise
us all that much...

432
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,833
According to the principal, lots
of girls have been requesting

433
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,958
he give them massages
on their wedding nights.

434
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,791
But they couldn't actually
be happy after that,

435
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,041
knowing their Mechamaster
husband would never be able

436
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,833
to give them
anything close to it.

437
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,125
Too bad... It really
is such a waste.

438
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,208
This place is great...!

439
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,083
There're so many herbs
and fresh plants!

440
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,375
I never liked having
to work for it!

441
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,625
She's kinda pretty.

442
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:12,250
Too bad...
don't you think?

443
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,166
We'll be getting
the sign real soon.

444
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,708
If you wanna play, get
yourself a different girlie.

445
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,875
What are you, kid?
Some kinda monster!

446
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:39,458
We have to get
back right now!

447
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,000
Cordyline is the ringleader
of a gang of bandits...!

448
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,875
Everyone at Ceres' villa...

449
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,541
They're about to
attack the resort!

450
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,250
Is Ceres still around?!

451
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,458
He gave himself up
so I could get away...!

452
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:50,833
Kenshi, we have
to rescue them.

453
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:54,166
All of your friends
are in danger!

454
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,333
What is that?

455
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,083
I think it must be
the bandits' signal...

456
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,833
Don't worry,
I'll be okay here,

457
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,250
just please hurry
and go on ahead!

458
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,875
Hey, how 'bout we
take a short cut?!

459
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,791
Empress, you aren't
hurt, are you?

460
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,166
Hey...! What in the
world's going on here?!

461
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,708
What's all this about?!

462
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,500
Everyone just remain calm.

463
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,083
We're under attack by a gang
of six air bikers, ma'am...

464
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,083
We don't know who they are yet,
but there's no need to worry;

465
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,666
our interception
system is blocking them.

466
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,083
I've got bad news...! They
broke into the guard post...

467
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,416
And it looks like
they've hijacked

468
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,750
one of our
Sacred Mechanoids!

469
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,291
That can't be!

470
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,916
Great... Well, get ready,
because it's coming our way.

471
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,708
Part of the interception
system has been destroyed;

472
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,875
we're wide open now!

473
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,583
There must be
something we can do...

474
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,708
Come on... Maria, do you have
any other Sacred Mechanoids...?

475
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,250
Like a brand
new model hidden

476
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,041
in the basement or
something of that nature?

477
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,083
This is a resort.
Of course, we don't.

478
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,541
Why would we keep
secret Mechanoids here?!

479
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:21,291
I don't know! Maybe because
of situations like this?!

480
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,041
Now what?

481
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,500
Hey...
I hit the jackpot!

482
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,875
Stop right there...!

483
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,500
Drop your weapons, put your
hands behind your heads,

484
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:36,458
and lay down face
first or I'll shoot!

485
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,333
We should do
as he says.

486
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,166
What the-

487
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:49,833
Kenshi!

488
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,041
That's one unlucky dude.

489
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,625
Kenshi,
who is that girl?

490
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,583
This is Hazuki...
Oh yeah!

491
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,250
And I'm pretty sure that gang
of bandits is after Sir Dagmyer!

492
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,291
Wait, what?!

493
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,041
Dagmyer!

494
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,125
Yukine, follow her!

495
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,250
Everybody is here except
for- Aura's missing...

496
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,666
And your mother is, too.

497
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,416
Perhaps you should have the
wild beast retrieve them.

498
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,541
Right...
But find Aura first...

499
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,333
Yes...
Then our Aunt.

500
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,125
If you don't find
Queen Flora in time,

501
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,500
we're willing to abandon her.

502
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:28,208
I'll look after the girl...
Now get a move on!

503
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,583
If you go now you might
see something amusing.

504
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,791
Wait, 'amusing?'

505
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,166
Hurry up!

506
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,333
Right!

507
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,000
Hey...
I'll hop on this...

508
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,750
Maybe I can find
out what's goin' on!

509
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,458
Please, just don't
do anything rash!

510
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,625
Relax!
I'll be fine!

511
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,375
It doesn't know
good from bad!

512
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:59,916
Aura, it's Kenshi,
I'm coming in!

513
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,041
Thank goodness...
You're okay.

514
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,500
Princess Aura?

515
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,250
Kenshi.

516
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,875
Hey, is everything all right?

517
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,541
I'm sorry I'm behaving
so strangely...

518
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,250
I know you've come
here to rescue me.

519
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,416
Uh... You are
acting weird...

520
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,125
But we should go because
bandits are trying to kill us.

521
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,708
It's this time of day...
I always act like this.

522
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,583
Yeah, that's right...

523
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,250
I remember you mentioning
something like that

524
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,750
to me before.

525
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,666
Stop right there!

526
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,375
It's not safe here.
Let's make a run for it.

527
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,125
No, I'm afraid!

528
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,625
It's fine, I'm here.

529
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,500
I won't let anything
happen to you.

530
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,333
Kenshi?

531
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,791
You saw my...

532
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,916
body...

533
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,500
Didn't you?

534
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:59,250
Could we maybe discuss
this some other time?

535
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,583
Listen... I can
no longer get married...

536
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,708
Since you've seen me...

537
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,791
Please take responsibility.

538
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,333
I guess this is what Lady
Lithia meant when she said,

539
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,875
'something amusing.'

540
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,666
Get down!

541
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,041
You okay?

542
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,500
I am...

543
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:30,708
I'm much better now and I'm
sorry to have put you out.

544
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,125
Although,
I would appreciate it

545
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,916
if you'd dismiss
what just happened...

546
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,125
And also disregard
everything I said to you...

547
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,250
Otherwise,
I would be forced

548
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,458
to make you
take responsibility.

549
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,583
It's already forgotten!

550
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,666
Trying to use this thing to
fight a Sacred Mechanoid

551
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,500
was a really dumb idea...!

552
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,708
I could
just kick myself

553
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,916
for not bringing
any gunpowder with me!

554
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,958
How could they not have
caught him yet...?!

555
00:29:56,041 --> 00:30:01,375
What in the world could possibly
be taking them so long?

556
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,083
Hey Aura, looks like you
made it just in time...!

557
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:08,708
Boy, I sure am glad
to have some backup!

558
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,916
Kenshi has gone off to
rescue the queen, Flora...!

559
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,041
So it's just us
'til he gets back!

560
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,750
Sounds good to me!

561
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:18,041
I really hope I can
make it there in time!

562
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,041
So this must be where that
brat's been hiding, eh?!

563
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,666
Be real careful, this
kid isn't normal!

564
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,125
He's fast,
that's for sure.

565
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,416
Wait him out...
He's a rat in a trap.

566
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,375
Nothing to worry about.

567
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,500
This is no good...

568
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,583
There's still
a lot of distance

569
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,833
between me and
Queen Flora's place.

570
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,416
Oh, yeah!

571
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,833
How did he get all
the way over there?

572
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,083
That was overkill...

573
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,541
You just blew the
poor kid to pieces.

574
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,833
Ah, too bad.

575
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:08,333
I wasn't done
messin' with him yet.

576
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,333
Hey, what's that...

577
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,583
Did fragments
hit the crate?

578
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,458
It's the kid!

579
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,833
What is that thing?!

580
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,958
Down!

581
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,541
Dagmyer.

582
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,625
For them to successfully mount
an invasion like this one...

583
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,291
Either they're
ingenious tacticians,

584
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,750
or Havoniwa is
weaker than I thought.

585
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:47,041
Or Male Sacred Mechamasters
are a bunch of spoiled babies.

586
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,500
So that's what
this is about...

587
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,875
I happen to agree.

588
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,916
Be a good boy and
come with me...

589
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,500
and you have my word
you won't get hurt.

590
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,250
I would like to speak with
your leader at once...

591
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,458
Any chance you could
make that happen for me?

592
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,791
Excuse me?

593
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,541
I'd like to render
your services.

594
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,708
Hey, are you all right?

595
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,416
Yes... I think
I'm okay...

596
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,541
But please don't worry
about Queen Flora...!

597
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,041
Many were wounded
during the attack,

598
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,041
so it's important that
we get them out first.

599
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,083
Uh... Yeah, sure
I'll go get the wounded.

600
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,500
Please, hurry!

601
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,583
What about saving Flora?

602
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,708
Shouldn't saving her
be the first priority...?

603
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,666
She's the Queen, after all...

604
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,875
Something
isn't right here.

605
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,125
Don't worry
about me one bit.

606
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:53,125
Nooo!

607
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,333
Hold on, Yukine and Dame Chiaia
still haven't rescued Dagmyer?

608
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,250
They're tied up with
the bandits, ma'am.

609
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,708
Perhaps we should have
sent Kenshi in their place.

610
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,333
Nooo!

611
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,875
Wait a second,
did you hear that?

612
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,375
It came from
our Aunt's manor.

613
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,958
Kenshi!

614
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,375
Stop it... Please
don't be so rough with me!

615
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:25,750
Hey! Let go!

616
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,583
I can't see anything with
you all over me like this!

617
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:31,666
You're blocking my view!

618
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,500
Somebody is having fun.

619
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,125
Oh, good.

620
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,916
All we really did was help her
get exactly what she wanted.

621
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,958
Get off of me!

622
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,916
Hey, I can see again!

623
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,333
Oh, thank goodness!

624
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,208
I was starting to get
scared there for a second.

625
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,208
Kenshi!
Look behind you!

626
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,875
Oh no! I'm getting
close to my limit...!

627
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,750
I'm gonna fry
that stupid brat!

628
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,791
Maybe this will stop her!

629
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,875
Come on, is he joking?
That didn't do a thing!

630
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,750
Yeah...! It worked...!

631
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,291
Their frames are just like
human bodies after all!

632
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,791
Keep talking
like that...

633
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,541
So hot.

634
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,291
What is with this kid?
I am done.

635
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,583
Sorry for the wait, Mom!

636
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:34,458
It's about time!

637
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,166
Oh no!

638
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,875
I can't believe she used
that here...! This is bad!

639
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,583
Oh, you're one to talk!

640
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,875
Let's move out...!
That's the sign, guys!

641
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,208
Right!

642
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,416
What?!

643
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,083
Come with me!

644
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,041
Dagmyer!

645
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,708
Are you gonna
be okay, Mom?

646
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:06,375
That was a close call.

647
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,208
That little brat!

648
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,000
It looks like they
pulled a fast one on us.

649
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,083
Yes, indeed.

650
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,375
He pulled a fast
one all over me.

651
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,583
We cannot believe this.

652
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:24,375
They completely had
their way with us.

653
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,500
Yes, and I loved
every minute of it.

654
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,583
It was just delightful!

655
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,500
Let him go...!

656
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,041
Now!

657
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,875
We think they took
this escape route.

658
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,000
So you think
they're here?

659
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,000
That's right.

660
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,416
Why is that?

661
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Because those bandits didn't
seem very bright to me.

662
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,083
What are you getting at?

663
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,375
Well, rather than actually
making an escape...

664
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:52,000
They've only gone just
far enough to feel safe.

665
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,875
So you're saying that they're
choosing emotions over logic?

666
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,125
We'll just have to
trust you on this.

667
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,708
Is it wise to make a
decision so flippantly?

668
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,416
Once the army arrives, we'll
investigate this place...

669
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,000
I think trusting
Kenshi's instinct

670
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,458
is the best
chance we have.

671
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm very sorry
it's such a mess.

672
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,625
You seem rather skilled...

673
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,750
For a former
Sacred Mechamaster.

674
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,458
Was your short
operational time

675
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:27,791
what led you
to become a RONIN?

676
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,375
That's enough questions...

677
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:32,541
I understand you want to
hire us on, is that correct?

678
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,291
Just how much money do you hope
to get out of catching me...?

679
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,500
Bargaining with a country
isn't easy, you know.

680
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,875
I could pick out a girl
for you to get married to.

681
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:41,916
There's no short supply
of RONIN girls here.

682
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,750
I don't think
it will be too difficult

683
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,416
to find something you like.

684
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,166
Perhaps you?

685
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,541
Tell me, do you include
yourself in that offer?

686
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,458
Of course.

687
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,250
So... You said you
want to hire us.

688
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,041
What did you mean?

689
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,916
You should know I'm
not like other men.

690
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,875
And I intend to
prove it to you.

691
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:16,333
Well, you have my
attention, Dagymer.

692
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,750
Excellent...

693
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,583
If possible, I'd like
to speak with you in private.

694
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,000
Ya trust him?

695
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,666
I don't know,
but it's okay...

696
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,291
She's a big girl...

697
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,000
Don't worry, she can
take care of herself.

698
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,000
Everyone listen up, we'll be
leaving the draft soon,

699
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,125
so we can't go
any farther in this.

700
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,541
In that case, Kenshi and I
will get out and scout the area

701
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,083
like we planned.

702
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,208
I'm begging you...

703
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,875
Save Ceres.

704
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:45,666
Yes... We will
do all that we can.

705
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,958
I'm going with you!

706
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,541
I would prefer it if you
stay and guard everyone here.

707
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,500
She's right, you would only
slow them down in the mountains.

708
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:55,625
Kenshi...

709
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,041
Come.

710
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,208
Oh, Dagmyer.

711
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,125
Yes, I think you're right, those
weak little lords and ladies

712
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:07,333
could never pull
something like that off.

713
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:09,416
But... are you serious?

714
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,416
There's only one thing I want
to hear from you right now,

715
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,125
you understand?

716
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,500
Alright then...

717
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,000
If that's what you
want from us, sure.

718
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,375
Then we should hurry up and get
ready before they come for me.

719
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,291
Well, Kenshi...

720
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,916
it looks like your
guess was right.

721
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,875
This is bad...

722
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,333
We don't have time to
wait for Queen Flora.

723
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,583
We have to get back to
Lashara and let her know.

724
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,208
You go ahead, I'll
keep an eye on them.

725
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,041
Right!

726
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,041
It's Dagmyer.

727
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,041
So... have you loaded up
the prisoners yet?

728
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,250
Yeah, we split them up
between the two containers.

729
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,291
Good... Prepare
to move out soon.

730
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,166
You got it.

731
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,750
Ceres...
I'm glad he's okay.

732
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,375
Here's the deal...

733
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:06,500
Their air bikes are parked
somewhere in this general area,

734
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,000
so if we manage to go
down the opposite side...

735
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,041
Then we just might
be able to escape...

736
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,750
Kenshi, the whole
plan hinges on it.

737
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,208
Are you positive
all the prisoners

738
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,750
are in those containers?

739
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,333
Yes, that's right, they're being
held in two separate groups.

740
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:19,833
Great...

741
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,041
Then we should have a shot
at rescuing Dagmyer and Ceres.

742
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,583
So, while Kenshi
distracts them

743
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,333
by wreaking havoc
with my Mechaworker,

744
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:27,250
Aura and I will steal
the cargo truck.

745
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,125
Got it?

746
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,708
Man, I was dumb to think
we'd get to relax today.

747
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:33,875
Yeah, tell me about it.

748
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:35,458
I had plans for
something sweet.

749
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,416
Oh, you poor little baby.

750
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:41,500
How's it goin'?

751
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,916
What was that noise?

752
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,958
What's going on?!

753
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,166
It's the kid!

754
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,041
So sorry... didn't
mean to do that!

755
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,333
Dagmyer?
Did they hurt you?

756
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,791
See for yourself...

757
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,916
Actually, all things considered,
I was treated very well.

758
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,416
You got here much quicker
than I expected you to.

759
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,875
That's all
thanks to Kenshi.

760
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,416
I am terribly sorry
to have worried you.

761
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,291
We are glad you're okay...

762
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,250
We'll be meeting with
Aunt Flora very soon,

763
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,000
so just try and
relax until then.

764
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,125
Right.

765
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,666
Come, Chiaia; let's go.

766
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,208
Right. We'll get
you out of here real soon.

767
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,916
Thank you.

768
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,333
Whaddaya know,
it worked!

769
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,708
I'm glad you're
okay, Ceres.

770
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,875
So am I.

771
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,875
Hey, Wahanly.

772
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,166
I have a favor
to ask of you.

773
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,875
For your friend?

774
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,416
Discussing how to
help Ceres escape?

775
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Lashara!

776
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,125
Where'd you come from?

777
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:15,000
Seriously, what in the world
were you thinking, you idiot?!

778
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,291
This could have been a
diplomatic nightmare!

779
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,041
Calm down...
We do not mind at all.

780
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,000
If we bring them
back with us,

781
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,375
even the girl
won't get off easy.

782
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:28,875
Doing that will undoubtedly put
Ceres in a precarious position.

783
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,625
This is a surprising twist.

784
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:31,916
Empress, we can't!

785
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,083
Come now, we
aren't monsters...

786
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,000
After all, Ceres is a
dear friend of Kenshi's.

787
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,833
Yeah, he sure is!

788
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,000
Then we want
to help him...

789
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,333
Only Queen Flora
would be bothered...

790
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,500
Ceres and Hazuki
just went missing...

791
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,625
Sound good?

792
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:47,833
Empress,
please understand,

793
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,750
I'm obligated to
uphold my position

794
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,541
as Princess of Shurifon...

795
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,958
Wouldn't you
agree, Miss Lithia?

796
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,666
Well, the Church
is forbidden

797
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,041
to intervene
in such situations...

798
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,083
I, for one,
didn't see a thing.

799
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,958
What?

800
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,166
Well, well,
the strictest one here

801
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,125
is surprisingly
understanding, isn't she?

802
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,375
Gotta say, I'm shocked.

803
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,750
You really do sympathize
with that Hazuki girl.

804
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,291
But Lithia- ...

805
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm begging you,
Princess Aura!

806
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,750
Oh, Kenshi.

807
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,250
My friend Ceres
is just like me.

808
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,166
He got thrust into this
world of Mechamasters,

809
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,291
and he's been
suffering ever since.

810
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,958
So please!

811
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,250
Oh, all right.

812
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,916
Those eyes get to
older women, too.

813
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,666
Fine, I've no idea what
everyone is talking about...

814
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,416
Don't ask me, I didn't hear
anything, not one single word.

815
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,583
I wish I could
be of assistance.

816
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:47,666
Oh, Princess Aura!

817
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,041
You better get going...

818
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,666
Before our Aunt
Flora gets here.

819
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,666
That Lashara.

820
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,666
The girl is up to
something, isn't she?

821
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,041
Whatever do you mean?

822
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,541
She's trying to tell me
that they lost Ceres

823
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,125
in the confusion
of the mission.

824
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,791
That... sounds like
a diplomatic problem to me.

825
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,333
While trying to accommodate
the Male Sacred Mechamasters,

826
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,541
Havoniwa let a gang
of bandits slip through

827
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,000
and infiltrate our ranks...

828
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,291
Unbeknownst to us, these
bandits traded places

829
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,791
with our guards and
attempted to kidnap our own.

830
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:21,541
Well... That's the story
I'm sticking to, anyway.

831
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,083
There's a competitive
sports tournament...?!

832
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,125
We'll win a fortune off
wagers, won't we...?!

833
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:16,000
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

834
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,791
Competitive Sports
Tournament...!

835
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:20,166
You mean Kenshi is the
crowd favorite...?!

836
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,541
This is bad!
