1
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,416
Wasn't Princess Maria
just here...?

2
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,875
Where did she go?

3
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,375
She's at a Student
Council meeting.

4
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,250
But class is
about to start.

5
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,791
Yeah, I know, but
the Student Council

6
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,041
takes priority
over everything.

7
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,791
No way.

8
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,125
Any final comments
on this matter?

9
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,625
Apparently not.

10
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,000
All who object,
raise your hand.

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,791
In that case,
the vote is unanimous,

12
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,041
and the motion has passed.

13
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,583
The Student Council?

14
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,333
Yes, we are a member...

15
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,500
'Tis managed by royalty like
us and other high nobles...

16
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,500
The remaining members have
all been voted into office

17
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,500
by the Council.

18
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,166
That makes sense.

19
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,208
It does.

20
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,583
During the meeting today,

21
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,500
we actually discussed
placing you on the Council.

22
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,708
You what...?!

23
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,208
Please tell me you're
kidding, Empress...!

24
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,583
There is no way that this thing
is smart enough for that.

25
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,666
No, that's
funny, though.

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,041
It would be more for odd jobs;
we have big events coming up.

27
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,583
This was your idea,
wasn't it?

28
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,166
Either way, the motion
passed with a unanimous vote.

29
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,875
So odd jobs...?
Will I just be doing, like,

30
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,708
more of the same stuff
I do at the dorms?

31
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,083
Idiot...! Do not compare our
work with simple housecleaning!

32
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,375
Just think...!
Where are we...?

33
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,708
Royalty, nobility, and Sacred
Mechamasters come here.

34
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,541
'Tis a small-scale
model of the world.

35
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,916
The Student Council

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,166
is the Holy Land's most
powerful organization.

37
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,291
Even if it is
for odd jobs...

38
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,541
Carefully consider what it
means for you to be voted

39
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,083
into this elite group.

40
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,625
Yeah, I get it!

41
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,833
Since I'm technically yours,
some of those guys might feel

42
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,250
like they owe us, which
could be helpful later!

43
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,666
Yes, you really do get it!

44
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,041
I think the Empress is
starting to rub off on you,

45
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,333
and I don't like it.

46
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,500
My life sucks.

47
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,000
However...

48
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,208
there is no need for you
to do anything to help Maria.

49
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,458
We get the distinct impression
that trashy princess

50
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,416
is up to no good.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,916
So be sure to
watch out for her!

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,791
Okay.

53
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,916
I'm surprised she offered to
lend him out in the first place.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,375
I don't think she realizes

55
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:18,541
how terrifying that
particular job can be.

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,958
Although...

57
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,041
this could be a huge
opportunity for us, indeed.

58
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,625
I have brought
Kenshi Masaki, miss.

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,958
Thank you, Lapis...

60
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,750
You may go wait
outside, now.

61
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,333
Yes, miss.

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,750
Are we the only
ones in here?

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,958
If I could have your
attention, Wild Beast?

64
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,416
I'm sorry...

65
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,958
Why do you keep
calling me that...?

66
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,625
My name isn't
actually Wild Beast.

67
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,000
But it is what
you are, isn't it?!

68
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,500
You have absolutely no idea
what you put me through!

69
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,291
If you think I've already
forgotten the way

70
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,708
you humiliated me,
you are severely mistaken!

71
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,916
Fine, that's fine!
"Wild Beast" it is.

72
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,250
So, what did you
need me for anyway?

73
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,666
Did Empress Lashara
not tell you?

74
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,916
She said I'd have to
do odd jobs, but...

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,750
yeah, that's pretty
much all she told me.

76
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,333
One moment, please...

77
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,416
Oh... 'kay

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
First things first...

79
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,666
You are now required
to swear an oath.

80
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,125
You shall never
repeat to others

81
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,125
what you see or hear in
this room, henceforth...

82
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,208
Do you swear it?

83
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,208
I swear.

84
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,166
Fantastic.

85
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,625
At the moment, we don't
have any specific work

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,916
we need for you to do...

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,125
but you must still report
to this room every day

88
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,208
after school.

89
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,791
No problem.

90
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:02,916
Also...

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,208
although we've no
work for you now.

92
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,083
Bear in mind, being
on the council

93
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,833
should be considered your
number one priority.

94
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,000
Uh... Okay.

95
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,625
Congratulations
on your acceptance

96
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,541
to the Student
Council, Kenshi!

97
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,708
Yeah, thank you...

98
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,625
but I think I'm just
gonna be a handyman.

99
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,791
Um...

100
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,041
I hope you don't get the wrong
idea about Lady Lithia...

101
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,458
She definitely comes off as
harsh, but she's not like...

102
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,791
you know...

103
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,666
She's just the super-serious
type, right...?

104
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,916
Oh, don't worry.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,333
I have a sister who's
exactly like her.

106
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,291
I'm glad
you understand.

107
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,833
You heard
about it, right?!

108
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,416
Kenshi Masaki
was asked to appear

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,666
before the Student Council.

110
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,458
Are you serious?
How come?

111
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,333
I don't know any
of the details...

112
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,541
But it is Kenshi...

113
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,833
Do you think
that maybe...?

114
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,541
Well, it's definitely
a possibility.

115
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,708
Look, it's Lapis!

116
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh, hey there, Lapis...!
Do you by chance know

117
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,250
what the Student Council
wanted with Kenshi?

118
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,166
Um, they only asked
me to be his guide,

119
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,500
so I wouldn't have a clue
what all that was about...

120
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,750
I wish I did,
though...

121
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,166
I'm really sorry.

122
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,500
Well, that figures.

123
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,708
But if anyone would know,
it'd be Princess Maria.

124
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,375
Well yeah, but we couldn't ask
her about that, could we...?

125
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,666
Could we?

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,458
Maybe we should just
go and ask Kenshi.

127
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,875
Excuse me, ladies!

128
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,583
What do you think
you're doing;

129
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,000
you're supposed
to be warming up!

130
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,791
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,125
What's this?.

132
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,291
Did the Student Council
release you already?

133
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,458
Yeah.

134
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,416
So, um, what are you
doing, Mister Ulyte?

135
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,250
I am sunbathing.

136
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,041
Sunbathing, really?

137
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,708
I am, and it looks as though
the suns are coming out, now.

138
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,625
Suns?

139
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,000
They are truly blinding.

140
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,000
All right, begin!

141
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,375
Why in the world are the
girls dressed like that?

142
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,875
Oh, you'll see
in just a second.

143
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,958
Very nice...

144
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,000
Looks like we've got another
year of well-endowed students.

145
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,875
Why would they
willingly wear those?

146
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,708
Supposedly, it's a tradition
from another world...

147
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:25,000
I find it to be
terrifically fascinating.

148
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,458
The guys who came here really
did do pretty much anything

149
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,958
they wanted.

150
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,166
Something the matter?

151
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,666
No, not really...

152
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,583
It's just that I was surprised
to see you still out here,

153
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,333
that's all, heh-heh.

154
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,375
I simply enjoy the fresh
vibrancy of youth...

155
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,375
It doesn't matter to me
whether it's male or female.

156
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay...

157
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,208
Speaking of which, where are
all the guys right now anyway?

158
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,125
That way?

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,375
Wow...

160
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,166
The boys at this school don't
even lift a finger, do they?

161
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,875
On their behalf, it's not
as if they won't work...

162
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,166
They're just not allowed to.

163
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,541
Besides, we don't want
them getting hurt.

164
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,750
They are valuable.

165
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,750
I see...

166
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,333
Now then, Kenshi...

167
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,125
What's going on with
the Student Council?

168
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,041
What could they
possibly want with you?

169
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,666
I guess they just needed
to have a handyman.

170
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,500
So... I take it they
admitted you with a vote?

171
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,500
Yeah, that's right.

172
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,375
You mean it's
really true...?

173
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,416
How amazing.

174
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,416
Uh, yeah...

175
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,458
but... I'm just a handyman.

176
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,791
That's still pretty cool.

177
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,541
Way to go, Kenshi!

178
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,791
That's funny...

179
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,458
And fascinating.

180
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,833
I heard they have more royals
and nobles this year than usual.

181
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,416
Is that true, too?
Do you know?

182
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,000
They even have Princess
Aura, she's so talented.

183
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,958
Don't forget Princess
Maria from our class!

184
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,208
Oh, and Lady Lithia's
on it, as well!

185
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,916
Even Sir Dagmyer
serves on the council!

186
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,166
You know, Kenshi...

187
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,083
if you ever need any
help, you can ask me.

188
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,291
I'm actually pretty handy.

189
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,291
Okay...

190
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,875
Would you
leave him alone...?

191
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,250
You know she's
just trying to use you

192
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,541
to get in good
with the council.

193
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,333
Oh like you wouldn't
do the same thing!

194
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,416
What is that
supposed to mean?

195
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I wonder if this is the
job she was talking about?

196
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,958
That is enough, ladies!

197
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,000
A little help, please,
Mister Ulyte...!

198
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,750
Quit smiling and start
chastising!

199
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,625
Oh, right...
sorry...

200
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,000
I couldn't shout over all
the fuss they were making.

201
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,083
Are you ever anything
but nonchalant?

202
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,041
That Mister Ulyte can be
rather devious at times...

203
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,916
At the very least, he's a
fan of spreading rumors.

204
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,291
Have you heard
about Kenshi, yet?

205
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,583
Yeah, of course I did!

206
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,250
Everybody has
by now, right?

207
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,125
It is so crazy that he
joined the student council!

208
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,708
How are these rumors
getting everywhere so fast?

209
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,791
It's kind of a big deal, so
I guess that does makes sense.

210
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,875
Stay focused...
We need to catch Kenshi

211
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,958
before one of those other
hussies beats us to it!

212
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,916
Kenshi, wait for us!

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,458
C'mon, let's go
after him, too!

214
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,041
Okay!

215
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,291
Kenshi!

216
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,416
Sir Dagmyer?

217
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,708
I found a few
more gentlemen

218
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,250
who would like the opportunity
to fight for you.

219
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,625
Much appreciated.

220
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,500
I am counting on you.

221
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,083
Thank you, sir!

222
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,291
Will you lend me your
strength as well?

223
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,541
Um...

224
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,333
I know you've got ideals...

225
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,541
I've just never thought
about things like that...

226
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,958
So if you'll excuse me.

227
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,791
Uh... Would you like me
to go bring him back, sir?

228
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,291
No, no one should be
forced to participate.

229
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,791
I have no need for someone
who won't oppose reality.

230
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,916
Oh, he got away again.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,458
Chasing him around like
this is getting us nowhere!

232
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,458
Can't breathe...

233
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,666
He's just too fast
for us to catch.

234
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,541
We need to come up with
a better plan, then.

235
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,708
You're being disorderly,
Wild Beast...!

236
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,875
Enter this room quietly.

237
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,333
Sorry...

238
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,000
I was just trying to keep
out of those girls' reach.

239
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,250
Lady Lithia?

240
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,416
What's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?

241
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,125
Paperwork makes me a little
sleepy, that's all...

242
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,375
Okay.

243
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,666
It seems like
you're being chased

244
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,166
around a lot these days...

245
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,791
Although, I'm sure you
must be used to it by now.

246
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,750
You are a Wild Beast.

247
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,666
Hey, how come
nobody else is here?

248
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,458
Oh, they only come
when we hold meetings...

249
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,208
I just work from here
because I like this room.

250
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,916
So, I'm guessing my actual job
is to let those girls chase me.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,083
My, my...

252
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,791
Look who's
surprisingly clever.

253
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,708
We have a few members...

254
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,541
Secret, executive members
who handle various tasks.

255
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,000
But, if their identities
were revealed...

256
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,250
they would face what you
are now dealing with.

257
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,666
And, being that the majority
of them are ladies,

258
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,291
they could get challenged
to duels out of spite.

259
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,625
Oh.

260
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,000
Every year we employ a few
people to act as decoys,

261
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,958
but it's not an easy job.

262
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,541
I suppose we could
hire professionals

263
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,083
to act as students,...

264
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
but they'd have to deal with
malicious bullying, too...

265
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,166
Even though I know
it's inevitable,

266
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,083
it still pains me
to put them through that.

267
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,125
But it's okay
if it's just me?

268
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,333
The boys at this school
are special, remember?

269
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,375
So don't worry, no one's
gonna try and hurt you...

270
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,500
At the most, they'll
chase you around a bit...

271
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,041
Try to bribe or
seduce you, maybe.

272
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,625
Well, thanks a lot for
the warning, I guess.

273
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,666
It just goes to show how
prestigious your status

274
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,625
on the Student Council is.

275
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,583
But aren't there other
guys that could do it?

276
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,041
The male Sacred Mechamasters
won't do anything,

277
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,958
and we can't force
them to, either...

278
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,333
In contrast, you may not
be a Sacred Mechamaster,

279
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,916
but you are fast...

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,750
So, I don't have to worry about
you getting easily injured.

281
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,958
And, as much as it
pains me to admit it...

282
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,583
you do work hard.

283
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, and one more thing...

284
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,833
Student Council proceedings take
precedence over everything...

285
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,583
The teachers cannot help you,
so don't waste your time asking.

286
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,666
Are you... serious
about this, Yeliss?

287
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,416
Do we want Kenshi for
ourselves, or do we not?

288
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,458
Listen up...

289
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,833
We're gonna have
to catch him soon

290
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,500
so we can talk some
sense into him!

291
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,625
And, it will be a whole lot
easier to deal with anyone

292
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,208
who approaches him...
after we catch him.

293
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,791
Yeah, I think you
guys are right.

294
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,291
You know it's kinda funny...

295
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,083
I can't remember ever working
together with anyone here

296
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,625
on a single goal,
much less all of you.

297
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,166
Yeah, that's true...

298
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,125
You know, once we graduate,
we'll have to spend time

299
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,625
fulfilling our duties to
our individual countries.

300
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,291
And I'm kind of
okay with that...

301
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,541
But I guess we might as well
have fun working together

302
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,875
until then, right?

303
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,875
Uh-huh.

304
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,250
Yeah.

305
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
Okay.

306
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,708
Let's do it!

307
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,291
We shall hereby commence
Operation Catch the Kenshi!

308
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,958
Let's communicate with
each of our teams

309
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,916
and work with each
other to catch Kenshi

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,291
using our own two hands!

311
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,125
Yeah!

312
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,250
They are clearly
enthusiastic.

313
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,958
A little too enthusiastic
if you ask me.

314
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,791
Well, we are sure
he will manage somehow.

315
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,291
Alright, Kenshi!
Give up already!

316
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,791
You can keep running
if you want,

317
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,000
but you don't
stand a chance

318
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,916
against all of
our forces combined!

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,208
Aren't you being
a little extreme?

320
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,541
Teams one and two:
give pursuit!

321
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,541
Team three:
block his escape route!

322
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,958
Teams four and five,
go around from the back!

323
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,875
Ugh, this sucks!

324
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,375
It's locked!

325
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,583
We've got you now!

326
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,916
I've got it...

327
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,958
Save Kenshi when
he's in a pinch

328
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,666
and go as far as
you can with him,

329
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,041
if at all possible...

330
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,916
If we're to steal him,
we must be aggressive.

331
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,083
Use this, Kenshi!

332
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,333
He's getting away!

333
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,416
Go around!

334
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,583
How did he do that...?
Hurry, go...!

335
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,666
Why don't you
stop for the day?

336
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,083
I can't do that.

337
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,583
Then, I want you to take
some medicine at least.

338
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,916
I had my own pharmacist
prepare something.

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
No, thank you,
but maybe later.

340
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:27,291
I will never understand
your hatred for medicine.

341
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,791
Kenshi?

342
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey, are you okay,
Lady Lithia?

343
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,833
I'm just tired...

344
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,583
There's no need for a wild
beast to worry about me.

345
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,416
She can't help herself...

346
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,875
She has a tendency to
push things way too hard.

347
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,125
Yes, she does...

348
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,500
And she has a frail
body to start out with.

349
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, I get it...

350
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,291
I used to be kinda frail back
when I was a little kid.

351
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,958
I mean, don't get me wrong;

352
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,875
I always had pretty good
stamina and stuff...

353
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,666
The others were just
so good, is all.

354
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,208
I don't have time to listen
to any of your silly stories,

355
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,333
Wild Beast...

356
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,958
So if you don't need
something from me,

357
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,541
please leave this
room immediately.

358
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,250
You realize you're
going to collapse

359
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,083
if you keep
this up, Lithia.

360
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,666
A baptism would
resolve the situation

361
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,041
if they would allow it.

362
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,875
Baptism?

363
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,666
Honestly, you can
be so stubborn.

364
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,958
Lady Lithia?

365
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,708
Why don't...
you have a cup of tea

366
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,833
before you
get back to work?

367
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,625
I would love to have
some tea, Lapis.

368
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,375
Oh, good!

369
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,208
Lapis!

370
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,208
What is it?

371
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,250
I'd like to help.

372
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,208
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

373
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,375
Appreciated.
Yes, thank you.

374
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,916
Oh, wow;
how unusual...

375
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,250
I like it,
though...

376
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,333
The flavor is
so refreshing.

377
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,250
Would you like to have
another cup, miss?

378
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,875
Yes, please.

379
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,833
Princess Aura,
what is a "baptism"?

380
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,375
Oh, yes...

381
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,750
There's a curative type of
aho used to heal our bodies

382
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,458
from virtually anything...

383
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,166
During the baptism ceremony,
a healer, as well as the one

384
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,750
who is being healed, form
a pact with the Goddess...

385
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,958
It's considered
a holy sacrament.

386
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,541
The Holy Land is special...

387
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,541
It was the original place where
we could commune with Her...

388
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,750
The main gate at the
Academy's entrance is said

389
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,375
to have been built
in her name.

390
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,166
The main gate?

391
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,958
Doesn't really look like
a Goddess, though, does it?

392
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,875
We don't even
know Her name...

393
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,000
Let alone how she
may or may not look.

394
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,625
Princess Aura...?
Kenshi...?

395
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,750
That's awesome.

396
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,583
It totally worked.

397
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,125
You brewed this tea,
didn't you, Kenshi?

398
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,041
Take this... Have Lady
Lithia drink some of it

399
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,916
whenever she gets
hungry tomorrow...

400
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,708
She'll feel better
soon; I promise.

401
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,625
All right...
Thank you, Kenshi.

402
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,125
Well, I guess I'd
better be running, now!

403
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,666
Kenshi has left the
Student Council Room...

404
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,500
He is currently racing
toward area A-33!

405
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,166
That cannot be
easy for him.

406
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,458
Agreed.

407
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,625
He just broke through
Team One's traps!

408
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,625
Team Three's traps
failed to capture him!

409
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,583
Team Seven's
traps didn't work!

410
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,500
We can't catch him...

411
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,083
And he gets past all our traps
like they're not even there.

412
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,708
This is unbelievable...!

413
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,250
And we've dedicated
an entire week to this!

414
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,750
Bwoole!

415
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,625
Talk to me about
those aho cables.

416
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,250
Don't they fall under Miss
Mexiah's jursisdiction?

417
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,916
Yes, they do...
You wouldn't!

418
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,541
I would.
Contact Wahan immediately.

419
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,083
Yeliss, we can't!

420
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,875
What I can't do is rely on
normal means to capture him...

421
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,500
He's left us
with no choice.

422
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,625
I'm still shocked you
keep managing to get away

423
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,208
from all of those
crazy girls...

424
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,833
How many groups are
after you again?

425
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,958
I have no idea.

426
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,666
I'm just lucky I'm fast.

427
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,666
But... This is
a perfect opportunity,

428
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,875
if there's
a girl you like,

429
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,250
you should totally
let her catch you!

430
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,125
Um, Empress...?

431
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,583
Maybe it would be best
if he didn't wind up

432
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,208
getting more traumatized.

433
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,541
He already has nightmares and
says weird stuff in his sleep

434
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,708
because of my crazy sister.

435
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,875
He does...? Oh...

436
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,583
So, like, what kinda
things do I say?

437
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,791
There's no way I'm gonna
repeat those words out loud!

438
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,250
You are right...

439
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,208
After all, even aho cannot
heal psychological wounds.

440
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,583
Yeah, but wouldn't I have
to be baptized first anyway?

441
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,166
How in the world do you
know about baptisms?

442
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,166
Princess Aura told
me all about them.

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
Of course...

444
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,916
We suppose we
should start thinking

445
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,125
about getting
you baptized.

446
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,666
Nah, don't worry
about me...

447
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
I'm the perfect
picture of health!

448
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,666
Did you know Sacred
Mechamasters get baptized

449
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,500
to repair their
Sacred Mechanoids.

450
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,375
What...? You can really repair
the Mechanoids with aho?.

451
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,875
Then why has Wahanly
been working so hard?

452
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,291
Wahan and I haven't
been baptized...

453
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,833
We wouldn't need to return
the Mechas to the Church

454
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,708
if we had a Sacred
Mechaguardian,

455
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,875
which is a Sacred Mechamaster
who knows healing.

456
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,791
So I guess a
Sacred Mechanoid...

457
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,500
would be pretty
much invincible

458
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,166
with a baptized Mechamaster
and Mechaguardian?

459
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,666
Well, although they do make
a formidable weapon...

460
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,166
There's still the operational
limit to worry about,

461
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,875
and you'd be doomed
if the Mechanoid ended up

462
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,833
getting damaged faster
than it healed.

463
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,125
I see...

464
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,833
If you want to know more
about it, ask Mexiah...

465
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,666
She is a Sacred Mechaguardian.

466
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,000
By the way, Empress...

467
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,833
I've got a question
I should ask you...

468
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,166
That boy
truly is amazing...

469
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,000
It's odd no one's forced him
into a compromising situation.

470
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,250
At any rate...

471
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,541
I doubt the upperclassmen
will give up now,

472
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,291
so be sure to keep
a close eye on him

473
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,500
and jump if you get
the chance, okay?

474
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,000
Princess Maria...!

475
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,333
We have just received
a transmission

476
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,500
from your homeland.

477
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,833
It's the Queen.

478
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,875
What could
my mother want?

479
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,416
What do you
want now, mother?

480
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,750
Did something happen?

481
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,875
Oh, Maria, there's no
need to act like that...

482
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,875
All I wanted was
to have an evening chat

483
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,541
and catch up with
my only little girl.

484
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,333
Of course you did.

485
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,541
So, how's it going?

486
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,041
Has anything fun happened?

487
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,416
For example...

488
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,166
Did you maybe find
a wonderful, new toy?

489
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,333
A wonderful toy...?
No, nothing like that.

490
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,625
Nothing at all.

491
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,000
Are you sure?

492
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,458
Your face says...

493
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,916
"I found something amazing,

494
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,291
and I can't wait
to tell you about it!"

495
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,958
Why does she have to have
her stupid intuition?

496
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,500
Okay, then...

497
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,375
But you will let me know if
anything comes up, won't you?.

498
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,875
Also, I've been thinking
about your summer vacation...

499
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,000
Summer vacation?

500
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,125
What a lovely morning!

501
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,250
Wow... I haven't slept
this well in years.

502
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,500
Wait...

503
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,541
How did I get in
my bedroom anyway?

504
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, good morning,
Lady Lithia.

505
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,083
Tell me...

506
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,250
Lapis, why am I
asleep in here?

507
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,708
Excuse me...?

508
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,083
Oh.

509
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,666
Good news, miss!
Your fever finally broke...!

510
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,458
You are feeling
better, aren't you?

511
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,625
Never mind that;

512
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,958
if you could answer
my question, please.

513
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,291
Sounds like you're
ready for breakfast!

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's very good.

515
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,083
Wonderful!

516
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:42,166
Miss...? Princess Aura
is here to see you.

517
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,083
Yes, she may enter.

518
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,583
Good morning, Lithia.

519
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,958
You seem better.

520
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,250
Clearly, you were
in on this, as well.

521
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,500
How dare you show your face
here after making me drink

522
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,125
that suspicious concoction!

523
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,958
Judging by this
newfound energy,

524
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,375
I'd say Kenshi was right
to serve you that tea.

525
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,500
No, that's why I'm upset!

526
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,708
Curse that wild beast!

527
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,750
Here you go...
This'll help.

528
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,750
I shouldn't have
to drink this...

529
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,083
If they would
just baptize me,

530
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,333
I'd be healthy and
strong all the time.

531
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,833
Indeed.

532
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,458
Although... it is better
than depending on medication.

533
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,833
Kenshi, wait!

534
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,875
Oh boy!

535
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,458
This is getting old.

536
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,083
They're making a bigger
fuss this year than usual,

537
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,291
aren't they?

538
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,416
Well, he's proven his
stamina is superior,

539
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,833
so it makes sense.

540
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,000
Now, all of those girls have
decided to work together

541
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,416
and strategize.

542
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,083
Ah, to be young!

543
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,166
However...

544
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,958
If this behavior
continues unchecked,

545
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,041
it will wind up
disrupting the class.

546
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,458
And not to mention
some students

547
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,250
are beginning
to get injured.

548
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,375
Maybe we should give them
a warning or something, huh?

549
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,541
No, let them continue...

550
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,625
I think we can let them do what
they want for a while longer.

551
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,583
Are you sure?

552
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,500
It's only a hunch...

553
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,416
but I have a feeling things
are about to change around here.

554
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,375
At least this time...
it appears as though, mentally,

555
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,833
it will be easier on them
than what normally happens.

556
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,916
True enough.

557
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,875
Still, I'm shocked he's
managing to hold up

558
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,416
so well with all those girls
chasing him around every day.

559
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,625
Oh, if only he
were baptized...

560
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,250
Then he would be
able to rejuvenate

561
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,791
in more ways than one.

562
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,666
Bet you'd still
tire him out.

563
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,208
But...
It is a good point;

564
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,916
why not just go
ahead and do it?

565
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,375
I'll think about it...

566
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,125
But.

567
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,791
I honestly doubt that
a baptism will be necessary.

568
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,458
Oh, come on!
We were so close!

569
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,375
I've already told you
to come in here quietly!

570
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,625
I'm sorry.

571
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,333
It seems the ladies are still
giving you quite the chase, huh?

572
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,958
I guess...

573
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,000
Seriously though,
do you have any idea

574
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,083
how long they'll
keep this up?

575
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,833
I have to admit, they're not
normally this persistent...

576
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,916
but, unfortunately,
you may have to indulge them

577
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,125
for a while longer.

578
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,000
That expression...

579
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,791
I bet those girls
are only chasing you

580
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,916
because you keep making
that silly face...

581
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,958
They probably just
wanna tease you a bit.

582
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,708
I don't think so.

583
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,875
Although, their goals
may have changed by now.

584
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,375
Thank you, Kenshi.

585
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,791
Thanks to you, I'm actually
getting some work done.

586
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,250
Ah, so now you're
working in the dorms

587
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,791
and going to class...

588
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,958
And on top of that, you're
being chased by a bunch of girls

589
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,875
since you're in
the Student Council.

590
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:51,666
Boy, you've got
your hands full.

591
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,875
Well, at least
you can feel safe

592
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,500
while you're here
at work, right?

593
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,000
If you get tired,
you can always use

594
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,291
wherever you're working
as a place to rest, kid.

595
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,416
Thank you, but
I'm holding up fine.

596
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,041
Wow, just how much
stamina do you have?.

597
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,291
I guess we'll see...

598
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,875
You are done here,
aren't you...?

599
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,291
Go on and call it a day, and
I'll put the stuff up for you.

600
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,833
Okay! Thanks
for the help...!

601
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:13,833
Bye!

602
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,583
Kenshi!

603
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,916
Good luck, kid!
Hang in there!

604
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:25,208
Isn't using that
against some sorta rule?

605
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,583
This is what you get for
running away, Kenshi!

606
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:39,875
Sorry! Excuse us!

607
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,250
Sorry!

608
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,541
Come on...!
Give up already!

609
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,041
Yeah, I figured as much...

610
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,500
Perfect!

611
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,750
He found out our weakness
and is taking advantage of it.

612
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,583
Yes. Exactly as we
thought he would.

613
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,208
It's starting
to get weird.

614
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,250
Agreed. How are you
planning to use Yukine?

615
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,875
What do you mean?

616
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,958
She's merely been instructed to
make sure he doesn't get hurt.

617
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,958
Is that so...

618
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,750
We told you
to give up!

619
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,208
Attack!

620
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,333
Why, you little!

621
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,916
We were so close!

622
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,791
We done here?

623
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,375
No way.

624
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,708
Are those steam engines?

625
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:54,750
We can't believe
they're using that!

626
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,916
They're moving perfectly!
I'm so proud!

627
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Wahanly, you're
responsible for those?

628
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,625
Technically, they're
using test models,

629
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,041
but my moving armor
can run strong

630
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,083
for a full thirty minutes!

631
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,541
What should I do?

632
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,916
I don't want them
to chase me into the forest

633
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,833
and end up running
outta power.

634
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,291
There is no
escape from us!

635
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,583
Catch him!

636
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,750
Don't... It's still
too dangerous...

637
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,375
You can hide here with
me if you want to...

638
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,166
'Til dark.

639
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,791
All right, girls,
we've gotta regroup.

640
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,958
Teams Two and Three
go block Zone A.

641
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,000
Teams Four and Five,
go block Zone B.

642
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,125
Got it!

643
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,750
I wonder what's
going on now?

644
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,708
Indeed...
He's disappeared.

645
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,541
The girls have asked
the Shurifon guards

646
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,416
if Kenshi went
into the forest.

647
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,333
Apparently, they lost sight
of him somewhere

648
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,583
around Maria's dorm.

649
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,833
Of course...!
Let's go!

650
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,750
Thanks a lot for letting me
hide out in here...!

651
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,333
So is this where
you stay, Yukine?

652
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:08,291
Well, we are where no one will
ever think to come find you.

653
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,041
Great, thank you...
And there's tea!

654
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,000
Um.

655
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,875
Do you have fun working
for Empress Lashara?

656
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,041
Yeah, I guess...
sometimes.

657
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,541
I have fun here with
Princess Maria, too.

658
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,083
Cool...
That's cool.

659
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:42,208
Save Kenshi
when he's in a pinch

660
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,333
and go as far as
you can with him.

661
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:21,416
As far as I can...

662
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,541
As far as I can...

663
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,333
As far as I can...

664
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,375
As far as I can...

665
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,500
Yukine!

666
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,500
We're coming in!

667
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,833
What in the world do you
think you're doing? You--

668
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,833
Well done, Yukine.

669
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,125
No, wait... it's...
not how it looks...

670
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,625
And how do you
figure that?

671
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,333
It is simply the truth...

672
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:55,041
Your attendant, Kenshi, has
deflowered my attendant, Yukine.

673
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,041
'Tis only natural
for them to be wed...

674
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,083
We wha?!

675
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,666
And as her husband...

676
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,125
He shall be serving as my
attendant from now on,

677
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,333
instead of yours.

678
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,125
He shall be doing
no such thing...

679
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,250
She fell and he helped her.
That's all!

680
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,166
Let us not forget the
recent massage incident.

681
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,750
That was Mexiah's
fault, and you know it!

682
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,000
Girls... If you cannot
come to an agreement,

683
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,500
why not battle it out in
some sort of competition?

684
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,500
What for? Kenshi is,
and shall remain, our attendant.

685
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,583
He is partially responsible
for the massage incident...

686
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,750
The compensation you owe
to Lithia, Yukine, and myself

687
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,208
is rather sizeable, too.

688
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,625
She needn't compensate us.

689
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,166
Princess Aura...

690
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,791
Could you please prepare
some sort of game for us?

691
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,250
Since Princess
Aura suggested it,

692
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,875
you have to know what game
she's going to choose.

693
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,250
We know exactly
what she'll go with.

694
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,666
What are you talking about?

695
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,500
Something you'll
do really well at.

696
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,875
It's called a Stew Battle...

697
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,458
It's a highly competitive
Shurifon game.

698
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,416
A Stew Battle?

699
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,791
We do enjoy eating
delicious stews...

700
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,875
But making them
is so boring.

701
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,583
How is it proceeding?

702
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:06,875
Right on schedule.

703
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,750
Yeah, same with me.

704
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,875
I would like to acquire
additional pawns...

705
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,750
But there are
only so many here.

706
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,708
Now, you do realize...

707
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,916
We'll have to do
things ourselves,

708
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,833
if we want to show strength.

709
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,583
I think we can go ahead
and move 'em up

710
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,833
to the next level...

711
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,041
They do all ridiculously
idolize you after all.

712
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,375
We should dally
at this no longer...

713
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,333
We can only obtain power...

714
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,916
Through power.

715
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,583
What is that?

716
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:40,125
We've been picking up slight
feedback for the past few days.

717
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,708
Isn't that a sensor
in the forest?

718
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,916
How very interesting.

719
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,416
I should probably
take a look into it.

720
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,750
I'd like to take this
moment to thank you all

721
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,541
for attending my party.

722
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,625
I believe you already know
of Shurifon's Stew Battle...

723
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,375
That is what we
will be doing today.

724
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,541
Basically, our guests
must gather ingredients

725
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,875
in the forest
to make stew.

726
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,208
Then, we get the
chance to taste test...

727
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,750
The tastiest stew shall be
chosen by popular vote...

728
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,291
And...

729
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:10,875
The declared winner shall
receive the title to Kenshi.

730
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,250
Excuse me, you said to gather
from the forest...?

731
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,541
But none of us are
exactly familiar with it,

732
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,875
so how do we know what to get?

733
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,875
Don't worry; I'm here,
and I would be happy

734
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,166
to judge the
ingredients for you!

735
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,583
Mister Ulyte?!

736
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,916
So, what do you say...?
May I please join you?

737
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
It sounds like it
would be a lot of fun.

738
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,791
Well of course you may!

739
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,583
By all means, judge for us!

740
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,750
I was out on a little walk
enjoying nature,

741
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,625
and now I get to be part
of a stewfest...!

742
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,041
What a delicious surprise!

743
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,708
But wait...

744
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,416
Why don't we
unchain poor Kenshi

745
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,166
and let him compete
with the rest of you?

746
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,416
I think it would only be fair to
let him have the opportunity

747
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,958
to win his freedom,
don't you agree?

748
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,708
Now let the game begin!

749
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,291
Meet back here in one hour.

750
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,541
Ready...? Go!

751
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,041
Okay...

752
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,666
No point wandering
around like an idiot...

753
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,791
Wish me luck!
See ya!

754
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,375
Well, you're no good.

755
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,875
But you guys are!

756
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,833
We think we should try
a shotgun approach...

757
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,083
Let's gather everything up that
looks like it might be edible

758
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,375
and let Ulyte
be the judge.

759
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,958
Aw, man... If I had known we'd
have to do stuff like this,

760
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,125
I would
have joined Kenshi

761
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,708
on one of his stupid
little expeditions.

762
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,166
What do you think?

763
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,458
Well, it looks like it...
but kinda not.

764
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,291
This is rather frustrating.

765
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,583
Even if it takes us more time,

766
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,916
we should make sure we're
getting the right stuff.

767
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Agreed.

768
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,041
I don't see it.

769
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,291
Yukine!

770
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,541
Is this not it?

771
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,000
It is!

772
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,333
Well, that was
certainly fast.

773
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,291
Of course...! You may
go ahead and judge away!

774
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,791
Oh my...

775
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,666
Well this is rather amazing.

776
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,583
So you are impressed?

777
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,083
Yes?

778
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,541
Yes, very much...

779
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,500
Everything in
here is poisonous.

780
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,541
This one gives
you diarrhea...

781
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,125
This causes vertigo...

782
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,958
Immediate paralysis...

783
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,500
Oh, and a single one
of these carrots?

784
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:17,250
It can take out over
a hundred people.

785
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,791
Oh, nice!

786
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,833
Hey! Whaddaya think about my
new Mechaworker, Kenshi??

787
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,125
Looks good.

788
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,708
I think so, too!

789
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,041
Wait; what are you doing?

790
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,041
Gimme those ingredients
or else, Kenshi Masaki!

791
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,666
I can't! That's
cheating, Wahanly!

792
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,500
I am not cheating...

793
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,416
I'm simply gonna pick up all
the food you happen to drop

794
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,458
while you're running
away from me, that's all.

795
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,791
Yeah, okay,
I get it...

796
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,125
I don't know what
I was thinking.

797
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,916
I have people chasing me
pretty much all the time,

798
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,833
why should today
be any different?

799
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,125
Say your prayers,
loser face!

800
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,500
How can one little
guy be so fast?!

801
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,708
I think I've got an idea!

802
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,666
I sure hope it works!

803
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,041
Oh no!

804
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,458
Yep!

805
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,375
I'd say that worked.

806
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,208
Hey, what the crap,
Kenshi?!

807
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,208
Just tell everyone you
got too hot and had to leap

808
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,208
into the water so you
could cool off a bit...!

809
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,791
Bye!

810
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,375
Hello, Kenshi.
What're you up to?

811
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:50,000
Hey, Big Sis Mexiah!

812
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,708
I'm playing in Princess
Aura's forest food game.

813
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,208
Do you mean
the Stew Battle?.

814
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,041
Those girls chase
you around all day long

815
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,833
and you work
in the dorms, too...

816
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,041
Aren't you tired?

817
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,583
Nah, I feel just fine!

818
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, no. Don't tell
me your sad heart

819
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,083
is more fatigued
than your body...

820
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:07,958
So many girls seem to be
putting poor Kenshi out.

821
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,333
I guess.

822
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:12,625
Oh dear... Your eyes say
that includes me, as well

823
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,416
No, I didn't mean that!

824
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,666
What's this?.

825
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,666
Why are you
bleeding, Kenshi?

826
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,666
Yeah, I'm fine;
I swear...

827
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,625
I just scraped
my head a bit.

828
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,541
I wish I could give you
some healing aho instead...

829
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,916
But that
will have to do.

830
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,791
Thanks a lot
Big Sis Mexiah!

831
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,000
See ya!

832
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,041
The feedback is
growing stronger.

833
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,500
I suspected as much.

834
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:53,875
Did you actually
gather food?

835
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,916
Talk about a sorry
supply of ingredients.

836
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Look at that. All you have
are two baby fruities...

837
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:02,166
And your basket!
It's completely empty!

838
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,583
And Maria...

839
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,333
It appears your homeland
never taught you

840
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,000
what actual
food looks like.

841
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,000
Excuse me?

842
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,833
Try not to be intimidated
by all the things we have.

843
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,916
Impressed?

844
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,666
Hey, what are you doing?

845
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,500
To be honest,
I'm rather astounded...

846
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,000
you did a perfect job

847
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,208
of gathering every single
deadly plant in the forest.

848
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,208
Poisonous again.

849
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,708
Oh, most impressive,
Lashara!

850
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,791
You've outdone us!
We lose!

851
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:45,291
Ultimately, hardly any of
you managed to harvest much.

852
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,875
This stupid game wasn't
fair to begin with.

853
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:50,166
I do believe
you are supposed to say

854
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,375
that before you
accept the challenge.

855
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,166
The contest shall be
between Kenshi and myself...

856
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,291
However, I have no intention
of asserting ownership over him.

857
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,458
You're kidding us...!

858
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,291
Then why are we even
bothering with this?

859
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,916
The point was merely to have
a friendly competition...

860
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,625
But still...

861
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,208
That doesn't mean I'm just going
to let you win without a fight!

862
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,833
I accept your challenge,
Princess Aura!

863
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,958
We shall begin
the taste testing!

864
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,791
Which stew has
the best taste...?

865
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,416
It's up to us
to determine the winner,

866
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,541
so everyone
go ahead and eat!

867
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,291
Wow, this is so delicious!

868
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,250
Thanks, everyone! I could
eat it for every meal!

869
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,833
Now it's time
to try Kenshi's stew!

870
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,166
How is it,
you guys...?

871
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,708
My sense of taste should
probably be the same

872
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,916
as yours, I think...

873
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,666
How did you do this?

874
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,875
Is it bad?
Oh no, I'm sorry.

875
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,625
No, it's just
the opposite!

876
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:53,208
How did you make
it so flavorful?!

877
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,458
Yum...!
This is amazing!

878
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,625
Indeed!

879
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,000
Aura's was good,
of course,

880
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:05,375
but yours is on an
entirely different level.

881
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,416
I'm seeing you in a
new light, Wild Beast.

882
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,500
It's decided...
Kenshi Masaki is the winner!

883
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,458
Wow. Thank you!

884
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,583
Now that the winner
has been determined,

885
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,250
I must return to work.

886
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,291
Thank you everyone for
a lovely distraction...

887
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,333
And Wild Beast, I'd appreciate
it if you'd make that again.

888
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,125
Okay...

889
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,583
Guess I'm still
a Wild Beast, though?

890
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:31,125
That's fine.

891
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,958
Lithia seems to be feeling
a lot better, doesn't she?

892
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,916
Yes, we have Kenshi's herbal
tea to thank for that.

893
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Well, that sure
was nice of you.

894
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,583
I actually used some of the same
ingredients in my stew broth.

895
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,250
Really?.

896
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:48,291
My pharmacist is very interested
in what those ingredients are.

897
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,625
Incredible...

898
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,375
Shurifon's knowledge
of herbal remedies surpasses

899
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,958
even the church...

900
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,791
And they want
advice from you...

901
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,125
That's a huge honor.

902
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,541
Is that all right with you...?

903
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,083
Would you mind showing me
what you used in this?

904
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,791
It's right here.

905
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,291
We want to see.

906
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,333
Yeah, okay.

907
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,666
Oh, you used these.
How interesting...

908
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,750
I never would have imagined
trying this myself.

909
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,750
Put that down!

910
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,416
Why does that not
freak you out?

911
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,666
Why should it?

912
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,666
Would you put those
things away already?!

913
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,958
What's wrong?
There's no need

914
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,916
for you guys to be
frightened of this stuff...

915
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,083
I promise I don't use 'em like
this when I make my remedies...

916
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:28,583
I dry them out first and
turn them into a powder.

917
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,250
Ew, gross; shut up!

918
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,500
We resolve not to get
sick, ever again...

919
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,625
We will not rely
on such medicine!

920
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:37,375
Kenshi, if Lady Lithia finds
out you use that kind of thing,

921
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,583
she'll kill you!

922
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,458
Yes... We should not
allow her to see them

923
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,708
in their original state.

924
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,333
Wait, I just thought
of something...

925
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:46,916
Didn't you tell us that you used
those in your cooking as well?

926
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,166
Yeah. I sure did...

927
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,291
Let me see here...

928
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,416
So this was what
brought out that flavor?

929
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,708
Right, and this, too...

930
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,083
You mean there's more?

931
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,041
This helped with texture.

932
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,291
Isn't it about time
you took a break, Miss?

933
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,916
Oh, thank you, Lapis...

934
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,291
I actually haven't felt
out of sorts all day...

935
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,541
Think that stew had
something to do with it?

936
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,750
I do! It's all
thanks to Kenshi.

937
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,416
Is it...? Well,
let's just leave it at that.

938
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,708
Summer vacation
is coming up soon.

939
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,083
And, it looks like I might
finish up work early.

940
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,875
Perhaps I'll be able
to enjoy this year.

941
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,125
Delicious...

942
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,250
Simply delicious.

943
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,791
The shining sun,
the blue sky,

944
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,958
and a remote resort
on a plateau!

945
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:15,125
It's finally time
for summer vacation!

946
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:17,166
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

947
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,458
Vacation.

948
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,625
Curse that woman!

949
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,583
We will make her pay
this time for sure!
