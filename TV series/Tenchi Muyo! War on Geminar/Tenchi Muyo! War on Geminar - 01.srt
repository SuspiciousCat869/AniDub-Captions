1
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,416
Blocks and guard shifts

2
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,541
for all countries in
attendance confirmed.

3
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,291
Yet another job well done!

4
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,250
Thanks. I was afraid I'd end up
breaking my operational limit.

5
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,500
Can you imagine
if word got out

6
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,791
I dirtied my cockpit
during the main event?

7
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,083
There'd go any luck I'd
have with any guy, ever.

8
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,625
I'm glad you didn't.

9
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,250
You know, it's funny...

10
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,500
I realize they're here for
Princess Lashara's coronation,

11
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,750
but...

12
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,458
I've never seen
so many ships before.

13
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,708
With Sir Dagmyer in front!

14
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,541
Even the male
Sacred Mechamasters

15
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,125
are in the guard shift.

16
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,791
Maybe I'll take a little
break and go say "hi" to him.

17
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,125
Well, if you get
the chance, good luck!

18
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,791
It's appreciated.

19
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,416
Oh... and don't forget to take
the bypath on your way back.

20
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,083
We don't want those
aho energy waves

21
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,541
from your Sacred Mechanoid
hurting anyone down there.

22
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
Will do!

23
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,000
Outta my way people,
coming through!

24
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,333
All these nobles
from all these countries

25
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,958
make quite the spectacle,
don't they...?

26
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,291
I suppose it's befitting
the honorable Shtrayu Empire,

27
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,416
though...

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,416
Or, rather...
befitting Lord Babalun.

29
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Perhaps.

30
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,333
With the King's death, Lord
Babalun has assumed control

31
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,625
of the country.

32
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
Although she may be young,

33
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,666
she is the daughter of the
Empress and the belated Emperor!

34
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,958
I doubt she'll go
down without a fight.

35
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,125
This should be
quite the show...

36
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,958
I take it you came to evaluate
the situation for yourself,

37
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,375
as well?

38
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,916
That...
is our target.

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,208
You mean...
the little girl?

40
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,333
That is correct.

41
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,791
And remember:

42
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,666
You don't have
the luxury of options.

43
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,583
It's here!

44
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,208
Do it... Now!

45
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,708
Come on, you can do this...

46
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,208
I don't have a choice!

47
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,791
I wanna go home!

48
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,250
Little Empress Lashara...

49
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,041
Your pathetically short
reign has come to an end.

50
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,166
I knew it...
The Sacred Mechalord...

51
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,333
The Sacred Mechanoids
just can't compare...

52
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,416
It's magnificent.

53
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,125
Think so?

54
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,875
Yes, it has an air of dignity
and power impenetrable by most.

55
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,708
We thought it décor
immovable by most.

56
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,333
My Empress...

57
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,583
Even though it was only
for your coronation,

58
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,708
Shtrayu is the sole nation
allowed to borrow it

59
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,750
from the church.

60
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,291
You should show
more respect.

61
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,041
It's so big
and heavy, though.

62
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,333
We still think
it's stupid.

63
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,625
The Koro alarm?!

64
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,958
What's going on?!

65
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,750
We've just been
attacked, Empress...!

66
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,000
An enemy
Sacred Mechanoid!

67
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,666
My, my...

68
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,333
Some people are
so impatient...

69
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,958
We had not
anticipated attacks

70
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,291
until after training
in the Holy Land.

71
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,250
How strange... The Koro
did not notice this adversary

72
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,541
until it was practically
on top of us.

73
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,625
I wonder who it could be...

74
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,875
This is not a good sign!

75
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,708
Chiaia...
what is it?

76
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,500
It's a white
Sacred Mechanoid!

77
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,833
A what?!

78
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,291
Not good...

79
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,208
Go to the helm and have them
take us as low as possible

80
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,833
while maintaining
current speed...

81
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,208
Take care of her.

82
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,083
The Empress
is in your hands.

83
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,250
You are the Captain...
so whatever you wish.

84
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,625
Chiaia, wait!

85
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,708
We have much
to ask this girl...

86
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:03,166
so give her a proper
welcome, won't you?

87
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,500
Would you like
for me to contact

88
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,875
the Pilgrimage
Route Guard?

89
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,500
No, we mustn't insult
Chiaia's honor...

90
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,833
On top of that, we hate
asking Aura for help.

91
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,333
This is no time for ego.

92
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,416
As you command.

93
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,958
Do you encourage her?

94
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,125
Not at all...

95
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,875
A white Sacred Mechanoid
is unprecedented.

96
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,541
We have no way to identify
the Mechamaster behind it.

97
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,291
We shall find out
once we capture her.

98
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,291
Are you aware this ship belongs
to Her Majesty Lashara Earth

99
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,583
of the Shtrayu Empire?

100
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,833
If you refuse to answer,

101
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,666
I have no problem
forcing one out of you.

102
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,833
She's good.

103
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,458
And strong.

104
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,291
Knowing Dame Chiaia, I'm sure
she will be perfectly fine.

105
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,041
If she's up against only one.

106
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,458
We have not seen a foe
such as this, after all.

107
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,750
You're mine!

108
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,541
How'd she dodge me?!

109
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,333
Mahya, no...!
Sir Ulyte!

110
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,708
Who are you?.

111
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,958
And who ordered you
to attack us...?

112
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,708
Yes... My father's new
contraption works well...

113
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,208
Prepare to die!

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,083
Who was that?

115
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,791
The Sacred Mechalord...
What happened?!

116
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,041
There was only supposed to be
one Sacred Mechanoid on SWAN!

117
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,625
Oh, yeah!

118
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,250
I just rescued Empress
Lashara like a pro!

119
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,291
Points totally
scored for me!

120
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,333
Curse her!

121
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,791
No! The Empress?!

122
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,500
He's worthless.

123
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,083
Freeze, fool...!
Wait up!!!

124
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,416
How dare you
try to stop me!

125
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,250
You're an idiot
to challenge me

126
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,666
with those pathetic
fighting skills.

127
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,166
Come, on...

128
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,166
You're about to be the guinea
pig for my new weapon...

129
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,000
Lucky you.

130
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,750
You're finished!

131
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,041
Yeah, okay...
How's this?!

132
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,541
No...!
This girl's a decoy.

133
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,500
Move it!

134
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,333
What was that?

135
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,541
Oh, yeah...!
Way to go me!

136
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,250
Impressive...

137
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,625
So that's what Wahanly's
rumored "gunpowder" can do.

138
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,708
This damage is bad.

139
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,250
I have no choice
but to retreat.

140
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,708
You're not goin'
anywhere, buddy!

141
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,041
Whoa!

142
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,625
Where did that
thing come from?

143
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,208
Wait, now there's a
black Sacred Mechanoid?!

144
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,208
What's this?

145
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,458
You're falling apart.

146
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,083
Silence!

147
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,041
Stop jabbering and take me
to a safe location immediately!

148
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,958
Is that any way to talk to
the lady who just saved you?

149
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,333
Wait right there!

150
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,291
I still have a buncha stuff
I wanna test out on you!

151
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,708
Hurry!

152
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,375
Tell me what you
think of this!

153
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,250
Oopsie!
Come on!

154
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,916
You're right...

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,416
I'd rather not
get hit, after all

156
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,583
Oh, wow...
That hurts...

157
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,791
I feel bad for her...

158
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,166
but not bad
enough to stop!

159
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,958
Why do you keep
trying to leave?!

160
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,833
It's just you and me now!

161
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,208
Useless imbecile!.

162
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,916
We failed because you
couldn't hold them at bay...!

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,791
I have to retreat, but you
must take responsibility

164
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,250
for your error and kill
Lashara yourself...!

165
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
If you succeed...

166
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,583
I shall keep my promise
and return you to your home.

167
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,875
She's fast, and that
fighting stance is powerful.

168
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,833
But I still see
fear in her blade.

169
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,625
Her tail?!

170
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,583
I don't think so!

171
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,791
There's another one.

172
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey there, looks like
somebody needs a little help!

173
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,458
You're supposed
to be in the workshop.

174
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,583
What are you doing here?

175
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,666
Rude! I'm the one
who saved the Empress!!

176
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,666
I don't have time
for your gadgets.

177
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,291
I'm a little busy
at the moment.

178
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,291
You were supposed to capture
her, not kill her, right?

179
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,958
So I was...

180
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,875
It's two to one now...!
We totally have the upper hand!

181
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,041
Don't let your guard down!

182
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,458
Her fighting stance
is unusual, at best!

183
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,375
Cool! It's tailed...

184
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,583
Looks pretty strong, too.

185
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,625
No... They
won't stop me...

186
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,833
I... Will...
Get back home!!!

187
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,875
What?!. She removed her
reactor's limiter!

188
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,791
What is that thing,
a monster?

189
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,958
She's amazing.
I wonder who she is.

190
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,541
Hit her!

191
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,375
Come on;
hit her already!!!

192
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,583
She has no limiter;
how's she okay?!

193
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,500
I don't know; she should
have passed out by now!

194
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,958
I'm out of ammo!

195
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,875
Oh great...
I've so gotta pee now.

196
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,875
What is going on now?!

197
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,666
She just hit her
operational limit!

198
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,708
Stop it!
I told you to stop!

199
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,791
The reactor is
over-accelerating!

200
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,291
Lashara...

201
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,333
Go now!

202
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,916
No!

203
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,083
Listen to me, Wahanly...

204
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,916
Oh please, not now!

205
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,583
You certainly put
on quite the show...

206
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,375
Sacred Mechamaster...

207
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,541
You...

208
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,250
You're not a girl?

209
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,041
I'm not.

210
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,208
Well, then...

211
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,708
We would not mind getting
killed by a Sacred Mechamaster

212
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,750
as strong as you.

213
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,416
Let's go...
I'm taking you with me.

214
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,083
Oh...? Are you saying you
wish to elope with us...?

215
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,666
Not that it isn't an
ever-so-tempting proposal...

216
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,291
But you appear
to be suffering

217
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,666
from a nasty case
of aho sickness...

218
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,041
Unfortunately, you are hardly
up to whisking us away.

219
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,458
Although, we must admit,
it is rather impressive

220
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,083
you can still move
after all you've done.

221
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,875
Why you-

222
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,375
It seems you still have
some fight left in you.

223
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,916
Hold on...

224
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,625
He's a guy?!

225
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,208
Stop!

226
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,500
Not only did he attack and
try to kill you, Empress,

227
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,375
he managed to break into
your chambers by himself.

228
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,666
You know only one man
is allowed in here.

229
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,916
It's fine.

230
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,625
But if people started
to doubt your purity,

231
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,000
it would damage the empire.

232
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,791
Which is not a problem if
people do not find out...

233
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,958
But primarily,
he is a precious witness

234
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,750
to the planning of
tonight's incident.

235
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,791
Male Sacred Mechamasters
are so rare;

236
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,625
it's difficult
to believe someone

237
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,333
would waste him
as an assassin.

238
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,791
We doubt he is even
a true assassin.

239
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
If he were serious...

240
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,958
he would have killed us when
he walked through the door.

241
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,541
True enough.

242
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,000
Whoever is behind this

243
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,166
has decided to use him
as a sacrificial pawn,

244
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,625
so who is to say we cannot
take him for ourselves.

245
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,916
But why?!

246
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,625
Think about it-he is
a young, powerful,

247
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,291
male Sacred Mechamaster...

248
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,625
We think he would sell for
a high price-do you not agree?

249
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,708
So... Lord Babalun has
finally made his move...

250
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,708
Who do you think will win?

251
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,416
How can you be so blasé?!

252
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,875
That man is dangerous!

253
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,708
It will merely
be a civil war

254
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,833
if no one contacts
the other countries...

255
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,416
This is hardly uncommon when
there's a shift in power...

256
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
More importantly...
He is correct.

257
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,750
In truth, our priority
at this time

258
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,208
should lie with the Sacred
Mechalord, above all else.

259
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,791
Centuries have passed
since we excavated it.

260
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,791
Why does it move now?

261
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,833
Your role has become...
exceedingly grave.

262
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,333
Look who's awake.

263
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,833
Ew...! Gross!

264
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,291
How many days in a row
did you wear those...?

265
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,625
They were filthy, so I went
ahead and washed them for you.

266
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,583
Now then, let's not
waste any more time.

267
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,083
I have a few questions
I need to ask you.

268
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,250
First I'm supposed
to say if you cooperate,

269
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,166
we will treat you well.

270
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,083
And please don't tell me you
think your nasty little friends

271
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,041
are planning
to come rescue you.

272
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,208
It's not gonna happen...

273
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,208
You're nothing more
than an expendable pawn.

274
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,458
Fine...

275
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,500
Just stay here forever
for all I care... Bye.

276
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,916
Oh, one more thing...

277
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,250
and you might want
to pay attention

278
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,833
because this
is very important.

279
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,833
You should probably
not tell anyone

280
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,416
you entered Empress
Lashara's bedroom,

281
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,958
because if you do, we will
execute you immediately.

282
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,375
Ooh, I can see him!

283
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,500
See who?

284
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,541
What are you
looking at?

285
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,958
It's him!

286
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,416
Oh, him! The boy
Dame Chiaia captured.

287
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,375
I can't believe
he's so young...

288
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,750
Is it just me,

289
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,375
or does he kinda look like
a little Koro in there?

290
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:18,416
Spying on our detainee
is unacceptable.

291
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,208
Lady Mahya!

292
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,458
I suppose
that's the boy?

293
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,500
Does something
about him upset you?

294
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,125
No... Nothing at all.

295
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,625
But Dame Wahanly does
have work to do...

296
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,250
Once you finish
checking for damages,

297
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,416
please deliver your report
to me straight away.

298
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,041
Yes, ma'am!

299
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,916
Empress Lashara,
why did you not report

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,291
what happened last night
to the nation?.

301
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,666
It is rather obvious who
these vicious attackers were.

302
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,125
Because they are the
most dangerous nation.

303
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,791
Lord Babalun.
But he's a good man.

304
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,250
That's true...
Good but...

305
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,250
Ambitious
above all else.

306
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,458
That man has nothing at all
to gain by assassinating us...

307
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,958
We also fail to understand
why he chose last night,

308
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,791
in particular, to resort
to such ugly methods.

309
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,125
You believe other
powers might be at work?

310
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,291
We are still attempting
to find that out...

311
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,125
Not to mention, letting
others beat up on us

312
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,916
is so not our style.

313
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,375
Find out how...?

314
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,208
We can barely even protect
the SWAN right now as it is.

315
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,958
Not true;
we have two Mechas.

316
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,958
So does that mean you're
planning to hire Wahanly?

317
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,541
She can quit the
Barrier Workshop now...

318
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:36,708
We could definitely
use her help

319
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,125
with repairing the SWAN...

320
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,083
not to mention your
damaged Sacred Mechanoid.

321
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,375
I suppose...

322
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,833
Her saving us was
too good to be true...

323
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:45,875
Right?

324
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:46,875
Right...

325
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,208
Right!

326
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,791
And there are some
not-so-great rumors about her.

327
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,458
Your majesty...

328
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,333
It may not sit well with you,

329
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,666
but the Pilgrimage Route Guard
should really be informed.

330
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,291
Then, you must hasten
back to the Holy Land.

331
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,833
But that would make
the enemy pull back...

332
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,416
If we do not get something
good on them quite soon...

333
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,375
even the Holy Land
won't be safe.

334
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,500
Come in!

335
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,500
Good morning,
Empress!

336
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,458
I'm glad you came...

337
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,208
You were marvelous
last night.

338
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,916
Nah...

339
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,333
It was nothing-I would
do anything for you.

340
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,666
Thank you...

341
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,875
What is that
you have there?

342
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,625
Just research materials
from the Barrier Workshop.

343
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,583
I can totally explain
all of them to you

344
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,916
if you have
a few minutes.

345
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,083
Wow...

346
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,083
First last night's
heroics and now this-

347
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,250
you certainly
are prepared.

348
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:42,041
Actually, last night was just
like a weird coincidence!

349
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,583
I had a couple of weapons I can
only test in the Holy Land,

350
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,500
but I wanted to show
them to you first.

351
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,291
You mean you fought with
that thing before testing it?!

352
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,500
'Tis fine...

353
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,333
We found the weapon
to be most impressive.

354
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,458
Does this container of yours
hold similar weaponry,

355
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:56,875
by chance?

356
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,750
Yep, by chance it does.

357
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,375
How very exciting...

358
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,250
Incidentally,
do you have any idea

359
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,458
who the attacker
might have been?

360
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:08,250
No... I'm sorry;
I don't.

361
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,208
Oh, Chiaia; I forgot to ask-Did
that intruder you found down

362
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,916
by the forest provide you
with any information of use?

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,458
He hasn't said a thing.

364
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,208
Rumor has it
he's just a boy.

365
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,958
What if he was the pilot
for that Sacred Mechanoid?

366
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,041
Oh yeah, like
that could happen!.

367
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:28,000
Who ever heard of a male Sacred
Mechamaster assassin before?!

368
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,791
Seriously.

369
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,666
One more thing, did
you find anything out

370
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,458
about the White
Sacred Mechanoid?

371
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:40,041
I did; she used a basic model
supplied by the Church...

372
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,458
That Mecha wasn't altered
at all, like even a little.

373
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:47,208
Meaning... All that power
belonged to the pilot.

374
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,416
Yeah, I hope she doesn't come
back; she was really strong.

375
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,000
How long will
the repairs take?

376
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,250
Well, mine'll be
done in no time...

377
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:57,250
But yours're gonna
take a bit; so sorry.

378
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,833
So, basically, we're down
to one Sacred Mechanoid?

379
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:03,041
Don't worry...!
I am all over it...!

380
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,750
I kinda had a feeling
this would happen.

381
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,791
Empress Lashara!

382
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,916
She's here!

383
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,583
Wait... my sister?

384
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,625
Now we have
two Mechanoids...

385
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,666
At least until
yours is fixed.

386
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,208
Oh, Lashara!

387
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,958
You've grown so much since
the last time I saw you!

388
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,416
Sister! Her Majesty Lashara
is the Empress of Shtrayu, now!

389
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,958
I missed your
coronation, too.

390
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,250
I'm so sorry.

391
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,750
Okay, Mexiah, why
did you come here?

392
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,000
Your loving sister flew
all night to get to you,

393
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,541
and this is how you act?

394
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,291
Stop! That seriously hurt!

395
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,083
Teachers from the Holy Land
are supposed to be prohibited

396
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,750
from aiding specific
countries in any way.

397
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,791
That rule doesn't
matter if I'm trying

398
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,458
to protect a
student though...

399
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,583
You know it's true.

400
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,375
Plus, we're borrowing the Sacred
Mechalord from the church,

401
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,125
so she's fine.

402
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,625
We're right?.
Right?

403
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,208
Exactly right,
Empress.

404
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,541
Now then, you can
focus on the repairs...

405
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,583
Chiaia... you fill Mexiah
in on what's happened.

406
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,708
Now we just
have to wait...

408
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:24,291
Let's hope the fish decides
to take our tasty bait.

409
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,250
A black and a white
Sacred Mechanoid...

410
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,458
How strange...

411
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,875
Where are their pilots?

412
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,666
They all got away.

413
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,416
But you did catch
that boy wandering

414
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,333
around by the forest...

415
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,625
Did he tell you
anything useful?

416
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,958
Nothing yet...

417
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,125
He won't talk.

418
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,166
It's probably those
scary eyes of your,

419
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,958
they frighten
all the boys.

420
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,791
I don't frighten boys!

421
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,250
Poor thing.

422
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,041
Don't you feel bad leaving
him out there like that?.

423
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,958
You should at least put
him somewhere warmer.

424
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,708
That defeats the point
of torturing him!

425
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:10,916
Help yourself...

426
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,708
You're hungry,
aren't you?

427
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,416
Rumor has it you
refuse to speak...

428
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,375
I hope that's not true because I
would love to know your name...

429
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,541
I'm Ulyte, by the way.

430
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,708
I'm...

431
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,208
Kenshi...

432
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,791
Masaki.

433
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,833
Kenshi...

434
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,708
Masaki...

435
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,208
That's a rather
unusual name.

436
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,916
Are you
by chance from...

437
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,666
No... of course you're not;
how silly of me.

438
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,875
Well...
Enjoy, Kenshi!

439
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,375
Well done,
Sir Ulyte...!

440
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,791
You got him
to reveal his name.

441
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,333
No fair;
I wanted to do that!

442
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,708
"Kenshi," huh...?
Call me crazy,

443
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,291
but he doesn't seem
like he would be part

444
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,500
of an assassination attempt.

445
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,916
Either way,

446
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,083
I do feel bad leaving
him out there in the cold.

447
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:09,083
Still, you have to admit he's
kinda cute when he shivers.

448
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,291
It is not easy to witness,
but we follow procedures

449
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,750
in case he is an ally to those
who attacked the Empress...

450
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,416
These things must be done.

451
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,166
You are all making it sound
as if we were an evil monster.

452
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:33,750
We refuse to let even a prisoner
believe we are a monster...

453
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,250
We would never damage
our precious merchandise.

454
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,791
Merchandise?

455
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,833
We mean precious witness...

456
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,791
It would be a
loss if you died.

457
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,750
A loss?

458
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:47,000
Anyway, stay right here
and try to be good.

459
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,375
And be sure not to tell Chiaia
we brought this to you.

460
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,500
She is...
inflexible...

461
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,291
She's the one who has a somewhat
hostile look all the time...

462
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,625
Don't let her get
to you though;

463
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,666
she just has an
odd personality.

464
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,625
What...?!
Oh no...!

465
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,166
Chiaia!

466
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,250
Hi! We didn't
see you there!

467
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,250
You'll have to excuse
this viciously hostile

468
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,333
look on my face;

469
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,666
I can't help it-

470
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,583
I just have one of those
odd personalities.

471
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:17,583
We only said
'somewhat' hostile.

472
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,291
Please,
big brother...

473
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,708
Big sister...

474
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,708
Big sis...

475
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,333
The Koro seem to really
like you; it's fascinating.

476
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,666
Um! Who are you?

477
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,375
You have,
a big sister...?

478
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,791
She's not here, but I'd be happy
to take her place if you want.

479
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,166
What is it now?

480
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,833
Mexiah... what in the crap
are you doing in there?!

481
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,541
What?
He looked cold.

482
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,208
Why are you naked?!

483
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,166
Obviously,
I'm warming him up.

484
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,541
I've heard this is the best
way to get the job done.

485
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,166
He's not that cold.

486
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,708
No one is!

487
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,541
I swear; you are
so ridiculous.

488
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,625
Aw, I couldn't help myself;
the little guy was freezing!

489
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:37,958
Who cares?

490
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,500
That didn't mean you had
to get naked with him!

491
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,958
See you later, Kenshi!

492
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,541
You messed up,
Kenshi.

493
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,833
Doll!

494
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,541
Ready?

495
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:15,708
Nice...
She took the bait.

496
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,500
Dark Elves on the
Pilgrimage Route Guard...

497
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,208
There is an uninvited
guest in your airspace.

498
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,458
Dame Chiaia!

499
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,708
What is it?

500
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,833
That boy...
he escaped somehow!

501
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,125
Why isn't the Koro
alarm going off?

502
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,333
Chiaia?!

503
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,375
We have to admit, we are
a little eager to see

504
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,375
what we catch this evening.

505
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,791
Chiaia, you can't...! Your
knight frame has to be sent

506
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,833
to the Church for final
repairs; it's still broken!

507
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,500
Fine. Then I'll borrow yours.

508
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,083
Okay, but try to be careful!

509
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,500
Mine still hasn't been
fully restored, either.

510
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:04,208
That's weird.

511
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,833
Where did Mexiah's
knight frame go?

512
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,833
It's supposed to be
right over there.

513
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:15,375
Why have you not
finished Lashara off?!

514
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,833
How tragic.

515
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,458
You're from another world,
but this is all you've got.

516
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:20,458
Search him!

517
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,083
Yes sir!

518
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,583
He's wearing an aho magic
transmission circle!

519
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,833
I suspected as much.

520
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,375
Well, that was
surprisingly fast...

521
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:39,166
But it was certainly enough
for some valuable insight.

522
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,750
You're up, Chiaia.

523
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,958
How did the princess
win you over?.

524
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,208
Did she...

525
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,083
tell you she'd give you
whatever you wanted?

526
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,416
No... No.

527
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,333
Playing dumb?

528
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,541
I didn't say...

529
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,833
anything...

530
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,375
Either way...
It is no matter...

531
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,791
I had planned for you to die
here from the very beginning.

532
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,416
We had a deal.

533
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,875
Do you mean how I would send
you back to your world...?

534
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,458
We only needed you
to kill Lashara.

535
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:12,500
You're a pawn, and an
expendable one at that.

536
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,250
You're nothing more
than an expendable pawn.

537
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,458
Besides, we don't exactly have
the means to send you back.

538
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,250
You lied to me.

539
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,750
Goodbye.

540
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,833
What are you
waiting for?.

541
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,833
Kill him already!

542
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,916
I want him dead!

543
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,166
Go!.

544
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,541
Get him!

545
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,125
Why are you laughing...?

546
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,625
You should be
finishing him off!

547
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,291
You want me
to kill Kenshi...?

548
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,708
With my hands...?

549
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:08,541
Surely you jest.

550
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,458
How dare you?!

551
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,750
Registry: unknown...

552
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,166
It's just
as we were told...

553
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,791
Yes.

554
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,208
You dare humiliate me?!

555
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,125
You owe me for everything
I've done for you.

556
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,708
Interesting...

557
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:46,958
Oh no...

558
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,125
You've gotten sick,
haven't you?

559
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,625
I don't like the idea
of him dying here...

560
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:02,750
How will you act,
Aura Shurifon.

561
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,875
Dissention
in the ranks?

562
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,916
What's going on?

563
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,208
What is Aura doing here?

564
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,791
I should have thought
about this first.

565
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,833
I wonder who's inside
that Mechanoid.

566
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,958
I can't even attack, let
alone move quickly...

567
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,291
I should bring him inside.

568
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,291
No, a Sacred
Mechanoid's aho waves

569
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,208
are dangerous to commoners...

570
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:39,125
What do I do?

571
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,000
Is that...
Gunfire...?

572
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,708
The boy!

573
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,416
Fine; I'll kill both of you!

574
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,958
I need help.

575
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,250
I'm pleased
you rescued him.

576
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,708
Let me help.

577
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,416
Who was that?

578
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,875
Chiaia Flan!

579
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,333
If it isn't Aura Shurifon!

580
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,416
It's the boy!

581
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,291
You go on ahead.
I'll take care of this.

582
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,083
Gladly.

583
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,500
This might be more obstacles
than I can handle...

584
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,708
I need to retreat.

585
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,458
Please, Princess Shurifon,
you can't go in!

586
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,041
As we are on a pilgrimage,
the SWAN has special rights...

587
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,291
My apologies,
but you cannot enter.

588
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,291
But as a member of the
Pilgrimage Route Guard,

589
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,458
I cannot let this go...

590
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,291
I will need some answers.

591
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,791
I'll certainly explain
the situation...

592
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,541
However, first I would like
you to surrender him to me.

593
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,250
This boy is my
exclusive witness...

594
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,666
Meaning I won't simply
hand him over...

595
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,583
And I would prefer to
hear your explanation

596
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,250
from Empress
Lashara herself.

597
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:12,083
I only informed HQ that I
saw something suspicious...

598
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,708
As long as the situation
is reasonable,

599
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:15,458
I won't need
to report it.

600
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,708
Stay back.

601
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,708
'Tis fine.

602
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,958
She has our
permission to board.

603
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,750
Empress Lashara Earth...

604
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,041
Please pardon my demeanor
during this crisis.

605
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,625
Of course...

606
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,958
It would be highly inappropriate
to discuss these matters here...

607
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,541
Would you care
to talk over tea?.

608
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,125
Chiaia.

609
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,208
As the one who just
saved this boy's life...

610
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,541
I will keep him until
I understand the situation.

611
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,041
I heard Kenshi's back!

612
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,583
Mexiah...?
Where have you been?!

613
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,666
Miss Mexiah!
What are you doing here?

614
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,333
Oh no...

615
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,916
I'm sorry... but it's likely
aho sickness from my Mechanoid.

616
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,125
It's worse...

617
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,541
Look at that rash!

618
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,083
It's Rodeshiatore...

619
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,583
The altitude sickness.

620
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,750
Rodeshia-what?

621
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,333
He's gotta be
from somewhere

622
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,333
that has a really
high altitude...

623
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:10,458
Rodeshiatore is an illness
specifically from the Ena Ocean.

624
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,583
So you've had it, too?

625
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,333
Oh, no way; I'm fine...

626
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,791
But I've already had
the vaccination for it...

627
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,500
If this boy's got it,
he could die.

628
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,333
We've gotta do something;
he's burning up.

629
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:29,333
Honestly, I'm surprised
you tried killing him...

630
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:30,708
Reckless behavior.

631
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:33,750
It's too dangerous
to let him live!

632
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,000
Jealous of someone
better than you?

633
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,958
If we allow him to live,
he'll reveal who we are.

634
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,708
We're dealing with
the princess...

635
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:42,791
I'm assuming she
already knows.

636
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,625
That's all the more
reason to destroy

637
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,208
whatever evidence
is left out there!

638
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:51,041
Focus on killing Lashara
before she enters the Holy Land.

639
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,791
Yes, sir.

640
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,916
Prepare to launch
the Sacred Mechanoid...!

641
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,041
And move the ship before
the Pilgrimage Route Guard

642
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,833
gets here!

643
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,958
At this rate, he has about
six hours before he falls

644
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,708
into a coma and suffers
heart failure.

645
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,375
I know...! I've heard
if the shot isn't good enough,

646
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,791
and you get sick anyway,

647
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,250
a natural antidote
is the Triam herb!

648
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,666
Oh...

649
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,000
Triam is rarely
used as medicine,

650
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,875
so we don't normally
carry any on board.

651
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,291
Then I shall go
and find some.

652
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,541
I'll go with you!

653
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,583
We leave the SWAN in your
more than capable hands.

654
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,875
Triam grows in the shallows
of rivers and lakes,

655
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,125
but we may have
difficulty finding

656
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,416
any since the herb
is not in season.

657
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,458
There's not much time...

658
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,208
Let's split up, shall we?

659
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,791
Agreed...

660
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:58,833
So he is from another world,
just as I suspected...

661
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:01,500
How, I wonder, did
they summon him here?

662
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,250
It is of no matter...

663
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,791
at the moment we must
focus on keeping him alive.

664
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:12,083
Your pacing is
making me nervous.

665
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,958
Quit worrying about
me and get that done!

666
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,958
They could come back and
strike at any moment!

667
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,375
Oh crap! I wasn't ready
for them to show up...

668
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,041
This sucks...!

669
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,833
What're we gonna do?!
I'm not done with it, yet!

670
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:29,166
Guess I'll just have
to go with skill.

671
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,125
Well, well... Someone's
overly confident, huh?

672
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,583
There are three enemy
Sacred Mechanoids...!

673
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,791
Change course
above the Draft!

674
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,375
Moving above the Draft.

675
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,583
Attack!

676
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,666
Looks like the number one
Reactor Ring is hit, sir!

677
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,500
We can't increase the power!

678
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,875
They managed to damage
our large Barrier Reactor.

679
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,750
Those aren't normal
Sacred Mechanoids.

680
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,791
One of them is missing...

681
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,875
Three-to-one is
hardly even a fight!

682
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:07,166
No... I can't
win against three...

683
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,916
What if I used his
fighting style...?

684
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,916
She's gone!

685
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,166
That's so rough on
the knight frame...

686
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,250
I can't believe he managed
to fight like this!

687
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,333
Crazy...

688
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,541
I just don't have the power!

689
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:27,583
What's wrong?

690
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,333
Dead already?

691
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,875
Who's that?!

692
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,791
Impressed?

693
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,125
Triam should be
somewhere around here.

694
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,791
I know it.

695
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,541
Who's there?!

696
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,333
Shocking dodge.

697
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,333
Well played.

698
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,625
A Black Mechanoid?

699
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,750
You're done!

700
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,041
What?!

701
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,666
If you had that, why
did you wait to use it?!

702
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,041
Watch your tone;
remember, I'm the one

703
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,625
who just saved
your big ol' butt!

704
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,333
And, so you know, this bad boy
takes a little time to activate.

705
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,916
You're certainly
a tough one...

706
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,500
But you'll be reaching
your limit, soon.

707
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,625
Where is Miss Mexiah?

708
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,791
I need her help...

709
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,958
Focus... We have to get
the Triam to that boy!

710
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,541
Not now...

711
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,750
My operational limits.

712
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,166
I can't move...!

713
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,166
Was that her
Dark Elf Field...?

714
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,791
No... I've lost.

715
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:16,916
I can't believe I had
to activate my field.

716
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,833
That was pathetic, Aura...

717
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,166
It doesn't matter
how strong a weapon is

718
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,541
if you can't hit the target.

719
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,416
I'm still here, sir

720
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,791
If you can still move,

721
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,000
retrieve the other knight
and retreat immediately!

722
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,791
But... sir!

723
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,125
I can handle this
on my own...

724
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,083
Don't leave
any evidence... Go!

725
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,333
Right.

726
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,208
What is that...?!
Are you kidding me?.

727
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,166
Your reaction time is awful!

728
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,958
Wow... That stupid
jerk is fast...!

729
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,125
Crap!

730
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,166
I'm out of ammo!

731
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,250
Without any bullets, you're
fighting with a mere toy.

732
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,458
Not good!

733
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,833
Oh...
What is that?

734
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,458
Aura...
are you okay?

735
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,250
A black Sacred
Mechanoid appeared.

736
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,750
What?

737
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,291
And you faced it alone?
Why didn't you let me know?

738
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,875
It doesn't matter;
did you find the herb?

739
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:18,583
Yes...

740
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,708
This is Triam, isn't it?

741
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:23,458
Yes, it is...
Let's head back, quickly.

742
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,375
Why's she so weak?

743
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,541
She must have
activated her field.

744
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,833
We have to go.

745
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:34,666
I swear, Aura, you
are beyond stubborn.

746
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,083
Try not to push
it too hard...

747
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,833
You still haven't been
baptized, you know.

748
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,458
Yes, I'm aware.

749
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,791
A Sacred Mechanoid
of unknown alliance

750
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,791
and a black Sacred
Mechanoid...

751
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:49,291
What in the world
is going on?

752
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,083
What now?

753
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,541
Hello.

754
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,625
You fool!

755
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,375
We got him!

756
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:10,875
What?!

757
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,833
Oops...!
I guess I missed!

758
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,750
Your aim is the worst!

759
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:23,208
I know...!
Quit reminding me!

760
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,916
Curse you!

761
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,625
What the?!

762
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:31,500
Mexiah!

763
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,750
I knew it...

764
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,083
Doll screwed this
up completely!

765
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,791
I'm done here.

766
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,833
I've seen that stance and
fighting style before...

767
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,375
Don't tell me it's
who I think it is.

768
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,375
You're back!

769
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:19,458
I heard Lashara and the others
entered the Holy Land territory.

770
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,333
I need you to lend
Doll to me again.

771
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:24,791
Doll shall remain asleep
until the time is right.

772
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,750
Concentrate on
personal duties, now...

773
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,875
Unfortunately, we've no time
to waste on the princess...

774
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:33,416
Understood, sir.

775
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,916
Wonderful!.
You're finally awake!

776
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,166
Your fever is gone.

777
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,625
It's surprising.

778
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,208
The herbs are good, but you're
still recovering swiftly.

779
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,041
I hope you appreciate
all of this.

780
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:06,750
And don't worry
about paying us back;

781
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,375
you can just
do it whenever.

782
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,500
Will you shut up?

783
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,958
Um... Thank you so much.

784
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,000
Come here!

785
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:23,625
Oh!

786
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,833
Back off, crazy.
He's recovering!

787
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:26,958
Now get some rest.

788
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:29,833
Go back to sleep
until morning.

789
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:35,041
We suppose we could all
stand to take that advice.

790
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,333
Beautiful...

791
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,166
Behold, Kenshi...!

792
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,791
That is the academy
for Sacred Mechamasters!

793
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:02,000
Isn't it fun how so much stuff
happens as soon as we get there?

794
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,416
Next, on Tenchi Muyo!

795
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,708
War on Geminar:
To the Holy Land!

796
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:08,458
I guess it's time
for your glorious debut!
