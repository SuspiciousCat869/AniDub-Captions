1
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,916
Nice!

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,500
You can totally tell
future Sacred Mechamaster

3
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,416
lords and ladies
hang out here.

4
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,541
Talk about fancy.

5
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,458
It's not only Sacred
Mechamasters...

6
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,333
Royalty and nobility
attend school here as well.

7
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,458
You need to be...

8
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,166
Lan... Be careful
not to draw

9
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,958
any attention
to yourself, at all...

10
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,166
We cannot afford

11
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,875
to have you jeopardizing
Sir Dagmyer's plans;

12
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,208
do you understand?

13
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,875
Sure... Whatever
you say, Lady Emera!

14
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,083
Ugh...

15
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,000
We're dying from boredom now
that summer vacation is over...

16
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,333
There has to be something
fun to do! Doesn't there?

17
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,250
Have anything
particular in mind?

18
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,625
Oh, we dunno...

19
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,333
make some quick and
easy money in a way

20
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,833
that doesn't require us
to put up any capital?

21
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,291
Yeah, right.

22
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,416
Don't get your hopes up.

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Things like that
don't just happen.

24
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,583
I totally see what
you're saying.

25
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,500
Is something
the matter?

26
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,041
It's ridiculous.

27
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,916
This is way too easy.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,291
I don't think we could
if we tried

29
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,291
Excuse me;
did you drop this?

30
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,291
Sorry?

31
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,041
Oh, yeah.
That is my watch...

32
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,708
How weird; I thought
it was in my pouch.

33
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,875
It must have
fallen out then.

34
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,291
Gone!

35
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,166
When did he
take it from me?

36
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,208
I know him.

37
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,875
Lan...! What exactly were you
thinking running off like that,

38
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:25,625
and what are
you doing here?

39
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,291
I just went on a walk...

40
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,583
Hey... What about him...?
What is that guy's story?

41
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,958
Who in the world is he?

42
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,708
Thank you so much!
Yeah, that was so crazy!


43
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,958
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm still amazed

44
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,666
how easy it was to sneak
into the Holy Land.

45
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,083
Yeah, well I'm still amazed

46
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,791
how much they let us just
screw around all day.

47
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,708
This is the best
job I've ever had.

48
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,500
Seriously! And how crazy
is the power they give away

49
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,083
to those Sacred Mechamasters...?

50
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,625
Well, at least one of
'em is keeping the boss

51
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,250
in a good mood, though.

52
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,333
Whaddaya wanna bet she's in
the middle of a really good mood

53
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,958
right now?

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,958
Once she's pregnant,
she'll be as privileged

55
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,250
as the nobles they got
prancin' around here.

56
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,125
Think her kid'll wind up being
a Sacred Mechamaster, too?

57
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,833
Be great to have some of
that luck rub off on me.

58
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,333
With that face?
Keep dreamin', sister.

59
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,750
Sorry... I would
rather not be forced

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,291
to confine
you to my ship,

61
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,000
but... there is a significant
chance you'd be recognized,

62
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,500
and that's simply not a risk
I am willing to take.

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,125
I don't mind...

64
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,583
Everyone else is enjoying
themselves anyway,

65
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,625
so it's not a big deal.

66
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,916
Tell me...

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,625
Is the plan
moving along okay?

68
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,625
Yes...

69
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,583
It's all right
on schedule.

70
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,625
Good...

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,583
When you first explained
the gig to me in Havoniwa,

72
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,125
I wondered what this young,
naïve lord was talking about...

73
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,708
I only half believed
you were serious

74
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,500
when I accepted
your offer.

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,000
To be honest...

76
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,791
I still find it hard to
believe you actually got us

77
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,958
inside the Holy Land.

78
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,250
I don't know why...

79
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,000
I thought I told you that
I am not like other men.

80
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,375
And I thought I told you I'll
give you all I've got to give.

81
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,750
And I'll take it all.

82
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,625
Well, look
what we have here.

83
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,250
Word has it you're
Lashara's servant...

84
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,500
So, what did ya do before
you started working for her?

85
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,250
I... I was...

86
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,500
in the highlands...
And uh...

87
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't lie to me.

88
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,416
I'm not...

89
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,750
It's the truth.
Yeah, I'm not buying it.

90
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,500
We're used to the
same line of work...

91
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,875
You don't have
to hide it from me.

92
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,750
It's not like I'm
gonna tell anyone.

93
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,583
In fact, I have a pretty
juicy gig coming up...

94
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,625
Want in on the action?

95
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,583
Oh I get it, now.

96
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,833
Come on, you should have a
little fun working with me.

97
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,875
Unlike your lame job
being a servant,

98
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,666
it'll put your
talents to use.

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,750
You shouldn't do stuff
like that anymore.

100
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,666
Bye!

101
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,833
Well... Guess that's what
I get for trying to help...

102
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,500
The dumb guy's
been domesticated.

103
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,041
C'mon, your retreat
pattern's too simple!

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,708
Well done, Alan!

105
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,666
You should put more
thought into your patterns.

106
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,916
Yeah, I know.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,916
They appear to be coming
along quite nicely.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,791
They're ready for combat.

109
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,041
Trust me...

110
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,958
how are things proceeding
on your end, Uncle?

111
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,083
All that's left is
a final confirmation...

112
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,916
And after that,
we'll be ready to go.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,166
And how much longer do you
think that will take you?

114
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,333
I suppose that answer would
depend on whether or not

115
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,208
you're willing to help
me out with something.

116
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,000
Say the word.
What do you need?

117
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,166
A competitive
sports tournament?

118
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,500
Yes... It gives us
the opportunity

119
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,041
to test the results
of our training

120
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,500
and promotes friendship
among Mechamasters

121
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,958
from different lands.

122
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,666
But if I'm going to
be honest with you...

123
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,208
The tournament's
real purpose...

124
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,500
is to prevent those
dorm room humdrums,

125
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
also known as boredom.

126
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,583
How interesting...
The main event...

127
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,625
is a long-distance
obstacle race...

128
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,958
That sounds like fun.

129
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,375
Thank you...

130
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,666
I figured we could hold
preliminaries during class,

131
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,125
so it shouldn't be
too demanding.

132
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,333
Good job...
And we think we know

133
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,916
how to get the students excited
about who will win the race.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,208
Gambling...? And I
suppose you also think

135
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,416
you should be the bookie?

136
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,875
Well naturally!

137
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,791
That's hardly necessary;
based on the size of the event;

138
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,500
the council's monthly
budget should cover it

139
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,875
without taking bets.

140
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,833
Yes, but do you really
think the council should pay

141
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,416
to keep students
from getting bored?

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,125
Expose anyone who would cheat
and try to maintain order...

143
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,916
Do that, and I will
give my approval.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,916
Understood.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,166
All right, then...

146
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,250
It doesn't appear
a vote will be necessary...

147
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,916
but just in case, does
anyone oppose this event?

148
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,333
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the motion is approved;

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,083
we're going
to have a tournament.

150
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,166
Uncle... the vote
has just been passed.

151
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,000
That's wonderful...
You have done rather well.

152
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,416
I expect you to keep
your promise to me now.

153
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,625
You must be talking about
allowing you to be in charge

154
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,291
of the front lines...
I can do that.

155
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,416
However...

156
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,041
I will still need
to have some assurance

157
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,375
my needs are getting
met, as well.

158
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,166
You always were
the one to worry.

159
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,416
Only because I realize

160
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,625
trust is born from one's
track record, nephew.

161
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,041
Yes, I am well
aware of that...!

162
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,583
Excuse me.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,958
Do you think those thugs
Dagmyer brought in

164
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,000
are going
to become a problem?

165
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,333
At the moment, they are keeping
quiet and staying low...

166
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,458
But that girl, Lan, is more
than a little mischievous.

167
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,875
Well, either way...

168
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,333
The hardest part
is still to come...

169
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,125
We don't have
a choice here...

170
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,041
Failure is simply
not an option.

171
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,166
Talk about
a piece-a-cake.

172
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,541
What in the world
is wrong with you...?

173
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,250
I thought I specifically told
you not to attract attention!

174
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,375
Will you relax? No one
even knew I was there.

175
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,583
Now, whaddaya plan
on doing with that?

176
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,916
I will not allow you to cause
problems for Sir Dagmyer.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,458
Sure... Okay...

178
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,958
Hey, Dagmyer!

179
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,083
Aw, no...

180
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,458
You don't know
how weak you are.

181
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,916
What's going on here?

182
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,666
Ya know, just makin' sure
I don't lose my touch.

183
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,666
Forgive us, sir.

184
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,916
Why would you waste time
with such tasteless appetizers

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,333
when the main dish
is coming up?

186
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,125
I grabbed them
while doing recon...

187
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,916
Besides, you can use
this to help get

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,666
to that main dish faster...

189
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,083
Maybe start a few
fights or something fun.

190
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,000
We'll be pushing the
plan forward soon...

191
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,291
So try not to attract
any attention.

192
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,875
Fine...

193
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,958
I just don't like to let all
this easy prey go to waste.

194
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,583
Yes, thank you!

195
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't help it...
I like rich stuff...

196
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,250
So, how's mom doing?

197
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,208
She good...? Are you
taking care of her?

198
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,333
You know that isn't any
of your business, Lan.

199
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,250
Yeah, true enough!

200
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,166
How are those dividend
rates coming along?

201
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,750
Good. We'll be done
with them shortly.

202
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,208
We can't help ourselves!
We're so excited!

203
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,875
I don't see why you need to get
ready for this thing so early.

204
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,458
Well, why would we not...?

205
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,541
We're planning to start
accepting bets tomorrow morning.

206
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,416
You mean you're taking
bets on the prelims?

207
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,541
Is it not truly exciting...?

208
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,500
We want to make certain

209
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,833
we're thoroughly
enjoying this experience.

210
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,875
Is everything all right?

211
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,083
We're going to
have a festival...

212
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:26,041
I think you ladies are all going
to enjoy the change of pace.

213
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,333
Hey... did you hear
about the tournament?

214
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,666
Of course I did!

215
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,625
The preliminaries are
supposed to start today!

216
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,916
I don't care what it is.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,333
I just really wanna make
the cut in something!

218
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,500
If we do well, the student
council might notice us, right?!

219
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,291
I'm looking forward
to the tournament...

220
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,541
as well as our other little
bit of "fun" with it.

221
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,958
Yeah, the judges are supposedly
screening the contestants

222
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,041
right now.

223
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,708
So, whaddaya think?
Are you gonna try

224
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,208
and win a fortune, too?

225
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,375
You better believe it; they're
accepting prelim bets now.

226
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,208
Yeah, good luck to
both of you guys,

227
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,500
but until you win that fortune,
you still work for me.

228
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,416
So try to stay
focused, okay?

229
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,416
Only until I'm rich.

230
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,291
Oh yay...!
I'm moving on!

231
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,250
Oh no!
I didn't make it!

232
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,125
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'd say things

233
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,750
have been running fairly
smoothly so far.

234
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,958
Yeah, too smooth
in my opinion...

235
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,000
Most of this
tournament is boring...

236
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,166
The event to watch will be the
long-distance obstacle race.

237
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,166
It appears to duplicate
Shurifon's traditional race...

238
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,958
The contestants will include
Princess Aura and Kenshi...

239
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,708
Oh, and it looks like Dagmyer
will be running, as well.

240
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,166
Things are about to
get exciting, Mexiah.

241
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,291
That's a good job
on you, Sir Dagmyer.

242
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:03,083
Everyone's going crazy
over your little tournament.

243
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,458
Well, if you ask me, it's
a complete waste of time...

244
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,625
We should have been
doing something.

245
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,583
There's no need for
any of us to rush.

246
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,083
Our time will
come soon enough.

247
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,250
Our time should be now; we
have our pride to defend here...

248
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,708
If you ask me, we need to
focus on proving ourselves.

249
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,000
And we will.

250
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,875
All right!.
Bring them down!

251
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,166
We're all
hooked up now, Miss!

252
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,458
This is overwhelmingly awful.

253
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,166
The life of a councilwoman
certainly isn't an easy one.

254
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,416
I don't think I've ever
felt this exhausted.

255
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,291
Again, only those
who actually worked

256
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,500
should be talking like that.

257
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,083
This is really dirty.

258
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,875
That's because it doesn't
get cleaned much...

259
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,708
They only shine it up for big
events, like the tournament.

260
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,791
But isn't it supposed to
be, like, a really big deal?

261
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,875
Well, yeah; it's
a way big deal...!

262
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,541
I mean, we're talkin' about
the only one in the world.

263
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,208
Wait...
There's just one?

264
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:26,083
Yep... This is the only
fully intact Sacred Mechalord

265
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,208
that has been excavated from
a prehistoric civilization...

266
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,041
So, the church is, like,
super protective of it,

267
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,083
for obvious reasons.

268
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,416
Empress Lashara was only allowed
to use it in her coronation

269
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,458
because Shtrayu originally
owned the excavation site.

270
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,916
Also known as,
the Holy Land.

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,458
Oh, wow.

272
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,916
In Shtrayu...

273
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,458
the Sacred Mechalord is
revered as a symbol of power.

274
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,416
This is just a
symbol of power?

275
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
It's not like anyone
can pilot it... ya know?

276
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,208
To me, it just seems
like a massive piece

277
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,458
of weird decoration.

278
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,958
Are we all done yet?

279
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,375
This is proving to be much more
profitable than we expected.

280
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,000
We have particularly high
hopes for the main event!.

281
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,166
Speaking of, how are
the preparations going?

282
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,625
We are almost
ready, Empress.

283
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,875
Almost is not good enough;
we must be ready...!

284
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,625
Then the fun can begin...

285
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,916
Remember: sell, sell,
sell, and sell some more!

286
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,416
It should be reassuring
to see her like this--

287
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,083
enthusiastic
about her job...

288
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,208
Yet it worries me.

289
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,041
Me too...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

290
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,791
Get your winning
predictions right here...!

291
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,583
You could get rich quick, so
don't let this chance slip by!.

292
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,083
Winning predictions,
right here!

293
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,541
Goodness me; this place
sure is packed wall-to-wall.

294
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,583
Yes, Miss Mexiah!

295
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,083
Correct me if I'm wrong,

296
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,833
but Empress Lashara is the
head bookmaker, isn't she?

297
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,458
Yeah. Success
smells so good!

298
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,625
What is this crap?

299
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,416
Kenshi's name is the
only one on here!

300
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,083
Yeah...
He's very popular.

301
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,291
It's true. He's
everyone's favorite.

302
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,791
You guys! Can't you
bet on anyone else?

303
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,791
Do you not understand
how real gambling works!

304
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,291
Yeah, we don't
really care, though.

305
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,750
We just want to
see Kenshi win!

306
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,125
Yeah!

307
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,541
That's so rude!

308
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,166
This looks
like my chance!

309
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,875
I see...
and I agree.

310
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,041
You have my permission to
take care of this situation.

311
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,375
Thanks, Lithia.

312
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,208
Hello!

313
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,333
Wait, please!

314
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,000
You have some
dirt on you.

315
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,958
Thank you.
I didn't even notice.

316
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,875
It's not a problem,

317
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,458
but I should be
the one thanking you...

318
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,125
You have my gratitude

319
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,833
for saving Sir Dagmyer
in Havoniwa... Thank you.

320
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,041
No, uh, I-I didn't
really do anything.

321
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,333
That was all Queen Flora!

322
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,000
I was told you were
immensely helpful as well.

323
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,000
I mean...

324
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,000
no, not really.

325
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,708
If possible, I don't want
to become enemies with you.

326
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,833
Nothing.

327
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,041
I've been looking
for you everywhere

328
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,708
I need to warn you
about something.

329
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,833
Excuse me.

330
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,000
What were the two of you just
talking about back there?

331
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,000
What?.
Why do you ask?

332
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,625
It's fine...
Never mind.

333
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,458
Kenshi!

334
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,791
I'm really confused.

335
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,875
Give Empress
Lashara a message.

336
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,625
I will be taking care of Kenshi
until the day of the tournament,

337
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,416
to make sure
he stays safe.

338
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,875
I even have the Student Council
President's letter of consent.

339
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,416
Let's go!

340
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,625
No!. She did what?!

341
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,000
She beat us to him...

342
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,500
How did Mexiah know
what we were planning?

343
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,208
Planning...? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

344
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,208
Chiaia...

345
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,583
What's up?

346
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,916
Apparently, Kenshi is by
far the crowd favorite.

347
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,791
Pretty much every
student and teacher

348
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,500
is betting on him to win.

349
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,416
The way the upperclassmen used
to chase him around all the time

350
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
probably has something
to do with it...

351
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,083
But that's
just my opinion.

352
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,166
And you know the bookie is
Empress Lashara, right...?

353
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,958
I bet Mexiah is making sure
Kenshi doesn't get hurt

354
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,583
before the games
even start.

355
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,750
Talk about a traitor!.

356
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,375
We will get you for
this Kenshi Masaki!

357
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,500
No one crosses us
and gets away with it!

358
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,416
And, she's already
losing it...

359
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,625
Whatcha think
we should do?

360
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,500
It's probably best
to ignore her...

361
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,500
Unless you really want
to get lost in crazy land.

362
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,958
But you guys!

363
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,666
What if she does something
to Kenshi, and he gets hurt.

364
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,291
Trust me, you don't
need to worry about him.

365
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,125
Oh yeah. If anybody's
gonna be okay, it's Kenshi.

366
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,666
No, not with her,
he won't!

367
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,416
He'll be in seclusion with
Miss Mexiah... Think about it!

368
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,875
That means he'll be alone with
her until the tournament starts!

369
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,000
Uh... Could I-?

370
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,625
Could you what?

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
I was just wondering
if it would be cool

372
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,375
if I went
to the restroom.

373
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,625
Sure, let's go!

374
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
No, I can go by myself...!

375
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,958
But, I would appreciate it
if you'd take off this chain.

376
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,916
No way. Until
the tournament starts...

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,666
Or I guess, more precisely,

378
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,625
until the long-distance
obstacle race begins...

379
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,458
You and I are going to get
to go everywhere together!

380
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,041
But!. How come?

381
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,375
Oh, Kenshi, why does
it even matter...

382
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,083
I mean, we have already seen
each other naked, haven't we?

383
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,291
Um... I don't remember
that ever happening.

384
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,166
And also,
I'm a student now...

385
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,083
Like officially... And I don't
think it's very appropriate,

386
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,875
or a good idea,
for a student and a teacher

387
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,375
to be sleeping in
the same bed together.

388
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,958
Why's that?

389
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,083
Well, because it's kinda frowned
on in my world, er, country--

390
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,458
wherever
it is I'm from.

391
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,666
Oh...?
How very unusual.

392
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,791
Unusual?.
What do you mean?

393
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,250
I mean, who teaches you about
the opposite sex that way?

394
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,083
Your mother...?
Or your sisters, maybe?

395
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,750
Not them... You just kinda
pick it up from books,

396
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,125
and like, your friends
and that stuff...

397
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,458
But, we do figure it out.

398
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,041
That's horrible!

399
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,333
No one teaches you what
everyone has the right to know?

400
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,416
How are you ever gonna find
out what's fundamental,

401
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,625
applicable,
or abnormal, even...?

402
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,500
What if you learned
something crazy on your own

403
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,666
and thought it was normal, but
only later found out the truth?

404
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,625
Please tell me you don't plan
on spending your entire life

405
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,791
in the dark about women...

406
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,416
This is serious!

407
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,458
The adults in your life are
ignoring their responsibilities!

408
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,041
I'm offering
you a chance...

409
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,416
I can teach you an entire
world of things, Kenshi.

410
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,083
I don't like that
look in your eyes...

411
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,416
Um... Am I just
imagining things,

412
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,666
or are you about to teach
me what's fundamental,

413
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,208
applicable
or abnormal, even?

414
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,166
Yes.

415
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,083
Crap! I gotta
get outta here!

416
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,833
I have sister-in-laws,
aunts, and grandmas

417
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,541
who get that same
look in their eyes,

418
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,333
and I don't
like it at all!

419
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,500
Now isn't that
interesting, baby boy.

420
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,750
As Student Council
President...

421
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,083
It is by the authority
of my office...

422
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:00,416
That I hereby commence
the Competitive Tournament!

423
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,708
This is bad.

424
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,083
It's pretty obvious who
will win each game...

425
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,875
If Kenshi wins, we're gonna
be in the red big time.

426
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,750
Most of the wagers
are for him.

427
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,916
I think 'in the red big time'
is putting it mildly.

428
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,416
Then, clearly, we need
to do something about Kenshi.

429
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,291
You can't
really be serious.

430
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,250
Oh, Empress Lashara,
you wouldn't!

431
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,583
We do what we must when we
don't have any other options.

432
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,458
How is everything running?

433
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,916
Great...!

434
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,458
All the games are proceeding
according to schedule.

435
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,708
How are
the preparations

436
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,875
for the long-distance
obstacle race coming?

437
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,041
Oh... Let me
check real quick.

438
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,250
Why did I get stuck wearing
this wacky costume, too?

439
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,041
Basically, because I knew
while everyone was occupied...

440
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,000
you were planning to go on
a little stealing spree.

441
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,125
The checkpoints
are all set,

442
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,291
so the main event
is ready to go.

443
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,666
Good...

444
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,458
And, in that case...

445
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,833
Let's get ready
to start the race!

446
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,500
Here's the
instruction manual

447
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,083
for the long-distance
obstacle race...

448
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,250
Please read it carefully
before the race starts.

449
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,833
Thanks.

450
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,583
It looks like they're
starting the race now!

451
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,083
What's she up to...?
Oh, Lan.

452
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,916
So, it's
about to begin.

453
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,416
Ready...

454
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,125
Go!

455
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,375
Nineteen, twenty...

456
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,625
What the-?!

457
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,458
Twenty-one,
twenty-two,

458
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,791
twenty-three,
twenty-four,

459
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,666
twenty-five.
Twenty-six,

460
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,125
twenty-seven,
twenty-eight,..

461
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,791
Excuse me,
Wild Beast, but...

462
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,625
what exactly
are you doing?

463
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,083
You're in a race.

464
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,250
But the rules said I had
to count to ten thousand

465
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:18,416
before I could
start to run.

466
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,291
The rules say
no such thing...

467
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,458
Now, start running!

468
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,875
Okay... I'm going!

469
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,000
Why do you have that
attached to you?

470
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,833
Because... I'm supposed
to have a handicap. I thought?

471
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,666
How does
that make sense?!

472
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,166
Are you an idiot on top
of being a wild beast...?

473
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,416
Take it off immediately!

474
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,166
Yeah, right!

475
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,000
Seriously?!. Will someone
sever this chain, please?!

476
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,708
Thank you very much!

477
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,458
Save the thanking
for later...

478
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,208
Get a move on!

479
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,583
Mew!

480
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,125
You know...

481
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,625
Kenshi has a tendency
to make that strange sound

482
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,791
when he gets really scared...

483
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,083
I wonder what
that's all about.

484
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,500
I have no clue.

485
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,333
But I'd guess it probably
comes from being raised

486
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,875
by wild animals.

487
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:04,875
Hm...

488
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,625
He finally
started running.

489
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,125
What do you think
the problem was, sir?

490
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,791
Oh, I have a couple
of theories on that.

491
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,500
Right.

492
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,666
Curse Lithia...

493
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,958
Why did she have
to get in our way...

494
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:19,000
But luckily,
we have got a plan B.

495
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,708
Kenshi, wait!

496
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,500
Sorry, but the course got
changed at the last minute.

497
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,791
So go this way, okay?

498
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay, yeah,
thanks a lot!

499
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,166
And with that we've got
plenty of leeway...! Go me!

500
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,708
Poor girl; the pressure must
really be getting to her.

501
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,791
Kenshi's gone off course...
I'm not sure why!

502
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,291
You have got
to kidding me...!

503
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,250
Do everything you can
to get him back on track now!

504
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,500
Yes, miss!

505
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,166
The target seems to have
abandoned course, sir.

506
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,500
This has got to be
Empress Lashara's doing...

507
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,666
Kenshi was the overwhelming
favorite before the race,

508
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,916
after all.

509
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,083
That's the truth...

510
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,916
To be honest, I bet
on him myself, sir.

511
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,916
Yeah, my money's
on him, too.

512
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,500
Which only serves
to further my point.

513
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,750
As the bookmaker, her earnings
would take a decent hit

514
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,333
if Kenshi were to win.

515
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,166
I swear... when
it comes to money,

516
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,500
Empress Lashara sounds
exactly like her mother.

517
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,583
I will agree with that.

518
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:20,125
Oh good; it worked.
He's back on course!

519
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,000
I only know of one
who could even imagine

520
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:23,541
doing something like this.

521
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,250
How dare
that royal brat!

522
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,541
The bookmaker is supposed
to expose cheaters,

523
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,291
not be the cheater!

524
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,833
Empress Lashara,
Kenshi has somehow

525
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,208
found his way
back on course.

526
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,208
Are you kidding us?.
Already...?

527
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,833
We've barely been able to slow
that jerk down at all!

528
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:48,875
All right...
We've got another plan.

529
00:28:48,958 --> 00:29:02,041
All right...
We've got another plan.

530
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,500
Good luck, Kenshi...!
You can do it!

531
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,000
Come on...!
Go Kenshi!

532
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,875
He almost made it to the lead;
the kid's gonna win!

533
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,875
Stupid Kenshi...!

534
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,250
We're going to break
his legs for this!

535
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,791
That kid
is something else.

536
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,875
Dagmyer!

537
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,916
Thanks, Chiaia.

538
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,791
What am I?

539
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,625
You're currently
in third place.

540
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,083
Behind Princess Aura...

541
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,416
and Kenshi.

542
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,958
Yes, but Princess
Aura is a Dark Elf...

543
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,250
and Kenshi
didn't actually enter

544
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,875
any of the other
tournament games.

545
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,041
Thank you for trying
to cheer me up...

546
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,125
Sadly...

547
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,375
I don't think I'll make that
next checkpoint in time,

548
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,000
as much as I might like to.

549
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,750
Then, you're stopping?

550
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,583
I am afraid I must retire.

551
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,166
However, as a man...

552
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,208
I certainly did make a
good show of it, didn't I?

553
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,083
He's finally catching up.

554
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,500
I expected it to come
down to these two.

555
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,083
Dagmyer has retired now...

556
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,958
All other contestants
are out of the race.

557
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,208
Well... I wonder
who's going to win, then.

558
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,958
He's keeping up
with my pace...

559
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,291
Impressive.

560
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,833
I guess it's time
to take this seriously.

561
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,000
We're receiving feedback.

562
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,791
Conduct a data check
and reexamine it.

563
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,583
Right...!
The data is accurate.

564
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,583
Please send all acquired
data to our motherland.

565
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:48,833
Yes, sir.

566
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:51,666
Looks as though we
finally found it!

567
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,250
Honestly... how much
stamina do those two have?

568
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,375
What should we do?

569
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,875
They've run the course
three times now.

570
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,125
All right...

571
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,500
Decrease time limits
between checkpoints...

572
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,750
If that doesn't work, we'll
go with the last checkpoint...

573
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,000
Whoever crosses it before

574
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,208
the other one will be
declared the winner.

575
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,583
Right.

576
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:21,291
This is actually starting
to get challenging.

577
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:27,833
Man... I can't believe I fell
for that weird list of rules...

578
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:31,458
I'm getting the idea something
bad might happen if I won.

579
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,166
What is he doing?!

580
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,875
Chiaia?

581
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,291
I've gotta be careful about
this so no one catches on.

582
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,291
Kenshi!

583
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,083
Chiaia?

584
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,916
If you back off, I'll take away
every crystal you're hiding...!

585
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,916
So pick up the pace!

586
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:57,000
Don't stop like an idiot.
Get out there and run...!

587
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,500
Boy, I'm sorry!

588
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,500
Oh, yeah, and you
better win this!

589
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:04,083
He is such a handful.

590
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,750
You guys are like
brother and sister.

591
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,250
Princess Aura!

592
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,791
Are you okay...? You still
have some time to make it...

593
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,083
What do you wanna do?

594
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,291
I just can't do it...

595
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,916
I think I'm going
to have to give up.

596
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,166
I've lost the main event.

597
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,541
Princess Aura is out!

598
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,875
She just retired at
Checkpoint Number Nine.

599
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,250
That makes it official.

600
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,208
The Wild Beast has
finally won the race.

601
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,958
Goodness.

602
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,500
You seem happy... Why?

603
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,041
Because I um...

604
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,833
I bet that Kenshi
would be the winner.

605
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:52,500
Oh.

606
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,333
Me too! We won!

607
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,333
What a stupid,
stupid head!

608
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,750
This is the first time
we've cursed our ability

609
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,291
to recognize talent.

610
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,916
It's like
losing your key

611
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,375
and being forced
to break into your house...

612
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,416
But then you end up falling
for one of the booby traps

613
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,291
you set yourself for
your own protection.

614
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,916
Congratulations, Kenshi!

615
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,625
Kenshi?

616
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,583
The wild beast
isn't stopping...

617
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,083
Why not?

618
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,583
I have no idea, he did
cross the finish line...

619
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,583
But what's more, he isn't
even slowing down, yet.

620
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:32,833
Can't lose!
Can't lose! Can't lose!

621
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:35,250
Can't lose! Can't lose!
Can't lose! Can't--

622
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,916
Maybe he was actually a monster
instead of a wild beast?

623
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,875
I'd love an explanation
from his owner.

624
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,416
Chiaia must have threatened
Kenshi with something bad...

625
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,875
We imagine that is the reason
he's running like a mad man.

626
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,125
She threatened him?

627
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,916
It's fine; We're sure
he will stop eventually.

628
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He must stop now.
I need him...!

629
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,500
The award ceremony's
about to start.

630
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,291
How would it look if
he didn't show up?

631
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,875
Oh yes, we know!

632
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,208
Meaning you have a plan?

633
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:03,125
No, but when do you think
he'll stop...? Wanna bet?

634
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,541
Kenshi, you
can stop running!

635
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,416
The race is over!

636
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,750
I don't think he can
hear us from back here...

637
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,833
This reminds me of the time
Miss Mexiah hypnotized him...

638
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,875
He's kinda acting
the same way.

639
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,875
It is possible.

640
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,083
Well, we might as well
resort to using force, then!

641
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,500
I've been waiting to
test this sucker out!

642
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:23,708
No... You can't!

643
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,041
Yes... Please don't!

644
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,583
Too late!

645
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,750
Take this!

646
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:31,875
And this!
And this! And this!

647
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,458
And this! And this!

648
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:37,000
No way! How's my awesome machine
slower than some silly kid?

649
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,041
Uh-oh... He's
coming this way!

650
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,208
His eyes look as though
they're glazed over.

651
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,250
I guess he really is in
berserker mode, huh...?

652
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,875
Hey, Chiaia...

653
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,791
Why did Kenshi stop
all of a sudden

654
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,666
toward the end
of the race?

655
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,875
How should I know?

656
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,250
Because...

657
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,958
you were acting like
his sister at the time.

658
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,541
Oh yeah!

659
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,000
Hey, Kenshi!
Snap out of it,

660
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,541
or I will take away
every crystal you have!

661
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,083
Huh... It worked.

662
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,916
On it!

663
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,791
Maybe asking for Wahan's
help wasn't too smart...

664
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,541
You know how
intense she can get.

665
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,041
Kenshi!.

666
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,375
Kenshi,
where are you?!

667
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,833
Kenshi!

668
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,333
Look who's
finally awake.

669
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,375
Princess Aura.

670
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,458
What happened...

671
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,458
Where am I?

672
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:12,041
The forest?

673
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,291
Don't tell me I collapsed
from exhaustion

674
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,416
during the race
or something.

675
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,208
Actually, that's
not the case...

676
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,500
Well, I'm sure
I must have lost...

677
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,500
I was pushing
myself a little bit.

678
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,500
Are you listening
to me, Kenshi?

679
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,666
Wow... sorry
if I bothered you.

680
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,916
Will you please
listen to me?!

681
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,625
You're the winner
of the race, okay...

682
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,000
For whatever reason,

683
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,625
you kept running afterwards
like you didn't know.

684
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,291
What...?
I really did?

685
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,416
Yes.

686
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,291
That's pretty weird.

687
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,416
It is strange...

688
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,791
But you should know
how amazing you are...

689
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,541
Until you, I only ever
lost a race to my father.

690
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,041
Thanks a lot...

691
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,208
But you're the amazing
one, Princess...!

692
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,458
I've never seen anyone
run as fast as you.

693
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,708
I mean, other than my
sisters, of course.

694
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,541
Why thank you.

695
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,208
So... Kenshi?

696
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,666
What's up?

697
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,541
I think...

698
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,875
Well, I think that I...

699
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,375
I think I like you!

700
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,916
So, do--...

701
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,750
Do you--...

702
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,875
Do you want to be...

703
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:23,875
There you are!

704
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,083
Oh...
Hey, Chiaia!

705
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,500
I found him, guys!

706
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,708
He's over here!

707
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,708
Are you okay...?
All good?

708
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,916
Yeah...
I'm just fine.

709
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,291
Oh... and thank you
for your help, Princess...

710
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm really sorry
if we were annoying.

711
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,208
You're fine.

712
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:43,000
Chiaia!

713
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,708
What?!

714
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:48,333
If we hurry, Kenshi can still
make it to the award ceremony!

715
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,625
You wanna come too,
Princess?

716
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,125
Thank you, Kenshi.

717
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,166
I hear you
found it, Uncle.

718
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,458
Yes...

719
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,250
Indeed I did.

720
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,916
Then it only makes
sense we get rid

721
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,666
of our biggest
obstacle first...

722
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,416
Right?

723
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,208
The event is almost here...

724
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,208
I think it would be wise for
us to avoid doing anything

725
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,500
that might arouse suspicion.

726
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,833
Huh?

727
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,916
Uncle, the job you came
to do here is done.

728
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,208
Feel free to shut up
and watch me work.

729
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,958
No, Sir Dagmyer,
you must not...!

730
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,833
Please, the students
aren't the only ones.

731
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,625
The faculty
adores that boy,

732
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,333
and the staff can't
say enough about him.

733
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,041
His death will
be investigated.

734
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,458
Silence!

735
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,875
You dare to order me...?
When did I say you could speak?!

736
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,833
Yes, yes.
But she's... so right...

737
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:41,333
Besides, Kenshi
is far too strong.

738
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,208
He's already done a number
on Lan and her friends,

739
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,708
or have you forgotten?

740
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,500
Whatever, this time we know
not to attack him head on.

741
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,958
You have made no real assessment
of his skills, though...

742
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:55,208
Let me help;
he will massacre you.

743
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,458
He's hardly an
issue right now...

744
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,041
And don't you have
something more important

745
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,875
than a servant
to worry about...?

746
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,000
On top of that,
Kenshi is the one

747
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,041
who helped us
out the most...

748
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,666
Couldn't we let him enjoy
his simple, peaceful life

749
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,166
just a tiny bit longer?

750
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,541
Oh, pretty please?

751
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,333
Very well, Uncle...

752
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:14,541
I shall defer to you on
the matter, this time.

753
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,625
Mark my words...
She'll try something.

754
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,458
She is a clever girl...

755
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,750
But could you look
after her for me anyway?

756
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,125
Done.

757
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,750
It's all falling
into place...

758
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,750
isn't it.

759
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,291
The real challenges
are yet to come.

760
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:51,000
I have a feeling I'm gonna
dig up a big one tonight!

761
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,833
Hey, there!
I recognize you!

762
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,708
Wow... This girl
is strong...

763
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,791
She's like,
"Chiaia good."

764
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:14,875
I'm sorry.

765
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,291
Are you okay?

766
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,666
I don't know what's goin' on, so
don't take this the wrong way...

767
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,916
but it seems crazy to waste
your own life like that.

768
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,333
So, thank you
for saving us.

769
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,750
I was only trying
to protect the girl...

770
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,958
Although, it appears
that wasn't necessary.

771
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,250
Well, technically, you did
throw a rope down, so...

772
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,958
There's that.

773
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,750
A storm is coming soon...

774
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,208
Be careful.

775
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,625
Consider that a "thank you"
for not hurting the girl.

776
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,000
A storm, but--...

777
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,291
What do you mean?

778
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,666
Hey...

779
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,833
That hole is dangerous...

780
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,458
would you mind taking
care of it for me...?

781
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:16,583
A Koro's
about to fall in.

782
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,750
Wait...!
Don't move!

783
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:20,833
Good...

784
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,208
That was close!.

785
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:26,208
Aw, that lady got
away because of you.

786
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,916
A storm, huh...?

787
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,458
I wonder
what that means.

788
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,625
Good morning!

789
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,625
What's wrong,
you guys?

790
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:12,250
Um...
What is that?

791
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:10,208
We knew this was our fate,
but we never thought things

792
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,416
would turn out the way
they have so far...

793
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,041
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar...

794
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,291
