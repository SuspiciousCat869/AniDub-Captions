1
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,833
Do I look like I care?

2
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,666
Do what you were told,
and do it now.

3
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,333
I'm sorry,
but I really can't.

4
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:55,375
I need to get approval
from Lord Ulyte first.

5
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,125
Ulyte isn't here
right now, is he...?

6
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,333
I say go ahead and do it
without his approval.

7
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,166
'Kay?

8
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,333
So...

9
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,958
You're leaving for the
Barrier Workshop tomorrow.

10
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,583
Yes.

11
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,500
Even Kenshi cannot defeat Gaia
with only a Sacred Mechanoid...

12
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,875
It is my understanding

13
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,333
that Lord Naua has set
something up for us.

14
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,166
Well, that's encouraging.

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,916
Perhaps he can handle
giving Sir Kenshi a power up

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,541
and whatever else he may need
while I find a way to coordinate

17
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,125
with Shurifon and
prepare a counter attack.

18
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,958
I believe we are
almost completely done

19
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,833
evacuating
the civilians...

20
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,625
I have a feeling
King Shurifon

21
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,833
is hardly going
to want to sit there

22
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,125
and quietly
take a beating.

23
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,083
Of course not...

24
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,125
It will be easier
to take action now...

25
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,875
We don't have
a castle to defend...

26
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,416
so we can focus
on offense.

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,666
Queen Flora, I'm sure
you're aware the Church

28
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,000
lost some
of its functions,

29
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,500
but our cocoons
and most of our weapons

30
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,125
have been
left untouched...

31
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,166
I certainly don't mind
giving you the password

32
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,666
to the underground shelter
so you can make use of them.

33
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,208
That would be wonderful...

34
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,458
I was getting worried
about our lack of supplies.

35
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,875
If Havoniwa and Shurifon
can form an alliance,

36
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,958
and we get everything we need
from the Church's shelter...

37
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,166
Is it just us, or does she look
like she's dying for revenge?

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,208
After watching our country get
trashed the way it did,

39
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,708
she's most assuredly
out for blood.

40
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,958
What are you two
girls talking about?

41
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,333
Oh, nothing.

42
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,458
You know,
it's disappointing...

43
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,083
I mean, the great and wonderful
King of Swan should be present

44
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,958
while we're having such
an important discussion,

45
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,916
but he's not here...
And that makes me sad.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,833
Well, we cannot do
much about that...

47
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,916
Your great and wonderful
king of Swan

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,875
has other obligations
at the moment.

49
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,916
Man...

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,875
I don't know why I'm doing this
when I'm supposed to be a king.

51
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,583
Oh, really...?

52
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,791
I didn't realize you
were the "kingly" type.

53
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,458
Okay, I'm not...

54
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,333
It even felt strange to say that
if it makes you feel any better.

55
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
It does...

56
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,125
Besides, this is an important
job, and you're the only one

57
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,541
who can do it.

58
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,250
True. Without those compressed
bullets you're making,

59
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,125
we wouldn't have enough energy
to be able to fight outside

60
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,291
of Ena's draft.

61
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,833
This technology is
like super brand new.

62
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,083
Your compressed bullets
will make the best fuel,

63
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,250
and we're recycling
garbage to make them...!

64
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,000
When Lashara found out
this particular project

65
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,625
wasn't gonna
cost her anything,

66
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,208
I thought her head
would explode.

67
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,416
Bottom line...?

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,875
Those bullets are important,
so keep working.

69
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,416
Okay, I'm on it.

70
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,583
What do you think
that's about?

71
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,833
Let's head back
to the Swan.

72
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,583
What is the situation?

73
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,333
We've spotted Mechanoids we
think belong to Lord Babalun...

74
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,333
Four total.

75
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,708
Only four...?
I wonder why.

76
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,250
We have combat
confirmed.

77
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,541
Combat?.

78
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,875
But why? Is there
dissention among the ranks?

79
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,791
On screen now.

80
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,708
The frame under attack
has been identified

81
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,541
as Ceres Taito's
Sacred Mechanoid.

82
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,833
It has?!

83
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,041
Why is Ceres here?

84
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,916
No...
I can't...

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This doesn't make sense.
Why is he so far from home?

86
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,583
What is going on?

87
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,208
After his
previous incident,

88
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,416
I thought he had moved
to a small mountain village

89
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,250
with his girlfriend
and gone into hiding.

90
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,625
If that's the case,

91
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,041
then what's he doing inside
of a Sacred Mechanoid?

92
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,166
Why are you
asking me...?

93
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,625
It is not as though I know
what is going on, either!

94
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,625
Right... We almost
forgot you were useless.

95
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,625
What?

96
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,500
A direct hit!

97
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,375
Crap, he's been hit!

98
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,916
No wait!
Hold on, Kenshi!

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,833
Just to be safe, have the
SWAN wait for me right here.

100
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,333
I've never seen
those frames before.

101
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,750
Are we sure they
belong to Babalun?

102
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,750
They're his.

103
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,458
Curse that
stupid man...

104
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,416
What is he up
to this time?

105
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,625
We'll shoot you again
if you keep screwing around.

106
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,083
Move it
or lose it...!

107
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,958
Whoo!

108
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,333
Are you sure this is what you
want to do, Sir Dagmyer...?

109
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,458
You can still stop.

110
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,041
Not another
word out of you!

111
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,541
I approved this plan...

112
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,833
Do not question it.

113
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,041
The way he keeps
dragging his feet

114
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,875
makes him
real easy to catch.

115
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,833
Come on, he's just
a little sleepy.

116
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,500
I must have showed the poor guy
too good of a time last night.

117
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,791
Yeah, right...

118
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,625
He's worn out 'cause you
wouldn't stop playing

119
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,166
with him afterwards.

120
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,583
Hey, it was my first time with
a male Sacred Mechamaster...

121
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,375
I got carried away.

122
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,458
I wonder...

123
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,000
Will you go any faster

124
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,083
if I relieve you
of one of your arms?

125
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,625
What the-?

126
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,875
I knew he'd come.

127
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,000
Leave him alone!

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,708
Crap!

129
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,500
He fired from
that far away?!.

130
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,583
He's good.

131
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,000
Too good! Let's go!

132
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,666
Are you okay...?

133
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,208
Ceres?

134
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,000
That really is you
in there, isn't it, Ceres?

135
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,041
I'm sorry...

136
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,958
Kenshi...

137
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,708
We knew it
had to be a trap.

138
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,166
I'm going out
to help him, Empress.

139
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,333
Yukine,
you go, too.

140
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,166
Ceres...?

141
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,833
I'm sorry...

142
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,333
I can't...

143
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,166
I didn't...

144
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,666
What happened?

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,625
I thought you were living
with Hazuki away from all this.

146
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,541
I was...

147
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,125
Until...

148
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,375
I can't believe that
a councilman sold him out.

149
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,833
That's horrible!

150
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,000
You mean a dirty scoundrel
who abandoned his country

151
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,750
and queen to save himself...

152
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,291
He probably thought it was
the perfect ingratiating gift

153
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,458
for Babalun.

154
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,916
That man's shame is
without boundaries!

155
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,958
Is that what I think it is?

156
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,041
Close in on the Mecha's back.

157
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,583
It's the Sacred Mechalord's
barrier reactor!

158
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,458
The who's what reactor?

159
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,791
Mechalords...

160
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,916
The Holy Land has
documents on it...

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,250
I know because
I've seen them.

162
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,875
We must stop him! He's
planning to self-destruct.

163
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,416
How do you
know for sure?

164
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,125
After the excavation
of the Sacred Mechalord...

165
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,125
A replica of its barrier
reactor was made.

166
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,083
But the trial model
went out of control...

167
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,000
It ended up exploding
during a test.

168
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,666
The Holy Land's coliseum
was built in the crater

169
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,500
made by that explosion.

170
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,791
Are you serious?

171
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,375
But barrier reactors
always have limiters

172
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,125
to keep that kind of
thing from happening.

173
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,500
No, not always.

174
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,416
That one...
was not given a limiter.

175
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,791
You two stay back.

176
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,291
We must all be prepared
for the worst.

177
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,208
Princess Aura has left.

178
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,708
Will she make it in time?

179
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,166
Knowing how fast
she is, she might.

180
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,125
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,541
I'm so sorry.

182
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,958
Please forgive me...
I'm so sorry...

183
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,291
I didn't have a choice.

184
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,000
Ceres, where's
your girlfriend?

185
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,750
At the ruins up ahead...
They said that...

186
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,583
They said they'd let her go
if I did what they told me...

187
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,208
and it went
according to plan...

188
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,958
I'm so sorry.

189
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,625
It should be
just about time.

190
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,708
Gotta say, I like how
you know more ways than one

191
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,291
to use a Sacred Mechanoid...

192
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,750
Now, why is Dagmyer
the guy in charge again?

193
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,208
Oh, come on.
Knock it off, Lan.

194
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,791
I suppose she's
served her purpose.

195
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,416
We should get rid of her.

196
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,583
Not even close.
Don't be stupid...

197
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,083
Why waste a good thing.

198
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,833
She can still make
us a lot of money.

199
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,458
I didn't have a choice...

200
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,250
I couldn't save
her any other way.

201
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,125
I couldn't help it...

202
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,041
I'm sorry, Kenshi...

203
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,166
What did they do...?

204
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,458
Did they torture you?

205
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,708
Kenshi! I'll have those
restraints off you in no time.

206
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,916
No!. You and
the SWAN retreat.

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,166
You want us to leave?

208
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,583
Get out of here!.

209
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,041
Retreat immediately!

210
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,583
But why?

211
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,833
Retreat!.
That's an order.

212
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,916
SWAN...
did you hear that?

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,166
You heard him!
Retreat immediately!

214
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,625
But we can't leave
yet. What about Kenshi?

215
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,458
We need to trust him...

216
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,416
He must have a plan.

217
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,583
What in the world does he
think he's going to do?

218
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,833
Sounds like the
plan was a success.

219
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,250
I'm taking
girlfriend with me...

220
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,250
I'm sure someone will
be willing to buy her.

221
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,958
We swore to release her
once the operation was over!.

222
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,166
That's the only
reason Ceres agreed!

223
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,208
Oh man, you cannot possibly
be that naïve, can you?

224
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,375
And you cannot possibly
be that depraved. Can you?

225
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,625
Don't waste time
over this nonsense...

226
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,708
We need to
confirm they're dead.

227
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,333
What was that?

228
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,125
It's another black
Sacred Mechanoid!

229
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,041
That thing's Kenshi.

230
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,875
How is he still alive?

231
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,875
He can't be. The
operation was a success.

232
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,208
He's supposed to be dead.

233
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,208
Let's move out!

234
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,291
Right!

235
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,125
Okay.
We're up!

236
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,958
Is that truly Kenshi?

237
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,833
Oh no... Wait,
it's not exploding.

238
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,375
I think he might
be compressing it.

239
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,458
Let's save her while
Kenshi's distracting them!

240
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,916
Okay!

241
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,833
And so he lives...
Not for long, though...

242
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,791
This time I'll
kill you myself!

243
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,750
Girlfriend is the only
loot we got outta this...

244
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,958
Talk about a waste of time.

245
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,833
Son of a-

246
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,333
Hazuki!

247
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,250
Ceres!

248
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,625
But...

249
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,166
Curse you!

250
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,958
You bastard!

251
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,125
Why are you still alive?!
How hard is it to die?

252
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,500
I had a perfect plan,
but you ruined everything!

253
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,916
What's wrong
with this freak?!

254
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,791
It's not supposed
to be like this!

255
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,541
I'm right here,
Sir Dagmyer!

256
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,958
Do you remember...

257
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,208
what the principal
said to us...?

258
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,458
"He who is garbed in light shall
be the savior of the world...

259
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,291
While he who dons
the robes of darkness...

260
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,958
shall be bent
on its destruction..."

261
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,875
In his case...
before others...

262
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,333
Kenshi would first...
destroy himself.

263
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,125
Oh, Kenshi...

264
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,875
I'm sorry...
Please forgive me...

265
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,708
This wasn't your fault,
Ceres... Really.

266
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,166
But still!

267
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,833
More importantly, don't you
want to seek sanctuary

268
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,375
in the SWAN
with your girlfriend?

269
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,958
Sanctuary?

270
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,083
Yes...! That is
a brilliant idea!

271
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,041
SWAN does have Havoniwa,
Shurifon and Shtrayu's-...

272
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,250
We have their splinter
groups, she means.

273
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,041
Or their blessing to function
as an independent country.

274
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,583
It's an independent
country?!

275
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,625
And it's all mine!

276
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,833
Excuse us...!

277
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,291
We'd rather you not refer
to us as a splinter group!

278
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,250
I was waiting for that.

279
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,958
[Music]

280
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,625
Okay, we're going
to leave now, Mother!

281
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,291
Take care of my baby!

282
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,250
We suppose our shortcut turned
into a bit of a detour,

283
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,416
but all is well...

284
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,375
Thanks to that
particular deviation,

285
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,458
we ended up getting our hands
on a Male Sacred Mechamaster.

286
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,708
Oh no.

287
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,375
You are going to make
us a fortune,

288
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,625
so work that little butt
of yours off, got it?!

289
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,958
What? It was only
a joke, of course!.

290
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,708
We're serious, don't
look at us like that.

291
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,000
We said it
was just a joke

292
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,291
and that's exactly
what it was, okay?!.

293
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,583
We were kidding!
Stop glaring at us.

294
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,375
You've got it all
wrong, we swear...

295
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,166
Why do you all have
to be so dramatic?

296
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,416
We shall arrive at the
Barrier Workshop momentarily.

297
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,083
This is the
Barrier Workshop?

298
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,416
Master Naua...
I just got back.

299
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,541
Father, did you
hear about Mexiah?!

300
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,625
Yes... I have heard
the reports, dear.

301
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,500
Empress Lashara,
I want to apologize... I,..

302
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,958
Oh, don't worry...

303
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,416
You have continually
provided satisfactory results

304
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,166
in everything
you've done...

305
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,875
The rest is trivial
in comparison.

306
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,166
Thank you,
Empress Lashara!

307
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,208
Wahan... Go to the workshop and
retrieve our little surprise.

308
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes, sir!

309
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,125
You're Kenshi
Masaki, aren't you?

310
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,708
Uh... Yes, sir.

311
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,000
If you don't mind, I'd like
to check on something...

312
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,541
Could you follow my
assistant, please?

313
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,416
Yeah, sure thing.

314
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,333
Rea, are you okay?!

315
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,958
Yes... I'm tired,
that's all.

316
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,541
Take her with you. She can
get some rest in the lab.

317
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,333
If you could both
follow me, please.

318
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:48,208
Thank you.

319
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,500
How's Dagmyer?

320
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,208
I see...

321
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:02,833
And what do you think
we should do now?

322
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,000
I don't have
the slightest clue.

323
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,125
That's up to Dagmyer.

324
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,291
I detect no abnormalities,

325
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,666
so she should be fine
after she gets some rest.

326
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,083
Now if you could just
come with me, please.

327
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,083
It will take a while for us
to receive the results

328
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,041
from Kenshi's tests.

329
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,416
In the meantime...

330
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,291
I should tell you about
our ancient civilizations.

331
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,916
We are guessing this has
something to do with Mexiah?

332
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,708
It does.

333
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,375
Unlike now,
a previous civilization

334
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,416
was almost entirely unified
under one nation...

335
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,166
Naturally, they still had
divisions such as states,

336
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,250
cities, towns
and villages.

337
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,833
Oh...? Did the government
eventually grow corrupt

338
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,625
or suffer from civil strife?

339
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,500
Otherwise, why would they
ever need Sacred Mechalords?

340
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,458
I think they were most
likely created well

341
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,833
before the unification
took place.

342
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,375
Actually...
Believe it or not,

343
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:24,750
Sacred Mechalords were
invented after the unification.

344
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,333
Why is that important?

345
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,375
Namely... Sacred Mechalords
were not originally developed

346
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,041
for the purpose
of fighting...

347
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,250
Not for war, at least.

348
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,875
At first, there
were festivals held

349
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,000
to promote
cultural exchange...

350
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,833
These gatherings were
similar to a tournament

351
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:44,083
and a world's fair
combined into one.

352
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,125
Giant manlike robots
were exhibited there.

353
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:50,541
The robots became popular,
so they were adapted...

354
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,458
Soon they could compete
in various games.

355
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,416
Nice! That sounds
like fun to us!

356
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,708
Eventually the robots
were used in public fights.

357
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:03,125
Battles that were used for
citizens' viewing entertainment.

358
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,416
Around that time,

359
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,958
people began calling the
robots Sacred Mechalords.

360
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,208
That... still seems
fairly logical.

361
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,666
The Sacred Mechalords were
anything their creators

362
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,416
wanted them to be,
from the object of gambling

363
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,125
in the far corner of town,

364
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,875
to incredible creations
the elite took pride

365
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,708
in pushing to their
technological limits...

366
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:28,291
But, surprisingly enough, even
the greatest Sacred Mechalords

367
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:31,875
weren't any stronger than
our modern day Mechanoids.

368
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,416
In fact, what was thought of
as a talented pilot at that time

369
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,750
only wielded as much
strength as what we consider

370
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,208
to be a second-rate
Mechamaster today.

371
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,458
That must be why they
started summoning people

372
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,750
from other worlds.

373
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,083
Yes... Dark Elves
for example.

374
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,166
We were summoned?

375
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,625
That's correct.

376
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:52,916
The Dark Elves' peculiar
"defective time" is evident...

377
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,625
It's a remnant of the
effect of residing

378
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,416
in this world's environment.

379
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,833
I just can't believe it...

380
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,500
But weren't they more
technologically advanced

381
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,791
back then...?

382
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,208
If that were the case,
why couldn't they control

383
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,583
the Sacred Mechalords remotely
instead of using pilots?

384
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,541
You forget they were
playing sports...

385
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:13,250
Athletic competition between
the living, not robots...

386
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,750
However... development
wars quickly escalated...

387
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,583
Once they began developing more
and more advanced technology,

388
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,250
they decided to start tweaking
the pilots, in addition.

389
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,625
Making things quite
volatile, we assume.

390
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:29,958
At first, they primarily
relied on mechanical assistance

391
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,541
or had those with strong
Aho tolerance marry...

392
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,291
But it didn't take long for
someone to try to create pilots

393
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,500
from scratch.

394
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,916
And... that's where
Mexiah comes in...

395
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,958
Is that not
what happened?

396
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,458
As the tournaments
became more of a show...

397
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,166
the audience called
for greater excitement.

398
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,500
The pilot death rate began
to rise dramatically...

399
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:55,291
They couldn't exactly force
more pilots to fight, either.

400
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,500
That's when something
called "Core Crystals"

401
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,958
came into play...

402
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,916
They stored pilots'
skills and experience

403
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,583
inside of these
Core Crystals.

404
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:07,500
After the pilots died or became
too old to fight any longer,

405
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,791
the crystal could be
transferred into another body,

406
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,125
allowing them to be restored
to their original state.

407
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,000
Basically, the Core
Crystals were the pilots...

408
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,500
In laymen's terms, these special
bodies were Sacred Mechamasters.

409
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,000
Interesting.

410
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,000
The data stored largely
specialized in combat...

411
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,375
which is important.

412
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,916
Because that's what made
them start to lose

413
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,416
whatever emotions they had.

414
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,875
And as a result,

415
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,833
misinterpreting an order
could cause them to go berserk.

416
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,666
Ultimately,
the Sacred Mechalords

417
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,041
became
incredibly powerful...

418
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,791
They eventually
pushed civilization

419
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,916
to the brink
of destruction.

420
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,916
How foolish...
It's unbelievable.

421
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,416
Whatever survivors were left
completely abandoned Aho power

422
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,875
and were forced to flee.

423
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,083
It's odd...

424
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,166
The Mechalord who proved
to be the strongest

425
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,708
of all the frames
back then...

426
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:11,041
by destroying that civilization
and all other mechas...

427
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,958
was also the only one
that had the ability

428
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:16,041
to move freely outside
of the Ena Ocean.

429
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,458
We'll have your test
results soon, Kenshi...

430
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,166
I hope you don't
mind waiting here?

431
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,000
That's fine.

432
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,875
Sorry for the wait!

433
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,541
We're about to start bringing
in more supplies, guys!

434
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,958
Would you mind helping
me load them up?

435
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,000
Sure!

436
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,041
Hey Wahanly...
what is that thing?

437
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:16,333
That's gonna be
Kenshi's new power.

438
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,708
The greatest Sacred Mechalord
the world had ever known...

439
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:23,041
Mexiah was one of three
artificial fighters

440
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:27,166
made specifically
to defeat that Mechalord.

441
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,375
In order for her to understand
ambiguous commands...

442
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,083
they decided she needed
to have personal interaction,

443
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:36,208
so she was raised by a family...
as a normal little girl.

444
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,583
My sister...
is an artificial being?

445
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:42,500
I don't understand,
she looked so normal to us.

446
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,458
We share the exact same
physical structure.

447
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,916
She can even have children.

448
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,166
She can...?
What amazing technology.

449
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,708
Did the three fighters
defeat the Sacred Mechalord?

450
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,958
According to literature,

451
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,166
Mexiah and one other
artificial fighter

452
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,708
fought against the Sacred
Mechalord, Gaia...

453
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,666
The records
indicate they won,

454
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,125
but at the cost
of one of their lives.

455
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:05,958
And Babalun...?

456
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,458
Do you think his Sacred
Mechamaster barrier reactor

457
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,125
originally
belonged to them?

458
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,791
Of course... And they must
have removed the limiters...

459
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,458
Most likely
while opposing Gaia.

460
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,083
They went that far...?

461
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,208
All right, so what
happened after that?

462
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:21,041
The citizens destroyed the
remaining Sacred Mechalords

463
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,375
and erased her memories.

464
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,875
They reverted Mexiah to an
infant and sealed her deep

465
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,666
within the planet.

466
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,666
They could neither
disassemble nor destroy

467
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,333
the Shield of Gaia...

468
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,708
As you already know, they
sealed it within the Holy Land.

469
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,000
And that means that the
Church must have been created

470
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,125
to protect it.

471
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,833
Gaia tried to destroy
everything in its path...

472
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,291
That made it rather difficult
for the survivors to live

473
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,166
in the Ena Ocean...

474
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,666
The Church as we know
it now had a precursor.

475
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,458
That group secured
distribution, transportation,

476
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,833
and allocation of goods in order
to help support those citizens.

477
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,125
I suppose that explains why
the Church ended up being

478
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,791
so influential in
so many countries.

479
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,750
The Church supplies dangerous
technology such as Sacred

480
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:07,083
Mechanoids and Aho barrier
reactors so we will never have

481
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,833
to relive the nightmare
created by Gaia.

482
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,041
What's more...

483
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,750
to keep the Church
from corruption,

484
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,458
they've implanted
memories of the event

485
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,541
into their subconscious minds.

486
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,000
Then why did
the Sacred Mechalord

487
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,791
ever get excavated
to begin with?

488
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,833
Well, the thousands of years
that have passed since then

489
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,875
have purged our citizens
of those horrendous memories

490
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,666
and legends.

491
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,833
Shtrayu excavated the Sacred
Mechalord from the Holy Land

492
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,125
because it had originally
belonged to them...

493
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,375
After an experiment went wrong,
the Church learned of its return

494
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,583
and claimed the Holy Land
for themselves...

495
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,000
In order to prevent nations

496
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,625
from competing over Sacred
Mechanoid development,

497
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,583
the Church began using
the technology it had stored

498
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:47,166
to supply nations with
their own Sacred Mechanoids.

499
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,500
So the countries

500
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,541
must have started training
Sacred Mechamasters

501
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,500
to control those Mechas.

502
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:03,000
Twenty years ago, a capsule
was found in the Holy Land...

503
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,125
Or rather, I should say
a capsule unearthed itself

504
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
in the Holy Land.

505
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,208
Was Mexiah inside of it?

506
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,291
The capsule had been set
to return to the surface

507
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,250
once it reached
its operational limit.

508
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,416
Those who originally sealed
the capsule underground......

509
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,083
probably felt
sorry for Mexiah.

510
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,666
Well, I certainly did...

511
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,291
That's the reason I raised her
as if she was my own daughter.

512
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,333
But it doesn't make sense.

513
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:12,791
If you raised her,
why is she choosing to obey

514
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,958
Lord Babalun's orders?

515
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,791
I don't believe she has a
choice in the matter at all...

516
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,250
He's most likely taking
advantage of a safety feature

517
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,000
designed to keep her
from going berserk.

518
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,041
Unfortunately, independent
researchers possess

519
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,333
most of the documents
excavated from the ruins.

520
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,583
And Babalun comes from a line
of Sacred Mechamechanics.

521
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,875
Who in the world is that man?

522
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,708
He could be...

523
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,250
Lord Naua...!
The results are in!

524
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:43,458
I knew it! And now I have
all the proof I need.

525
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,166
What are you
talking about?

526
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,333
There were three artificial
fighters created

527
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,083
to defeat the
Sacred Mechalord...

528
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,333
One died...
One is Mexiah...

529
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,833
And we might've
found the third.

530
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:09,000
Our target is the SWAN...
Ignore everything else!

531
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,875
Right!

532
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,041
It's Babalun's
lackeys again!.

533
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,166
Why did they come here?

534
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,500
Take Empress Lashara and
the others to the SWAN.

535
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,416
Yes, sir!

536
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,000
Chiaia, come with me...
I need to give you something.

537
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,666
Okay.

538
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,875
You need
to get to shelter!

539
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,708
No... They're
coming after us!

540
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,000
I've gotta get
to the SWAN!

541
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,083
Be careful, sir.

542
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,708
I will!

543
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,333
Oh no! We need
to get Miss Rea!

544
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,791
But how... When everyone
on that side came here with us.

545
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,666
Listen to me...

546
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,166
Destroying the Shield
of Gaia is an impossibility.

547
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,625
Okay... Then what
should we do?

548
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,875
There is still a way
to defeat Gaia...

549
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,708
even if you cannot
demolish its shield...

550
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,125
Once we get there,
I'll show you how.

551
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,208
Well, that's no good...
It looks like I've been caught.

552
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,958
Wait, what are
you doing in here?

553
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,833
No...!
Give that back!

554
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:11,166
I'm sorry... It's mine now
and I'm taking it with me.

555
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,583
What are those things?

556
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,208
Our attacks are
completely ineffective!

557
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,458
This sucks!.

558
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:24,541
My best guess is they're
Shield of Gaia replicas.

559
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,416
My gunpowder
won't even work!

560
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,666
They actually replicated
the Shield of Gaia?!

561
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,375
They used
different materials,

562
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,125
but, yeah, I think these things
were at least based off of it!

563
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:38,166
Curse Lord Babalun
and his nasty toys!.

564
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,166
Where's Kenshi?.

565
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,583
Is he not back yet?

566
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,958
Rea...
where did you go?

567
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,333
Rea! Hey, what are
you doing out here?

568
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:49,000
Um, I, uh... was,
uh... just...

569
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,291
Babalun's army found us.
We need to get to the SWAN!

570
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,416
Kenshi! Grab her!
Don't let her get away!

571
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,625
I wish I could
go with you, Kenshi...

572
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,791
But I have
to head back now.

573
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,291
It was only for
a short time...

574
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,541
But... it was fun!

575
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:09,166
What... Neizai?

576
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,333
Meet me in the Holy Land!

577
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,250
No, wait!

578
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,750
Doll's here!

579
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,916
Chiaia, stop!

580
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,291
Father, no!

581
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,791
Run, now!

582
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,458
I have something waiting
for you on the SWAN!

583
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,208
Get her out of here!

584
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,500
Wait, Father!

585
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,125
Trust me,
I'll be fine!

586
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,916
Father,
please, no!

587
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,166
It's been
a while, Father.

588
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,791
Mexiah...

589
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:43,833
I've missed you so much...
so I came to see you.

590
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I have a question for you...
Would that be all right?

591
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,458
It's no good...
I can't keep them at bay!

592
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,541
They broke through!

593
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,541
Retreat to the SWAN!

594
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,416
You got it!

595
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,916
Time is up...
We've no choice.

596
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,875
Move the SWAN out
once Wahanly's back!

597
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:03,875
We can't!

598
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,250
Why not?

599
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,166
It's Kenshi!

600
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,291
Kenshi!

601
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,500
It's Kenshi!

602
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,458
Kenshi... Check out
the hangar on the right!

603
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,875
Thanks, Wahan!

604
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,583
That guy in white
is a pilot!.

605
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:26,375
Don't let him get away!

606
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:30,666
I was hoping I could use my last
bullet for something like this!

607
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,541
What are you doing?!
After him!

608
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,166
Kenshi,
hurry up, please!

609
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,666
I'm doing my best, but with
both of us on this thing,

610
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,791
we're not exactly stable.

611
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,666
What do you mean?
Are you calling me fat?!

612
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,583
That's not what I said!

613
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,625
Kenshi! Hurry up!

614
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,250
Hey, it's Ceres!.
Perfect timing!

615
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:07,125
I had to have
hit him!

616
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,291
Yes!. The SWAN
will be mine!

617
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,875
What was that?

618
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,875
What is it...?
What happened?

619
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,916
Wait...
What's that sound?

620
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,125
It's the White
Sacred Mechanoid!

621
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,458
It vanished!

622
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:03,125
Go! That's our cue...!
Release the partitions now!

623
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,458
They're getting away!

624
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,875
Don't give chase!

625
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,458
Doll has made
an appearance.

626
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,000
We'll be finished if she uses
the Shield of Gaia in here!

627
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,791
Aura and Yukine, you
stand by on the SWAN.

628
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,250
Kenshi and Wahan,
lead the way!

629
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:21,833
Doll...

630
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,916
Perfect!
Drop it, now!

631
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,458
Get out of there, now!

632
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,458
Oh no!

633
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,166
There isn't any time!

634
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,916
It disappeared.

635
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,416
How'd he do that?!

636
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,125
All right! Let's
give these a try.

637
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:06,166
Yukine, let me
see that rail gun.

638
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,708
Despite the power
reactor's low output,

639
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,666
its power is increasing.

640
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
This oughtta work!

641
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,833
Here I go!

642
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,041
So cool.

643
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,250
Wahan, this new
model is awesome!

644
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:44,875
No way... You are
the one who is awesome!

645
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:46,875
Hey! How long are
you going to stare?!.

646
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,375
Take this opportunity
to pull out!

647
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,208
Yes, ma'am!

648
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,416
What is
with that power?!

649
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,833
We gotta get outta here!

650
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,333
If that hits us when we
don't have our shields......

651
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,000
we'll be dead for sure!

652
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:04,916
I see...

653
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,083
So it's exactly
as I expected.

654
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,958
Mexiah...

655
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:31,875
Good... Everything
is in place now.

656
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,875
What?

657
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,916
Kenshi needs a legendary
weapon befitting his strength

658
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,208
in order to defeat
the Sacred Mechalord?

659
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,916
Next time on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

660
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,333
"Fruition."

661
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:19,458
Hopefully, we will be able
get him one for real cheap

662
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:21,583
at a bargain sale...
or something.
