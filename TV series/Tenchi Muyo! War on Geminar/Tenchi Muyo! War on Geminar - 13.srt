1
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,791
Huh... Tonight's just
as quiet as last night.

2
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,375
Hey, are we positive those
guys are headed our way?

3
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,000
We sure are...
They have to.

4
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,625
Havoniwa's
railway is down,

5
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,208
so this is the only
entrance to the Holy Land.

6
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,125
Do you think our forces
will be enough to stop them

7
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,166
when they get here, though?

8
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,083
What, are you
scared, princess...?

9
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,916
This was originally
a fortress...

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
We have buried
defensive capabilities.

11
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah...

12
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,000
Not to mention the underground
barrier reactors here

13
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,125
makes the whole
joint Ena free.

14
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,833
Their Sacred Mechanoids won't
be able to get close to us.

15
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,125
That's a good point, and with
the formation we're using,

16
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,958
I guess we only have to worry
about the highlands.

17
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,500
Those long cords
all over the place

18
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,583
will keep their cabled Sacred
Mechanoids from attacking.

19
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,041
And their Mechaworkers
got nothing on us.

20
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,083
As long as we've got our
Shield of Gaia replicas

21
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,125
there's no way
they can beat us.

22
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,750
I'm looking forward to it.

23
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,583
They're weak little babies,
and they don't even know it.

24
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, but... what about
that white one...?

25
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,291
He can move outside
the Draft, can't he?

26
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,500
Well, the white
one won't come...

27
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,583
Don't worry about him.

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,791
Even if he did show up,
we'll still be able to win

29
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,958
as long as we can hold out until
the Sacred Mechalord revives.

30
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,833
If Babalun conquers the world,
we'll get rewarded big time.

31
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,958
So, I'm counting
on you guys

32
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,041
to make sure this
goes down as planned.

33
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,041
No mistakes, got it?

34
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,750
Yeah...
we got it.

35
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,000
Woah... What the...

36
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,833
We're under attack!

37
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,500
Move it, now...!
Activate the Mechas!

38
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,250
And so it begins...

39
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,791
All units,
commence fire!

40
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,958
Shoot all you want--
there's no way

41
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,916
you're taking this checkpoint
down with a frontal assault.

42
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,875
Make sure you
don't get too close.

43
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,625
Concentrate fire
on the gate's cannons!

44
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,541
Would you like me
to deploy my unit, now?

45
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,083
Hey, Lan!. Havoniwa
sent out cabled Mechanoids!

46
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,416
Don't panic.

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,416
They can't get close
with those cables attached.

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,916
Just like the
battery-operated ones.

49
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,958
Oh, no!

50
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,208
You didn't expect
those landmines, did ya?

51
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,166
You know, it's almost too
easy with that white one gone.

52
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,708
What the...?

53
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,708
What was that?
What's going on out there?

54
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,416
Changing the screen, now!

55
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,833
What the heck are those?

56
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,708
They look like
moving armors.

57
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,291
And they're using
steam reactors!

58
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,083
Take that!

59
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,791
I think I got 'em!

60
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,083
Why are RONIN so stupid?

61
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,583
Every highland Sacred
Mechanoid we've got is down!

62
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,791
They also severed
the battery line!

63
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,833
Try to keep it together.

64
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,375
They haven't broken
through, yet!

65
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,958
Get the Mechaworkers out there
and reconnect those lines!

66
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,333
And in the meantime, deploy
all remaining Mechanoids!

67
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,125
We've still got this!

68
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,250
First line of defense:
Damage at forty percent!

69
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,000
The checkpoint itself remains
largely undamaged, sir...

70
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,000
but the majority
of Mechanoids are inoperable.

71
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,083
Let's have Lan continue
to hold down the fort...

72
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,500
But more importantly,
is the SWAN present?

73
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,333
Not as of yet, sir.

74
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,125
How peculiar...

75
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,666
The SWAN should be
participating in the attack

76
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,708
on the checkpoint...

77
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,333
This is BABEL's team
from the Top Observatory!.

78
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,958
We've finally
located the SWAN!

79
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,125
Believe it or not, she's
traveling through the highlands.

80
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,208
What? You're kidding me!
How can the SWAN manage that?

81
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,125
Hooray for Aunt Flora not
being a complete idiot!

82
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,916
She had holes dug
throughout the highlands

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
for Aho barrier reactors,

84
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,833
and then used the reactors
to supply the tracks with Ena.

85
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,500
Whatever gaps are
in the tracks are, like,

86
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,208
at the most a few hundred
meters apart, which is awesome!

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,291
The reactor can totally
make up for the difference

88
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,708
since it's set to use
Kenshi's compressed bullets.

89
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,875
I must admit, it was
a good strategy...

90
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,916
But do not praise her too much.
It'll go straight to her head.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
We are not praising
her at all.

92
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,208
We are merely stating
she is not as dumb

93
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,583
as we originally thought.

94
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,500
We are on target to reach the
designated point momentarily.

95
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,916
And so, Lashara,

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,291
I hope we will meet again
if you happen to survive.

97
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,500
We refuse to die
until after we've gone

98
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,083
to your poorly
attended funeral!

99
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,083
Funny, I was about
to say the same thing.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,208
An armored locomotive
is approaching

101
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,458
from the opposite direction.

102
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,000
All cannons target
the warship BABEL!

103
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,791
Cannons,
commence fire!

104
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,916
Commence
counter-fire, now.

105
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,166
Ooh, Maria is going all out!
We like it!.

106
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,541
'Tis our time
to descend as well.

107
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,750
Let's go! Everyone
prepare for impact!

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,541
We can turn around here and
try to attack the checkpoint

109
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,916
from behind!

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,750
Sounds good. We're
counting on you, Lithia.

111
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,375
Oh, don't worry,
Empress...

112
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,166
We've got everything
under control.

113
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,541
That's right, we do...!
We're ready to fight...!

114
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,416
Anything for King Kenshi!

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,125
Cool, yeah, thanks...

116
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,041
'Kay, be careful.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,208
That is so like
Queen Flora...

118
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,375
She has always been one
who enjoys a good stunt.

119
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,083
Curse that woman...!
We've no time for this.

120
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,333
I've almost resurrected
the Sacred Mechalord!

121
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,666
Would you like me
to send Doll out?

122
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,916
If you're willing
to allow it... I'll go.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,750
Very well.

124
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,500
This is it...
Show me what you can do.

125
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,458
Yes, sir!

126
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,208
Good luck, sir.

127
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,250
I don't need luck.

128
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,041
Bastards...
They're making fun of us!

129
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,000
At this rate,
we're totally screwed!

130
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,791
It's not like we owe
Babalun anything.

131
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,750
If we stay, we're all gonna
get killed. Let's go!

132
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,708
No one's going anywhere...!

133
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,458
If we play our cards right,
we can score an entire country

134
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,083
instead of one measly ship!

135
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,541
We'll get money and jewels.
Anything we want!

136
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,125
Do you understand that?

137
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,125
All we have to do
is defend this fort!.

138
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,708
As long as they don't
sneak in from behind,

139
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,916
we've already won!

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,833
Lan, we have something
approaching us.

141
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,166
What are those?

142
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,666
These are new weapons
invented by my son-in-law!

143
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,958
Now, go!

144
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,875
What is that?!

145
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,291
Oh Lithia, how dare you
try to leave me behind?

146
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,000
I wouldn't miss out on a battle
like this for the world.

147
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,500
But I'll wait
to deal with you

148
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,750
until after I take care
of these minor obstacles.

149
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,458
This is bad.

150
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,958
They came in from behind.

151
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,125
How did this happen?

152
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,416
Die! Die,
you fiends, die!

153
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,291
Remind the other pilot that no
matter what happens around her,

154
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,541
she must stay still while Dame
Morga is in berserker mode...

155
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,791
Anything that
moves is a threat.

156
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,083
Send in the
reinforcements already!

157
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,333
That's why we have a
rear guard, isn't it?!

158
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,833
First line of defense,
reporting in...!

159
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,791
We need help!
Second line of defense!.

160
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,333
We're requesting
immediate reinforcements!

161
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,750
Second line of defense,
please respond!

162
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,125
Second line of defense,
are you there?!

163
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,041
Third line
of defense, respond!

164
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,916
Hello? Hello!

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,166
I did as you ordered

166
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,916
and had the second and
third lines of defense

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,916
pull out of the
battle immediately...

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,750
They are scheduled to rendezvous
with our main forces

169
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,583
when they
cross the ravine.

170
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,583
Are you sure about this?.

171
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,041
You will be sacrificing
the first line.

172
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,291
Let them die.

173
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,083
They are nothing more
than money-hungry thugs.

174
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,875
They might have become
a threat later, anyway.

175
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,708
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

176
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,583
What is it?

177
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,750
Probably the unit strengthening
defenses in the ravine.

178
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,625
It seems they
intend to rendezvous

179
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,708
with the main forces
in the Holy Land.

180
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,625
I don't think so.

181
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,833
Team One and Team Two!
Enter your frames...!

182
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,916
Team Three on down!
Prepare for mobilization!

183
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,541
Now then, ladies...

184
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,958
You can win, provided you remain
calm and do as you were trained.

185
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,791
Who are they?

186
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,583
Enemy Sacred Mechanoids?

187
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,416
Where did
they come from?

188
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,416
Here we go!.
Are you ready, Lapis?

189
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,166
I'm ready,
Lady Lithia!

190
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,416
We're ready
to fight, too!

191
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,750
Yeah!

192
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,958
Wait, what are students
from the Holy Land doing here?

193
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,125
Well, that's a surprise!
Who would have imagined

194
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,208
we'd run into our very own
Student Council President here?

195
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,833
You think we should...
go help 'em out?

196
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,541
I have no intention of
fighting my classmates.

197
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,458
And besides that...

198
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,750
we should make sure we see
this with our own eyes.

199
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,875
You know, where our ideals
will ultimately take us

200
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,708
and everything.

201
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,166
We will arrive
at the Holy Land soon.

202
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,000
We hope you are prepared.

203
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,333
No matter what,
we cannot allow them

204
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,875
to resurrect
the Sacred Mechalord.

205
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
Babalun must not succeed.

206
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,958
Princess Lashara, there's a
Sacred Mechanoid in front of us.

207
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,708
Who is that?!

208
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,708
It's Dagmyer...
What's he doing?

209
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,916
Kenshi Masaki, I challenge
you to a one-on-one duel!

210
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,708
A duel, huh?

211
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,291
We shall fight him...

212
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,666
Kenshi, you should go and deal
with the Sacred Mechalord!

213
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,041
Listen to Princess Aura.

214
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,583
Ignore that jerk!

215
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,791
What is that?.

216
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,500
Wait, hold on...

217
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,458
He's holding a Mechalord's
barrier reactor!

218
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,291
We won't be able
to get near him.

219
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,416
Will he self-destruct
if you don't accept?

220
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,833
Kenshi, we don't
have time for this!

221
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,208
I don't know
if it'll work...

222
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,291
but try compressing
his Sacred Mechanoid!

223
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,000
I've gotta accept
his challenge.

224
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,041
What?

225
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,791
We don't have
that kind of time!.

226
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
Kenshi!

227
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,791
Chiaia...! Let Kenshi
do as he chooses.

228
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,208
But why?!

229
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,000
Because he is probably
trying to show his respect

230
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,041
for Dagmyer's resolve
in some weird way.

231
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,958
Again, we don't
have time for that!

232
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,458
He is a Sacred
Mechamaster.

233
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,750
A genuine one.

234
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,750
I am glad you accepted.

235
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,541
Although, I will admit
the ultimatum

236
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,708
was somewhat cowardly
on my part.

237
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,875
"If only you
weren't around."...

238
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,041
I've thought
that many times...

239
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,708
I should've seen you
for what you were...

240
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,416
My own personal challenge.

241
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,875
And now...
I will finally crush you!

242
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,791
Now come at me!

243
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,166
All right.

244
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,625
How dare you?!

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,083
I simply can't deny
his skill anymore.

246
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,416
You did well... Dagmyer.

247
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,791
What are those waves?

248
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,291
Oh no!

249
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,833
Behold the Sacred
Mechalord's resurrection!

250
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,416
No...

251
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,250
The Sacred Mechalord.

252
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,250
We're too late.

253
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,541
Don't worry, ladies, we were
prepared for this the second

254
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,125
they tried to buy
more time...!

255
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,791
Kenshi!

256
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,875
Oh, come on.

257
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,333
Kenshi,...

258
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,500
We shall confirm the true
reason you came to this world...

259
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,416
Now that we are in
our time of need.

260
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,208
Wow... he's incredible.

261
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,375
His fighting is on par
with the Sacred Mechalord.

262
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,083
Yes, and we expected
no less from him.

263
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,666
I am honestly surprised he
is able to stand his ground...

264
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,958
In that case...

265
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,500
What is he doing?

266
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,958
Sacred Mechamaster
from another world...

267
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,458
Prepare to experience
Gaia's true form!

268
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,583
I am the perfect
form of Gaia.

269
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,875
No...!
Prime Minister Babalun!

270
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,833
Target the Sacred Mechalord!
Concentrate all fire on Gaia!

271
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,875
Help Kenshi!

272
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,291
You fools.

273
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,625
Princess Maria!
Watch out!

274
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,000
Disconnect command car!

275
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,875
Die!

276
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, thank you, Kenshi!

277
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,625
It's too dangerous...!
Get back!

278
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,041
We shall retreat as well.

279
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,583
The last thing we need
to do right now

280
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,375
is get in Kenshi's way!

281
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,500
Right behind you.

282
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,666
It cannot be helped.

283
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,666
Let's go.

284
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,041
Kenshi...

285
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,541
I'm counting
on you, Kenshi.

286
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,500
This is all Rea's doing...

287
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,791
And it pains my heart to have
to thrust this burden upon you.

288
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,875
I hope it's not too late for us
to provide him assistance...

289
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,791
My time is almost up...

290
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,791
More little baby
chicks to kill!

291
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,250
Not this time!

292
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,791
Oh, you're finished, now!

293
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,750
Lapis!

294
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:16,041
If it weren't for my operational
limit, they'd be dead!

295
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,458
Number two! Number four!
Number six! Swap out!

296
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,791
Well... that'd be us!

297
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,875
Let's go teach those
jerks a lesson!

298
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,416
Just in time.
I'm at my limit!

299
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,000
Thanks, ladies...
Have fun!

300
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,916
You ready for this?

301
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,916
They've sent out new pilots!

302
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You're not calling
us cowards, are you?.

303
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,833
Because I'm pretty sure
you were the ones

304
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,875
who attacked us en masse!

305
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,125
Huh. They're
barely even a match.

306
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,291
What matters most
is who can last...

307
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,708
Our girls may be
professional,

308
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,166
but even their odds
won't be good

309
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,833
if they're forced to keep
fighting fresh pilots.

310
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:16,500
So power and quantity beat
experience and expertise...

311
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,916
This is most educational.

312
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,750
Plus, it would seem
their most recent backup

313
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,666
is rather experienced
themselves.

314
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,750
Tides have
changed... huh?

315
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,750
Seems so.

316
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,291
It looks like we've subdued
them for the most part...

317
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,541
I think it's best now to
proceed through the ravine

318
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,333
and eliminate
any remaining units

319
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,541
that may be on our way
to fight at the checkpoint.

320
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,375
Empress Lashara!
We're in.

321
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,166
The checkpoint's gates
have been forced open!

322
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,250
I see...

323
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,666
So we were unable to stop the
Sacred Mechalord's resurrection.

324
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,250
I know we would've
made it in time

325
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,750
if it weren't
for Dagmyer's stupid duel.

326
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,375
Of course!.

327
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,166
As a Sacred Mechamaster,
that was only natural for him!.

328
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,875
He has such
ardent courage!.

329
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,833
I keep liking
my son-in-law all the more!

330
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,916
Unfortunately,
the Sacred Mechalord

331
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,208
has already surpassed
our worst fears!

332
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,666
Babalun somehow merged
with the Shield of Gaia

333
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,333
and became one being
with the Sacred Mechalord.

334
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,083
He became Gaia!

335
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,208
Is that so?

336
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:38,000
If it is, Babalun
has succeeded.

337
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,375
Before the fusion, Kenshi
and the Sacred Mechalord

338
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,250
seemed like
they were equals.

339
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,083
But now I'm afraid
he's at a disadvantage.

340
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,666
He's fighting out
there right now...

341
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,500
He's all by himself...
And he's doing it for us.

342
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,458
Well, come on...
Let's go help Kenshi, then!

343
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,958
In that case...
I wanna go, too!

344
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,958
You can stay!.
Bad girl! Bad Aunt Flora!

345
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,791
What? But I want
to go help him!

346
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,833
Don't be mean!
Let me go to Kenshi!..

347
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,916
You be careful
out there, okay?

348
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,333
Tell Kenshi we're
thinking about him.

349
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,833
Yeah! Let go!.
No! Stop!

350
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,041
Don't you lose!
That's an order, Chiaia!

351
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,791
Okay!

352
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,791
I'm a little surprised you
didn't want to go with them.

353
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,083
We thought
we'd help make sure

354
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,541
they had somewhere
to come home to.

355
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,500
This is total devastation.

356
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,375
And this is what Kenshi
has been up against.

357
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,541
Oh, Kenshi...

358
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:45,500
Yeah, I figured its head
would be its toughest section.

359
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,750
Obstinate wretch!

360
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:53,250
Okay... How's this?!

361
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,166
So strong.

362
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,625
Yes, but the difference in their
frames' power is too great...

363
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:03,708
It has incredible
defensive capabilities.

364
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,916
Fool! The outcome
will always be the same!

365
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,375
Fool! Oh, Kenshi...

366
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,916
If he keeps it up, Kenshi
will hit his limit sooner

367
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,291
rather than later...
And if that happens...

368
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,500
Is there anything that we
can do to help? Anything at all?

369
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,625
How can he survive?

370
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,583
Do you not understand
this is futile?

371
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,250
Wahan...! Look...!

372
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,083
Down there!

373
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,041
Oh, heck yeah!

374
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,500
Well...?
Is it usable?

375
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,791
Totally!

376
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,041
But we'll have
to make sure it's charged

377
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,958
before we'll be able
to activate anything.

378
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,791
A Mechalord's barrier
reactor emits killer waves!

379
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,416
Kenshi!
Do you copy?!

380
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,083
Huh...? Wahan?
Is that you?

381
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,291
We're going
to overcharge that

382
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,458
Sacred Mechalord's
Aho barrier reactor...!

383
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,250
Hit Gaia with it!

384
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,916
No! That's
too dangerous!

385
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,416
You're the one in danger...

386
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,666
We're trying
to help you this time!

387
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,625
We are at forty...

388
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,041
Climbing to forty-five...

389
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,458
We are at fifty!

390
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,416
No, please don't...!
I can take care of him!

391
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,958
Fifty-five...

392
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,500
Sixty...

393
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,583
We are at sixty-five...

394
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,458
We...

395
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,208
We are at seventy...

396
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,250
I said no!

397
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,916
We can't stop, now...
Not after we've come so far!

398
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,375
Seventy-five...

399
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,458
Eighty.

400
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,333
Eighty-five...

401
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,833
We're...
up to ninety.

402
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,125
Ninety-one...

403
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,916
Ninety-two...

404
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,333
Enough already!
Everybody, get out of here!

405
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,833
Ninety-five...

406
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,416
I said get out of here...!
That's an order from your king!

407
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,666
Shut up and quit
being stupid!

408
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,625
Listen to me. If you keep
whining like a little baby,

409
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,250
I'm going to take away every
last crystal you've been hiding!

410
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,250
Okay, fine...!
I'll do what you guys want.

411
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,916
Finally!

412
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,750
Curse you!

413
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:13,791
Look out!

414
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,541
Aura, no!

415
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,291
Die!

416
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:23,958
Chiaia!

417
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,750
Don't worry about me!

418
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,083
Now's your chance, Kenshi!

419
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,375
Ninety-eight...

420
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,166
Ninety-nine!

421
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,416
Critical!

422
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,791
Now, Kenshi! Go!

423
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,583
Chiaia, get down!

424
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,708
Did it work?

425
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,833
No, not yet.

426
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,208
Okay, how did
that not work?!

427
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,125
Die!

428
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,541
Chiaia...

429
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,458
Get everybody
out of here!

430
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,958
But Kenshi, wait!

431
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,875
It's amazing.
He still hasn't given up.

432
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,541
Kenshi...

433
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,541
Is that Doll...?
And Mexiah, too?

434
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,916
It can't be...

435
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,916
Kenshi...
Please, save me!

436
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,916
What?! How dare you
disobey my orders?!

437
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:27,125
I will not tolerate defiance!

438
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,291
You will pay!

439
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:56,125
Nothing can damage
the Shield of Gaia!

440
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,833
What is that?

441
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,666
The massive amount of Ena
that got trapped inside

442
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,541
when he compressed the sword
is emitting feedback!

443
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,750
You cannot pierce through me!

444
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:24,000
I shall not die by your hands!

445
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,875
You are a fool!

446
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,375
Hey! What's
keeping you?!

447
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,625
Will someone please cut off
that thing's creepy head?!

448
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,458
Come on!.
You've almost got him!

449
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,458
Go!

450
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,458
Hurry!

451
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,916
Quit screwing around!

452
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,500
Hurry up and kill him
so we can save my sister...!

453
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:47,750
If you do it right now,

454
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,583
I'll let you dig up
all the SWAN's crystals!

455
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,166
Consider it done...!

456
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,833
You're going down, Gaia!

457
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,291
What?!

458
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:10,625
No...
what did you do?!

459
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,666
He... He did it.

460
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,833
Amazing...

461
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:31,166
Mexiah... Mexiah!.
Please wake up!

462
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:35,583
Come on...
Wake up, Big Sis Mexiah!

463
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,625
Hi, Kenshi.

464
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,916
Does this mean
that you saved me?

465
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,791
So... I have to know...

466
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,958
Which body of mine
did you prefer:

467
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:56,458
This one or
my busty adult form?

468
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,333
I don't really know...

469
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,458
Well, I mean...

470
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,875
usually at the end
of stories like this one,

471
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,958
the hero and the
princess he valiantly...

472
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,833
...rescued are supposed
to kiss, isn't that right?

473
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,791
I don't see a princess!

474
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,875
Chiaia...! Have
your kicks grown soft

475
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,416
in the short time
we've been apart?

476
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,208
Will you shut up!

477
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,666
He's alive!

478
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:39,125
Mister Ulyte?

479
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:45,166
Ulyte. There's not much time!
Hurry and give me your body!

480
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,833
So that must be
Gaia's true form?

481
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,750
What's going on?

482
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,833
This ends now,
my brother.

483
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:10,625
Mister Ulyte!

484
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,458
You're... burning up...
Are you sick?

485
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:17,875
No... My body...
is leaving me...

486
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:20,833
but not before
I fulfilled my goals...

487
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:24,125
And now...
I can go in peace.

488
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,625
No, you can't go!

489
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,958
Calm down...

490
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,583
It isn't as though
I'm going to die, Kenshi.

491
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,416
What. It's Rea?

492
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,875
I mean,
it's Neizai?!

493
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,291
Neizai?!

494
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,041
I see...

495
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,208
So it was you...

496
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:52,041
The one they planted in
you back then was Neizai.

497
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:55,958
No... How dare
they plot against me!

498
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,333
My father planted
a Core Crystal

499
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:09,875
inside of my older brother
and me when I was just a boy.

500
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,833
It gradually
eroded my flesh,

501
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,250
but fortunately I was
still a child...

502
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:18,041
My actual tissues
adapted to the crystal.

503
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,958
My body changed
to match Ulyte or Neizai,

504
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,791
depending on whose
awareness was stronger.

505
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,708
Ulyte had practically
reached his physical limit...

506
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:29,083
but he was able
to hang on until today...

507
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:32,250
all because of the drink
you gave him, Kenshi...

508
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,666
You have our gratitude.

509
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,791
Like from
when he was sick?

510
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,166
Gaia's core ate away
at my father...

511
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,583
and then...

512
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:43,041
it took my older brother...
I was just a child...

513
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,833
so there was no way
for me to stop him...

514
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,708
let alone... find a way
to defeat him by myself...

515
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,666
All I could really do...

516
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,458
Well... was hide the fact that
I was Neizai and bide my time,

517
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,833
and, that's about it.

518
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:59,666
Now, you mustn't continue
to keep everyone waiting.

519
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,416
Sacred Mechamaster
from another world...

520
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,875
Quickly! This way!

521
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,000
Um... Hi, guys!

522
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,041
Well, it looks like someone
just stole the 'princess

523
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,583
in need of protection'
position.

524
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,750
So let me get
this straight:

525
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,000
Mister Ulyte
is really you, Neizai?

526
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,000
Simply put, we are the same,
yet we're not the same.

527
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,041
That's not simple at all.

528
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,416
You know, your mother
is the one responsible

529
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,041
for this little
predicament.

530
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,416
I don't like this!

531
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,291
We already settled the
problem regarding ownership

532
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,083
over Kenshi, lady!

533
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,208
Well, I wasn't part
of that decision.

534
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,208
I can't believe her...

535
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,416
She pulls the same kinds
of stunts as Miss Mexiah.

536
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
It's deplorable at best.

537
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,000
She will not...

538
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,416
That hussy will
never be my sister!

539
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,708
You know, since we've taken care
of this whole Babalun problem,

540
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,041
we might as well
revisit the whole

541
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,708
"who owns Kenshi"
thing now, right? !

542
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:14,875
Wahanly! Please do not tell us
that you want him as well?

543
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,750
No!

544
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:20,333
Kenshi has already sworn to
marry into the Shurifon family.

545
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sorry, but it's
only natural for Kenshi

546
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,750
to take Yukine's hand
in marriage!

547
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,541
Aura and Maria...

548
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,333
We can't believe
you're doing this, too!

549
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,625
I know! Since this
is becoming a big mess,

550
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:33,541
why doesn't Sir Kenshi
hook up with me instead?

551
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,083
Certainly not!

552
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,166
What is going
on in that tiny...

553
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,875
Um... Pardon
my interruption...

554
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,541
Yeah...?
What do you want?

555
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,916
I wish to confirm the
Student Council's reward

556
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,375
for our consistent assistance
throughout this incident.

557
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,333
We don't know why
you're asking us.

558
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,583
We thought Shtrayu was supposed
to become a subordinate state

559
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:51,958
to cover
all those costs.

560
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,708
Yes, we are not
necessarily interested

561
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,291
in anything like that.

562
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,791
Well, what
do you want, then?

563
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,916
Are you kidding us?

564
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,541
I am now speaking
on everyone's behalf...

565
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:09,416
We would like to reserve the
right to marry Kenshi Masaki.

566
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,166
For the record, all the
female students present

567
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,208
have given their consent.

568
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,750
The order of marriage is first
come, first served, right...?!

569
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,541
Last one there
is a rotten egg!

570
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,166
Morga!
That's cheating!

571
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,833
I won't lose!

572
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:33,000
Where do you think
you are all going?

573
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,541
He still belongs to us!

574
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,708
Which of the forests do
you want to get married in?

575
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,416
Don't you wanna help me do
tests on my new Mechaworker!

576
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,541
Yukine, hurry up
and steal Kenshi away!

577
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,791
Oh yeah.

578
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,791
Baby boy...
Come to sister!

579
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,750
Oh my!
Kenshi is just so cute!

580
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:53,541
Ugh, I don't know how much
more of this crap I can take.

581
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,833
Back off, Kenshi
belongs to us!

582
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,291
They're all so scary.

583
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,708
Mob mentality
at its worst.

584
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,291
Sorry, ladies!

585
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,541
What?. He left!

586
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,000
What are you waiting for?
After him!

587
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,583
And there they go again...

588
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,458
Ah, well, I suppose this
must be our big, fancy finale.

589
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,875
No matter
where I go in this world,

590
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:53,875
I'll be screwed if I don't have
some sort of peace offering.
