1
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,916
Thank you
for your help, Aura.

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,041
Of course... I was merely
fulfilling my duties, Empress.

3
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,916
They're finally here.
It's the Holy Land's envoy.

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,125
Wondrous.

5
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,333
We cannot wait to be
free of that luggage.

6
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,375
Speaking of which,
do you have some sort of plan

7
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,583
on what to do with your
other piece of luggage?

8
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,250
We shall be taking
Kenshi to the Holy Land

9
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,291
to act as our attendant.

10
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,958
As your what?!

11
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,875
It is imperative we establish
the fact the boy belongs to us

12
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,583
before the truth
should get out.

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,958
So I take it he didn't
give you any information

14
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,208
on our enemy, either?

15
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,125
After he awoke in
the Summoning Ruins,

16
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,458
they trained
him underground

17
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,541
to keep him from figuring
out where he was.

18
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,041
According to Kenshi, all of
his instructors wore masks.

19
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,000
But... why be so thorough?

20
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,625
Because they were
planning to use him

21
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,583
to murder the
head of a nation.

22
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,416
Of course... but why get rid
of a male Sacred Mechamaster?

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,625
It makes me wonder if they're
able to summon regardless

24
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,916
of the stars' position...

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,083
Yes, we were curious
about the same thing...

26
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,416
but Kenshi said,
when he awoke,

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,291
he saw nothing that would
have led him to believe

28
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,375
they were performing
any rituals...

29
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,083
'Tis no matter, our biggest
problem at the moment is Doll,

30
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,541
the girl who piloted
the black Sacred Mechanoid.

31
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,708
A Black Mechanoid?

32
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,208
Supposedly, she is the
same age as we are.

33
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,166
But how?
That's so young!

34
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,333
As with Kenshi... we have never
heard of a Sacred Mechamaster

35
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,166
like her before...

36
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,375
Perhaps she is not
from our world, either.

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,208
There's no way!...

38
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,958
Is there?

39
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,666
If she is from another world...

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,875
It is vital that we claim Kenshi
for ourselves immediately.

41
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,625
Why are you so willing to
endanger yourself over this boy?

42
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,958
What exactly do you want?

43
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,625
We want to see
how he will change

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,875
under new circumstances...

45
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,875
After all, his situation is
very similar to that of our own.

46
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,416
Yes, understood.

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,541
I have to admit, though;

48
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,750
I'm a bit worried
it would be dangerous

49
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,625
to let him run
around by himself.

50
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,291
I can do this on my own!

51
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,125
His skin is so smooth;
it's amazing!

52
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,166
Isn't his face just the
cutest up close like this?

53
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,500
Be sure to clean that boy
from his head to his toes!

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,875
Okay!

55
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,291
From head to toe, huh?

56
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,666
Empress, please!

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,875
Come on... Don't tell me
you're not curious, too!

58
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,291
What?... I mean,
that is so not the point.

59
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,666
I can't believe
how built his chest is!

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,833
Same story down here.

61
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,875
Oh yeah, you are so right!

62
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,916
Wait, you shouldn't do that!

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,250
Shoot, I think he's waking up.

64
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,875
Don't worry; we'll
take care of this for you.

65
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,583
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
No-no-no!

66
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,250
Trust us,
we don't mind.

67
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,166
You're so cute;
I'm gonna die.

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,250
Not if I die first!

69
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,708
Nice... Not
half bad, are you?

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,458
Wow... Yeah,
he cleaned up well.

71
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,000
All right, Kenshi...

72
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,708
Now that you look
somewhat presentable,

73
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,291
we have a
proposal for you.

74
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,708
Would you like to join us?...

75
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,125
You can be our new attendant.

76
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,541
So you know, we've
taken a liking to you.

77
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,416
Oh... But um...

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,666
I, uh

79
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,916
Look at us, Kenshi,
not the floor!

80
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,416
So you know, we have
taken a liking to you...

81
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,666
Fairly strange,
considering. Right?

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,666
But that's
the way of things.

83
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,125
The Holy Land should be
entering visibility soon...

84
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,041
Kenshi, you are quite
free to accompany us

85
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,041
if you are so inclined.

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,375
His physique and mannerisms
are rather unique...

87
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,958
I have lived in the royal
palace for a long time,

88
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,750
and I have seen more people
than I care to remember.

89
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,375
But this one...

90
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,958
We may have just borne witness
to an historical moment, ladies.

91
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,791
By the way, what exactly
is "the Holy Land"?

92
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
'Tis a place where the
Church oversees baptisms

93
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,625
in the name
of the Goddesses.

94
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,958
People from the Continent

95
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,041
who wish to become
Sacred Mechamasters gather

96
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,625
at the academy located
there for schooling.

97
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,958
Wow... You'll,
be a Mechamaster?

98
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,458
No, we will not,

99
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,750
but... You will learn more
of the details once we arrive.

100
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,000
That is the gate
to the Holy Land.

101
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,708
It's so beautiful!.

102
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,166
What's in there?

103
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,916
The Sacred Mechalord.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,250
The Mechanoids were
modeled after it.

105
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,083
Empress Lashara!
I'm gonna go on ahead!...

106
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,916
What's up, Kenshi;
I'll see ya later!

107
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,541
Why's she going first?

108
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,791
Shouldn't we all be together
if this is the Holy Land?

109
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,041
There are certain
conventions for entry...

110
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,333
The SWAN is supposed
to enter outside the Draft,

111
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,000
so they had to unload the
Mechalord while they could.

112
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,250
Outside the Draft?

113
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,875
Yes, look.

114
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,583
This is Ena's Draft...

115
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,250
Is it not rather pretty?...

116
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,875
From this area up,
you cannot use aho...

117
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,041
That is why they
had to unload

118
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,541
the Sacred
Mechalord elsewhere.

119
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,583
Empress Lashara...

120
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,166
We are now entering
the Holy Land.

121
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,083
I can't believe how big
this thing is up close!

122
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,875
Ew... a Havoniwan ship!

123
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,791
Like that's what we'd want
to see upon our arrival.

124
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,166
The academy is on the other
side of that stairway.

125
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,125
Try and keep it together
once we get inside, okay?

126
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,375
Okay!

127
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,458
So he is now Empress
Lashara's attendant...

128
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,458
Just as we predicted.

129
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,708
Yes... Indeed he is...

130
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,166
Still though,
I was rather surprised

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,666
when this reacted to
the boy the way it did.

132
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,916
Do you think it's him?

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,125
I'm not sure,
but if so...

134
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,583
We may achieve our goals
before much longer.

135
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,250
Yes... We may.

136
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,250
Will you stop making
that idiotic face!.

137
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,250
There are students
watching you.

138
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,125
It looks like
the Princess is back.

139
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,291
She's an Empress
now, remember?

140
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,375
Wow... Who is that guy?

141
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,750
Must be Empress
Lashara's attendant.

142
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,375
I don't know if you can tell,

143
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,000
but it's already being assumed
you're the Empress's attendant.

144
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,750
So please...
try not to do anything

145
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,458
that would embarrass
your mistress.

146
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,958
Understood.

147
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,750
Well, if it
isn't Dagmyer...

148
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,708
Thank you for coming
to welcome us.

149
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,375
Yes... I worried
about you tremendously

150
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
when I heard the SWAN
had been attacked.

151
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,208
Apparently, all I needed
to put me at ease was

152
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,666
to see your smiling face.

153
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,250
Yes... and now you must hurry
and inform your father,

154
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,708
Lord Babalun, that we are
feeling quite, quite well.

155
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,625
After all... We wouldn't want
him worrying himself to death.

156
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,833
Right... As you wish.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,375
That fighting style
and battle stance...

158
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,291
It can't be...

159
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,708
Chiaia...

160
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,875
Was the battle difficult?

161
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,875
It was nothing
I couldn't handle.

162
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,208
Either way, I'm glad
you're all right.

163
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,208
No, I must be wrong.

164
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,500
Where'd he go?

165
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,833
Hey!

166
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,166
What... Did I... Say?

167
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,250
To keep it together.

168
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,625
Do you call
this together?

169
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,083
Wow, he is like, adorable!

170
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,166
He's not a Sacred
Mechamaster, is he?

171
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,500
He isn't wearing a sword, so
maybe he's just an attendant!

172
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,291
What? But he's too young
for that, isn't he?!...

173
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,583
Life as an Empress must
be like, the best ever.

174
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,541
He looks so cute;
like a little Koro!

175
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,208
Ladies, will you mind
your manners, please?

176
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,500
Empress Lashara of Shtrayu and
Princess Maria of Havoniwa...

177
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,375
Things are about
to get ca-razy...

178
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,083
This is Empress
Lashara's attendant.

179
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,958
He's on
the special side.

180
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,791
I will see you later,
Empress Lashara.

181
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,833
Hey!

182
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,458
Hey, Chiaia?...

183
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,375
So do you like have a thing
for that guy or what?

184
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,250
No, he's just a friend
from when I was a kid.

185
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,958
Besides, it doesn't really
matter how much a girl

186
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,708
likes a Mechamaster.

187
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,208
What?.
And why is that?

188
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,750
Shut up!.
We are leaving!

189
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,166
Ow! That's my ear!
Ah-ah!

190
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,833
Wow, it's huge!.
Is this a coliseum?

191
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,041
It was made for Mechanoids,
so yeah it's big.

192
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,083
This is where select
Sacred Mechamasters

193
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,708
from the Continent battle
in the Sacred Tournament...

194
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,625
They are enclosed
by the Draft as they fight

195
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,708
around those pillars...

196
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,333
It is terrifically difficult.

197
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,916
Victory here is an honor...

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,333
The greatest you can earn
as a Sacred Mechamaster.

199
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,458
Oh... Well, it doesn't really
look all that hard to me... Hey!

200
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
Watch it!

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
I saw that earlier!

202
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,791
You did.

203
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,541
The Sacred Mechalord was
originally displayed

204
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,208
as a symbol of power.

205
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,125
We hold a fair number
of ceremonies and events

206
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,666
in this arena...

207
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,958
In fact, tomorrow Chiaia and
Wahanly are going to be knighted

208
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,708
as Sacred Mechamasters.

209
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,708
Cool!.
Congratulations, Chiaia!

210
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,458
Thank you very much.

211
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,125
Oh, Kenshi...
You will be attending, too.

212
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,958
Important figures from
the Holy Land will be there,

213
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,333
and you want him to come?...

214
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:22,333
Are you insane?

215
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,541
If he is attending, everyone
will get the impression

216
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,083
he is our attendant.

217
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,791
I have to admit,
I was somewhat concerned

218
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,166
when I heard the SWAN had been
attacked, Princess Lashara.

219
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,333
Empress!... And there's
no need to lie, Maria.

220
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,625
I'm not lying.

221
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,000
I was worried innocent
people might get injured

222
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,083
because of your
unfortunate situation.

223
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,166
Right, Yukine?

224
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,083
Your face is unfortunate.

225
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,916
Um... Who's that girl?

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,458
She's Princess Maria
Nanadan of Havoniwa...

227
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,958
Otherwise known as
Empress Lashara's cousin.

228
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,875
I'm guessing they're
not the best of friends...

229
00:12:58,958 --> 00:12:59,916
as in not at all.

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,958
They've been
through a lot.

231
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,791
Imagine, the whole ordeal
happened because of your poor

232
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,125
daily conduct...

233
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,416
And poor Chiaia
had to risk her life.

234
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,333
Oh!... We see
that you are toting

235
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,375
around a rather
adorable boy with you.

236
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,791
What did you do that for?

237
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,416
Nice to see you still
have terrible taste...

238
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,875
I bet it's due to immaturity.

239
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,208
What do you mean
"terrible"?... Huh?

240
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,416
That amount of lace is
horribly inappropriate...

241
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,458
A good princess must not
waste the national budget

242
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,875
on such things.

243
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,166
It's a traditional form
of lace from my country...

244
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,500
In fact, even a small
child could make it...

245
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,750
Unfortunately, your country
lacks such special trades.

246
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,708
Kids making lace
is hardly special.

247
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,875
Why am I not surprised you chose
a childish color like purple?

248
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,500
'Tis a royal color, and,
unlike you, I am an Empress.

249
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,708
A childish Empress
who almost got assassinated

250
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,458
because no one respects her.

251
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,833
Well I think you're both
acting like children.

252
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,166
Look I'm sorry;
I didn't mean it; I swear!

253
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,750
Shut up!

254
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,916
Tell us, which one
do you like best?

255
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,666
Which what?

256
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,291
You heard me! Which one
do you think is better?!

257
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,416
Tell us; we will not be angry
if you choose Maria's atrocity.

258
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,708
That is not at all true.

259
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,666
Uh... I can't
really say for sure.

260
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,000
It's okay. I promise
you can tell us the truth...

261
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,916
And I understand
if you choose Lashara;

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
it is only out
of loyalty and pity

263
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,708
for your worthless
and pathetic mistress.

264
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,333
Go ahead!
Who's best?

265
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,125
Okay, uh, um...

266
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,333
I like hers the best.

267
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,791
Yukine!

268
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,875
I'm so sorry for
keeping you waiting.

269
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,916
Empress Lashara of Shtrayu
took me into her services...

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,583
And tomorrow I become
a Sacred Mechamaster...

271
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,500
Everything is gonna better
than I could've ever imagined!

272
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,958
Honestly... Why were we
forced to endure all of that

273
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,458
just for the privilege
of starting school?!

274
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,791
That is proof that you have our
permission to enter our dorm.

275
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,125
Do not take it off.

276
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,166
But... Empress Lashara...

277
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,458
It's just that-

278
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,458
If you like, I'd be happy
to add a leash to it,

279
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,333
to keep you from wandering off
and getting into trouble.

280
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,125
Really.

281
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,791
Why did you have to be
so inconsiderate?!

282
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,458
She's talking
about earlier.

283
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,125
Yeah, well, I didn't think
flipping up each other's skirts

284
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,458
was very considerate either,
but that's just me.

285
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,708
The only thing they're
allowed to wear

286
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,041
while they're here are
those boring uniforms,

287
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,666
and because of that
they compete over

288
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,000
who has the best
undergarments.

289
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,125
Speaking of inconsiderate,
we cannot believe

290
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
how rude Maria's little
attendant, Yukine, was.

291
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,083
How dare she barge in
on a battle between us!

292
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,666
What was she thinking?!

293
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,875
I think she might've been trying
to stop you two from fighting.

294
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,250
You can't really blame
her for that, can you?

295
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,625
Excuse us?!

296
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,333
It's just that if I had
picked either one of you

297
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,375
over the other, you would
probably still be arguing.

298
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,125
True. Maria
is beyond stubborn.

299
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,375
She's not the only one.

300
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,000
What was that?!
Nothing.

301
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,375
Besides, she doesn't strike me
as the type of person who cares

302
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,666
about stuff like having
a prettier underskirt thing.

303
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,958
So what you're saying
is that you like her.

304
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,750
Well... She's like
pretty or whatever...

305
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,833
She has this air
of maturity, too.

306
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,291
How rude.

307
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,458
What?!. No, I'm just-Sorry,
I won't talk anymore.

308
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,333
There's no reason
to be sorry!

309
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,750
After all,

310
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,458
there's a decent chance
you might marry her someday.

311
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,916
It would be horrible

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,250
if she failed to fulfill
her given duty...

313
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,333
Do your best to get to know
her and see what happens.

314
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,916
Wait... Marry her?

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,291
Sacred Mechanoids are the
ultimate weapons on this world.

316
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,000
As such, marriages to Sacred
Mechamasters are supervised

317
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,791
by their countries
in order to ensure

318
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,958
they produce highly
gifted children.

319
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,458
We suppose it could be seen
as similar to breeding horses,

320
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,625
and Sacred Mechamasters are
like our own thoroughbreds.

321
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,083
Yes!. To put it
quite bluntly,

322
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,875
marriage is basically
a stud service here.

323
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,250
Did you say
stud service?!

324
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,625
Too blunt, Empress!

325
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,208
Hey, don't get
upset with us!

326
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,166
The reality is there
are far more females

327
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,166
than males
in our population.

328
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,458
Like it or not, you may be
united with one of the girls

329
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,833
from this school.

330
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,708
Female Sacred Mechamasters
can fall in love with

331
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,583
and marry anyone
they want except

332
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,958
for a male Sacred
Mechamaster

333
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,208
as long as they
fulfill their duties...

334
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,458
But Male Sacred Mechamasters
don't get the same luxury

335
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,916
because they're so rare.

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,791
I don't care what you
say; I'm not a horse!

337
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,375
You don't care what I say?!...

338
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,958
I don't know how stuff
goes down where you're from;

339
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,833
but this is how
we do things here!

340
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,916
Well yeah, but...

341
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,458
Have you already forgotten?...

342
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,625
You attempted to assassinate
the Empress Lashara, Kenshi...

343
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,083
Now in your world, murder might
not even be considered a crime.

344
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,458
But in this one, not a single
soul would have flinched

345
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,750
if we had put you
to death immediately.

346
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,708
You're right,
I'm so sorry.

347
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,458
Yes, you are; now stop
forgetting how much you owe us.

348
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,708
And calm down,
you're just a kid,

349
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,375
so it's not like anyone's
gonna marry you off tomorrow...

350
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:12,750
Plus, there's still a chance we
may find a way to send you back.

351
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,250
And do me a favor and try
to keep that whole you being

352
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,541
from another world
thing under wraps.

353
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,583
Yeah, sure thing.

354
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,875
But if I don't
go back before long...

355
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,250
Does that mean I might
end up marrying... you?

356
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,916
If I ever hear
you say that again,

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,083
you're going
to seriously regret it.

358
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,791
That sounds good to me.

359
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,083
Looks as though you two are
having a good time ignoring us.

360
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,375
There you are!.

361
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,666
I need you to stand as
witness for me, Chiaia!

362
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,416
As a witness?

363
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,333
So... Why do you have
to stand as a witness?

364
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
To see who the winner
of the duel is and make sure

365
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,375
the competitors are playing
according to the rules.

366
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,458
What duel?

367
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,958
The challenger
is most likely trying

368
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,291
to get Empress Lashara's
attention by defeating Wahanly.

369
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,166
I'm sure those girls
are RONIN and looking for more.

370
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,250
RONIN means they don't serve
anyone yet, doesn't it?

371
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,166
It does... The church
supplies the Mechas to them,

372
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,250
but each country is only allowed
to have possession of so many.

373
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,208
So then... duels are like
a way for them to get a job?

374
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,375
Yeah, pretty much.

375
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,541
In Wahan's case, I bet they
figure she's a weak Sacred

376
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,500
Mechamaster since she mainly
deals with the mechanoids

377
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,500
as a mechanic.

378
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,791
This is so insulting!

379
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,291
They are questioning our
ability to assess others...

380
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,916
Since we hired Wahanly...
they are challenging us

381
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,875
by challenging her.

382
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,333
And that makes them
exceedingly stupid.

383
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh... I see what you mean.

384
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,958
Hey... What's that armor?

385
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,958
That's called moving armor.

386
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,625
I am a teacher in
the Holy Land, sister.

387
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,083
Whatever;
why're you here?

388
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,916
A lot of students
like to target newcomers

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,916
for duels this time of year...
We're on patrol.

390
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
This is how I dress in
the Holy Land... You like?

391
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,375
Yeah...
You look cool!

392
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,291
Thank you;
I'm glad you're a fan.

393
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,333
Me too... Uh, Miss Mexiah...

394
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,166
Should you be leaning
on me like that?

395
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,875
Kenshi, will you
do me a little favor

396
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,583
and call me
Big Sis, instead?...

397
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,333
Big Sis... Please?

398
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,250
'Kay, Big Sis...
Mexiah...

399
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,250
Look over there a sec...
Those things are what we use

400
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,958
for Sacred Mechanoid
training exercises...

401
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,250
That plate emits aho,

402
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,208
which allows them
to maneuver the armor.

403
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,250
And they can only move
when they're on that plate?

404
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,000
Exactly!

405
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,625
Hey, look! It's Miss Mexiah
and Mister Ulyte!

406
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
Isn't that boy
next to Miss Mexiah

407
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,083
Empress Lashara's attendant?

408
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,375
I like the idea of her
being with Mister Ulyte,

409
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,208
but that's super sweet, too!

410
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,000
It seems Kenshi and Mexiah
are quite a popular couple.

411
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,166
Miss Mexiah, the students
are watching you!

412
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,500
Or they're just waiting
for the duel to start.

413
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,250
Is everyone ready?

414
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,291
Begin!

415
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,125
You're so transparent!

416
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,291
Why is it crapping
out on me?!

417
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,458
Look, Kenshi... The spot
where she just got hit

418
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,666
that's changing colors?...

419
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,166
You see?... The moving
armor uses dummies,

420
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,916
but it still calculates
the damage you take

421
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,166
and will limit
your movements.

422
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,000
Hey, Big Sis Mexiah...
Do both of the girls get

423
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,708
to have the same
performance capabilities?

424
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, they're supposed to.

425
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,583
You mean they might not?

426
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,833
Most people can't tell the
settings are being controlled.

427
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,125
I'm very impressed.

428
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,916
Well, considering
their maneuverability,

429
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,208
Wahanly's movements
are awkward.

430
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,000
No... She's been
cornered already?

431
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,333
You're mine now!

432
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,833
This is bad!

433
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,791
There is a limit to aerial
maneuverability, as well...

434
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,416
Just like with Ena's Draft.

435
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,416
She's done.

436
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm sure
she's gonna be fine.

437
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,041
She's probably just
planning her next move.

438
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,333
You lose!

439
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,708
How can you still move?

440
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,291
Isn't that like way obvious?

441
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,166
You only damaged one arm!

442
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,083
So... You still don't
have a weapon, do you?...

443
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,083
What're you doing?

444
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,875
The winner is!...
Wahanly... Schme!

445
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,291
Your girl won.

446
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,333
That's only natural
considering who she works for.

447
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,458
Get me outta here!

448
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,333
It kinda looks
like a mini castle...

449
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,916
Does everyone at this school
live in places like this?

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,375
Not at all.

451
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,833
Actually, most students
live in dorms...

452
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,500
Royalty like the Empress
gets special treatment.

453
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,833
That's where the sacred
garb she'll wear

454
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:03,958
at the ceremony is kept...

455
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:07,291
'Tis not to be
touched casually.

456
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,875
Chiaia and Wahan have our
permission to use the study

457
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,958
for trying on and
storing their garb.

458
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes, very well, Empress...
Dame Chiaia,

459
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,916
if you would like
to follow me to the study,

460
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,291
we can get one last fitting
in before the ceremony.

461
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,375
Okay. I just have to take care
of something real quick.

462
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,125
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

463
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,083
This room is where
you'll be staying.

464
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,875
You're still recovering, so
you'll wanna sit around here

465
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,250
and rest until
lunch is ready.

466
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,625
No, look at this;
I'm all better. Trust me.

467
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,666
I honestly don't care; just stay
put and don't wander around.

468
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,625
Uh-huh.

469
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,750
I'll see ya later, Kenshi.

470
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,333
'Kay.

471
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah, this should
definitely taste good.

472
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,666
Look at the fish, too...

473
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,750
This forest has so many
things to eat in it...

474
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,500
I could live out here
if I wanted to.

475
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,958
Someone's here... Two?

476
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,791
He doesn't look like
your typical kid.

477
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,791
Violence is not the answer!

478
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,208
Stop!

479
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,833
Aura...

480
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,041
Thank you... For what you
did the other day, I mean.

481
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,708
I'm glad you're doing well.

482
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,333
Princess... do you know him?

483
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,291
Yes... He is an attendant
for Empress Lashara.

484
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,791
What is he doing here?...

485
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:01,041
Princess... This forest is
under Shurifon jurisdiction...

486
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,500
It is forbidden for any
to enter without permission...

487
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,083
let alone use it
as some hunting ground.

488
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,291
What?. It is? I didn't
know that. I'm so sorry.

489
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,708
As Empress Lashara's attendant,
it's your duty to know!

490
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,125
A moment... Kenshi is
originally from the Highlands

491
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,416
and only a recent addition
to the Empress's service.

492
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,458
I'm really sorry.

493
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,958
But I am curious
as to why you came here...

494
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,875
Please don't tell me they
aren't feeding you properly.

495
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,375
No, I'm fine!...

496
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,125
This is just kind
of like a custom of sorts...

497
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,125
I guess you could
call it a hobby.

498
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,000
A hobby... huh?...

499
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,958
You found a lot for your
first time in the forest.

500
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,791
I'm impressed.

501
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,208
I didn't take
too much, did I?

502
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,791
You're fine...
This is a big forest...

503
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,625
And you have my full permission
to use it from now on.

504
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,875
But Princess Aura...

505
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,083
I can tell by
the way he hunted,

506
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,458
this one would not
ravage our forest.

507
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,541
Thanks, I really
appreciate it.

508
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,958
No... It can't be!

509
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:58,958
Is this mushroom
what I think it is?

510
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,666
This is definitely it.

511
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,958
I can't believe my eyes;

512
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,583
I've never seen one
of these in person before!

513
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,000
This is amazing; I've only had
the chance to drink some soup

514
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,000
that had the tiniest
little sliver in it

515
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,958
when I was celebrating
entering the Fourth Forest!...

516
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:13,666
It's beautiful...

517
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,625
Stop crying immediately!!.

518
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,958
Look... Kenshi, I realize my
attendants might appear

519
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,458
to be overreacting, but...

520
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,625
This mushroom...

521
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,041
So I'm assuming
it must be rare.

522
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,541
Yes... We only serve
them at special events.

523
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,833
They're even limited
at royal court dinners.

524
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,791
Ah... Then you
all should have it.

525
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:34,166
Truly?... We can't...
It's worth a fortune...

526
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,125
You found it,
so you should have it.

527
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,375
Please, Princess Aura!
Please, please ,Princess!

528
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,625
Mushree!... Mushroom!

529
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:46,791
I'm terribly sorry...

530
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,291
But for us
that mushroom

531
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,250
is not the sort
of thing money can buy.

532
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,208
Thank you so much
for giving it to us.

533
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:55,458
Oh, it's okay... I mean, I sorta
owe ya; you did save my life.

534
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,583
I was simply glad
I could help.

535
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,916
Is it really that great?

536
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,166
I always thought a mushroom
was just a mushroom.

537
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,833
Well... This mushroom
is pretty special...

538
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,083
We've actually used
them in exchange

539
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:07,541
for a male Sacred
Mechamaster's sperm before.

540
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,083
Stud horses, right?

541
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,000
Stud horses?

542
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,125
Great!...
They fit perfectly!

543
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,916
You both will look amazing!

544
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,875
Thank you, Empress.

545
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,375
I've gotta head back
to the workshop,

546
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,750
so promise you won't
let anything happen

547
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,541
to my fancy garb, okay!

548
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,958
Why don't you take a break
and have lunch with us instead?

549
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,916
After the ceremony, I'd
kinda like to start out

550
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,250
my sacredness with
a clean workshop.

551
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,333
Oh, I don't mind helping
you out with that.

552
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,041
Fine. But you
should get Kenshi

553
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:39,166
to carry around
all the heavy stuff.

554
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,000
A studhorse? How funny.

555
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,500
I can actually hear
the Empress saying that.

556
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,208
But... Doesn't the whole idea
of getting married to someone

557
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,625
you've never even met
before bother you at all?

558
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,666
Right to the point, huh?

559
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

560
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,291
With... marriage in general...

561
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,416
I understand and agree
why it is necessary.

562
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,416
What, you do?

563
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,875
I do.

564
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,708
We all need food, clothing,
and shelter to survive...

565
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,333
To sustain those needs,

566
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,083
we must have institutions
that form communities.

567
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,000
Nations... And,
the Sacred Mechamasters

568
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,541
are the primary deterrent
powers and line of defense

569
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,208
used to uphold each nation.

570
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,625
Yeah, I get that...

571
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,583
But... Why does marriage
have to be such a big deal?

572
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,458
The Mechanoids are
indispensable weapons

573
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:24,125
that can wield unimaginable
power in the Ena Ocean...

574
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,125
But their numbers are
limited by the church...

575
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,416
If you aren't
allowed to make more,

576
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,000
you must improve
their quality.

577
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,500
How so?

578
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,916
One could learn various piloting
skills through training...

579
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,541
But endurance is something
you must be born with.

580
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,625
And, in all actuality...

581
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,041
Sacred Mechanoids
are cheap weapons.

582
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,125
Far more so than by using
a bevy of weapons

583
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,125
and people
to defend a country...

584
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,958
That's why we Sacred
Mechamasters are so important.

585
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,166
That... idiot!

586
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,000
Ulyte, is that you?!

587
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,666
Hey... Kenshi...

588
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,583
Oh no; what's wrong?!

589
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,625
How're you feeling?

590
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,250
Well...
I'm embarrassed to admit

591
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,083
I'm starting
to feel somewhat ill...

592
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,083
I'm a bit dizzy.

593
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,583
Dizzy?...

594
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:19,083
Drink this... I boiled up
a few healing herbs for you...

595
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,916
It's Washu's r-

596
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,916
It's a family recipe.

597
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,291
This looks rather
interesting.

598
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,916
It looks gross,
but it works.

599
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,333
I see...
Might as well try.

600
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,583
Go figure;
it's surprisingly good--

601
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,250
Ulyte, no!

602
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,541
I'm sorry...
I was trying to help,

603
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,958
but I think
I made you worse.

604
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:43,750
Does it look like
you're helping?

605
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,208
I know; I'm sorry.

606
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,666
Please, it's okay...

607
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,000
There's no reason to get
so upset with the boy.

608
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,250
I'm guessing the concoction he
made was a little strong

609
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,333
and put my body into shock...

610
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,083
I'm fine; there
was no harm done.

611
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,500
Just get out!.

612
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:59,541
We don't normally allow lowly
servants in here, so go.

613
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,250
Right. I'm sorry.

614
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,291
Incidentally, how are
things coming along?

615
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh... I'm in the process
of setting the sensors.

616
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,333
Then I take it we will
still be able to proceed

617
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:17,625
according
to the plan, Uncle?

618
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,916
Yes, nephew;
you have my word.

619
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,916
Well in that case, try not
to push yourself too hard.

620
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,916
Oh yeah? Are you
worried about me?

621
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,333
It would be rather inconvenient
to have you collapsing,

622
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,875
especially now.

623
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,833
Yes, I imagine so.

624
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,125
Hello... We've met before...
your name is Yukine, isn't it?

625
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,416
Yes.

626
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:08,750
You look sad.
Are you?

627
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,250
But... you did
it out of kindness...

628
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:15,125
That... was your
intent, wasn't it?

629
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,125
I wouldn't worry.

630
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,791
I'm sure she understands.

631
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,083
Yeah... You're right...

632
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,875
So are... those
for Princess Maria?

633
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,250
After all,
there's a decent chance

634
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,000
you might get to marry
her someday, Kenshi.

635
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,541
What's the matter?

636
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:38,208
It just... I know this
is gonna sound weird...

637
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:41,625
But Yukine, as a Sacred
Mechamaster, are you okay with--

638
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,541
You know...

639
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:46,375
Like, having a child with some
guy you've never met before?.

640
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,291
It seems so strange to me.

641
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,208
Uh, never mind!...

642
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,541
You don't really have
to answer that...

643
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:59,083
I'm sorry; it was
on my mind, that's all.

644
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,916
It's okay... If doing that
decreased the number

645
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,333
of wars we have...
I would be up for it.

646
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:05,541
Seriously?

647
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,875
The same goes
for the Holy Land...

648
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:11,125
We get to meet girls from
so many different countries...

649
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,791
If we all become friends
and start working

650
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,916
to stop wars...
eventually...

651
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,958
There wouldn't
be any more war.

652
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,875
This school even let
the two of us become friends.

653
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,500
There you are!

654
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,083
Crap, it's Chiaia!

655
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,583
Did I or did I not
tell you to stay put!

656
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,625
Tell me this jerk
didn't do anything rude.

657
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:39,708
That's good to know. Well...
We've gotta go, so see ya.

658
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,833
Kenshi...
Take care... Goodbye!

659
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:47,458
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry!

660
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,875
The second I take
my eyes off you,

661
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,250
you do exactly what
I told you not to!

662
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,250
What's your problem?!

663
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,416
I'm sorry!

664
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,208
Oh, hey!

665
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,750
Be careful! That's the last
batch, so don't drop it.

666
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,916
Thanks for the help, you guys!

667
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,750
I can't really ask
people to work with me

668
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,791
on this classified stuff...

669
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,708
Now... That goes there...
This over there. This here.

670
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,083
That over there, that in that
one, this one wherever,

671
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:13,250
this one's just for show,
and that goes here, too.

672
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,958
You two are the best!...

673
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,791
Now I can come back from the
ceremony with a brand new start!

674
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,625
Isn't this the one
that was broken?

675
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,083
Can you not, like, fix it?

676
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,583
It's way too badly damaged
for me to repair it

677
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,958
with the equipment
they have here.

678
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,125
We'll have to return
it to the Church,

679
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,208
so they can
take care of it.

680
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,625
What's that?

681
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,166
It's a funny story...

682
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,041
Hey, Wahan, what was
that robot I saw earlier?

683
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,500
Awesome, Kenshi!
You know about robots?...

684
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,041
You really were raised
in the highlands.

685
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,291
Nah, I think all boys
know about robots.

686
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,791
Well this particular robot's
called a Mechaworker.

687
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:55,041
It actually runs off
steam instead of aho.

688
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,125
I don't get why you
go to the trouble

689
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,875
of making dangerous
stuff like that

690
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,291
when you have an
Aho Barrier Reactor.

691
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,416
I like it.

692
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,125
Thank you. I'm normally
used to everyone

693
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,500
treating Barrier Workshop's
workers like weirdoes.

694
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,750
But that one is cooler.

695
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,041
I mean, it actually
looks like a robot.

696
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,333
Really?.
You think so?

697
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:16,791
Yeah. Plus, I don't like how the
aho energy makes me feel sick.

698
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,750
And just about anyone can ride
inside of your Mechaworker,

699
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,333
can't they?
Of course!

700
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,083
So how does that not make
Sacred Mechamasters pointless?

701
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,125
Say what?

702
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,291
Over here...

703
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,583
Oh, I get it!

704
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,500
Yeah, I know the Sacred
Mechamasters' ways

705
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:32,000
seem really strange to people
from the highlands...

706
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,958
I totally understand
where you're coming from...

707
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,750
But if you tried to make
a high- performance

708
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,416
Mechaworker
meant for battle,

709
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,041
you'd still need an Aho
Barrier Reactor to power it.

710
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,625
So, it's basically the
same thing in the long run.

711
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,416
We'd need a very capable
Mechamaster, regardless.

712
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,000
Makes sense, but why make a
Mechaworker to start out with?

713
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,958
I've been used to using them in
the highlands for basic labor...

714
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,000
They pretty much
do the same thing here.

715
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,375
I think you should
abandon that place

716
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,958
and just live
in Ena instead.

717
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,500
Yeah, not likely.

718
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,541
In the Highlands, they call
Ena, the "Treacherous Ocean";

719
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:00,833
it's forbidden
to even go there...

720
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,708
And that applies
to aho energy, too...

721
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:05,000
According
to our elder,

722
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,000
doing either one could
bring massive calamity.

723
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,083
Calamity?

724
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,375
That's just an old story.

725
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,958
True enough... But there
is still something

726
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,625
that bothers me about it.

727
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,625
According to the Barrier
Workshop's historians,

728
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,833
none of the countries
in Ena Ocean have a history

729
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,666
that predates
a specific period.

730
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,083
That's not all, though.

731
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,416
You know what's even crazier?

732
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,875
All of those countries
can be traced

733
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,125
directly back
to the Church.

734
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,375
So what?

735
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,208
So!. It's weird... right?.

736
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,958
For an institution to be that
wide spread at one point

737
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,416
in time is not natural...
It's like they...

738
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,375
What?

739
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,625
Mexiah?

740
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,500
You're all having
lunch without me!... Why?

741
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,125
You've broken my heart, and
now you're having fun talking

742
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,041
about something
behind my back.

743
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,791
We're not... It wasn't
like that... I swear.

744
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,250
Good, then I'll join!

745
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,916
See, I told you
she'd be here!

746
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,666
You should be eating
with us, ma'am.

747
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,541
Pretty please!...
I need advice!

748
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,125
No, I'm sorry...

749
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,000
I promised my friends
a while back we'd have lunch.

750
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,375
But they just got in today,

751
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,000
and we all made plans
with you weeks in advance...

752
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,791
You're supposed to be
having lunch with us!

753
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,416
Fine... Okay,
I'm coming.

754
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,875
I'll let you each have a turn
with me; is that better?

755
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,291
I guess I'll see
you later... Bye!

756
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,000
Talk about a typhoon!

757
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:19,625
Big Sis Mexiah sure is popular
with the ladies, isn't she?

758
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:23,041
In more ways than one.

759
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,250
You seem to be
feeling better today.

760
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,458
Don't tell me it's
that time already.

761
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,291
Yes... I'm doing very well...

762
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,000
That herbal
concoction of Kenshi's

763
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,708
must have been
effective after all.

764
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,791
And the investigation?
How's that going?

765
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,833
Just as we suspected, it seems
to be hiding behind a barrier...

766
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,666
But, when I was
setting the sensor,

767
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,916
it happened to pick up
another strange reaction.

768
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,250
So it was
like before, then?

769
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,583
Do you think
it's hostile?

770
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,750
I believe that
child could be--.

771
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,458
Someone's coming!

772
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,291
Oh, hello Kenshi!

773
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:02,458
Hello... I just wanted
to see how you were feeling.

774
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,875
You know, about that...
I'm actually feeling better

775
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,291
than I have
in a really long while.

776
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,541
Seriously?

777
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,625
It's true... Normally,
I like to take a nap

778
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,000
around this time of day,

779
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,083
but as you can see,
I don't need to!

780
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,208
Great, then I'll be sure
to make you some more...

781
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,458
But maybe this time
I'll dilute it a bit first!

782
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,333
Thanks...
It's appreciated...

783
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,791
Now, how are you adjusting
to life in the Holy Land...

784
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:23,916
If you need
any help or advice,

785
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,833
my door is always
open to you, okay?

786
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,291
So... it's regarding
Sacred Mechamasters.

787
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,625
Yeah.

788
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,750
Well, I can see how people
from the Highlands

789
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,500
or other areas might
find it dubious.

790
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,000
But still...

791
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,083
No matter how strange
the whole thing seems to you...

792
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,708
In our world it is
perfectly normal to do.

793
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:48,833
So it really is normal...
at least on this world.

794
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,375
Does it honestly
bother you that much?

795
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,000
Well...

796
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,541
Do me a favor and try to keep
that whole you being from

797
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,166
another world
thing under wraps.

798
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,208
No, uh...

799
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,208
Your reaction is hardly normal,
and I bet I can guess why.

800
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,750
Come on, you can
tell me, Kenshi.

801
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,208
Well I'm
from the highlands,

802
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,000
so I know nothing;
but don't mind me...

803
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,416
Could it be?

804
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,458
I knew it! You have a crush
on someone, don't you?

805
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,333
And she's a Sacred
Mechamaster, at that!

806
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:18,125
Oh yes, that does
make more sense...

807
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,666
Even if you do understand

808
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,083
that she would only be
fulfilling one of her duties...

809
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,291
as a man, it can be
very perplexing... Right?

810
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,583
I certainly understand how
you want to be the only guy

811
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,166
in this girl's world,

812
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,291
but you just need to be a man
and deal with it for her sake...

813
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,916
She has a much
greater calling,

814
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,541
and you need to
support her...

815
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,166
So?. Tell me
all the details.

816
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,625
Who has caught
your eye, Kenshi?

817
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:40,625
No, no one has caught
my eye, I promise!

818
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,625
Considering the Sacred
Mechamasters you've met,

819
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:45,208
it must be Dame
Chiaia... No, wait.

820
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,333
It could be Princess Aura,
or the Empress herself!

821
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,833
I gotta go! Bye!

822
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:52,500
Come back to me for more
advice if you need any!

823
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,625
You're such a bully.

824
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:54,958
I couldn't help myself.

825
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,708
We said no!

826
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:59,000
We do not want to go inside
this vulgar monstrosity!

827
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,458
It must be a joke!

828
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,833
My apologies, Empress, but
your aunt was so insistent,

829
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,875
I simply could not refuse her.

830
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,500
Right.

831
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,208
Big surprise she had something
to do with this gaudy thing.

832
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,166
Now we really
won't bathe in it.

833
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,416
Miss... Please, the big
ceremony is tomorrow!

834
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,416
Oh!... It is?!

835
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,375
Sorry, I know you have to get
ready for tomorrow, too.

836
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,583
Consider it payback for
helping me move stuff earlier.

837
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:26,125
Besides, I doubt I'd be able
to relax in that gaudy bath.

838
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,791
I know, right?

839
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,166
This the one?

840
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,000
It got damaged in that fight...
We did a temporary fix,

841
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:41,541
but the warm water isn't making
it to the large bath at all now.

842
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,291
The problem's
probably in here.

843
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,833
I had a feeling.

844
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,208
One of the control
rings is broken.

845
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,000
Anything I can do to help?

846
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,000
Nah, I'm good.
This'll just take me a second.

847
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,916
They fixed it!

848
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,291
Good job, Wahan!...

849
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,833
Hey, Empress Lashara
gave us permission

850
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:58,875
to use the large bath.

851
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,458
I'm going if you
wanna come with me.

852
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,916
No way!... I've always wanted
to take a bath there!

853
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,666
Let's go, then
Wait... Kenshi?!

854
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,875
Not again.

855
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,458
This is amazing!

856
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:14,375
Wow. Who knew I'd be able to
find some of these here?!

857
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,250
How many times do I have to
tell you not to wander around?!

858
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,875
So much better!.

859
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:30,250
This is what we are talking
about when we want a bath.

860
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,708
Kenshi?...

861
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,500
What are you
doing in there?!...

862
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,958
Kenshi! Hey!

863
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,458
You need to pull
yourself together!...

864
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,041
Mahya!

865
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,541
You're heavy!.
Get off of us now!

866
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,750
Empress Lashara,
are you all right?

867
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,791
What is the
meaning of this?

868
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,000
What in the world did you
think you were you doing?

869
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,416
Do not be angry...

870
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,666
They did not do it on purpose;
it was just an accident.

871
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,375
This is unacceptable!...

872
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,458
We cannot afford for someone
to have seen you with him

873
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,916
and started rumors
you were not pure!

874
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,083
Then that is all the more
reason not to shout about it.

875
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,875
Do you not agree?

876
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,875
Yes, I suppose you
do have a point.

877
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,500
Try to be more
careful from now on.

878
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,708
We will;
we're sorry!

879
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,916
Kenshi... The girls look
beautiful, do they not?

880
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,875
Are they wearing what
came in yesterday?

881
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,625
Yes... That is the
academy's most formal garb.

882
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,041
What?...
That's formal?

883
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,958
Now then, we should probably
head on over to the coliseum...

884
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,416
Please, follow us.

885
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,208
Amazing.

886
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:44,250
I commence the ceremony to
knight our Sacred Mechamasters.

887
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:55,583
Chiaia Flan of the Shtrayu
Empire, come forward.

888
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:57,291
Here!

889
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:11,583
Congratulations.

890
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:14,000
Thank you very much.

891
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:23,166
Is it me or does she look like
she got crowned with cat ears

892
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,166
at a beauty pageant...

893
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,458
What is with this world?

894
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,958
Maybe I should've thought
this through more.

895
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,875
How exciting, Kenshi!

896
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,083
As of today, you shall
work in the Holy Land!

897
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,083
Now quit dawdling
and get to business!

898
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:16,166
Next on
Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar:

899
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,625
"He Who Must Work."

900
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,416
Everything is going to be
so clean; we can't wait!
