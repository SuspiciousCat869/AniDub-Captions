1
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,541
Huh?

2
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,291
I got a bite!

3
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,666
Look at that!

4
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,708
It must be huge!

5
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,416
This is a pretty
impressive pile of food

6
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
I've got for myself here.

7
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, I just need
to preserve all of it...

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,625
According to the report...

9
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,333
Lord Babalun has been
appointed Prime Minister

10
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,541
of the Supreme Parliament,
as you predicted.

11
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,458
So, Babalun finally
has unquestioned power

12
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,708
over Shtrayu...

13
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,083
Meaning that little
assassination incident...

14
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:10,083
may actually not have
been his doing after all.

15
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,750
That would have
been quite foolhardy

16
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,125
before his new appointment.

17
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,458
This wouldn't be happening

18
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,083
if the belated king
were still alive...

19
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,291
Babalun is attempting
to seize Shtrayu

20
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,291
through his own
natural resources...

21
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,166
We wish to obtain our
country with our two hands

22
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,291
rather than merely inherit
it from our parents.

23
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,666
Are you not afraid you're
placing too much faith

24
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,083
in one boy, Empress?

25
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,208
Work in the dorms?

26
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,833
Correct...

27
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,541
You are still our attendant to
some extent, make no mistake...

28
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,333
However, we cannot pay you
out of our national budget.

29
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,250
Hey, no offense,
Empress Lashara...

30
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,250
But are you broke?

31
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,583
Not in the least!

32
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,250
If we paid you through
the national budget,

33
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,875
we would be forced to expose
your true identity!.

34
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,666
Is that what you want?!

35
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,041
Basically, if you wanna eat,
you're gonna have to work.

36
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,750
I think that's reasonable
though, don't you?

37
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,333
Yeah, but if this is just about
food, I don't need money...

38
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,458
I can find stuff
in the forest.

39
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,500
Well...

40
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,208
Yeah, I guess that's
true; you could.

41
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,833
Do not encourage
him, Chiaia!

42
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,208
Listen, Kenshi!

43
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,958
Do you think you're
some sort of wild animal

44
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,166
because we don't
recall owning any pets!

45
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,500
But I don't understand
why I need money here.

46
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,583
I don't get the point?

47
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,208
Then tell us
what you would do

48
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,083
if you finally found
a way back home...

49
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,000
But... it was only
available to you at a price?

50
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,375
I... don't know.

51
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,750
On top of that
bit of reason,

52
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,166
the dorms house
high-ranking students

53
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,583
from several countries...

54
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,833
Would it not be
in your best interest

55
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,125
to get to know
those students

56
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,458
because you might
want information

57
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,250
or have to ask one
of them for a favor?

58
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,833
Think about it, Kenshi.

59
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,708
Good point...
Well yeah, okay!

60
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,375
I'll do it!

61
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,083
Good-we have already spoken with
the academy on your behalf...

62
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,291
Now, you must
speak with them

63
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,750
in order to learn more
about your new job.

64
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,125
Pardon the intrusion, Empress,
but I'm afraid it's time.

65
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,166
Very well.

66
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,166
Bye!

67
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,250
Take care, Empress.

68
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,333
It is about time for you
to head out as well.

69
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,500
Sure!

70
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,083
Do you know where you'll
be going, my dear?

71
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,833
I'll be fine...!
See ya later!

72
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,208
Good morning.

73
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,958
Hey! Good morning!

74
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,375
This is just like home!

75
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,375
But with, like,
way more girls.

76
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,375
Hey, Kenshi!

77
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,166
Hi!

78
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,541
Oh...
Him again!

79
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,958
Isn't that Empress
Lashara's attendant?

80
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,750
Meow!

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,333
Oh, no!
He ran away again!

82
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,458
Doesn't he look
like a Koro!

83
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,750
He's so cute!

84
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,250
Try not to scare him off,
all right, ladies?

85
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,250
Miss Mexiah, you seem like
you're pretty close to him.

86
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,458
Is that true?
Are you?

87
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,000
Curious?

88
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,458
Well, too bad...!

89
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,708
I only answer questions
about school!

90
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,458
Toodles!

91
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,416
Wow... That was
kinda weird...

92
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,916
Having that many girls all
grouped together in one place

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,958
is a little intimidating.

94
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,375
It's open.

95
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,041
Excuse me.

96
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,291
Wait...

97
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,375
You're the principal.

98
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,375
I thought this was the
Dormitory Director's room.

99
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,333
In this academy, we all
have more than one job...

100
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,416
So, yes, this is also the
Dormitory Director's room.

101
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,083
Oh.

102
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,333
I think we're going to start you
off with a few different jobs

103
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,125
to see where
your talents lie.

104
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,125
Sound good?

105
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,125
Sure!

106
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,291
That's excellent...

107
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,416
Now, you won't be paid
on a fixed rate...

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,125
Instead you'll
receive points

109
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,166
based on how much
work you finish...

110
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,125
Regardless of the hours
you put in working,

111
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,958
you will actually
be compensated

112
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,666
for how many
points you earn.

113
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,416
So if I do a lot of tough jobs
in a short amount of time,

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,875
I'll be able to
earn more money?

115
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,666
Yes, precisely.

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,666
That's awesome!

117
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,416
The dorms are split
into four sections...

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,916
the independent dorms where
high nobles and royalty

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,666
like Empress Lashara live...

120
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,708
the boys' dorms, the
upperclass dorms,

121
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,583
and the underclass dorms.

122
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,583
But it's important
to note the independent,

123
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,000
as well as
the boys' dorms,

124
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,416
have their own equerries
and personal staff...

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,833
while the underclassmen
all take care of themselves,

126
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,083
for the most part.

127
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,708
So, it won't
come as a surprise

128
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,083
that you will primarily work in
the upperclassmen's dormitory.

129
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,791
The upperclassmen
don't have to work?

130
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,166
What's that all about?

131
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,875
Upperclassmen have been
officially knighted

132
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,208
as Sacred Mechamasters...

133
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,333
They've earned the right
to have their own attendants.

134
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,833
But... The Holy Land
is meant for training...

135
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,083
Aside from royalty
and high nobles,

136
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,833
students are not allowed
to bring their own attendants.

137
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,916
All the upperclassmen are
upperclassgirls, though,

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
isn't that right?.

139
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,750
Should I be working
in their dorms?

140
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,083
You're alright...

141
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,250
As long as you don't
pass the aptitude test,

142
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,166
we'll make sure to
keep you out of places

143
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,041
where you have to worry
about things like that.

144
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh good; I was kinda worried!

145
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,625
But if something
should happen,

146
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,000
you are required
to report it immediately.

147
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,833
A few girls might try
to drag you into their lair,

148
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,083
and they have a way of ignoring
your efforts to avoid it.

149
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,416
Oh.

150
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,583
Hannah!

151
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,416
I would like you
to meet Kenshi.

152
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,500
What am I supposed
to do with him?.

153
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,416
Seriously,
he's just a kid.

154
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,541
You're hardly in a position
to be picky, my friend.

155
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, you got me there.

156
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,458
Then I will leave
him in your hands.

157
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,375
Work hard, Kenshi.

158
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,916
Right!

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,333
Wow! This is
like a factory.

160
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,666
I didn't even know all
this stuff was down here.

161
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,916
The Holy Land is full
of privileged royalty

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,833
as well as Sacred
Mechamasters...

163
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,375
So anything unsightly is
hidden under the ground...

164
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,375
We're like feet
hidden by swans.

165
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,875
Okay...

166
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,541
But doesn't the energy
needed to move all this stuff

167
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,333
around give
people aho sickness?

168
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,250
The power is generated
deep underground

169
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,416
and carried
through cables,

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,083
so there's really
nothing to worry about.

171
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,458
Try to learn fast
and on your feet...

172
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,708
We may be understaffed,
but that won't stop me

173
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,083
from firing you Okay...

174
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,250
But why are you
understaffed to begin with?

175
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,375
Doesn't the academy
cater to the super rich?.

176
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,291
Do you just not have enough
money to pay a full staff?

177
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,333
I suppose that's one
way to interpret it!

178
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,916
The problem comes
from the graduates

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,208
taking their favorite
staff members with them.

180
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,666
Oh, really?

181
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,708
Yeah, we're used to it
happening every year...

182
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,958
but this past one was
ridiculously bad...

183
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,291
Honestly,
it's infuriating.

184
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,375
We spend time and money
perfecting our staff only

185
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,458
to have them leave us.

186
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,916
They're bribed
away of course.

187
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,291
Is this part not
underground, too?

188
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,416
It is. This is
our supply dock...

189
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,583
It also serves as a parking lot
for students' personal ships.

190
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,958
Why's it so bright, though?

191
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,750
It's almost like we're
standing outside.

192
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,000
Meh, a lot of ships have
their own gardens...

193
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,375
Some even have a couple of
house attendants on them.

194
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,750
Even though
it's underground,

195
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,166
we have the lights on the
same cycle as the outside.

196
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,791
Jozzy!

197
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,500
I told you about Kenshi
here yesterday...

198
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,000
I'd really appreciate it
if you'd show him the ropes.

199
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,791
Seriously?

200
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,666
I already said exactly
what you're thinking.

201
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,000
But you'd hire a Koro,
so give him a shot.

202
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,666
Yeah, whatever.

203
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,083
This is important.

204
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,791
You're gonna wanna make sure
to give it a clean corner

205
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,083
like this, okay?

206
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,083
You got that?

207
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,416
Yes, ma'am!

208
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
Why don't you try doing
the bed in the next room?

209
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,041
Nice... Yeah, you're
pretty good at that...

210
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,166
Well, moving on...

211
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Dirty laundry.

212
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,166
You pick it up in this...

213
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,541
Leave the door to the hallway
open so the room can air out,

214
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,291
and that's it.

215
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,541
The beds are all the same,
but the extra bedspreads

216
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,291
and blankets
belong to them,

217
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,500
so you wanna make sure
to put them in the right bag.

218
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,083
And no matter what, you're
only allowed in the bedroom...

219
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,375
Seriously...

220
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,083
And no touching anything
or breaking anything...

221
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,083
Ya got it?

222
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,375
Got it!

223
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,125
Okay, then I'll just
leave this floor to you...

224
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,250
I'll come back
and help you

225
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,916
as soon as I finish
doing my floor...

226
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,500
Boy.

227
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,375
Hey, Jozzy!

228
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,250
What're you doing here...?
Did you screw up already?

229
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,625
No. I'm all done,
so I came to help you.

230
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,083
No way you're done...

231
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,041
No way... I'm not
even halfway through yet.

232
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,583
You better not have
done a crappy job!

233
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,750
Um... I can redo them
for you if I did them wrong.

234
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,958
No, you did good.

235
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,416
Finally...

236
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,333
I got a good one!

237
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,708
Everyone's
in total awe!

238
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,500
Hey, now! Why did you
all stop working?!

239
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,958
You better get on top of it so
this newbie doesn't show you up!

240
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,916
Anyway, I'm a
hundred percent sure

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,291
they're supposed
to be identical.

242
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,791
I guess we'll just
have to be careful

243
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,666
and match up
all the pieces.

244
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,416
Hey, Chiaia!

245
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,125
Rumor has it Kenshi started
working at the dorms.

246
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,708
Wow, that traveled fast.

247
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,250
Yeah, a friend of mine on the
staff told me all about it...

248
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,833
He also said Kenshi's
pretty popular.

249
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,125
And... people have been
saying that Kenshi is

250
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,291
Miss Mexiah's newest
little plaything...

251
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,791
Is that true?.
Do you know?

252
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,041
Good grief...

253
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,750
No, of course
it's not true...

254
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,708
I can't believe you're
even asking me that.

255
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,541
Well, besides her...

256
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,458
He's also 'popular' Empress
Lashara's newest attendant...

257
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,583
And he has a habit of running
around the Holy Land

258
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,166
looking super cute,
like a sexy little Koro.

259
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,583
So he's kind
of asking for it.

260
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,875
Hey, Princess Aura!
Where are you off to?

261
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,958
I think classes have
already started...

262
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,666
You aren't feeling
sick today, are you?

263
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,916
I'm alright...

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,375
I just always head out
this time of day...

265
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,375
I suppose you could think
of it as a kind of custom...

266
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,750
I do apologize
if I worried you.

267
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,958
But tell me Kenshi, what is it
that brings you out here today?

268
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,250
Oh, I just started
working for the Holy Land.

269
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,791
You're working...?

270
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,333
I thought you were acting as
the Empress's attendant, though.

271
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,250
She wanted me to take
advantage of being here

272
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,375
in the Holy Land and try
to meet some new people.

273
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,833
I see...

274
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,375
Then you have
impeccable timing;

275
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,666
I was just about to fetch
a member of the staff

276
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,791
to assist me
with something.

277
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,958
Did the wind blow
it over the edge?

278
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,125
Bullies did.

279
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,291
Bullies, huh?

280
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,541
Students from many
countries gather here.

281
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,958
Some are Sacred
Mechamaster candidates,

282
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,500
and some aren't...

283
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,041
The reasons vary, from
differences in rank to customs.

284
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,000
It's out of the Draft right now,
so we can't use an aircraft.

285
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,291
Honestly, I'm shocked
they threw it down there.

286
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,625
Please don't
worry about it...

287
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,750
It's gone now...

288
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,375
Thank you, though,
Princess Aura.

289
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,166
But that handkerchief
is precious.

290
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,958
Didn't you tell me that
your mother gave it to you?

291
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,208
We'll get it back...

292
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,500
We just need to find
a little rope first...

293
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,166
Kenshi... You can be
in charge of the rope.

294
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,000
Kenshi!

295
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,833
Done!

296
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,000
Here!

297
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,166
For you!

298
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,083
Oh no, it got a
little dirty...

299
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,583
One second!
I'll wash it for you!

300
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,041
No, that's okay!

301
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,125
I think I can
manage it myself.

302
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,125
Kenshi...

303
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,875
That was very dangerous.

304
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,500
Not really. The vine
was pretty strong,

305
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,333
and there were enough
spots for me to hold on to,

306
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,291
so I was perfectly
safe. Trust me.

307
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,625
You were not
at all safe!

308
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,875
Either way...

309
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,000
I really appreciate it...

310
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,541
Thank you, Kenshi.

311
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
You too, Princess.

312
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,125
I'm very glad you got your
handkerchief back, Lapis.

313
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
Are you ready?.

314
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,833
We should head
back to class now.

315
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,166
Yeah, I've gotta run, too!

316
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,916
Oh, that boy...

317
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,250
He's always
in such a rush!

318
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,000
Man, Kenshi sure
did surprise me!

319
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,000
And this is just
his first day!.

320
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,666
We'll have to see
if any bad habits show.

321
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,916
No way...

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,958
That kid has got this
line of work down.

323
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,583
In fact... he's got a weird
gift for it or something.

324
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,166
With a little training, he
could become one of our best.

325
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,750
Well, I sincerely
doubt he's good enough

326
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,791
to replace all the people
we lost this past year...

327
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,000
Although that isn't to say
we won't take him, of course.

328
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,041
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me...!

329
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
Your piddling little staff
hardly requires that much skill,

330
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,041
and you know it!

331
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,208
You take the next new one.

332
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,916
You always get
preferential treatment

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,291
when it comes
to new workers--

334
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,083
Now, now... Whether
we like it or not,

335
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,541
we're going to have to work
together to make ends meet

336
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,500
until we get some
new staff in here.

337
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,166
In the meantime Mister Masaki
will help all departments.

338
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,958
Remember, the poor child
only has one body...

339
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,541
You must coordinate
with each other

340
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,541
to make sure you
don't overwork him.

341
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,750
Hey, kid!
Be careful!

342
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,666
Okay!

343
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,125
I think he'll be fine.

344
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,458
The underclassmen servers
should be here soon...

345
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,208
Get a move on!

346
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,333
We have a lot of
delivery orders today,

347
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,791
but that doesn't mean
you can get sloppy...!

348
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,875
Treat each order
with love and care!

349
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,958
Uh, excuse me...

350
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,791
Am I doing this
right... sir?

351
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,500
Oh!

352
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,833
Your presentation has a very
unique style, Mister Masaki...!

353
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,750
Who did you
study under, son?

354
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,541
I've just always
helped my sister.

355
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,541
What is that?

356
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,166
Those are sliced
bamboo leaves.

357
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,500
I've heard only royal chefs
use this kind of technique...

358
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,250
Yes, it's very impressive...

359
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,416
Now, I need
you to go ahead

360
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
and deliver two servings
of this yourself.

361
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,375
But I'm not done
in the kitchen.

362
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,708
Well apparently you were
asked for specifically.

363
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,208
I was?

364
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,666
Hello!

365
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm here with a delivery
from the kitchen!

366
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,625
Excuse me, ladies.

367
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,791
Your lunch has arrived.

368
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
Come in.

369
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,958
Sorry to intrude.

370
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,208
Oh...
Princess Aura...

371
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,083
Hi. Thank you for bringing
our food to us, Kenshi.

372
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,250
So...

373
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,666
This is the boy you
were talking about.

374
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
Here, let me
introduce you...

375
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,125
This is the current
Pope's granddaughter,

376
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,625
the honorable Lady
Lithia Po Cheena.

377
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,916
I'm Kenshi Masaki.

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,875
So nice to meet you, Kenshi.

379
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,166
To be honest, you look
absolutely nothing like

380
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,958
what I expected you to...

381
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,083
Instead...

382
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,666
You're more
like a wild dog.

383
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, I get that a lot.

384
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sure!

385
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,708
Lithia, remember
your manners...!

386
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,666
Kenshi is not a wild dog...

387
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,416
If that boy is anything,
he is a proud wolf.

388
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,166
Still doesn't change the
fact that he's a wild animal.

389
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,083
Shame on you.

390
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,208
I am sorry.

391
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,375
I know she can be
somewhat harsh at times.

392
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,083
She is straightforward,
that's for sure.

393
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,541
I suppose.

394
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,250
Now if you ladies
will excuse me.

395
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,041
It was nice meeting
you, Kenshi.

396
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,458
I guess
I'll see you later.

397
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,500
He provided a service
to us, Lithia...

398
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,916
The least you could have done
was to thank him, you know.

399
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,541
Oh please; I was merely
stating an opinion.

400
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,166
Found him!

401
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,250
You're Empress Lashara's
attendant, aren't you?

402
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,583
Yeah, um...

403
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,708
Then I would love to talk
to you about something.

404
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,875
Yeah, but I've got a
question for you first!

405
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,500
Tell me about
Empress Lashara!

406
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,958
Hey...

407
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,458
Why don't we go to a more
private place to talk?

408
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,416
No. Don't try
hogging him, Bwoole!

409
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,125
Yeah, that's cheating...!
He should be able to talk

410
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,041
to whoever he wants
to, which is me!

411
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,958
Cool! So Kenshi
is doing well?

412
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,583
That is good to know.

413
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,458
Yeah, and the male workers
won't stop raving about him.

414
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,750
I hear those stupid rumors
about him and my sister

415
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,250
all over the place.

416
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,916
Well, at least everyone's
getting a little excitement.

417
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,791
Get out of my way!

418
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,750
What...
the heck was that?

419
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,875
I knew this would happen!

420
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,166
Nice... He's grown
rather popular...

421
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,291
That's wonderful!

422
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,291
Hey, Kenshi!
Wait!

423
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,750
Wait up!

424
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,958
That's Empress
Lashara's attendant!

425
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,583
We should go
after him, too!

426
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,625
Over here! Swing
around to the right!

427
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,000
He's so fast!
Don't let him get away!

428
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,125
He went over there!
Let's surround him, everyone!

429
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,625
We've got to catch that boy!

430
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm going left!
I'm going right!

431
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,958
Honestly, could they
make more noise?

432
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,666
What in the world is going on?

433
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,583
A ton of upperclassmen have
decided to chase Kenshi around

434
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,166
for some reason.

435
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,458
Well, then, they certainly
have bizarre taste.

436
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,375
And supposedly, they want
to use him to get close

437
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,250
to Miss Mexiah
or the Empress.

438
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,291
That's hilarious...
I guess we should go.

439
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,541
I might feel bad about
myself if he ended up

440
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,708
becoming some idiot's plaything,
and I could've helped...

441
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,708
Yes... But miss...

442
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,791
Why me?!

443
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh!. I knew
he was a wild beast!

444
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,250
Um... Lady Lithia...?

445
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,583
No one can get
anywhere close to him.

446
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:52,250
The girls are
dropping like flies.

447
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,541
Did they just chase
him into the forest?!

448
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,750
They did.

449
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,583
I'll let Shurifon's
guards know immediately.

450
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,291
Yes, please do.

451
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,333
Lithia, what
is going on here?

452
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,416
They chased the wild
beast into the forest,

453
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,125
accidentally
over- exerted themselves,

454
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,000
and needed some help...

455
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,708
Since you were busy
with an extended lecture,

456
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,375
I couldn't interrupt you.

457
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,041
So I'm afraid I had to ask your
subordinates for assistance.

458
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,000
Very well.

459
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,208
Wait... Where
is Kenshi, now?

460
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,833
Is he still somewhere
in the forest?

461
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,375
Oh... Maybe?

462
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,375
All right...

463
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,041
I shall join
the search team.

464
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,375
Kenshi?!

465
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,958
Oh, hi, Princess!

466
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,583
Lady Lithia...

467
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,500
Those two were the last
of the ones out there.

468
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,041
Okay, thank you.

469
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,583
You're very welcome.

470
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,000
Now, if you ladies will
excuse me, I have more work...

471
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,041
And Princess Aura...

472
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,416
I'll see you tomorrow.

473
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,625
You did a great job.

474
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,416
Hold on... he was
on the search team as well?

475
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,708
Oh yeah.

476
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,208
I'm back!

477
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,791
Don't track all
that dirt in here!

478
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,458
Pay attention, Kenshi!

479
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,958
I'm sorry!

480
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,333
Very impressive!

481
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,750
He works even harder
than we expected.

482
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,083
To what...

483
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,666
do we owe the pleasure
of your company?

484
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,708
Come now, I'm your
sister, not a teacher.

485
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,833
Now say, 'ah'!

486
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,291
Kenshi...

487
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,958
How has work been treating
you this past month...?

488
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,000
All is well?

489
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,875
All's great!
Everyone is really nice.

490
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,250
I've heard...

491
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,041
You're pretty popular
with the other workers.

492
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,208
They say you're
one of the best!

493
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,416
Perfect...
That is wonderful news.

494
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Ow! Ow, that hurts!

495
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,250
Ears are for
hearing not pulling!

496
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,250
And that other thing?.
How is it proceeding?

497
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,083
I've already
obtained approval...

498
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,875
The main issue was
Kenshi's work ethic,

499
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,833
but no one's worried
about that now.

500
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,708
We see.

501
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,291
So I take it you approve?

502
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,458
Considering how these new
recruits are working out,

503
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,625
how could I not?

504
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,041
It's settled...

505
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,708
They're all going to be
tickled pink... I'm sure.

506
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,625
Now I need to know: This will in
no way interfere with your work,

507
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,708
will it Hannah?

508
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,250
Not at all.

509
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,041
Thanks to him, we were able
to handle a lot of repairs

510
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,791
and odd jobs
we needed to do...

511
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,291
We should be
fine sharing him

512
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,291
on shifts until
more workers come in.

513
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,625
In that case, I'll let
you be the one to draft

514
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,916
a detailed shift plan...

515
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,416
Have Kenshi Masaki come
to my office, please.

516
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,416
Tell me, you must've been
raised in a family

517
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,750
of very hard workers,
Mister Masaki...

518
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,333
Not only did they teach you
the importance of cleaning,

519
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:19,083
but they also gave you
rather specialized skills...

520
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,333
like construction.

521
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,416
Well, my father did
work in construction,

522
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,666
and my sisters were really
good at demolishing.

523
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,125
Is that so?

524
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,041
One of my sisters
is amazing at cleaning,

525
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,916
so I watched
her work a lot.

526
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,833
And... I have another sister

527
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,458
who might just be the worst
cleaner in history...

528
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,625
So I guess
getting to see

529
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,625
both of those extremes
helped me learn.

530
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,333
I imagine so...

531
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,875
At this time, I would like to
assign you some different work,

532
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,291
if you think
you're up to it.

533
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,000
Sure!

534
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,833
Big Sis Mexiah?

535
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,625
Who said you could
call me that...?

536
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,000
Kenshi Masaki...

537
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm Miss Mexiah,
baby boy.

538
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,666
Baby boy?

539
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,750
I've heard some cultures from
other worlds have their teachers

540
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:12,083
dress in costumes and refer
to their students as babies.

541
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,666
Where did she
hear that from?

542
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,250
Do you object to it?

543
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,166
No, no objection
from me at all.

544
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,666
So, what kinda job is it?

545
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,875
A significant number
of upperclassmen

546
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,375
have submitted
requests for you

547
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,583
to become their personal
estheticians, baby boy.

548
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,250
Esthe-what?

549
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,916
Someone who helps them wash
up before getting into a bath.

550
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,125
To put it simply,
baby boy will be washing

551
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,583
the Sacred Mechamasters'
hair and bodies.

552
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,125
Oh no, I forgot
I have to go...

553
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,625
This is a very
exclusive job, baby boy.

554
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,208
Yeah, I bet it is...

555
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,208
He accepts!

556
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,625
What?
I accept?

557
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,958
Kenshi... It is quite
the honor for them to ask you.

558
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,166
You cannot refuse them;
that would be rude.

559
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,875
It's too embarrassing...
I, couldn't...

560
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,166
You accept!

561
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,416
You should.
It's very sacred work.

562
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,541
But I've never done
anything like that before.

563
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,958
Well, we all have to start
out somewhere, don't we...?

564
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,583
And besides, Kenshi...

565
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,958
For them to have requested
you specifically means

566
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,666
that the Sacred Mechamasters
are starting to take more

567
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,708
of an interest in you.

568
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,333
And try not to forget...

569
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,500
Connections like these
could increase your chances

570
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,541
of going home, so maybe take
advantage of this opportunity.

571
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,833
I understand your
point, but...

572
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,458
There's no
need to worry...

573
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,208
I can give you
thorough instructions

574
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,958
since this is your
first time, baby boy.

575
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,958
Wait!
Big Sis Mexiah, please!

576
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,708
It's Miss Mexiah,
remember?

577
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,416
Are you implying I'm not good
enough for you, baby boy?

578
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,458
No, I am not.

579
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,583
I see...

580
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,750
In that case,
I think it's imperative

581
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,458
I teach you every single thing
there is to know about me.

582
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,833
That way you can make a much
better informed decision.

583
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:41,833
But I never said you weren't
good enough, I swear!

584
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,250
I didn't even think it!

585
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,500
Get ready!

586
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:50,250
I'm taking you to a land
of ecstasy, baby boy!

587
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,291
Does she seem far more excited
about this than she should be?

588
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,041
Apparently, he's popular
with all the older girls...

589
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,416
And, yes.

590
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,708
The Holy Land is significantly
lacking in men...

591
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,500
Especially fun ones.

592
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,000
Plus, there are
a whole lotta people

593
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,875
who would like something
to connect them to you.

594
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,375
Well, we don't care
about the reason;

595
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,333
we're just happy they're
all so interested in him!

596
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,250
Let's get started,
baby boy!...

597
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,833
We feel as though
we should stop them.

598
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,416
No, he's just being a baby.

599
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
She's only teaching him
how to bathe someone.

600
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,041
Wake up, Kenshi!

601
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,750
Get a grip,
you loser! Come on!

602
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,375
Oh Mexiah...

603
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,916
Could you tell me why Kenshi
looks like he's about to die?

604
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,833
On the other hand, you
yourself seem very lustrous.

605
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,166
I know, right...?
It felt so amazing, too!

606
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,416
What in the world
did you do to him?

607
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,083
He was just such
a quick learner,

608
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,166
I couldn't help
but get carried away...

609
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,500
So, good!

610
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,541
Please tell us you did
not teach him anything

611
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,833
that could prove to be
problematic later...

612
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,916
Kenshi is still
underage, you know.

613
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,708
Oh, no. There's no need
to worry, Empress...

614
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,833
I made sure to teach
him just when to stop.

615
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,750
He'll be perfect, I swear.

616
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,750
Meaning?

617
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,458
I told him...

618
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,000
"Now, Kenshi, don't ever take it
this far when you are working."

619
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,666
You didn't?!

620
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,708
Something tells us we should
probably stop asking questions.

621
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,041
For shame!

622
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,041
At this point, Mexiah,
is it safe for us to say

623
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,125
that Kenshi's bathing
lesson is over?

624
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,375
It is!

625
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,583
Although, I could only
teach him the basics.

626
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,666
Oh great.

627
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,875
What does that mean?

628
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:21,041
He's still lacking
actual experience.

629
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:24,166
We need more guinea pigs,
or rather, more subjects

630
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,583
for him to practice
what he's learned on.

631
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,083
Kenshi Masaki,
clean Chiaia!

632
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:39,875
Don't you dare!

633
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,541
Why do your eyes
look like that?

634
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,791
No! Bad Kenshi!

635
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,500
Nothing you say
can stop him now...

636
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,166
He's trained to immediately
obey any order I give him.

637
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,125
He's essentially
a massaging machine,

638
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,833
and you're
his next victim.

639
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,958
We see...
You input your orders

640
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,333
while his mind was
trying to escape reality,

641
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:58,166
so he's basically in what they
call "berserker mode," right?

642
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,500
Exactly.

643
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:02,208
He won't listen to anything
but what I tell him.

644
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,375
Why would you do
something so idiotic?

645
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:07,625
Kenshi, you need to focus
and pull yourself together!

646
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:08,875
Oh, no!

647
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,791
Hey!
Put me down!.

648
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,958
Kenshi!.
Let me go!

649
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:19,791
That's far enough.

650
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:26,166
Stop it, Kenshi...! Hey!

651
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,125
I am never going to
forgive either of you!

652
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,875
I hate you both so much!.

653
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,916
You're the worst!

654
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,083
He is a massage machine...

655
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,166
We could make a
fortune with his touch.

656
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,541
Then I think we should
probably spread the word

657
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,500
by letting him practice on some
of the other girls we know.

658
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,041
Borrow Yukine?

659
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,250
It's important, baby girl.

660
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,250
What do you need me for?

661
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,791
It's important, baby girl.

662
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,333
It's important, baby girl.

663
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,291
You are forbidden
to use Kenshi Masaki...!

664
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,375
Miss Lashara!

665
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,333
Why?! Everyone
enjoyed him so much

666
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,083
they couldn't
even move afterwards!

667
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,958
That's exactly the
problem, my dear.

668
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:30,083
Are you sure you
should be up, Yukine?

669
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,666
Does that look erotic,
or is it just me?

670
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,750
It's not just you.

671
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:55,916
Princess!

672
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,083
Are you all right
in there?

673
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,333
Princess!
Princess!

674
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:06,250
Would you please
stop that banging?!

675
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,625
I cannot believe
what he did to me!

676
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,041
I told them
he was wild!

677
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,041
Stupid jerks!

678
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,541
I'll teach them!

679
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,333
I'm gonna test my
new weapon on him.

680
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:47,375
People have issued complaints
and are reporting after effects.

681
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,791
Some are even making
strange requests

682
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,375
to undergo the experience before
their marriage ceremonies.

683
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:57,000
This is unacceptable,
especially for an Empress!

684
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,125
So he got a little
carried away.

685
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,541
Who cares...?

686
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,000
This guarantees there
will be a flock of applicants

687
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,958
when we make
the big announcement!

688
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,250
Very nice...

689
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,958
You all did well.

690
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,208
Now, fill it with warm water

691
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:24,875
and welcome the Sacred
Mechamasters inside.

692
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,583
Um. I thought I was done
after the tubs were full.

693
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:32,333
Unfortunately, two of our best
estheticians hurt their backs

694
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,125
after carrying your massage
victims to their rooms...

695
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,500
I imagine you would rather
call them your test subjects,

696
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,083
but still... We're a bit
short on staff now.

697
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,000
And besides,
the Sacred Mechamasters

698
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,541
have started fanatically
requesting your services...

699
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,125
I'd prefer
not to do this...

700
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:50,916
but I received permission for
you to wash only their backs.

701
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,208
They're on their way.

702
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:02,791
Now let's get going;
it's time to greet them.

703
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,166
Hey, it's Kenshi!

704
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,583
Wait, Kenshi's here?

705
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,541
Really?

706
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,500
Does this mean you're
going to wash our backs,

707
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,500
because that
would be so awesome!

708
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,250
I guess so.

709
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,333
Yay!

710
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,375
Oh no; I'm sorry...
I didn't hurt you, did I?

711
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,625
No...

712
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:42,000
You feel like a Koro walking
up and down my naked back.

713
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,708
Hey, uh, Kenshi...?

714
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,875
Could you wash
me here, too?

715
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,166
I'm sorry, no...

716
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,041
I mean, you can
reach those yourself.

717
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,541
I know, but that's
not the point.

718
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,958
I want you to do it.

719
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,791
There are other people
waiting, so why don't you try

720
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,041
using a little self-control
for once, Yeliss!

721
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,166
That's right!.
Kenshi, I'm next!

722
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,250
I'm after that!

723
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,500
But I was
in line after her!

724
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,458
I clearly had a foot
in front of you!

725
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,208
I'm not done
with him yet!

726
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,666
So, Cliff Cleese...

727
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,875
What do you think?

728
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,125
Do you think I'm
being too ideological?

729
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,541
I don't...

730
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,375
Reality will never change
if one does not have ideals.

731
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,208
I offer you
my full support...

732
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,958
Dagmyer Mesut.

733
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,625
Thank you, my friend.

734
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,958
I'm so tired.

735
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,291
Hey!. Kenshi!

736
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,875
Oh, hi, Mister Ulyte...

737
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,750
Heard you've been busy...

738
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,000
That must be fun for you...

739
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,208
Touching all
those cute girls.

740
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:57,541
It's a tough job...

741
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,416
But, you know what
they say, don't you?

742
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,750
About how some unlucky soul
has to be the one to do it?

743
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,208
There's just so many of 'em.

744
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't really have
time to enjoy myself.

745
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sure you
will eventually.

746
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,333
Well I'm not...

747
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:12,708
I don't think I can keep
up with all those girls.

748
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,916
We are in Holy Land, so those
sentiments are understandable.

749
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,625
Don't you think it's
a little weird, though?

750
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,375
It probably feels
that way to you,

751
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,166
but remember you're
from the highlands...

752
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,458
You do have
to keep in mind,

753
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,250
it's something we're
accustomed to around here.

754
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,208
Yeah...
I guess you're right.

755
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,791
In fact,
there is one theory

756
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,333
that someone
from another world

757
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,458
came here and deliberately
spread a few of our customs

758
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:36,250
across the land...

759
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,000
Those from other
worlds always make

760
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,125
for superb
Sacred Mechamasters.

761
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,750
There's never
been an exception.

762
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,333
So, naturally they obtain high
ranks and become influential...

763
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,000
It wouldn't surprise me
if some of their interests

764
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,416
got forced onto us.

765
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,666
I see...

766
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,291
So they, like, did
whatever they wanted?

767
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,041
Yes!. They, like,
did whatever they wanted!

768
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,041
Oh...! When I was washing the
Sacred Mechamasters' backs...

769
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,958
I noticed this, uh,
sort of emblem-like thing

770
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,208
near their waists.

771
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,708
Right...

772
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,958
That's a contraceptive shield;
all the girls have them...

773
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,375
They have a duty to fulfill,
so precautions are taken.

774
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,041
Oh, I get it.

775
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,166
Which means...

776
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,166
If a girl you like
makes a move on you,

777
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,000
feel free to go
for it, kid.

778
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:18,416
Is it just me or do those
two look perfect together?

779
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,041
Yeah, absolutely amazing!

780
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,041
Kenshi!

781
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,333
Kenshi!
Oh my-- wow!

782
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:29,666
What's wrong,
Miss Sister...

783
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,166
B-Big...
Miss Mexiah Sister?

784
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,416
No questions!

785
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,875
Just drop everything
and run away with me!

786
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,833
Did she just say what
I thought she said?

787
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,166
She really did!
Yes, she did!

788
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,625
They're really
gonna do it...!

789
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:42,958
They're gonna elope!

790
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,125
Please know I'd be happy
to suffer through anything

791
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:48,500
as long as I could
still be with you!

792
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:51,541
Would I be right in assuming
that this has to do with that?

793
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,208
I found 'im!

794
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,000
You're not getting
away this time!

795
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,541
I swear upon my pride you
will pay for humiliating me!

796
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,041
You and that wild beast will
pay for what you've done!

797
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,750
You'll both
stand as witnesses

798
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:13,166
while Lashara coughs up a
fortune in compensation to us!

799
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,208
No...
Please don't!

800
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,708
Why?. You should
be compensated.

801
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,666
No, I don't like it
when... it's rough.

802
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,666
Yes, I understand,
perfectly...

803
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,000
Kenshi Masaki!

804
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,833
Take responsibility for
getting rough with Yukine

805
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,125
and defiling her!

806
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,333
No... blood...

807
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,666
spilt... please!

808
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,750
There was blood...?!
Oh, say it isn't so, Yukine!

809
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,625
Oh, what a monster!

810
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,666
Kenshi, it would seem
I made a grave mistake

811
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,250
that day I saved you...

812
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,125
I shall correct
that error.

813
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,708
No, blood, please!

814
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,333
We understand,
Yukine.

815
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,541
You're not alone...
I'm right here.

816
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,541
Please stop!

817
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,833
Well I, for one,
don't really care!

818
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,833
You're freakin' heavy,
so why don't you get off me

819
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,416
so I can annihilate
these perverts

820
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,791
with my fancy
new weapon?!

821
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,666
Where are they?

822
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,625
Wahan...
Over there!

823
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,291
I'm willing to die
as long as I'm with you!

824
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,041
I don't think this is the
time to be joking like that!

825
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,250
I'm sure you
must be relieved

826
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,458
that Master Cliff
agreed with you, sir...

827
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,791
Now you are another step
closer to your goal.

828
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,041
Master Cliff is a smart man...

829
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,250
I was very confident he would
understand my point of view.?

830
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,041
What is that?!

831
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,583
You won't get
away from me!

832
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,166
What are you doing?

833
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,708
Well, that
was uncalled for!

834
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,333
I do apologize, sir...

835
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,375
Were you injured?

836
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,708
No, not at all...

837
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,166
I'm alright...!

838
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,750
More importantly, isn't
that the "Mechaworker" Wahanly

839
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,333
has been working on recently?

840
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,833
Supposedly it doesn't
use an aho reactor.

841
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:51,000
Impressive
maneuverability.

842
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,000
Really!

843
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,500
Who do they think
is going to fix

844
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,125
all the damage
they're causing!

845
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,583
Aren't you worried the academy
will make you be the one to pay

846
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:00,041
for all the stuff that's
getting obliterated back there?

847
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,708
I don't see why they
would, baby boy.

848
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:02,875
I'm just sitting here...

849
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,750
But just in case,
let's run into the forest

850
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,208
so they can't
destroy anything else.

851
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,583
Why do you keep
calling me baby boy?!

852
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:10,000
Because I like doing it!

853
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,541
How can he still move like
that while carrying Miss Mexiah?

854
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,125
He's a beast.
That's how!

855
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,166
If they go
into the forest,

856
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,333
then I can really
let this baby rip!

857
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,125
Goodness.

858
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,166
They are not joking
around, are they?

859
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,625
Nor am I,
Miss Lashara...

860
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,125
Believe you me.

861
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,333
Yes, we can agree that no
one is joking right now.

862
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,750
Have everyone involved
come to my office once

863
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,791
this ridiculous
fight is over...

864
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:51,125
Naturally,
that includes you.

865
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:53,375
Understood.

866
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,666
I have no intention of
lecturing you on normal ethics,

867
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,833
so let me be
as blunt as possible.

868
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,708
No one standing
before me right now

869
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:03,875
should come to
school tomorrow.

870
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:04,958
Are we suspended?

871
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:05,958
Not quite...

872
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,208
As you are well aware,

873
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,250
the academy is
extremely understaffed,

874
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,791
so we're going to put
all of you to work.

875
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,333
You will be responsible
for repairing every facility

876
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:17,041
you destroyed today.

877
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,625
None of you
will return to school

878
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,500
until those
repairs are done.

879
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:21,750
I don't understand...

880
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,083
we aren't exactly
trained in construction.

881
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:28,000
A few new workers will
arrive tomorrow afternoon.

882
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,291
Kenshi Masaki,
you will instruct them

883
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,416
on how to fix
the damages until then...

884
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,458
Can you do that?

885
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,041
Uh, yes, ma'am.

886
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,291
Absolutely.
You can count on me.

887
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,583
What an exhausting day...

888
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,041
What the-?

889
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,083
Kenshi, it's about time we
headed back to the dorm...

890
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,791
How long are you
planning to stay in here?

891
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:14,083
What do you think
you're doing, you idiot?!

892
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,333
Pardon me, sir.

893
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,541
I hate to intrude,
but I just received word

894
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,500
that the 'packages'
are in transit.

895
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:37,666
Understood.

896
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,041
Is everything
all right, sir...?

897
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,875
Are you concerned about
that machine we saw earlier?

898
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,750
The aho reactor, if it
really doesn't need one...

899
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:47,958
then it could be used for
battle outside the Draft

900
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,583
without using a cable...

901
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,875
Which means...

902
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,916
It would be rather useful
in seizing the castle.

903
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,958
That's true.

904
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:01,083
Uh, good morning,
everyone.

905
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,541
I'm excited to work
with you all.

906
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,083
If you could just
follow my instructions

907
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,625
to get the repairs all done,
that'd be great!

908
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,375
How dare a lowly attendant
tell us what to do!

909
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:12,416
It can't be helped...

910
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,166
We are less than amateurs when
it comes to this type of work...

911
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,625
Let's just do
whatever he tells us.

912
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,500
Yes. Someone kill me.

913
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,958
Reconstruction is fun...

914
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,666
I bet I can get some sweet
data out of all this stuff.

915
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,416
We have to admit,
we're rather jealous

916
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,416
a certain country bumpkin
is so accustomed to such work...

917
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,041
We have personally never had
to lift anything heavier

918
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,041
than a teacup.

919
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,625
Surprising...

920
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,416
One would figure by now your
greed would have forced you

921
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
to grab any bag of money,
no matter the weight.

922
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,541
Excuse us?!

923
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,166
I will not!

924
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,416
I'm starting to think
this might go faster

925
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,083
if I just did it myself.

926
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:53,791
Wow, you brought a lot
of options this time!

927
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,125
Yeah...

928
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,791
We got an odd last minute
flood of applicants

929
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,333
from out of nowhere...

930
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,208
They seem fairly capable, too,
so I'm sure more than one

931
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,000
will be a nice contribution.

932
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,875
I hope so... I do hate putting
them all to work so soon...

933
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,166
But could
you try to send

934
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,625
about ten more experienced
construction workers

935
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,250
over to me first...?

936
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,041
I wish I could let them rest,
but I just don't have a choice.

937
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,583
That's fine...

938
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,208
They came here to work,
so we might as well let them.

939
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,291
Can we get ten here?!

940
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,250
Wake up already, Kenshi!

941
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,250
You've got to smack
into an upperclassmen,

942
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,791
resulting in a
hilarious chain of events!

943
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,416
Next time on Tenchi Muyo!

944
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,333
War on Geminar:
Pendant...

945
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:21,125
A romantic comedy is
about to get under way!
