1
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:04,366
Wow, these paintings by
Yumemi Yumeno are so
beautiful, but why do they
make me feel so nostalgic?

2
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,300
Wait!-That pure-hearted
girl possesses a Rainbow
Crystal?! We've gotta
do something!

3
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,633
Okay, here
goes nothing!

4
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:16,166
I am Sailor Moon! And in
the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

5
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:25,300
Hey! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
You know me as the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice.

6
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,200
I am Sailor
Moon!

7
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,000
This job's not
easy, by the way.

8
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:33,500
We have to find and
protect the Legendary
Silver Crystal before the
bad guys get it. But in

9
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:38,400
order to do that, we need
to find the seven Rainbow
Crystals and the people
holding them!

10
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:43,900
Pretty crazy, huh? But
now there are four of us
Sailor Guardians, so I
think everything's

11
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,866
gonna work out just fine.

12
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
[giggling]

13
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,700
"The Painting of Love:
Usagi and Mamoru Get
Closer"

14
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:15,666
Of the seven Rainbow
Crystals... Two are in
the hands of those Sailor
Guardians and Tuxedo Mask

15
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,700
while we only possess one
of them.

16
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,900
And as for our allies,
the Seven Great Monsters,
three of them have
already been defeated.

17
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:26,400
Do you have anything to
say for yourself,
Zoisite?

18
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:30,833
Yes! Queen Beryl-please
allow me just a little
more time.

19
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,166
This young lady is our
next target.

20
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,266
I promise to
obtain the Rainbow
Crystal she has by
whatever means necessary.

21
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,166
But should you fail...
you know what will happen
to you?

22
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,366
Yes, my Queen.

23
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:09,366
Yup, it's autumn all
right. Seems like there
are folks in love
everywhere.

24
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,833
Oh Tuxedo Mask, tell
me. Are you a friend
or a foe?

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,933
There is one thing we
do know, that he is after
the precious Silver Crystal.

26
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:23,366
So that means we
should consider him
an enemy.

27
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,166
No! That can't be
right!

28
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,766
I don't know the real
identity of the guy
I'm in love with

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,733
and then there's
all those scary
monsters!

30
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:35,200
They keep popping up all
the time! Why does this
stuff keep happening to
me?!

31
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,266
Sorry I'm late,
Usagi.

32
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,533
Naru! So what is it you
wanted to show me,
anyway?!

33
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,466
You're just gonna have
to wait to find out!
Come on!

34
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,400
Okay, but I'm
starving! Can we get
something to eat?

35
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,533
[screaming]

36
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:51,233
That was way too
close. Seriously.

37
00:04:55,766 --> 00:05:02,866
[chatting]

38
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,800
Wow! They're great!

39
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,366
Aren't they?! That's
why Yumemi Yumeno's
paintings have become all
the rage now.

40
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,833
This place is packed,
mostly with couples.

41
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:16,466
You know why? Because her
artwork is known as the
paintings of love!

42
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,733
Oh, Umino!

43
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:21,800
I agree! They say if
you have one of Yumemi's
paintings,

44
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,766
Your own wishes of
love will be granted!

45
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,566
Um-hm!-Um-hm!

46
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,700
Then I'm buying a poster
of hers!

47
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,433
Wow look at that! It's
one of Yumemi's self
portraits.

48
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,866
Oh! She's beautiful!

49
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,600
She definitely looks like
a person who would create
fantasy art.

50
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:42,466
Actually what she really
looks like is a mystery
because she's never, ever
been seen in public.

51
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Well then, maybe in
reality she's super
ugly.

52
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,500
Did you really just say
that?!

53
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,600
[giggling]

54
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:00,400
This isn't good. I
can't paint without the
right inspiration.

55
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:04,866
But I've heard Yumemi
hasn't produced any new
paintings in a while.

56
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,866
Yeah, rumor is she's in a
creative slump and has
gone into hiding.

57
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,333
I'm right here.

58
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:11,533
That sucks.

59
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:12,700
Yeah, no kidding.

60
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,500
[fake laughing]

61
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,700
[giggling]
Huh?!

62
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,366
What is it,
Usagi?

63
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:21,500
Wow, this picture.

64
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,900
It's like I've seen
it somewhere before.

65
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,400
Huh? This painting
reminds me of...

66
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,366
Please find the Silver
Crystal.

67
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,200
It's like that dream
I always have.

68
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:56,133
Hey! Hey, come on,
let's go!

69
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,866
[grunting]

70
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,566
Sorry!

71
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,833
My glasses,
where'd they--

72
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,200
Hey. Are you all right,
Miss?

73
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:06,166
Yeah... wait. You're
him! It's you!

74
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,866
Huh?

75
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,300
Huh?

76
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:11,800
<i>Hey!</i>

77
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,166
Isn't that guy out there
a friend of Motoki?

78
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,566
Yeah, that jerk!

79
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
He's cheating on Rei!

80
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:23,166
Oh, this is gonna be fun!
Sorry Naru, I'll see you
later, 'kay?

81
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Hey wait!

82
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,566
Oh, Umino, make sure
that you walk Naru
home!

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,433
And grab a poster
for me, will ya?

84
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,333
Okay-You can count on me!

85
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,000
Can you believe her?

86
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:38,166
How about that? An
unexpected turn of events
has left me all alone
with Naru.

87
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,566
In the past I would've
been sad if Usagi decided
to suddenly run off and
leave me behind.

88
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,533
Now it just feels like
I've fallen in love yet
again!

89
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,600
Umino, I can
hear you.

90
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,433
Please, help me.

91
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:53,800
Help you what? If you
want something you better
speak up, lady.

92
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,366
Um--- I want
you to be my model.

93
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,433
Oooo! Busted! Wait
'til I tell Rei
about this.

94
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,466
You've got this all
wrong, Usagi.

95
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,433
And just how's that?
You're the one holding
hands with this girl!

96
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,866
Huh?!! What luck!

97
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,733
Huh? What
is it?

98
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:16,466
You're perfect! Now
I can start my next
painting!

99
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,600
[sighing]
Please say you'll
model for me, oh,
please!

100
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,300
Huh?! Model for you?!

101
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,133
Well, come in!
Right this way!

102
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:32,166
Wow! What
pretty flowers!

103
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,766
Thank you!
Well, uh--

104
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,500
Make yourselves
comfortable while I go
make some coffee.

105
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,866
Look I know I let you
talk me into coming here,

106
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,366
but I really can't spend
my whole day doing this
thing.

107
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:47,633
Oh, yeah, whatever. Like
you have better things to
do, you loser.

108
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,700
Hmph!

109
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:53,200
This looks like Yumemi
Yumeno's artwork!

110
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,300
[gasping]

111
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,266
Wait! Are you Yumemi
Yumeno?

112
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:58,533
Mmm.

113
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:04,300
I'm not what you
expected, right?

114
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,833
People think someone really
beautiful should paint
paintings like these.

115
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:12,766
That's why I made my
self-portraits look
pretty. But please, keep
this all a secret, okay?

116
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
So then no one knows what
you look like? Not even
your own friends know
who you really are?

117
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,700
That's a big
secret!

118
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,366
I don't have
any friends.

119
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,500
But I'm used
to it, now.

120
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,266
Besides, as long I can
keep working on my
paintings, that's good
enough for me.

121
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,900
All right, then.
Let's get you two
ready.

122
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,566
Usagi, could you sit
here?

123
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,233
What?! You want me to be
in a painting with this
jerk?!

124
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,333
You should
be so lucky.

125
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,300
Ohhhhhh!

126
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,900
I can't be a part
of this. I'm out of
here.

127
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,500
Please don't go.
I can explain.

128
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:45,566
I have a hard time
imagining it all without
having models to help me.

129
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
And lately, there's
been no one who matches
what I see.

130
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,600
I promise it'll be just
for today... Please?

131
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,333
Oh, all right.

132
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,666
Oh my gosh!

133
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,166
If Rei ever saw this,
she'd kill me!

134
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,300
But hey, he does look
pretty handsome.

135
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,233
Oh, geez. What am I
thinking here?!
Stop it, Usagi!

136
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:12,300
Tuxedo Mask is the
only one I love!
Owie-that hurt.

137
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,533
Just what are you doing?

138
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,300
Uh! None of
your business!

139
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,333
Hmph!

140
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,466
Heh.

141
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,800
Now! Let's get started!

142
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,833
I feel this one could be
a masterpiece!

143
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:38,766
Oh boy! It's hopeless!
Where could Usagi have
run off to anyway?

144
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:55,200
Is that me?!
Unbelievable!

145
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,466
Can't we get this
over with?

146
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,633
You know the only real
reason I'm still sitting
here is because this
coffee's so good.

147
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,900
[sticking tongue out]

148
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:08,933
I'm so impressed. How are
you able to draw such
wonderful pictures?

149
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:15,300
Whenever I start my
drawing, I always make a
wish in my heart.

150
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,766
I wish for the people who
see my artwork to let it
make them happy.

151
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,800
And for all of them to
be able to find their
true love.

152

Wow! That explains why
they're called paintings
of love, it all makes
sense, now.

person, it's sad you
don't have any friends.

154
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:40,366
That can't be helped. My
fans think Yumemi is this
incredible beauty. But if
people found out I'm

155
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,333
her, it would shatter
their dreams, and make
them sad.

make themselves happy,
can never make others
happy either.

<i>It's beautiful!</i>

302
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,406
I'd say it looks pretty
good considering who the
model was...

303
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,173
Ugh, would it kill
you to be nice once
in a while?

304
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:10,540
Oh, hey!

305
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,706
Huh?

306
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:18,540
All of my self-portraits
will look like this from
now on.

307
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:23,206
Thanks to you I've
found the courage to be
honest about myself and
what I look like, so now

308
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,606
I feel good sharing the
real me with everyone!

309
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm so glad, Yumemi!

310
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:12,840
Autumn... the
season of longing.

311
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:15,573
A time when you want to
be with the one you
love.

312
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:18,340
<i>There's no time for</i>
<i>that, you've got an</i>
<i>important mission!</i>

313
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,873
Maybe a walk in a park
together or see a
movie...

314
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:23,573
<i>Come back to reality!</i>

315
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:26,340
Tuxedo Mask...
Motoki...

316
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:28,206
<i>You know Motoki has a</i>
<i>girlfriend.</i>

317
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,140
What?!

318
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,640
"Next time on Sailor Moon,
Total Chaos: The Messy
Love Rectangle"

319
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,240
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
