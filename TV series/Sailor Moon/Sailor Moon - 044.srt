1
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:04,133
Endymion...Mother...
I remember everything.

2
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Kunzite! We'll show you
that things don't always
work the way you planned!

3
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,133
I am Sailor Moon!

4
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,866
And in the name
of the moon!

5
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,600
We'll punish you!

6
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:28,900
Tuxedo Mask, tell
me where you are!

7
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,066
Wake up, Usagi!
It's urgent!

8
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,933
My dear Tuxedo
Mask, I love you!

9
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,733
Usagi!

10
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:40,666
This is important! Sailor
Venus and Artemis have
finally discovered the
entryway into the Dark

11
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,900
Kingdom's hideout!

12
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,700
What?! Are you serious?!

13
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:53,700
<i>"Usagi's Awakening: A</i>
<i>Message from the</i>
<i>Distant Past."</i>

14
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,200
This is the place,
everyone.

15
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:07,100
It looks that way.
Great work, Sailor
Venus.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,900
C'mon!

17
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,033
What's this?

18
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,933
Let's check it out!

19
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
What's that energy?

20
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,100
(struggling grunts)

21
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,666
(evil chuckle)

22
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,866
I wish I could give you
a grand tour of the Dark
Kingdom, but at the present
time we're not quite ready

23
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,033
to welcome all of you.

24
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:54,266
But there's a fun place
I'd like to take you
to, instead.

25
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,866
Stop messing with us!

26
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,166
Supreme!

27
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,000
Thunder!

28
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:11,900
Sailor Moon! If you
willingly hand over the
Silver Crystal, I shall
spare your life!

29
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:17,166
Oh really, is that right?
Well if you tell me what
happened to Tuxedo Mask,
then maybe I won't have

30
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,666
to punish you.

31
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,633
Enough! I've had
it with all of you!

32
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,866
I'm sending you to
the Multi-Dimensional
Chaos World!

33
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,600
What's the Multi-
Dimensional Chaos World?

34
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,900
It might be prehistoric
Africa during the age
of the dinosaurs, or it
might be medieval Europe

35
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:37,000
during an era of war,
bloodshed and bubonic
plague.

36
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:43,000
Whoa! Those totally suck.
I don't want to go to
either of those worlds.
I'll pass!

37
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,100
(forceful grunt)

38
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,700
Ahhh!

39
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,200
Now I'll take the
Silver Crystal!

40
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,000
(reaching grunts)

41
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,366
No!

42
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,233
Ahhh!

43
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,166
Ahhh!

44
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,933
Where am I?

45
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,533
What is this place?

46
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:53,833
This is what's left of
the Silver Millennium. In
the distant past, it was the
glorious land of the Gods.

47
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,800
Silver Millennium?

48
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,866
Who are you?

49
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,633
I am the incarnation of the
Moon Goddess Selene, here
to deliver you a message
from the distant past.

50
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:16,066
My name is Queen Serenity.
I am queen of the Silver
Millennium. And I am also
your mother.

51
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,900
What?! My mother?! How
could that be possible?
I don't understand what
you're saying.

52
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:26,066
<i>I put Luna and Artemis</i>
<i>into cold sleep and then</i>
<i>awakened them so they</i>
<i>could watch over all of</i>

53
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,666
<i>you. I've been waiting</i>
<i>a very long time for</i>
<i>this moment.</i>

54
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,233
(astonished gasp)

55
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:47,100
We are a race of long-
lived beings born on the
Moon. We protect the sacred
stone, the "Legendary Silver

56
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:54,133
Crystal", handed down in
the Moon's royal family.
Our mission is to watch
over the Earth and help

57
00:06:54,166 --> 00:07:02,900
it advance. Try to
remember Serenity, open
your mind, and remember
the time when you were

58
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,633
a Moon Princess.

59
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:20,300
You would often spend
many happy hours gazing out
at the Earth, daydreaming
of what life would be like

60
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:29,666
being surrounded by the
wind and the trees of
the blue planet. And then,
one day you found love.

61
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,166
<i>Princess Serenity!</i>

62
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,066
(startled gasp)

63
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,766
Prince Endymion!

64
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,000
<i>I apologize for</i>
<i>arriving so late.</i>

65
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,933
I've been waiting
for you.

66
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:42,000
<i>A terrible thing</i>
<i>has happened.</i>

67
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,533
(gasp)

68
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:47,000
It seems that many of
my people have been
brainwashed by a woman
named Beryl.

69
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,933
Beryl?

70
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,866
This woman has been
possessed by an evil
energy called Metalia.

71
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,066
<i>And as a result. She has</i>
<i>convinced many humans</i>
<i>that in order to live</i>
<i>longer lives, they must</i>

72
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,366
<i>take over the Moon.</i>

73
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,966
Who's there?!

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,700
Huh?!

75
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,700
I'll see you
later at the ball!

76
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,800
Hurry back, Endymion.

77
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,400
What happened to
the others?!

78
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:21,300
Don't know. Looks like
we'll have to find the
hideout ourselves!

79
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,033
Where are we?!

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,200
It's the Arctic!

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,033
Princess...

82
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,200
Would you do
me the honor?

83
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,300
Why are you
wearing a mask?

84
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,166
A bitter war is about
to get underway any
day now...

85
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,300
between my people on
Earth and your people.
I will become your enemy.
It wouldn't be good for

86
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,666
either of us if people
knew I was here.

87
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,966
So please forgive
my disguise.

88
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,500
<i>You?! My enemy?</i>

89
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:28,200
Listen to me carefully.
Metalia is not human.
She is a being of pure
evil energy. And Beryl

90
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:34,966
is a sorceress. She is
using Metalia's power in
an attempt to conquer both
the Earth and the Moon.

91
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:48,566
<i>Unless I do something,</i>
<i>the Moon Kingdom will</i>
<i>be destroyed.</i>

92
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm convinced the only
way to stop this war is
to eliminate Metalia, and
wipe out her evil energy.

93
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,833
<i>That should put an</i>
<i>end to Beryl's plans.</i>

94
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:03,233
I'm going to need you
to help, Serenity. Please
believe me, we don't have
any time to waste.

95
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Yes.

96
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,733
Serenity...

97
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,733
I love you,
Endymion.

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,766
(attack yell)

99
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,833
It's terrible!
Everybody run for
your lives!

100
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,600
The people of Earth
are attacking us!

101
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:37,633
(attacking roar)

102
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,766
Bubble!

103
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,300
Spray!

104
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,766
Fire!

105
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Soul!

106
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,766
Supreme!

107
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,033
Thunder!

108
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,933
Crescent!

109
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,700
Beam!

110
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,166
(shocked gasp)

111
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,066
(deathly screams)

112
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,933
(attacking yell)

113
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,566
(evil laughter)

114
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:38,633
From this day forth, I
shall rule both the
Earth and the Moon!

115
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,700
I will not tolerate
any opposition!

116
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,866
Beloved Queen Metalia,
at this very moment, our
own Dark Kingdom is born!

117
00:11:56,866 --> 00:12:00,133
(triumphant laugh)

118
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,033
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

119
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:26,349
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

120
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:42,216
(fearful gasp)

121
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,849
So you must be
Princess Serenity.

122
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,383
(scared gasp)

123
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,383
Say goodbye to
your pretty face!
Hah! Take this!

124
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,649
(painful yell)

125
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,016
What's this?

126
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:58,316
Now that I have your
attention, listen to me!
I will not let you lay
a finger on the Princess!

127
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,649
Endymion!

128
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,449
Why are you protecting
this girl? What loyalty
can you have for the Moon?
You are the Prince of the

129
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:12,283
Earth. Marry me and you
will be King of both the
Moon and the Earth!

130
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:17,383
No, Beryl. Don't you see
what's happened? Metalia's
evil energy has totally
consumed you!

131
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,616
Come to your senses!
Free your heart from
evil!

132
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:24,449
Silence you fool or
I will kill the both
of you!

133
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,349
(evil growl)

134
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:34,383
(painful scream)

135
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,649
Don't go, Endymion!

136
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,283
Serenity! Stay back!

137
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:40,883
Endymion, don't
leave me!

138
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,383
Get out of here!

139
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,583
Serenity!

140
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,549
(painful screams)

141
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,516
(scared gasps)

142
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,416
Serenity!

143
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,349
Princess Serenity!

144
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:14,849
(evil laugh)

145
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:18,849
She's dead! The Moon
Princess is dead!

146
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,216
(evil laughter)

147
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,116
<i>Serenity...</i>

148
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:56,216
Queen Serenity, don't!
If you release the Silver
Crystal's full power,
you will die!

149
00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:01,516
My life doesn't matter.
Not when the peace of
the Moon and the Earth
is at stake.

150
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,749
Moon Healing
Escalation!

151
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:08,383
What?!

152
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:12,816
(painful roar)

153
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,216
Queen Metalia!

154
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,349
(painful screams)

155
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,349
Curse you, Queen
Serenity!

156
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:41,616
Don't give up.
You have to stay
strong, Artemis!

157
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:46,183
I'm alright. But what
about you, Luna. Are
you getting tired out?

158
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:50,883
Mm. I'm fine. I have
no intention of dying
until we find that
hideout!

159
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,549
Is that?!

160
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:03,683
We did it! At last we've
finally found the entry
portal to the Dark
Kingdom's hideout!

161
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,683
We have to tell
the others!

162
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,583
Sorry, but you're
way too late.

163
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:15,283
(fearful gasp)

164
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,516
<i>Luna...</i>
<i>Artemis...</i>

165
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,349
<i>Yes?!</i>

166
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,683
The Silver Crystal can
bring peace into the
world when used by
someone with a pure heart.

167
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:32,449
But, when it is used
by someone with an
evil heart,

168
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:35,683
it immediately becomes
a frightening weapon.

169
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:39,149
That's enough, please
don't talk anymore!

170
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:45,916
With the power of the
Silver Crystal, I was
able to seal away Metalia.
However, there's no telling

171
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:48,283
when she'll return
once again.

172
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:55,883
That's why I need to tell
you about the Moon Stick.
Only those with royal
blood are able to use it.

173
00:16:55,916 --> 00:17:00,816
So in the future, if Metalia
is able to break free from
her suspended animation...

174
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:05,916
...Entrust this stick to
Princess Serenity, so that
she can protect the peace
of the world.

175
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:06,883
Yes.

176
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:14,449
Princess Serenity, and
all the other Sailor
Guardians as well, may
your future lives on

177
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:17,849
Earth be filled with
love, kindness and hope.

178
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,883
This is my final wish.

179
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:56,349
Live in peace
and happiness.

180
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,516
Queen Serenity!

181
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:21,749
(screaming)

182
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,883
Queen Serenity...

183
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,516
So that's
what happened.

184
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:39,983
It all makes
sense now.

185
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:44,416
Now we know why we
were chosen as Sailor
Guardians to protect
this planet.

186
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:45,816
Yes.

187
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:47,816
Thank you, mother.

188
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:49,549
Help!

189
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:50,683
<i>(painful scream)</i>

190
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:51,583
(startled gasp)

191
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:55,516
(attacking yell)

192
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:56,349
Ahhh!

193
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:57,549
Luna!

194
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,583
Artemis! No!

195
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,549
Sailor...

196
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,316
We're not going to
let you hurt them
anymore!

197
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:11,583
Sailor Moon, but how
did you?! I sent you
away to the Multi-
dimensional Chaos World!

198
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:14,616
Well too bad that
things didn't work
out the way you
planned.

199
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,383
But thanks to you,
we've regained

200
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,349
all our memories
of the past!

201
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,849
We'd like to
show you...

202
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:22,183
...how very
grateful we are!

203
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:26,449
Argh! Don't be condescending
to me, you presumptuous
dress-up dolls!

204
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:30,883
Return Tuxedo Mask. I
mean, Endymion. You have
no right to keep him!

205
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,316
(evil chuckle)

206
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:36,149
I'd be willing to let
him go if you'd just hand
over the Silver Crystal!

207
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:36,649
Hah!

208
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,549
(fearful gasp)

209
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:43,383
(attacking roar)

210
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,449
(attacking growl)

211
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,216
(painful screams)

212
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:49,016
Sailor Moon!

213
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,716
You're even more deranged
than I'd ever realized!

214
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:54,649
Unforgivable!

215
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:59,783
Hmph! It is you who are
deranged if you think your
silly attacks could possibly
work here in my world!

216
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:00,816
(attacking yell)

217
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:03,849
(painful screams)

218
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:08,383
We need to put our
powers together to
protect Sailor Moon!
Let's do it girls!

219
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,183
Venus Power!

220
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,349
Mercury Power!

221
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:15,916
Mars Power!

222
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,649
Jupiter Power!

223
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,249
(attacking yell)

224
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:29,349
(painful grunts)

225
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:31,883
Stop it!

226
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:40,483
Even if you went out right
now and bought us the finest
haute-couture, trend-setting
designs as replacements.

227
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:44,183
I can't forgive you
for trying to shred
our Sailor Guardian
outfits!

228
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,483
In the name
of the moon...

229
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,883
I'll punish you!

230
00:20:56,683 --> 00:21:01,116
Moon Healing
Escalation!

231
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,683
(startled gasp)

232
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:14,849
I am Kunzite! A proud
member of the Dark
Kingdom's Four Kings
of Heaven!

233
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:17,749
You can't make me
yell out 'Refresh'
ever!

234
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:19,516
(attacking yell)

235
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:22,849
What?!

236
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:26,283
(surprised grunt)

237
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:28,583
Impossible!

238
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:34,649
To be defeated by
my own weapon!
Oh, Zoisite!

239
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:42,216
Help guide me to the
world where your soul
is in limbo! I'm coming
my love!

240
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:54,416
Sailor Moon's power
is just incredible!

241
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,249
Even greater now.

242
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:02,316
Are you going to
be all right, Luna?

243
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:07,849
I'm okay, Usagi. I mean
Sailor Moon. No, you're
Serenity, aren't you?

244
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:12,583
The Dark Kingdom's
hideout is the D Point
located in the Arctic
Circle!

245
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:16,516
You're going to have
to hurry there before
the dark spots on the
sun spread!

246
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,549
There isn't
much time left.

247
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:21,849
Okay, we'll storm the
Dark Kingdom immediately!

248
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,116
Right, everybody!

249
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:26,383
Right!

250
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:29,516
Now, in the name
of the moon...

251
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,483
We'll punish you!

252
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:18,197
A powerful evil energy is
about to be resurrected!
The time for our final
battle is here!

253
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,230
<i>Curse you impudent</i>
<i>girls! I will not let</i>
<i>you interfere with my</i>
<i>plans! Die!</i>

254
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:29,430
Silver Crystal, please!
Please! Give us strength!

255
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,497
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Death of the Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians: The Tragic</i>
<i>Final Battle."</i>

256
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,030
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
