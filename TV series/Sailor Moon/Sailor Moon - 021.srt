how Usagi normally
reacts.

142
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,700
I mean that's where
they're making the new
Sailor V anime,
isn't it?!

143
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,433
Ugh! I could've gotten
a hold of one of their
cel drawings as a
souvenir!

144
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,900
(Luna & Ami)
Huh?

145
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,300
How weird and wacky
can this girl get.

146
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay, so then we'll
all go to Studio
Dive after school!

147
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:43,900
(Ami cont'd)
It's important that
find out just what
Nephrite is up to, so-

148
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,300
Right! Uh-huh!
Uh-huh! We do!

149
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,166
We have to go visit the
studio knowing that
Nephrite's been there!

150
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,500
(Luna & Ami)

You drew all of

night?!

153

Sure, doesn't
everybody!

154

Kazuko...

155
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,866
Yeah?

156
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,133
(Hiromi)
I want to have this
room all to myself
today.

157
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,400
Um, sure, that's
fine but... uh.

158
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,266
What's with her?

159
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,266
(Chuckles)

160
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:26,166
You can't outdo me
now, Kazuko. Not as
long as I have this
pencil.

161
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,433
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

<i>Animation studio?</i>

00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,233
Why would I ever
want to go visit that
place?

165
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,600
Besides, anime's
really for kids.

166
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:10,500
Fine, then we'll go
without you!

167
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,900
<i>(Ami)</i>
<i>Oh dear, look at</i>
<i>the time! We gotta</i>
<i>hurry!</i>

168
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,000

Next time, buy a
watch!

169
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,200
Sorry...

170
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,433
Well, <i>what's done</i>

171
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:20,900
<i>(Rei)</i>
<i>You're late!</i>

172
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,466
(Usagi & Ami)
Huh?! Rei?!

173
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,566
I've been waiting!
What took you guys
so long?!

174
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,566
Someone had to stay
after to catch up
with her homework.

175
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,133
(Giggles)
Shh!

176
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,966
But Rei, Usagi said
you weren't interested
in visiting the studio
with us.

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,233
C'mon! Are you kidding?
We have to go by the
studio knowing Nephrite's
been there!

178
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,566
Now where have I
hear that before?

179
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Anyway! We should
get going!
Huh?!

180
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,900
Looks like somebody
is expecting to get a
lot of autographs
signed.

181
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:55,100
Well, my friends are
big fans and wanted
some stuff signed!

182
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:59,366
Such a liar! C'mon
Rei, you're the one
who really wants
the autographs, right?

183
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Hold on. You do
realize, we're starting
high school soon,
don't you?

184
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,066
What's your point?

185
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,066
Mmm- Just saying.

186
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,433
Ugh! Ms. Smarty
pants thinks she's
all that!

187

Hmph! What now?

189
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,933
So I take it that
your plan is going
quite well this time?

Hmph!

<i>Oh?</i>

192

outcome.

<i>I love Sailor V!</i>

197
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,800
So sorry, to barge
in on you like this.

198
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,733
It's fine, we're
glad to have you!

199
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:55,033
Thank you. Would you
mind if I ask you
a few questions?

200
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,233
Why sure! What is
it you want to know?

201

happened here recently
that you'd consider

209
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,966
<i>(Hiromi)</i>
<i>You might try keeping</i>

<i>(Rei & Usagi)</i>
<i>Oh! We're very sorry!</i>

Hiromi!

213
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,833
What's wrong?!
That's no way to talk
to people who are fans
of what we do here!

214
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:25,333
Hunh! I bet they're
just here to get
autographs and free
drawings!

215
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,166
Really! You act like
they're a bunch of

Hello, this is

You shouldn't be
letting visitors in

Well you see, in
the last scene.

I'm going to kill
off, <i>Sailor V!</i>

Uh! Do what?!

have a chance against
us.

287
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,966
Oh, we'll stop you!

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,066
(Both)
See!

289
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,433
The powerful bond
that we share
together...

290
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,133
...makes us
invincible!

<i>(Kastol)</i>
<i>You guardians have...</i>

292

No chance.
To win.

293
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,700
Around and around
and!

294
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,133
Take this!

295
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,833
Ahh!

296
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,866
Ah! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

(Porkus)
<i>My turn!</i> Around
and!

298
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,033
Take that!

299
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,833
Ugh!!

300
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,566
(Laughing)

301
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,300
See!

302
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,100
Our teamwork has
knocked you out!

303
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,100
Oh no!

304
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,400
(Rei)
<i>They're attacking us</i>

(Twins Laughing)

306
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:34,400
Now I'll finish
you off.

307
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,433
(Porkus)
Hey, wait!
That's my job
thank you!

308
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,500
What? Finishing
them is my job!

309
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,800
No way!
I get to do it!

310
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,333
<i>(Kastol)</i>
<i>Why don't you</i>

<i>you!</i>

312
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,000
Ugh! Our friendship
ends right here,
right now!

313
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,633
That's just fine!
<i>We are done!</i>

314
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,000
Now's your chance!
Those monster's
teamwork is done!

315
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:58,333
Okay!
We'll show them
what real teamwork
can do!

316
00:19:58,366 --> 00:19:59,033
(Rei & Ami)
Right!

317
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,300
Fire!

318

Huh?! Oh no!

324
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,633
We should have
valued...

325
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,666
...our friendship
a lot more!

326
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:51,866
(Giggles)
We did it!

327
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,366
(Gasp)
This can't be!

328
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Ha! How amusing
watching you fail.
(Laughs)

329
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:06,600
<i>It seems I</i>

<i>C'mon Hiromi, please,</i>

331
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,833
Kazuko, the truth is
I've been using
those pencils.

332
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,633
Hiromi...

333

<i>(Kazuko)</i>
<i>There's uh, something</i>
<i>I've been keeping</i>

Huh?

<i>(Kazuko)</i>
<i>Look.</i>

Are those, your

337
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,100
Ah!

338
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,000

<i>Sorry, but I broke</i>
<i>my promise too!</i>

339
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:34,566
I was so frustrated
because you always
did such great work!

340
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,733
And these inspired
me to do better!

341
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,733
<i>(Hiromi)</i>
<i>So you did it</i>
<i>too?</i>

342
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:43,433
<i>(Kazuko)</i>
<i>I felt like if I didn't</i>
<i>do something, I'd just</i>
<i>get left way behind you.</i>

343
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,566
But, that's just
how I felt!

Hey, it's all good!

345
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400

There was nothing wrong
