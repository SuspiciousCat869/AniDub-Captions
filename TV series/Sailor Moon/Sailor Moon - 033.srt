1
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,033
Wow, my dream of
becoming super
famous has finally
come true! Sort of.

2
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:06,900
The truth is, the
enemy is using my
identity to lure in
Tuxedo Mask, so they

3
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,400
can steal his
Rainbow Crystals!
Tuxedo Mask, look
out!

4
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,866
That does it! Time
for the real Sailor
Moon to take action!

5
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,833
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

6
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:25,733
Hey! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
You know me as the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice.

7
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:29,733
I am Sailor Moon!
This job's not easy
by the way...

8
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:33,666
We have to find and
protect the Legendary
Silver Crystal before
the bad guys get it.

9
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,233
But in order to do that,
we need to find the Seven
Rainbow Crystals and the
people holding them!

10
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:43,833
Pretty crazy, huh?
But now there are
four of us Sailor
Guardians, so I think

11
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,233
everything's gonna
work out just fine!

12
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,633
(giggling)

13
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:56,133
<i>"Enter Venus, the</i>
<i>last Sailor Guardian"</i>

14
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,600
Now to end your life
once and for all!

15
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:07,633
Hm?

16
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,266
Not while I'm
around, Nephrite.

17
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,400
Tuxedo Mask,
my hero!

18
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,733
(angry growl)

19
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,833
Ahhhh!

20
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,833
Enough of this!

21
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:39,300
Explain yourself,
Zoisite. What is
the purpose of this?

22
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,000
Why would you think
I would wish to
see these images?

23
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,333
Well, Queen Beryl,
every time we have
Sailor Moon within
our grasp someone

24
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:53,766
comes to her rescue
and it's always the
same person, as those
scenes reveal.

25
00:03:54,333 --> 00:04:00,233
Yes. So? It's Tuxedo
Mask. Have you finally
figured out his true
identity?

26
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:05,333
Unfortunately, no. We
still don't know who
he is. But, my Queen,
we know one thing for

27
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:09,966
sure. And that is he
will only appear when
he knows Sailor Moon
is in great danger.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,800
All we have to do is
place Sailor Moon in
peril and Tuxedo Mask
will come to us.

29
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:20,000
If he does appear,
will you be able to
retrieve the two
Rainbow Crystals he

30
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,200
has stolen?

31
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:26,700
You do realize that
this is the last chance
you'll have to succeed,
right, Zoisite?

32
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,700
Yes...

33
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,866
... And I won't
fail you.

34
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>Not so fast,</i>
<i>Zoisite.</i>

35
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,500
Huh?

36
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,200
Oh, Kunzite!

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,166
Listen, if your plan is
to lure Tuxedo Mask out
into the open so that
you can deal with him,

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,100
then the first thing
you need to do is
separate him from the
Sailor Guardians.

39
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:52,766
With your permission,
I'd be happy to take
on that part of the
job, my Queen.

40
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Very well. Bring me all
seven of the Rainbow
Crystals. And do not
fail me this time.

41
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,733
Yes, my Queen!

42
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:06,633
Though I swear
allegiance to Queen
Beryl. I am doing this
for no one but you,

43
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:10,566
Kunzite. I would give
my very life for you!

44
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,600
(scared screams)

45
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,066
You behind the
counter! Money
in the bag!

46
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,733
C'mon! Make
it quick!

47
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:23,833
(painful grunt)

48
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,533
Huh?! Who the
hell are you?!

49
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:43,100
This just in! Another
arrest was made today
by the mysterious hero
calling herself the

50
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:47,133
Pretty Guardian Sailor
Moon. According to
witnesses, a man armed
with a rifle entered

51
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:52,066
the Tozai Bank's Juban
branch around two p.m.
The suspect fired
several rounds and was

52
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,000
demanding money from
a bank teller when the
Pretty Guardian entered
and quickly subdu-

53
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,700
Huh?! Usagi?!
No way!

54
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm goin' in!

55
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,533
Now this is my idea of
how a schoolgirl should
spend her day off! Eating
every dessert she wants!

56
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,866
Yeah, well, you're
going to need a
bigger school uniform
if you keep it up!

57
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,433
I can't help myself!
I just have to try
all of them!

58
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,033
Huh?

59
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,400
Aaaghh!

60
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,666
(gasps)

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,733
Oh no!

62
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,366
Somebody help us!
I'm losin' my grip!

63
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,900
Ahh-Ahh!

64
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:02,866
Ahhh!

65
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,666
(gasps)

66
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,833
Ahhhh!

67
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:18,400
(crowd cheering)

68
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,933
Could she have cut
those ropes herself?

69
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,433
Sailor Moon...

70
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,366
Why in the world does
she have to dress up
as Sailor Moon? Now
everyone thinks she's

71
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
some huge hero and
I'm not even getting
any credit for it! Wah!

72
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,600
Agh, just calm
down, Usagi!

73
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:54,733
Right now, we have
to tell Luna about
this and then go find
that faker!

74
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,366
Mmm-hmm!

75
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,600
The only ones with any
chance of catching her
are the Sailor Guardians
and Tuxedo Mask himself!

76
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:27,300
And the minute he
shows up. That'll
be that. The end of
Tuxedo Mask!

77
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,266
I could've sworn she
came this way, but
now I've lost her.

78
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,666
So a Sailor Moon
impostor has
appeared?

79
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,300
<i>Yeah! I saw her on</i>
<i>the news catching</i>
<i>that bank robber!</i>

80
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,000
That was when I
knew for sure it
was the fake and
not our Usagi.

81
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,466
Yeah, you got that
right! If the real
Sailor Moon worked
that hard there'd

82
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,766
be no work left for
us to do around here!

83
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,433
Very funny!

84
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:09,300
What I want to know
is, what is this
impostor after? Whose
side is she on anyway?

85
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:13,766
That's a good
question, Ami.
Luna, do you think
she might be the

86
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
fifth Guardian?

87
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:19,000
Huh?! Well let me
think about that for
a sec, uh...

88
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,433
I don't care who
this Sailor Moon
wannabe is! How
dare she go around

89
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:25,633
using my name
without asking
my permission!
I'm about to call

90
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,966
a lawyer and sue
her for stealing
my act!

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
(annoyed groans)

92
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,266
Get it together,
Usagi! You're
missing the point!

93
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,766
<i>(terrified scream)</i>

94
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,966
Let's go,
you guys!

95
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Right!

96
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
(evil chuckle)

97
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,233
It's her!

98
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,266
<i>(shocked gasps)</i>

99
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,533
And look! He looks
like he's from the
Dark Kingdom!

100
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,233
Come on everyone!
We have to help her!

101
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:04,666
No wait!

102
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,666
She's right! It's
probably a trap!

103
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,333
I don't care if it's
a trap! I can't ignore
someone in danger, even
if she is my impostor!

104
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,533
You're right.

105
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,533
Hm!

106
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,900
Come on! Let's
transform!

107
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:23,800
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

108
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,633
Mercury Power
Make Up!

109

Mars Power
Make Up!

110
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,600
Jupiter Power
Make UP!

111
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,100
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

112
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,733
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

113
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:56,292
This world is filled
with too much light.
It disgusts me.

114
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:03,192
True beauty is the
glow of darkness, and
the shadow of the
Dark Kingdom will

115
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,853
soon cover this
world.

116
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:08,420
You up there! Let
my impostor go!

117
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:15,153
You're one sick puppy
to tie up a girl and
leave her hanging from
a crane, you know that?!

118
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,020
I am the Pretty
Guardian...

119
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,987
Who fights for love
and for justice!

120
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,887
I am Sailor Moon!

121
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,753
That's right! And
I'm Sailor Mercury!

122
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:32,353
And don't you
forget Sailor
Mars!

123
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:35,553
And last, I'm
Sailor Jupiter!

124
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:44,353
And now in the name
of the Moon. We're
all here to punish
you good!

125
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:50,853
I've been expecting
you Sailor Guardians. I
am Kunzite, one of the
Four Kings of Heaven.

126
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:54,887
It's nice to meet
you but, now you
will die!

127
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:17,987
Behold, I bring you
darkness! Isn't it
beautiful?!

128
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,787
That's pretty
impressive.

129
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,720
Fire!

130
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,453
Soul!

131
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:30,953
(stunned gasp)

132
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,353
Great, that attack
was totally lame
Sailor Mars!

133
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,320
(evil laugh)

134
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,420
He's strong!

135
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,353
What's wrong?

136
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:52,387
Supreme!

137
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,687
Thunder!

138
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:02,487
(shocked gasps)

139
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,220
The darkness is
just swallowing
our attacks!

140
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,987
(evil laughter)

141
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:12,453
If that's all the
strength you Sailor
Guardians have, then
I guess it's time

142
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,820
to end this charade.

143
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,420
(shocked gasps)

144
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:55,653
Sailor Moon!

145
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:59,787
Could this be
a trap?

146
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,253
Hang on!

147
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,120
(evil laughter)

148
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,320
(painful grunt)

149
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,553

Sailor Moon!

00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:52,787
(callous laughter)

151
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,153
Zoisite!

152
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,420
<i>Oh, you poor thing.</i>

153
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:03,387
That must've hurt!
Don't worry, in just
a minute you won't
feel anything!

154
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,353
Zoi!

155
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,487
(mocking laughter)

156
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Run if you want! You're
not getting away with
those Rainbow Crystals,
Tuxedo Mask!

157
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:32,520
Augh! We're all
trapped in here!

158
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:34,120
Not if I can
help it!

159
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,253
Supreme!

160
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,387
Thunder!

161
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:50,187
No use! That thing
keeps on absorbing
our attacks!

162
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,820
Ahh!

163
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:04,153
(evil laugh)

164
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:07,487
You're finished. My
barrier's impenetrable.

165
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:17,420
(gasp)

166
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:21,753
(evil chuckling)

167
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,187
Found you...

168
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:25,553
Die!

169
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,820
(strained groans)

170
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:30,020
Zoi!

171
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,553
(shocked gasp)

172
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,653
It can't be!

173
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:45,187
<i>Well, well, what a</i>
<i>handsome face you've</i>
<i>been hiding!</i>

174
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,220
But it still won't
save your life!

175
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,320
(strained groans)

176
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,553
(evil chuckling)

177
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,253
<i>Prepare to die!</i>

178
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,520
Crescent
Beam!

179
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:00,687
That hurt! Who?!

180
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,320
(gasp)

181
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:09,320
Who are you?!
Dammit! Huh?!

182
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:15,653
I don't know who
you are, but you'll
pay for making a
fool out of me!

183
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,220
I'll tear you into
pieces, you hear me?!

184
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,620
(evil laughing)

185
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:32,120
We're running
out of air!

186
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,353
Can't breathe!

187
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:36,087
How do you like the
taste of my darkness?

188
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:38,653
Kunzite, we may
have a problem.

189
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:43,287
I had Tuxedo Mask
but he got away,
and there's another
enemy, as well.

190
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,553
You had one job
to do! And you let
Tuxedo Mask get away?!

191
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:51,053
I'm sorry I let
you down, but
I'm not done!

192
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:55,987
Listen to me, Tuxedo
Mask! I know you're
here somewhere,
hiding! Come on out!

193
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,687
What?! Tuxedo
Mask is here?!

194
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,587
Your darling Guardians
are almost gone! Wanna
save them?! Just give
yourself up! And hand

195
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,253
over the Rainbow
Crystals! Or else!

196
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:18,987
No! Don't do it!
You've got to stay
away! Don't give
up the Crystals!

197
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,320
Sailor Moon!

198
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>Wait!</i>

199
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,153
Huh?

200
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:24,920
(gasp)

201
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,953
Well well well!
Look who's decided
to join us! You see
Kunzite, I knew we

202
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,953
would defeat these
losers in the end!

203
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:39,087
<i>Struggling only makes</i>
<i>the pain worse. You</i>
<i>should just give up.</i>

204
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,187
Don't listen to him!
No matter how hopeless
things may seem, you
must never give up!

205
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,387
Her again!
Come out, you!

206
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,653
(surprised gasps)

207
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,120
(gasp)

208
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,420
I know that voice!

209
00:19:58,353 --> 00:19:59,853
A Sailor Guardian?!

210
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:11,420
I am the fifth and
final Pretty Guardian
who fights for justice!

211
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:14,620
I am Sailor Venus!

212
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:21,320
Crescent
Beam!

213
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,853
(painful howls)

214
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:27,220
Kunzite, no!

215
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,953
The barrier's broken!
I can breathe again!

216
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:35,953
(gasp)

217
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:39,353
Wait a minute.
You're Sailor V
aren't you?!

218
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:40,020
(gasp)

219
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:40,820
(gasp)

220
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:41,553
(gasp)

221
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,620
That is correct! She's
Sailor V! Known as the
Guardian of Justice!

222
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:52,453
<i>But her true identity</i>
<i>is the Pretty Guardian,</i>

223
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,287
Sailor Venus!

224
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,187
Good to see
ya, Luna.

225
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,487
Artemis!

226
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:07,387
Stay back! Just
watch, I'll make
these pests pay for
hurting you, Kunzite!

227
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,020
Zoisite! Kunzite!
Cease operations
immediately!

228
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:13,587
(surprised gasp)

229
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,087
Queen Beryl?!

230
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,387
Retreat. There has
been a change in
our plans.

231
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:23,587
But, my Queen!

232
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,520
Silence! You'll
do as I say!

233
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,453
As you wish.

234
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,820
But we almost
had them.

235
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,353
So, you win for now
Guardians but we
shall return!

236
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,487
(gasp)

237
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,887
Tuxedo Mask!
Where are you?!

238
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,920
He's gone already.

239
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:47,853
Oh well, at least
we survived a
fight again.

240
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:03,053
The team is complete.
The five Guardians and
both of the cats are
finally here together.

241
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:07,053
Yeah, and we welcome
you Sailor Venus.

242
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,387
(giggles)

243
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,020
(realization gasp)

244
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,953
Wait a minute!
Could you be the
Moon Princess?!

245
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
(giggle)

246
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:17,046
Big trouble, Usagi!
Zoisite has gotten
hold of all seven
Rainbow Crystals!

247
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,046
<i>What? How?!</i>

248
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,213
It turns out
Mamoru had them!

249
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:24,179
<i>Why would he have</i>
<i>them?! Oh never mind,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter, we</i>
<i>have to go save him!</i>

250
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,413
No way! It's
obviously a trap!
It's too dangerous!

251
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:29,579
<i>But, what if</i>
<i>Mamoru is hurt?!</i>

252
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:35,513
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"The Shining Silver</i>
<i>Crystal: The Moon</i>
<i>Princess Appears."</i>

253
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:38,379
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
