<i>Yeah!</i>

141
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:42,466
So, anyway, Rei told
me she was going to
enter it, too! Doesn't
that make you so angry!

142
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,133
Not really, I don't
plan on getting married
anytime soon.

143

What?!

144

the point here! Wearing
a beautiful dress is

145

Anyway, you're really
good at home economics,
right? Can you just
teach me how to sew?

146
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,133
Well, sure, if you
really want me to.

basics, and only once
you have them down,

sew.

This would be the
perfect material to
use in making a wedding

to enter this contest!
You see?

00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:52,180

that you'd want to go
to Ms. Akiyama's house.

never been able to

else to do!

easy even for people who
know how to sew well.

180

just give up before

No, I haven't seen
her anywhere!

286
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,613
Thank you very much!

287
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:42,047
First of all!
Huh? What's going
on?!

288
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:52,980
Ms. Akiyama?!
Amazing!

289
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:55,680
(Emcee)
Hey! You can't
interrupt the show
like this!

290
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:57,347
Just shut up!

291
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,880
(Sighs)
Yes, of course!
Now I see it!
You truly are the

292
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,513
ideal bride!
Please, won't you
marry me?!

293
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:08,580
Silence! Do you
really think someone
as lowly as you is
worthy of me?!

294
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:12,747
The greatest men in
every nation around the
world should be bowing
down before me

295
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,913
and they will do so,
once word of my
unsurpassed beauty spreads
far and wide!

296
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:20,513
And not only the men,
but the women as well
will kneel before me!

297
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:21,680
(Scared)
Ahh!

298
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:26,480
(Sinister Laughing)

299
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:29,047

(Cont'd Laughing)

301
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,980
Usagi! Don't look
into her eyes!

302
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,613
Huh? Hey! What are
you doing under my
dress, you pervert!

303
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,713
Now is really not the
time for this!

304
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:42,013
Her energy has peaked!

305
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,413
Come forth!
My monster, widow!

306
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:58,547
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Ms. Akiyama!</i>

307

So you've revealed
yourself, monster!

308
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,113
Ha-ha!

309
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,613
(Usagi)
Why are these monsters
always so creepy!

310
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:06,513
Who the hell are you?

311
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:07,613
<i>(Rei and Ami)</i>
<i>Stop right there!</i>

312

<i>(Usagi Whining)</i>

314
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,880
A wedding dress is the
symbol of every girl's
dream!

315
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:19,013
And we'll never forgive
anyone who defiles that
white wedding dress!

316
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,980
Hey! No fair showing
off without me!

317
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:28,647
You! You're gonna pay
for ruining my chance
to win that lavish, all-
expense-paid reception!

318
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,013
Prepare to feel a
girl's wrath!

319
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:36,713
Moon Prism Power!
Make up!

(All)
We'll punish you!

327
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,947
We'll see about that,

Ah!

Idiot!

331

I'm going to weave you a
beautiful burial outfit made
from your lifeless body!

332
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,547
No! No! No!
Please!

333
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,313

you?!
Ahh!

whoever catches the
bouquet is supposed to
