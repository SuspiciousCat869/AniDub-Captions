1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,433
The ski resort is having
a contest and the girl
with the right athletic
ability and elegance

2
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:06,466
earns the title "Moon
Princess?" Cool! But
how will I have a
chance to win if I'm

3
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,000
trapped in the freezing
snow?! Either way, I'd
better get out of here
before I catch a cold!

4
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,533
I am Sailor Moon!

5
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,466
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish you.

6
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:26,533
<i>"The Snow, the Mountains,</i>
<i>Friendship and Monsters."</i>

7
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,266
Hey! Let's go up to
the snow! C'mon!
I'll be fun!

8
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,900
And it says right here
that this weekend,
they're having this
great Moon Princess

9
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,900
contest up at
the ski resort!

10
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,600
That seems like an
odd coincidence.

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah it's perfect! A
contest like this one
is tailor-made for me
to win, don't you think?

12
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:44,966
<i>Let me see!</i>

13
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,033
Wow! So the contest
winner gets to be
crowned Moon Princess
at night, in front of

14
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,800
a big crowd of
people?!

15
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
(happy sigh)

16
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,900
Mmm. I can already
see myself there!

17
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,700
So is that
a yes?!

18
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm good with all of
this, but I'm wondering
what Luna and Artemis
will think about it.

19
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,500
There's no need to
worry about that,
I'll just tell them
we're all going up

20
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,866
to the mountains
to do some serious
training!

21
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,766
I'm kinda surprised
you'd actually suggest
telling them that.

22
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,433
Why? It's the truth.

23
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:24,533
It's more like
stretching the
truth, but I'm sure
they'll believe it

24
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,933
coming from you.

25
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,966
Great! That means
all of us can go!

26
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:31,766
But how're we gonna
find a hotel vacancy
on such short notice?

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,966
I think I could
help you out with
that, Rei!

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,400
<i>Yuichiro?!</i>

29
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:38,966
My folks own a place
up there that's big
enough for all of
you to stay!

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Whoa! We would so
appreciate that!

31
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:43,300
Sure!

32
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,133
Well then it's all
set! I'll take this
weekend off and then
I'll just-

33
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,833
Hold on! So does
that mean that you're
coming too?

34
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh, is that
a problem?

35
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,833
No, that'll be
fine. Right, Rei?
Like they say, you
never know when you

36
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,200
might meet
your destiny.

37
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,166
(awkward laugh)

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,366
You mean, "By chance,
a meeting could be
your destiny." Right?

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,066
I'm not sure either
of those quotes would
really apply in this
case.

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,556
(annoyed groan)

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,633
(nervous sigh)

42
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,300
(evil chuckle)

43
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,466
I know that they'll
fall for this. Because
these girls are quite
predictable.

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Are you sure?

45
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,133
Hm?

46
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,033
I think you might
be underestimating
these Sailor Guardians.

47
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,333
What?!

48
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,700
Perhaps that's the
reason all of your
previous attempts
have failed, you

49
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,666
tend to regard your
enemy's abilities
too lightly.

50
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,366
(annoyed growl)

51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,866
<i>Know thy enemy,</i>
<i>know thy self.</i>

52
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,700
I believe that that
is the first rule of
battle, isn't that
right?

53
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:49,000
Just what I expected
you to say. After all
Endymion, you've been
helping Sailor Moon

54
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,066
for so long...

55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,433
I'm sure you know
everything about
those Guardians.

56
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,000
But, I know
them too!

57
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,766
I will do whatever
is required to
defeat everyone of
those girls.

58
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,633
For you, Zoisite.

59
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:11,366
Hm...

60
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,733
Wow! How pretty!

61
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,833
I can't believe
we're actually
here.

62
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,733
I feel bad leaving
Luna and Artemis
behind.

63
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:29,833
They'll be fine,
besides I'm sure they'd
rather be curled up
somewhere warm.

64
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:37,300
There's nothing like
relaxing on a nice
warm kotatsu, right
Artemis?

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,900
Huh?

66
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,766
<i>Aww. He looks so</i>
<i>peaceful there.</i>

67
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:48,300
Why would anyone want
to pass up being here
to go train in the
freezing cold? Well,

68
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,166
good for them.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,666
<i>Whoa!</i>

70
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,200
My parents are at our
Swiss chalet right now.
So please, make yourselves
right at home.

71
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,300
This place
is so huge.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,066
Say...Since you're
so filthy rich! Uh- I
mean so well-to-do,

73
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,766
<i>Why are you wasting</i>
<i>your time training</i>
<i>at our shrine?</i>

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,066
I train so I can
become a better
person.

75
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,566
Oh, uh, right!

76
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,333
Become a better person
my butt. He just wants
to spend all day smelling
your hair.

77
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,100
Please go away!

78
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,200
(embarrassed laugh)

79
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,333
Well, why are we
just sitting here?
Let's go skiing!

80
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,733
Yeah!

81
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,900
<i>Wow! Oh wow! Look</i>
<i>at all this snow!</i>
<i>This is so awesome!</i>

82
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,900
This is perfect
weather for skiing!

83
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,033
That's for sure!

84
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,933
Wait a sec, where'd
Rei and Yuichiro go
anyway?

85
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:56,566
This area's flat as
a pancake. Let's all
go further up the
mountain, okay?

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,566
Uh! No thank,
I'll pass.

87
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
Maybe you'd better
go on ahead with
Yuichiro.

88
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,833
We'll be over at
the beginners'
slope practicing.

89
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:05,133
Yeah, we'll
be fine!

90
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,633
Hold on, Usagi.
Weren't you planning
on getting in on the
Moon Princess Contest?

91
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,266
That's being held
way up there on
the mountain. Up
at the top.

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,966
Huh?

93
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>What?!</i>

94
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:20,600
Besides being good
looking, you also
need to be a good
skier or you won't

95
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,000
have a chance of
being named the
Moon Princess.

96
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:24,900
Are you kidding?

97
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,633
What'll you
now? Drop out?

98
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,233
You know it's alright
if you quit, then I'll
be crowned Moon Princess!

99
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,066
Hey wait! I'll go!

100
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:38,033
After all, the real
Moon Princess should
win this thing!

101
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,066
<i>Do you see anyone</i>
<i>that might be her?</i>

102
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,633
No. Not yet.

103
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:55,100
Give it time. With
the monster power that
I've endowed upon you,
you should have no

104
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,933
trouble uncovering
Sailor Moon's true
identity.

105
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,266
<i>Go on. Get to work.</i>

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,866
Leave it to me,
Master Kunzite.

107
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,200
(evil chuckle)

108
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,933
Lo-Lo-look at that.

109
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,933
I-I sure hope this
isn't where I'm
s'posed to try
to ski...

110
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,966
Nah, this is nothing
compared to how steep
it is up at the top.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,633
Huh! Ugh...

112
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,100
(pageant chatter)

113
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,200
<i>All of these</i>
<i>ladies must be</i>
<i>crazy!</i>

114
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:37,900
Welcome to all you lady
contestants! The Fourth
Annual Moon Princess
Contest will begin in

115
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,400
just a moment!

116
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:43,133
Tonight, our very
first princess is
here to help guide
you down the course.

117
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:47,900
Moonlight Slope's very
own ski instructor,
Miss Saeko Yamamoto!

118
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,933
And now here are
the contest rules.

119
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:56,066
Whichever of you
deemed by the judges
to be the fastest and
most graceful skier to

120
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,066
cross the finish line
of the Moonlight Course
will be crowned Moon
Princess.

121
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,933
Even though you'll be
racing in the dark,
the course is quite well
lit-so there's no danger.

122
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,633
(scared gulp)

123
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,066
Ready, set, start!

124
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,466
(scared whimper)

125
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Wahh! Okay, that's
it! I quit!

126
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,366
Usagi, you can't fall
this far behind in
the race!

127
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:44,733
Ahhhh!

128
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,466
(screaming)

129
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,033
That's the way
to ski, Usagi!
You can do it
if you try!

130
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,966
(giggling)

131
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,800
(evil chuckle)

132
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:10,500
This ski course will
be their one way
ticket to hell. Hah!

133
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,466
Huh?

134
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,566
(leaping grunt)

135
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,000
(falling screams)

136
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,766
I thought I sensed an
evil aura just now!

137
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,566
Can't be! There's
no way a monster
would ever be up
here!

138
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,333
Ahh!

139
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,866
Huh?! Usagi!

140
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,300
Wahh! I can't
slow down!

141
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,633
(scared screaming)

142
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,366
Not bad, Usagi! But I'm
the one who's gonna
win this race!

143
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,566
(panic scream)

144
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,500
(screaming)

145
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:55,800
Hmm. Well it looks like
one of those two skiers
is the real Moon Princess,
Sailor Moon.

146
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:58,533
(screaming)

147
00:10:58,566 --> 00:10:59,300
Hmph!

148
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,266
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

149
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,433
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

150
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,142
Usagi! You've got to
slow down or you're
gonna get hurt!

151
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:31,975
Ahh! If I could I
would've done that
by now!

152
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,609
How are you supposed
to stop these things?!

153
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,042
Hah!

154
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:39,875
(panic scream)

155
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,209
(gasp)

156
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:45,842
Uh-Usagi! Start
skiing a lot faster.

157
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:49,142
But Rei! I've got no
control at all here!

158
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:57,942
Wait, that sure sounded
like an avalanche! That
must mean Rei's in trouble!

159
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,942
(panic scream)

160
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:01,542
Just keep going!

161
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,875
Time to get
serious! Hah!

162
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,842
Blizzar!

163
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,342
What's happening?!

164
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,075
Mommy!

165
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,909
Hey Rei! It's
me, Yuichiro!

166
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,942
Don't you worry
Rei! I'll save you!

167
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:47,375
You shall not pass!

168
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:50,809
I could swear I
just heard a
voice back there!

169
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:57,175
Very impressive,
princess! Now let's
see if you can escape
this!

170
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:02,775
Bliz! Bliz!
Bliz! Bliz!

171
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:08,375
(screaming)

172
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:11,209
I gotcha!

173
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:15,009
Huh?

174
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,909
What should we do?

175
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,875
<i>There's something</i>
<i>weird going on here.</i>
<i>Could this be the</i>
<i>work of a monster?</i>

176
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,409
(struggling grunts)

177
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:40,475
Uh, Rei. Are
you all right?

178
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,309
No! Not

179
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:46,942
exactly! Now come
on! We need to climb
up this snowbank and
get out of here!

180
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:50,042
(struggling grunt)

181
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:57,209
That's not working.
Why don't we just
wait here for someone
to rescue us?

182
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:01,142
What if no one shows
up until after we've
been turned into
ski-sicles?!

183
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,809
You've got to
suck it up and
tough it out!

184
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,942
Hm?

185
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,509
Aww, I bet by now
someone else has
been crowned as
Moon Princess.

186
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:13,809
Probably. Thanks to
me saving a certain
someone, I missed
my chance!

187
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:14,709
Sorry...

188
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,909
Tuxedo Mask...

189
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:28,275
Oh, I'm sorry
Rei, I...

190
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,375
That used to be
Tuxedo Mask's right?

191
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,442
Uh-huh...

192
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,309
When I'm sad and I
listen to it, it
kinda helps to take
away my sadness.

193
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,042
Hmm...

194
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:49,909
Sorry! I didn't mean
to brag or anything.
I was just trying to
keep things positive.

195
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,009
Y'know trying to
change the mood
here...

196
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:55,075
I hope I didn't
hurt your feelings
by bringing him up.

197
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,275
There's no reason to
think that. It really
doesn't bother me
anymore.

198
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,109
Oh, but I thought.

199
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:06,075
Really, I'm totally
fine with the fact
that Mamoru. I mean
Tuxedo Mask, isn't

200
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:07,475
going to be my guy.

201
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,042
I mean let's face
it, he went and
risked his life to
save your life.

202
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,342
That proves he
really likes you!

203
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,875
Oh Rei...

204
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,842
But now hear me out
Usagi, if you don't
have a life filled
with happiness with

205
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,175
Mamoru. Count on
this, I'll punish
you!

206
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:24,942
(acknowledge laugh)

207
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:29,042
But speaking of
punishment, first
we've got to defeat
those Dark Kingdom

208
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,875
guys and bring
peace to the
world.

209
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,875
Yeah, you're right.
Whoa! That's right!

210
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,609
What was that about?

211
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:39,809
I just figured out that
with your Fire Soul, we
could probably get out
of here right now!

212
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:43,342
Whoa! That's right!
Hey, why didn't you
think of that sooner!
When it comes to

213
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,909
coming up with ideas
there's just no hope
for you!

214
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,709
I just came
up with one!

215
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:51,309
Okay you're right.
Let's transform!
Mars Power!

216
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,809
<i>Is that you Rei?!</i>

217
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:53,609
Huh?

218
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,375
It is you! Thank
goodness, you're
alive!

219
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,442
Oh, uh, Yuichiro!

220
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:01,042
This has gotta be
a miracle of love!

221
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:04,142
This is a safe way
out! C'mon, let's
go ladies!

222
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,309
Not so fast!

223
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,009
Wha?!

224
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:11,675
It's Miss Yamamoto?!

225
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,842
Ha ha ha! I
am Blizzar.

226
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,775
And I've been ordered
to eliminate Sailor
Moon!

227
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,109
I'm sure this is
the Dark Kingdom
at work!

228
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:23,175
They must've turned
her into a monster!

229
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:26,342
Now, Sailor Moon!
Prepare to die!

230
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,675
Whu-huh-wha?
You mean me?!

231
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,209
With your looks,
athletic ability
and your elegance,

232
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,009
<i>you must be the</i>
<i>real Moon Princess!</i>

233
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,309
Oh, so you think
that too, huh?

234
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,175
You're awfully
honest for a
monster.

235
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,175
What?! No way, y'mean
you really are Sailor
Moon?!

236
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,875
You've got it
all wrong!

237
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:49,542
Silence! My judgment
has never been wrong!

238
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,109
Blizzar!

239
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,275
I will protect Rei!

240
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:57,042
(shivering)

241
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,275
Uhhhh...

242
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,842
Poor Yuichiro!

243
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,342
Forget about him!
Now's our chance!
Transform!

244
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,109
You're even colder
than the snow is, Rei.

245
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:09,575
Hurry up and do it!

246
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,009
Okay! Moon
Prism Power

247
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,775
Make Up!

248
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:33,809
Mars Power
Make Up!

249
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:56,642
I don't believe this!
So you're both Sailor
Guardians?!

250
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:04,109
We can't forgive you
for trapping us in
this ice! Don't you
know that it's really

251
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:06,975
not good for young
ladies to let their
tummies get cold!

252
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:11,509
How dare you freeze
my Yuichiro into a
statue! You're gonna
pay for what you've

253
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,875
done, Monster!

254
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,009
Hmph!

255
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:18,175
In the name of
the Moon. I'll
punish you!

256
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:21,975
In the name
of Mars, I'll
chastise you!

257
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,442
Enough of your talk!

258
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,109
Blizzar!

259
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,675
(panic screams)

260
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,609
Fire!

261
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,575
Soul!

262
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:41,042
Time to finish you!

263
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:42,875
Huh?

264
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,742
Oh my god!
Tuxedo Mask!

265
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,042
Good evening,
Pretty Guardians.
Nice to see you.

266
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,442
Endymion?!

267
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,842
I'll handle these
girls once and
for all.

268
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,042
Blizzar, stand
aside and watch.

269
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,809
Prepare to die,
Sailor Moon!

270
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,009
(scared squeals)

271
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,209
Ahhh!

272
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:09,409
I won't miss
next time.

273
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,975
So what now?

274
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:19,075
Tuxedo Mask! Have
you really forgotten
who we are?!

275
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,775
You used to be on
our side, remember?

276
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,109
You've always fought
to protect Sailor
Moon! Because you
loved her so much!

277
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:28,442
He can't remember.

278
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,975
I'm begging you,
try to think back
to that time!

279
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:42,542
Huh?

280
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:43,909
Blizzar!

281
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:44,642
(gasps)

282
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:46,742
(evil laugh)

283
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:49,475
Huh?

284
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,642
Why'd you stop
me, Endymion?!

285
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,575
Sailor Moon!
Now's your
chance!

286
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:02,509
Right!

287
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,609
Moon Healing
Escalation!

288
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,175
(painful screams)

289
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,475
Refresh!

290
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:41,525
Hunh! My time is too
valuable to defeat you
fools right now! So,
farewell ladies.

291
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:43,758
We will meet again...

292
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:56,225
<i>Tuxedo Mask, I will</i>
<i>find a way to get</i>
<i>you back, I promise.</i>

293
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:01,625
You're such an
idiot, Yuichiro.
Always risking your
life to save me.

294
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:03,058
(chuckle)

295
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:04,992
Thank you.

296
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,192
Whu-huh?!

297
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:15,225
What am I doing here?

298
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,158
You finally woke up!

299
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,258
Oh thank goodness!
You're safe Rei!

300
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:35,992
Yeah. After you got hit
the Pretty Guardians showed
up and they rescued everyone
of us!

301
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:40,125
Oh I see, well I'm
sorry I wasn't up to
the job, but I did try.

302
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:44,292
Hey! What are you
talking about! You
acted so cool and
brave back there!

303
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:46,025
Huh?!

304
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:47,692
Didn't he, Rei?

305
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:48,592
(chuckle)

306
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,292
Yeah, you did!

307
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:53,492
Well I'm glad
to hear that!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

308
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,958
(laughing)

309
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,425
<i>There you are!</i>
<i>Where have you</i>
<i>all been?!</i>

310
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,992
You know we've been
worried sick about
you guys!

311
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:05,358
I'm just glad you're
safe! If it ends well,
all's well!

312
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:09,225
Uh, shouldn't that
be, "All's well that
ends well", Minako?

313
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:10,592
Hmph!

314
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:15,392
I had an awful time.
Usagi's such a klutz.
She almost got us
all killed.

315
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:20,392
What?! Aw, c'mon we
had fun! We had a chat
that strengthened our
friendship! Right?

316
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,592
Me? A fried of
yours?! We pigs
fly!

317
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:30,492
Wahh! Stop being
so mean, Rei!

318
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:13,992
The skating rink, where
people zoom around like
rays of light!

319
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,992
<i>You're not doing much</i>
<i>zooming on your butt.</i>

320
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:17,958
Such elegant
skating costumes!

321
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:20,358
<i>A fancy costume won't</i>
<i>make you a good skater.</i>

322
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,425
My performance has
you enchanted!

323
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,425
<i>I'm just waiting</i>
<i>to see wipe out.</i>

324
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,758
That's enough from
you! Leave me alone!

325
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:32,992
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Paired with a Monster:</i>
<i>Mako the Ice Skating Queen."</i>

326
00:24:33,825 --> 00:24:36,392
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
