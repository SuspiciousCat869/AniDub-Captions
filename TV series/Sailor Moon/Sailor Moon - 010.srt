00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,833
<i>This is unforgivable!</i>
<i>Completely unforgivable!</i>
<i>I'd never let anyone</i>
<i>get away with kidnapping</i>

2
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:06,033
(cont'd)
<i>young girls who dream</i>
<i>of finding love!</i>

3
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:11,133
<i>But until the day</i>
<i>when every family is</i>
<i>safe and love is a</i>
<i>universal truth...</i>

4
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:15,933
<i>I am Sailor Moon,</i>
<i>and in the name</i>
<i>of the moon, I'll</i>
<i>punish you!</i>

5
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,400
<i>Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino,</i>
<i>and I'm a fourteen</i>
<i>year-old middle school</i>
<i>student.</i>

6
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,766
<i>I'm a bit of</i>
<i>a klutz...</i>

7
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,733
<i>And some people</i>
<i>might say I'm a</i>
<i>little emotional.</i>

8
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,733
<i>So, one day, this</i>
<i>strange cat named</i>
<i>Luna gave me a</i>
<i>special brooch</i>

9
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:36,766
<i>that transformed me</i>
<i>into a guardian in</i>
<i>a sailor uniform...</i>

10
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,100
<i>... and told me</i>
<i>I had to fight bad</i>
<i>guys!</i>

11
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,066
<i>Boy, does that ever</i>
<i>make me nervous!</i>

12
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:46,866
<i>But I'm sure it'll</i>
<i>all work out fine!</i>
<i>(Giggles)</i>

13
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:56,766
<i>The Cursed Bus:</i>
<i>Enter Mars, The</i>
<i>Guardian of Fire.</i>

14
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:01,300
(Queen Beryl)
<i>If these Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians find the</i>
<i>Legendary Silver</i>

15
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,166
(cont'd)
<i>Crystal before we do,</i>
<i>then they could</i>
<i>cause us some very</i>

16
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,300
(cont'd)
<i>serious problems.</i>

17
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:12,166
We, the Dark Kingdom,
must be first to
acquire the crystal.

18
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,000
We will show no
mercy to anyone who
stands in our way.

19
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:19,900
Are you here to
tell me you still
haven't located it?

20
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,133
I'm afraid so,
Queen Beryl.

21
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,033
You have failed
several times
already, Jadeite.

22
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:29,066
But I will give
you a chance to
redeem yourself.
Go collect more

23
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,933
human energy for
our great ruler
and then eliminate

24
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,966
those two
troublesome
guardians.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
Yes.

26
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,633
(Police Sirens)

27
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,200
Huh?

28
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,166
Huh?

29
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,866
(Police Sirens)

30
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,200
I wonder what
happened...
(Gasp)

31
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,766
Ami!

32
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,033
Oh! Usagi!

33
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,200
(Giggle)
Hi, Luna!
(Luna)
<i>Ami!</i>

34
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,666
Are you waiting
for the bus?

35
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,466
Yeah, I'm on
my way to cram
school.

36
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Wait, you seriously
have to travel so far
that you need to take
a bus to get there?!

37
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:01,866
It's nothing. I'd
take a plane if it
meant going to a
good cram school!

38
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,600
And besides, now
that I'm a Guardian,
I need to study and
acquire as much

39
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:09,066
knowledge as I
possibly can so that
I can help Luna find the
missing moon princess.

40
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,733
Yes, that's right,
Ami! You're so
admirable! Unlike
someone else I know...

41
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,233
Ha ha ha!
Where is that
bus?!

42
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,166
(All)
Huh?

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,133
(Police Sirens)

44
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,900
Another police
car?

45
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,233
(Naru)
Hey,girls!

46
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,900
(Kuri)
Have you two
heard what happened
on this bus route?

47
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,500
(Usagai & Ami)
What?!

48
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,833
Yesterday evening
a little after six
p.m., a bus that
was full of passengers

49
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,600
just drove off and
then disappeared!

50
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,866
Wow! Really? That
sounds pretty cool!

51
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
No, it's not.
It's really
serious!

52
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:37,700
Do you guys know
the bus stop down
the road called
Sendai-Zaka-Ue?

53
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,733
Yeah! It's where
the five streets
meet, isn't it?

54
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,133
That's right.

55
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,600
Apparently nearly
fifty people got
on the bus there
yesterday and

56
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,833
no one's seen
them or the bus
since!

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,766
At first, the police
tried to keep it
secret because they
thought it might

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,466
be a mass kidnapping
or something.

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,600
But no demands were
made, so they made
it public and opened
up an investigation.

60
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,666
The cursed six
o'clock bus...

61
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,100
(Gasp)

62
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,700
Scary, right?

63
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,966
You know, there's
a Hikawa Shrine
right near Sendai-
Zaka, and the amulets

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,900
from there are known
for warding off evil.

65
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,900
So what do you say
we go down there and
get some?

66
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,433
Wait, I know that
place!

67
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:13,100
They say the Shrine
Maiden there has
strong spiritual
powers and can even

68
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,066
predict the future!

69
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,533
Oh, then we can
get our fortunes
told too!

70
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,733
Well let's head
over there!

71
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:20,566
Usagi, do you think
you could pick me
up an amulet?

72
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
Yeah, but why don't
you come with us?

73
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,666
Sorry, but I really
have to study today.
There's an important
practice test coming

74
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,033
up that I can't
miss. You know what
it's like when you
have to hit the books.

75
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:42,200
Please, please,
please, let him
notice that I
like him!

76
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,466
(Girls)
<i>I can't believe I</i>
<i>did that. Guys!</i>
<i>Seriously!...</i>

77
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>(Chuckle)</i>
<i>Go on, wish for even</i>
<i>more love!</i>

78
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:52,600
<i>Fill your hearts</i>
<i>with romantic energy!</i>

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,433
<i>It's coming...</i>

80
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:05,166
<i>Something sinister</i>
<i>is growing closer...</i>

81
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,566
<i>(Grandpa Hino)</i>
<i>Hi, there! What</i>
<i>a bunch of cuties!</i>

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,633
Any of you interested
in working here?

83
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,233
Huh??

84
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,900
sorry, but we just
came here to buy
some of those love
amulets that you sell.

85
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:23,633
Hahuh ha!
Why, of course!
I was only kidding
you! Ha ha

86
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:28,000
It's five thirty.
You're just in time!
So, as usual, I'll
recite a special

87
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,566
prayer in order
to bring true love
into your life!

88
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:36,500
Here me, oh spirit
flame! Listen to me
proclaim! May their
hearts come ablaze

89
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,400
(cont'd)
with true love always!
Let joy in them imbued,
and may their wishes

90
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,866
(cont'd)
come true!

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,666
(Sigh)
There.

92
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:47,033
I'm guessing that
you girls have
come a long way.

93
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,866
But, before you leave,
you should draw a
fortune slip!

94
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,633
We sell ema plaques
for passing exams,
as well! Maybe you
should buy a couple!

95
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,366
Thanks for your
concern, but we
don't need that.
(Giggles)

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,433
(Giggles)
Weird!

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,433
Here's another
group of cuties!

98
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,800
(All)
Huh?

99
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,033
Would any of you
like to work part
time here as Shrine
Maidens!

100
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,533
(All)
Uhh...

101
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,566
(Rei)
Grandpa!

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,733
Just stop hitting
on everyone,
would you?!

103
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:18,133
Oh!
Hi, Rei!

104
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,800
You know, people
around here are
starting to say
very unflattering

105
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,966
things about you!
(Chuckle)

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Ahh! She's so
cool! And pretty!

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,433
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>So she's a shrine</i>
<i>maiden! I wouldn't</i>
<i>mind doing that</i>

108
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,566
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>part time!</i>
<i>(Giggles)</i>

109
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,566
<i>(Girls)</i>
<i>What fun!</i>
<i>(Giggles)</i>

110
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,666
I sense an evil
aura! Is it a
spirit?!

111
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,666
(All)
Uhh...

112
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,033
Trying to make
trouble at our
shrine, huh?

113
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,333
Forget it!
I won't let you!

114
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,866
Evil spirit!
Be exorcized!

115
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,833
(Gasps)

116
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,800
Usagi!

117
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,533
That isn't what
I expected to
happen.

118
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:12,400
(Jadeite)
Ms. Rei, I
brought some hand
towels and water.

119
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,533
Thanks. You can
leave them right
there.

120
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,300
Sure.

121
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,566
<i>Wait, that man</i>
<i>looks familiar...</i>

122
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,900
What a hunk!
(Meow!)

123
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,366
what! Huh! Where'd
he go?! Huh?!

124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,733
<i>Well, that sure</i>
<i>was a quick</i>
<i>recovery!</i>

125
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,900
Is that guy
your older brother?

126
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:32,433
What?! Oh, no!
Ugh, this is all
Grandpa's fault!

127
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,966
(Laughs)

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,633
<i>(Rei)</i>
<i>He's so overly</i>
<i>friendly with</i>
<i>everyone!</i>

129
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,533
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>He tries to make</i>
<i>friends with every</i>
<i>person who comes</i>

130
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,900
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>to visit the</i>
<i>shrine.</i>

131
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,733
Grandpa hired that
guy and now he's
actually living here
with us!

132
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:45,633
Uhh..
You're grandpa is
interesting...

133
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,666
Listen, Usagai,
I'm very sorry
for what happened
earlier.

134
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,333
It's no big
deal! I mean
uhh--

135
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,500
Things have been
really weird
lately.

136
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:57,366
For one, my sixth
sense and prophesies
used to be spot on,
but not anymore.

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,166
Huh?!

138
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,900
<i>Prophesies? Wait,</i>
<i>could this girl</i>
<i>be the princess</i>
<i>that we've been</i>

139
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:03,600
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>looking for?</i>

140
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,633
Huh?

141
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,700
You there!
Where's the person
in charge here!

142
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:10,366
My daughter came
here to buy one
of your amulets,
and she still hasn't

143
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,533
come back home!
I know your head
priest always has
a special prayer at

144
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:18,900
five thirty! You're
purposely sending
people onto that
cursed six o'clock bus!

145
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,233
Don't make wild
accusations!

146
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,733
Look, that ceremony's
been going on for a
long time! And the

147
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:26,566
police already
questioned us about
the bus's disappearance!

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,566
(cont'd)
If you want to file
a missing persons
report, talk to them!

149
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,300
My Grandfather has
nothing to do with
this! Now get out of
here!

involved, I can feel
it. Call Ami. We need
to have a strategy

154
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:45,333
(cont'd)
meeting.

155
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,433
But Ami's busy!

156
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,900
A whole lot of
people have gone
missing! Just call

157
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,400
her and tell
her to get here
quickly!

158

All right,

Yeah.

161
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,700

<i>Shine...</i>

164
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,400
(Usagi)
<i>I bet they went over</i>
<i>there</i> 'cause they're all
in love with someone!

165
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:19,466
They should be busy
with high school
entrance exams!
Where do they

166
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,266
find the time
for all this?
Jeez.

167
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,900
But, don't you
want to fall in
love, too, Ami?

168
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:27,300
It's wonderful!
(Chuckle)

169
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,800
Usagi, both of us
are too young to
understand what love
truly is!

170
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,233
I really don't think
you should spend so
much energy on these
fantasies.

171
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,633
Oh, look!

172

<i>(Ami)</i>
<i>You're right...</i>

175

Okay, Usagi, get
on, quick!

176
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,133
But, uh...

177
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,400
Go on, go!

178
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:15,200
No! No way!

179
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,366
Come on!

180
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,633
I don't wanna!

181

And now, I
really don't!

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,833
Don't be like that,
Usagi. We have to
get on with the
others to investigate!

183
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:26,133
Be brave!

184
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,666
I can't!

185
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,133
I'm way to scared!
(Crying)

186

Oh no, it left!

187
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:40,233

Come on, Usagi!
You can't be
such a chicken!

188
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,466
I know! But
I-I-
(Crying)

189
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,733
Nothing we can do
now. We'll just have
to come back tomorrow.

190
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:47,700
I guess so...

191
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,166

No way!

195
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:13,700
Could it be a
black hole? A
fourth-dimensional
rift?

196
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,400
Or a tear in the
magnetic field?
What is happening
here?!

197
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:31,700
(Deep chuckle)
Master Jadeite,
today's operation
was a big success.

Can I help you?

206
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,533
Yesterday's six
o'clock bus
disappeared, too!
I saw it with my

207
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,966
own eyes!

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,700
And you think my

just like everyone
else does?!

Huh?!

coming to question
us, and I'm sick
and tired of it!

211
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:32,300
You've got the
wrong idea, Rei!
I was just wondering
if you knew anything

212
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,200
that might help
us understand what
happened!

213
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,666
I don't!

214
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,266
I'm sorry if I'm
making you upset!
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

215
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,033
I just wanted
to be friends

Look, I don't care.
Just go.

Uh, okay. I'll
just come back
later. Bye!

218

What nerve! Who
does she think
she's kidding?!

219
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,733
I wonder if she
accidentally dropped
this...

I just wanna confirm
something that I've
been wondering about.

You wanna confirm
something?
Like what?

I'll explain it
later.

239
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:58,066
What's important right
now is that you get
on that six o'clock
bus today!

Yeah I know, but,

Where am I?!

288
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,033
Usagi, just
calm down!

289
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:38,166
How can I?!
Look where we

Usagi, you have
to transform into
Sailor Moon!

294
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,766
(Crying)
I'm so sick of
all this!

295
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,066
But I'll do it!

296
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes! Your carefree
spirit and optimism
are your true
strengths!

I am Sailor Moon!

300
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:50,233
It's about time!
I've been expecting
you, guardian!

301
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,633
That mark!
Look!

302
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,333
Let Rei go! And
everyone else, too!
I won't let you
keep them trapped

303
00:18:57,366 --> 00:19:01,300
here! So now, in
the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

Moon Tiara!

Action!

Ha! Your toy
can't defeat me!

307
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,400
But you fell
for my trick!

308
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,166
What?!

309
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,400
Rei, you aren't
hurt, are you?

310
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,300
No, I'm okay.

311
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,366
Rei, take out the
transformation pen!

312
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Hold on!
Did that cat just
speak to me?!

313
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,733
I'll explain it
all later. Just
trust me.

314
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,166
Hurry up and take
out the pen that
you picked up earlier!

315
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,066
Uh.. this?

316
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,400

Now hold that pen
and call out, "Mars

Hurry up!

320

I don't have a
clue what's happening,

it! She's also
a guardian?!

What is this?!
What's happened
to me?

AHH!

325
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:22,833
I don't know what's
going on, but you'll
pay for your evil
deeds, monster!

No idea!

Is Ami doing
that?!

341
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:15,866
I'm not sure, but
it's possible. She

show us the way

right!

Quickly, run toward
the point where that
light is coming from!

Hey there!
You girls need
a ride?

Wow, he's
really cool!

you're falling for
Tuxedo Mask!

ridiculous! I only
wanted to thank him

besides, you're the
one who has feelings

Isn't that right?

369

Wake up, honey.
Sometimes those
feelings are only
one-sided.

370

What's "one-
sided" mean?
