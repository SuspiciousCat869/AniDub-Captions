1
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:01,686
Minako's boyfriend is
a handsome chap from
London. But what's
this?! A pretty lady

2
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,186
named Katarina likes
him too! It's a love
triangle! How awful!
Those Dark Kingdom

3
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,286
creeps are trying to
break the heart of a
young girl that's in
love. But I won't

4
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,486
stand by and let
that happen! I
am Sailor Moon!

5
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:16,053
In the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

6
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:26,386
<i>"Sailor Venus's Past:</i>
<i>Minako's Tragic Love"</i>

7
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,020
Hmm, let's see...

8
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:41,753
Nothing here...

9
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,986
Not here either.

10
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,220
(sigh)

11
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,020
I wonder if...

12
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:49,220
Huh?

13
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,186
Sorry we're a
little late!

14
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
(whining)

15
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm worn out!

16
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,120
So how'd it go?

17
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:59,353
Not one of the dumpling
places we checked out

18
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:02,386
<i>had anything like an</i>
<i>entrance coming from</i>
<i>the Dark Kingdom.</i>

19
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,586
Too bad. We've had
no luck either.

20
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,053
Somehow they continue
to keep sending Monsters
here one after another
from the Dark Kingdom.

21
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,253
There has to be an
entrance or portal
somewhere.

22
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:14,286
How'd things go
for you, Rei?

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,153
I've had no
hits at all.

24
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:19,720
We haven't found
anything that leads
to their lair.

25
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:21,586
I guess that
leaves Minako.

26
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,986
<i>I'm so tired!</i>

27
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,020
Usagi! Everyone here's
doing their best to help
out. Just suck it up!

28
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:30,286
I'm also starving!
When do we eat?!

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,186
Wait, didn't you
just eat a big meal
at the dumpling shop?

30
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,320
The three plates of
sweet dumplings and
two bowls of anmitsu
jelly were tasty!

31
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:41,020
But that was just
a snack! I'm hungry
again!

32
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,186
<i>Hey everyone,</i>
<i>we're back!</i>

33
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,320
How'd it go?

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,953
Not so great. We checked
every bathhouse in Tokyo,
but not one of them panned
out.

35
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,953
Well, thanks
anyway.

36
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:54,653
In that case, I
guess we'll call
it a night.

37
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:55,920
Sounds good.

38
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,620
I could use
some sleep.

39
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,453
Oh my gosh!
What's that?!

40
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:06,553
It can't be!

41
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,286
This has happened before!

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,053
Whaddya mean
before?

43
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:16,653
Those dark spots are
moving in the exact same
way they moved eons ago,
when the Moon Kingdom

44
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:18,120
was destroyed!

45
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:19,253
What?!

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:28,586
Once those dark spots
cover the entire sun,
then I will awaken
from my eternal sleep.

47
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,520
And that time
rapidly approaches.

48
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:42,486
All that's left is to
retrieve the Silver
Crystal, then at last
the world will be ours.

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,086
Good news. We will
have the Silver
Crystal shortly.

50
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,253
What?

51
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,553
I have found someone
who knows Sailor V's
human identity.

52
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,286
You have?

53
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:57,453
Yes, she is a police
officer in England who
works with Interpol.
What's even better is

54
00:04:57,486 --> 00:05:01,386
this woman once thought
of Sailor V as if she
were her little sister.

55
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,320
That's good.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,553
Now find a way to use
Sailor V's connection
with the Sailor Guardians
to eliminate them all.

57
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:10,553
Yes.

58
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,186
That noise.
What's going
on?

59
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:32,486
I can feel it. This
man possesses the same
energy wavelengths as
I do. Endymion, you

60
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,953
shall become my
successor!

61
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,186
(painful grunts)

62
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:39,186
(scared gasp)

63
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,053
What's the matter?

64
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:46,386
It was Tuxedo
Mask again...

65
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,886
<i>So you had another</i>
<i>nightmare?</i>

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,053
<i>I feel for what</i>
<i>you're going</i>
<i>through.</i>

67
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:55,586
But if all you do is
worry, you'll wind up
sick. You need to make
sure that you're eating

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,220
and sleeping enough.

69
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:58,453
Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,920
Well at least I'm
pretty sure that I'm
eating enough.

71
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,420
Mmm, great, now
I don't have to
worry.

72
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:05,720
(giggle)

73
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,853
Seeing the moonlight
sure makes these
dumplings taste
delicious!

74
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,353
Now I'm happy!

75
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,353
Ahhh!

76
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,120
Sorry, Usagi!

77
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:19,786
(choking grunts)

78
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,886
So Artemis,
what's going on?

79
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,286
There's big trouble!
It's Minako, she's
disappeared!

80
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
(choking grunts)

81
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,286
A little
help here.

82
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,986
Maybe she went out
to try to find the
entryway to the
Dark Kingdom?

83
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,320
Waaatter!

84
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:35,986
If she had, we
would've gone
together.

85
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,153
Water!

86
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:39,153
Any idea where
she could've gone?

87
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:44,386
Just one. She got a
call from this woman
named Katarina. Maybe
that phone call had

88
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,353
something to do with
her disappearance.

89
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:50,953
Ahh! I finally
got it down!

90
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:52,720
Nice job.

91
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,953
<i>Minako...</i>

92
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:09,386
Or should I say,
Sailor V. I was so
happily surprised
when I heard that

93
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
you were alive.

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,386
Why didn't you call
me and let me know
you were okay?

95
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,253
(emotional grunt)

96
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,120
I was so proud when
I heard that you're
active as Sailor V.

97
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,853
Thank you.

98
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,053
Well I want to help
you. So then, you're
a member of the Sailor
Guardians?

99
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,386
I'd sure like to
meet them.

100
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:35,320
Katarina. How's
Alan doing?

101
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,220
Oh, he's doing fine.

102
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,886
See? We took
this recently.

103
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:47,986
(sad sigh)

104
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,120
I know Alan misses
you, too.

105
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,886
Oh Katarina, I see
you still wear that
necklace I gave you
so long ago.

106
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,320
Why of course, I
treasure it. It was
such a special birthday
gift. Anyway I really

107
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:08,020
do want to help you.
And I'd love to meet
the Sailor Guardians
as well.

108
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,186
Katarina, you're
like the big sister
I never had.

109
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,920
And I know meeting the
Guardians is something
you'd enjoy. But I don't

110
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:20,286
want to expose you to
that kind of danger!

111
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:24,020
I'm so glad I saw
you. I must go.

112
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,020
Goodbye Katarina!

113
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,953
<i>Minako wait!</i>

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,986
Come back!

115
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,686
Master Kunzite...

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,853
It doesn't appear
that pushing her
any further will
work.

117
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,820
Let's turn you into
the monster Papillon,
so you can attack her!

118
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:47,720
Ahh!

119
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,620
Hah!

120
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,586
Papillon!

121
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,086
Alan...

122
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:02,620
Minako...

123
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,686
Alan!

124
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,220
A butterfly
in winter?

125
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,853
<i>Damn!</i>

126
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:21,186
You have died once!
It would've been much
better if you had
stayed dead!

127
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:24,120
A monster!
All right!

128
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:28,886
Venus Power!
Make Up!

129
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:48,053
What?! Minako's
really Sailor
Venus?!

130
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:54,020
Crescent Beam!

131
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,786
That won't work!

132
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:00,586
Huh?!

133
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:05,253
I know everything
about your techniques,
Sailor Venus. Now have
a taste of mine!

134
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:09,720
Ahhhh!

135
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,586
<i>You see, I know</i>
<i>all your weaknesses!</i>

136
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,520
Ahhahh!

137
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:23,586
That necklace.
Katarina, is that
you? But why?

138
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,286
(painful screams)

139
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,720
Now tell me the
identity of the
other Guardians!

140
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,820
Please don't do
this, Katarina.

141
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:32,853
Sailor Venus!

142
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,153
(shocked gasp)

143
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,120
Oh no! That monster
seems really strong!

144
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:37,953
(angry growl)

145
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,753
Over there! We'll
use that boat to
escape!

146
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:44,520
<i>What?!</i>

147
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:47,620
What are you thinking,
Luna?! I don't have the
slightest clue about how
to drive a boat!

148
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:50,253
Then just turn
yourself into a
real sailor!

149
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:52,086
Oh! That's right!

150
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,253
Okay!

151
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,586
Moon Power! Turn me
into a cute, seafaring
sailor!

152
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,486
(attacking growls)

153
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,086
(struggling screams)

154
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:26,153
Now's our chance!
Let's get out of
here!

155
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:26,920
Hm!

156
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,486
So how'd you figure
out where to find me?

157
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,786
Well we searched every
hotel's database for
one that had a guest
named Katarina.

158
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,653
That's how we found
out she was staying
at the Harborview
Hill Hotel.

159
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,953
Where'd she go?
I'll get her!

160
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,086
So hey, what now?
Ahhh!

161
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,786
No! She's found us!

162
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,053
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

163
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

164
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,492
I'm gonna give this
boat everything it's
got!

165
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:29,892
Looks like
we got away!

166
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,958
Nice job, Usagi.
Thanks.

167
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:32,592
(giggle)

168
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,158
You can count on
me! Oh...

169
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:41,225
Hey Usagi! Steer the
boat toward that big
deserted ship that's
anchored over there!

170
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:42,125
Hm?

171
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:44,392
Aye, aye, Luna!

172
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,492
Ahh! I made it!

173
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,325
Now let's get
moving!

174
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:05,192
Says the cat that
rode the whole way
up on my head!

175
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,158
Everyone, we
have to hide!

176
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,725
They're here
somewhere!

177
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,825
It sure looks like
there's no one on
board.

178
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:27,358
Still we all need
to be careful and
stay alert. By now
that monster knows

179
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:28,792
that we escaped
to this ship.

180
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:33,892
Sailor Venus, how
does that monster
know so much about
you? What's your

181
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:35,992
connection with
this Katarina
person?

182
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:42,758
Hey Luna! Maybe she
doesn't really wanna
talk about it right
now.

183
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:43,225
<i>No...</i>

184
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:43,925
Huh?

185
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,025
It's okay...

186
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,825
The whole thing
happened just
six months ago.

187
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:56,425
I found myself in London,
I was following up on
information that there
was a Dark Kingdom monster

188
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,025
somewhere in England.

189
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:13,925
That's when I met a
young man named Alan,
and I fell in love.

190
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,692
Soon after that...

191
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,092
I somehow found
myself at a crime
scene.

192
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:32,925
Huh?

193
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,658
(evil laugh)

194
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,825
(shocked gasp)

195
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:40,992
(crying)

196
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125
(painful screaming)

197
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,658
Huh?

198
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:03,325
Ahhhh!

199
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:06,858
That was amazing!

200
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:13,692
She's amazing!

201
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:14,325
<i>Thanks!</i>

202
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:15,825
(giggling)

203
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:19,925
From that moment on,
Katarina and I became
the best of friends.

204
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:25,158
She gave me good
advice, and helped
me with my studies.

205
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,725
We saw the sights
together, always
having fun.

206
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:35,325
I loved her like she
was a big sister. And
she always cared, and
looked after me as if

207
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,158
I was her little
sister.

208
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:48,058
Katarina! Alan!
C'mon you two!

209
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:57,058
Of course, I introduced
her to Alan. The three
of us always had fun
together.

210
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:09,158
Then one day
something happened.

211
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:20,625
Hm?

212
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:23,258
(shocked gasp)

213
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,625
Ahhhh!

214
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,025
(shocked gasp)

215
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:37,625
Minako!

216
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,158
(painful wincing)

217
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:47,092
Huh?

218
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:51,525
Alan!

219
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,558
Alan! Minako was
in there! She's...

220
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,625
She's what?!
What happened?!

221
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,592
Don't worry.
I'm here.

222
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:05,092
I'll always be
here for you.

223
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:16,658
That's when I discovered
the real truth. I had
never realized that Alan
and Katarina were actually

224
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:17,658
in love...

225
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:23,258
I decided to leave and
disappeared from their
lives. I thought that
remaining dead to them

226
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,158
would probably be the
best thing for their
happiness.

227
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,825
So that's why you
returned to Japan.

228
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:34,525
You decided to forget
those sad memories by
devoting yourself to
fighting evil.

229
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,492
No!

230
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:37,692
Huh?

231
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:43,125
That's so unfair!
I'm so sad for you!

232
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:44,792
Thanks, Usagi.

233
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:47,125
Hm?!

234
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:47,992
Hm?!

235
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:55,658
So were those tears
of yours, tears of
joy? Brought on by
the thought of me

236
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,025
killing you?

237
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,025
Don't worry, I'll
make sure this
becomes the sight
of your graves!

238
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:03,992
I'm in a really bad
mood right now. If I
were you, I'd get out!

239
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:08,592
Moon Prism Power!
Make Up!

240
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,592
I see, so you are
Sailor Moon, huh?

241
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:52,592
At this point, I
don't care if you
do know who I am!

242
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:56,592
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

243
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,458
I am Sailor Moon!

244
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:01,725
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish
you!

245
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,658
Just what are you
blabbering about?!

246
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,125
Haah!

247
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,058
I refuse to run away
today! I won't let you
get away with trying to
break the heart of a

248
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:18,725
young girl that's
in love!

249
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,525
Die!

250
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:28,392
Moon Tiara!

251
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:30,525
Action!

252
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,458
Ahhahh!

253
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,425
Ahhh!

254
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,892
<i>Stop! Please</i>
<i>don't hurt her!</i>

255
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:57,592
Huh?

256
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:02,058
It's my fault! I'm
the real reason she
was turned into a
monster!

257
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:06,958
Katarina knew that I
was a Sailor Guardian.
That's why the Dark
Kingdom used her to

258
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:08,058
do their bidding.

259
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,992
She's not to blame
for all this!

260
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:16,025
But you loved her like
a big sister and then
she betrayed you!

261
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,825
Please save her
for me!

262
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:22,925
How can you want to
be nice to her?! She
stole the guy that
you loved!

263
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,758
He chose her!

264
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,858
She's the person
Alan fell in love
with.

265
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:30,725
Agh...

266
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,825
Please help her.

267
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:38,758
All right!

268
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:50,492
Moon Healing
Escalation!

269
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:55,358
Refresh!

270
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,392
Katarina!

271
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,525
Katarina!

272
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,258
Minako...

273
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,758
I'm sorry...

274
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:28,458
I had no idea about
your feelings for him.
I thought you were still
just a child. Forgive me.

275
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:43,458
So what's going on?
What happened to
Minako?

276
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:45,692
It looks like
she's sad.

277
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:49,725
Yeah, we should probably
go over there and try to
cheer her up or something.

278
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,258
It's better if
we just leave
her alone.

279
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,258
Huh?!

280
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:57,825
She'll be fine.
Minako is a lot
more mature than
any of us.

281
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,558
This is how
it should be.

282
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,892
He chose you,
Katarina.

283
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:18,692
As long as you're
both happy, that's
what counts. That's
what matters.

284
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,425
That's what matters.

285
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,993
I've had it!

286
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,260
<i>What's wrong, Usagi?</i>

287
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:16,860
Everyone keeps calling
me names like dummy,
klutz and stupid!

288
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,226
<i>Well, at least</i>
<i>they're honest.</i>

289
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,926
Right? That's what
I- Uh! Luna, how
could you?!

290
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,160
<i>Hey! Honesty is</i>
<i>the best policy!</i>

291
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:26,360
Cat thinks she's
so smart!

292
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:32,360
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Usagi Abandoned: The</i>
<i>Falling Out of the</i>
<i>Sailor Guardians."</i>

293
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:35,926
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
