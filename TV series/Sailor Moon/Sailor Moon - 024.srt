1
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,800
Sometimes girls just
can't help falling in
love, even when their
intuition tells them it's

2
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:07,000
wrong. And they'll stand
by their love, no matter
how tough things get.
When a girl is on the

3
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,500
path of true love, I
won't let anyone get in
her way!

4
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,100
I am Sailor Moon...

5
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,100
...and in the name of the
moon, I'll punish you!

6
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:22,400
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino! It
may not look it, but
I'm actually a
superhero!

7
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,233
I use a special brooch to
transform and fight evil!
You know me as...

8
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:31,266
...the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice. I am Sailor
Moon!

9
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm friends with the
kindhearted genius, Ami
Mizuno, who's Sailor
Mercury...!

10
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:40,800
...And Rei Hino, the
hotheaded psychic, who's
Sailor Mars. Both of them
seem to have it a little

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,800
more together than I
do...

12
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,066
But, oh well, guess I
just gotta do my best!

13
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,333
[giggling]

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,466
Naru's Tears: Nephrite
Dies For Love

15
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:16,933
I hate to see you so sad like
this. Naru, I think it would
be best if you just forget
about him.

16
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:17,966
I can't.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,066
Uh!

18
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,000
Even if he is a bad
person..I still love him.

19
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,066
Hm. What a dilemma...

20
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:29,966
Usagi... You have someone
you like, right?

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,866
Uh, me? Well.. Yeah, of
course!

22
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,000
So then, you should
understand exactly how
I'm feeling now.

23
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,333
Mm.

24
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,866
I don't understand...

25
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,300
Why did the Dark Crystal
react to Naru Osaka's
energy?

26
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,066
Is it the energy of her
love for me?

27
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:54,400
I won't let anyone
hurt Mr. Sanjoin!

28
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,700
[giggling]

29
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:07,266
Because I love him...I
love him with all my
heart.

30
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,133
Mmph! What nonsense.

31
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,100
Now that I think about
it, Sailor Moon knew that
girl quite well.

32
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:19,466
Which means Naru Osaka
most likely knows who
Sailor Moon really is.

33
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,800
[chuckling]
Watch out, Sailor Moon.

34
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,333
As I thought. So that's
the Dark Crystal, which
can determine where the
Silver Crystal's located.

35
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:44,733
Hmm...

36
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,033
The Dark Crystal is
reacting again...

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
...to the same girl.

38
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:57,733
Huh? I wonder if it's
possible that the Silver
Crystal could be inside
the body of a human...

39
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,166
It's not there.

40
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not getting a
reading. She doesn't
carry the crystal.

41
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,900
[gasping]

42
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,766
Mr. Sanjoin?

43
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:51,766
No. The man you know as
Masato Sanjoin does not
exist.

44
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,266
My real name
is Nephrite.

45
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,966
Uh--

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,166
I can't lie to you any
longer.

47
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,733
Huh?

48
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,000
Stay right where you are
and listen...

49
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,066
All right.

50
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,466
You are a wonderful
girl...

51
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,333
...And thanks to you, for
the very first time, I've
learned what love
actually is.

52
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:17,000
This emotion doesn't
exist in the evil
organization that
I work for.

53
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:22,433
In my world, we betray
our allies. We kill each
other for personal gain.

54
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,233
I thought that was just
how life was. I never
expected it to be any
more than that.

55
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,866
But your love has
opened my eyes.

56
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,833
It's truly changed me.

57
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:38,933
I'm now thinking of
joining Sailor Moon
and her friends to fight
the evil organization.

58
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:43,700
That's why I need you
to tell me all you know
of Sailor Moon and how
to find her.

59
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:47,466
I really don't know
anything. I'm sorry.

60
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,200
Don't you believe me?

61
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,933
It's not that! I do
believe you!

62
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:57,366
I really do! But I just
don't know anything...
about her... honest.

63
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,700
I see... That's
unfortunate.

64
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,900
[gasping]

65
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,366
Please wait!

66
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,900
I want to help you,
Nephrite.

67
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,966
Now to watch and
wait. If she does know
Sailor Moon's identity,

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,733
then she'll contact
her sooner or later.

69
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,166
My, my.

70
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:29,933
So, what do we have here?
It seems he's fallen in
love with a human girl.

71
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,733
<i>Master Zoisite...</i>

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,466
Were you listening? You
heard what Nephrite said?

73
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,733
Heh, what a fool.
Let's take him out,
now.

74
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:42,433
Now hold on a second.
Remember Nephrite is a
powerful warrior.

75
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:45,766
We need a plan in
place before we
pursue him.

76
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,100
Let's begin by taking
that girl hostage, and
using her to lure him
out.

77
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,800
As you wish.

78
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:59,966
What should I do? I
wanna help him, but I
really don't know how
to find Sailor Moon.

79
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,933
Usagi! You have a phone
call.

80
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:09,866
Okay. Who could be
calling at this hour?
It's the middle of the
night.

81
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,200
[yawning]
Hello? Usagi speaking.

82
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,966
Mm?

83
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,100
Is anyone there?

84
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Usagi...Sorry to bother</i>
<i>you this late...</i>

85
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,066
Naru! What--

86
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,800
What's wrong?

87
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't know what to do.
I'm so confused. You're
the only one I can talk
to about this.

88
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,366
So tell me, what
happened?

89
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,000
It's about Mr. Sanjoin.
He just came by right now.

90
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,066
And asked where he
could find Sailor Moon.

91
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,266
[gasping]

92
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:45,833
He was in such a hurry,
it seemed like he was in
trouble.

93
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:49,266
I feel so powerless,
there's nothing I could
do to help him.

94
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,500
Do you have any
idea where he is now?

95
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,066
[crying]

96
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,200
Naru, are you crying?

97
00:08:55,233 --> 00:09:00,066
I'm fine. I shouldn't
have gotten you out of
bed. Just forget it.

98
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,300
But, Naru....

99
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm all right now. Just
talking to you has calmed
me down. Thanks for
listening, Usagi.

100
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,166
You sure you're
okay?

101
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Usagi...

102
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,500
Nephrite is keeping close
tabs on Naru, so he must
be up to something.

103
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,966
Come on, Usagi, pick
up the pace, we need
to hurry!

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,033
I don't have four legs
like you!

105
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,066
I'm going
on ahead!

106
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,033
<i>All right,</i>
<i>be careful!</i>

Whoa! What's
going on?!

108
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:33,066
Oh, I get it! A
monster's behind this!
You don't scare me!

109
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,166
All right where are you?
Show yourself! Come out!

110
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:40,033
Fine! That's it!

[gasping]
It's Nephrite!

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,900
So, Sailor Moon is
actually Usagi Tsukino!
Seeing is believing.

117
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,033
Oh no!

tell anyone that I'm
Sailor Moon!

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,433
Let's just keep this
between you and me!
Please, I'm begging you!

121
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,300
But you've no reason
to hide your identity,
now.

122
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,100
I don't see things
quite the same way as
you! C'mon, pretty
please...!

Somebody... help me.

Now, to end your life
once and for all!

Hm?

The beautiful Sailor Moon
will never suffer defeat
at the hands of evil.

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,066
Seems I have other
matters to attend to.

140

I can attack you anytime
I want, now that I know
your true identity,
Sailor Moon.

141
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,466
So watch
your back!

00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:56,066
What am I gonna do?
Luna's gonna be so
mad at me!

143
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,133
You're a smart girl,
I'm sure you'll figure
something out.

144
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,033
Farewell, Sailor Moon.

save me.

I'm too late! I have
to inform the Sailor
Guardians immediately!

147
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:30,166
They want the Dark
Crystal in exchange for
Naru Osaka. This has got
to be the work of Zoisite.

148

would I care what happens

151
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,800
Nephrite better
get here quick.

152
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,466
Do you honestly think
he's going to come rescue
this human?

153
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,766
Hmph! Well,
if he doesn't, I guess
we'll be forced to
eliminate her.

154
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,366
The poor thing. She
looks so frightened.
[chuckling]

155
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
Hm?

156
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,466
[gasping]

157
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
Nephrite, you came!

158
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,066
Die!

159
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,533
Ha!

160
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,500
[grunting]

161
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,933
Ha!

162
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,366
Did we get him?!

163
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,433
[gasping]

164
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,966

[gasping]

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,466
I've got a message
for you to deliver to
Zoisite. I'm not giving
up the Dark Crystal.

170
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,300
[panting]

171
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,833
Thank you, Nephrite...
for coming to save me.

172
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,933
Don't thank me. If you
didn't know me, this
wouldn't have happened.

173
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,366
In fact, I don't
even know why I
saved you.

174
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:42,333
Besides, I haven't
been honest. I've lied
to you this whole time.

175
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:45,733
And knowing myself,
I may continue to lie
to you.

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,466
That's okay with me.

177
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,366
As long as you always
remain by my side... I
can live with the lying.

178
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,333
[gasping]
Oh no! You've been
injured!

179
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,533
It's all right.

180
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,466
It's not all right.
This happened to you
because of me.

181
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,800
We have to hide from
those women, before they
find us again.

182
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,166
Come on,
follow me.

183
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,800
You'll need to take off
your jacket.

184
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,833
All right.

185
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,266
[grunting]

186
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,833
On 3rd Avenue, there's
this little place that
serves the best chocolate
parfait.

187
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,766
Chocolate
parfait?

188
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,866
Yeah, you like it?

189
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,066
Uh--sure, why
wouldn't I?

190
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,033
That's a lie...

191
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,733
Mm?!

192
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:49,433
A sweet lie to make
me believe that we have
something in common.

193
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:55,866
[grunting]
Thank you, Naru.

194
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,866
Anyway, I was wondering
if you'd like to go there
with me sometime.

195
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:05,133
I know it's kind of a
silly idea, but I've
dreamed of going there
with you.

196
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,733
To share a chocolate
parfait together.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,466
Sounds good.
Let's do it.

198
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,433
You mean it?

199
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,766
You think I'm
lying to you.

200
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,466
Mm-mm.

201
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,133
I can't wait!

202
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, but will your evil
organization give you
a day off? Like, maybe
this Sunday?

203
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,100
Hm?

204
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,933
[chuckling]
Wow, I've never
seen you laugh like that.

205
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:45,933
[giggling]

206
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:48,800
How strange, what
brought that on?

207
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,133
Now I can't seem
to stop laughing.

208
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,133
[grunting]

209
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,400
[struggling]

210
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,466
Heh-ha!

211
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,933
[grunting]

212
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:01,466

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,466
[grunting]

214
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,300
What have you
done to him?!

215
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:13,733
You let your guard
down. Those thorns will
drain your energy until
you meet your death.

216
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,166
<i>[giggling]</i>
<i>A fitting end</i>
<i>for a traitor.</i>

217
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:24,133
If you don't want us
to kill the girl, too,
then hand over the Dark
Crystal.

218
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,000
You can have it.

219
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,900
Get out of here, now!

220
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,033
No!

221
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:29,833
Run away!

222
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,200
I won't!

223
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,233
[sobbing]

224
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:34,066
Go, you idiot!
[grunting]

225
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,300
No!

226
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:43,266
[struggling]

227
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,100
Fool. Do you really think
a pathetic human like you
could pull out those thorns?

228
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,866
[struggling]

229
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Give it up! You have
to get out of here!

230
00:17:55,433 --> 00:18:00,800
[struggling]

231
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,133
Just leave me.
You've done enough.

232
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:10,766
[struggling]

233
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,866

[struggling]

235
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,400
Impossible!

236
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:22,333
Nephrite, don't die!
Hold on, please!

237
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,833
[struggling]

238
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,366
[grunting]
I'm going to finish
both of you!

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,966
[gasping]

240
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,133
Now, die!

241
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,933
[trembling]
Huh?

242
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:48,233
Are you all
right, Naru?
[grunting]

243
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:51,933
[gasping]
Nephrite?!

244
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:54,100
Well done, you three.

245
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,933
The plan worked. The
Dark Crystal is ours.

246
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm sure he wants to
die with the girl he
loves, but we can't wait.

247
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:04,200
Give him a good beating
to finish him off.

248
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,033
Damn you, Zoisite.

249
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,500
[shaking]

250
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,200
[chuckling]
This should be fun.

251
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,400
[grunting]
Run!

252
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,833
No...

253
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,733
Stop right there!

254
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,266
Hm?

255
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:26,466
How dare you mess with
two people who are in
love! That's truly
despicable!

256
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,800
The Sailor Guardians!

257
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,966
And now, in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

258
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,966
Douse yourself in
water and repent!

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,300
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

260
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,133
All right, we'll
deal with you, first!
Die!

...Spray!

266
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,466
Now's our chance!

267
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,733
What?!

268
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:05,700
Where'd they go?!

269
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,833
Fire!

270
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,866
Moon Tiara!

Nephrite, we're
safe now.

Yes?

It looks like your
true identity will
remain a secret
after all.

Huh?

284
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:05,833
Don't think... we'll
be having... chocolate
parfait together.
