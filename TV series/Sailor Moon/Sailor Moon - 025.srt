1
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,600
What in the world?!
A human got turned
into a monster! Now I
can't punish him!

2
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:07,066
I've never encountered
anything like this in
my entire career as
Sailor Moon! But this

3
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,733
is no time to worry
about that! What
the heck, I'm just
gonna do it!

4
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,633
In the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

5
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:22,600
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
It may not look it,
but I'm actually a
superhero!

6
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,166
I use a special
brooch to transform
and fight evil! You
know me as...

7
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,266
...the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love
and for justice. I
am Sailor Moon!

8
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm friends with the
kindhearted genius,
Ami Mizuno, who's
Sailor Mercury!

9
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,866
And Rei Hino, the
hotheaded psychic,
who's Sailor Mars.

10
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,066
Both of them seem
to have it a little
more together than
I do.

11
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,800
But, oh well,
guess I just
gotta do my best!

12
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,200
(giggles)

13
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>"Jupiter, the Powerful</i>
<i>Girl in Love."</i>

14
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:01,533
Awaken, Great
Ruler...

15
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:05,100
To you, I offer
vital energy.

16
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,966
Hear my plea and
awaken once more.
Great Ruler of ours,
now is the time!

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Arise! Oh
Great One!

18
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,633
(gasp)

19
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:42,633
So, It seems as if
the energy from the
humans has stirred me
from my long sleep.

20
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:46,033
Yes, Great
Ruler! What an
auspicious
moment.

21
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,166
How we have
waited for this
to happen!

22
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,166
But it is not enough.
I can feel myself
being drawn back into
a deep sleep...

23
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,666
Yes...

24
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,100
You must locate the
Legendary Silver
Crystal, at once!
Without that Silver

25
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:07,766
Crystal, it will be
impossible for me to
make my resurrection
complete!

26
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,966
We're searching for
it but it has not
yet been found!

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,166
When the Seven Great
Monsters are revived
together with the
Rainbow Crystals.

28
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Only then will the
Legendary Silver
Crystal shine brightly
enough to be found!

29
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,566
Ahh! Of course!

30
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,633
Oh no! I'm late!
I'm so late!

31
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,700
Hey! Don't forget
your lunch!

32
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,566
Oh! Okay, thanks
Luna!

33
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,533
Ow! That hurt!

34
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,900
Sorry about that-!

35
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:41,933
You broke my leg!
I heard it snap
like a pretzel!

36
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,433
Hey! Whatcha
gonna do now?!

37
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,766
She said sorry!

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,433
Wha-?

39
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:50,366
I saw the whole
thing, boys.

40
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,666
She barely bumped
you. That's pretty
low, trying to con
an innocent girl.

41
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,733
What's that?!

42
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:57,100
How dare you!

43
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:59,766
No one ever
talks to us
like that.

44
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,066
(painful grunt)

45
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,566
Why you!

46
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,733
(painful grunt)

47
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,966
Oh wow!

48
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,600
Are you okay?

49
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,733
Uh, sure!

50
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,366
You take care.

51
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:25,300
A rose-shaped
earring...
So cool!

52
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,533
When the Seven Great
Monsters and the
Rainbow Crystals are
revived together,

53
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,800
then the Legendary
Silver Crystal will
be found!

54
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:39,333
I remember everything
about the Seven Great
Monsters. They were
the strongest of our

55
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:42,800
allies. But they
were sealed away
eons ago by our
enemy.

56
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:55,333
Your memory serves
you well. The legendary
Seven Great Monsters
were the most powerful

57
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,566
warriors of all!

58
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:02,466
Until that day when
we suffered a great
loss to our enemy!
Those cowards sealed

59
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,533
away the Seven Great
Monsters into separate
fragments of the
Legendary Silver Crystal

60
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,233
and then banished
them to Earth.

61
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:14,600
Those seven fragments
are known as the
Rainbow Crystals...

62
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,466
Rainbow Crystals...

63
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,666
<i>So what's become</i>
<i>of the Seven</i>
<i>Great Monsters?</i>

64
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,533
They lost their memory
of once being monsters
and they have been
reborn as humans.

65
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:29,500
I see. So if we
remove these Rainbow
Crystals from the
reborn humans...

66
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,733
Will it lead us
to the Legendary
Silver Crystal?

67
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:38,400
Yes, but what's even
better is the Seven
Great Monsters will
also be reincarnated.

68
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:49,900
I've modified that
crystal to only react
to the presence of
the Rainbow Crystals.

69
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,400
Mmm. Thank you,
my queen.

70
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,933
Zoi!

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,933
Ahh. So there's a
Rainbow Crystal
inside him, huh?

72
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:13,833
(boys laughing)

73
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,233
Race ya there!

74
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:18,900
It's lunchtime!
Lunchtime! My
stomach's growling
like a big old bear!

75
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,933
It's that girl
with the rose
earring!

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,533
Hey Usagi!

77
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:29,633
(startled scream)

78
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,333
Don't startle me
like that!

79
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,633
That girl your
stalking is a
transfer student
who just joined

80
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,733
class six today!

81
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,133
Huh?

82
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,200
Her name's Makoto
Kino. And the word
is, that she's
incredibly strong!

83
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:42,766
Turns out that she was
kicked out of her last
school for fighting.
So if I were you I'd

84
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,166
keep you distance!

85
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,766
Sounds like you
should be careful
around that girl
or she might real-

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,733
Uh-uhhh
Agghh!
Wait!

87
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,200
Usagi!

88
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,900
Ohh wow! Look how
cute and yummy her
lunch and dessert
are!

89
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:00,633
Ah! And the bag of
hers is cute too!

90
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,766
That mixed rice ball
looks so good, I can
almost ta-

91
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,833
Who's there?!

92
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:07,366
Ah! Uh! Ha-ha-ha!
Why hello again!

93
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,800
Oh it's you! So
you go to school
here too, huh?

94
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,800
I do! I'm Usagi!

95
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,900
So, care to
join me?

96
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:17,833
Huh? Sure! Thanks
for helping me
this morning!

97
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,833
Oh, would you
like to have
some?

98
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,333
Huh?! Well
actually I'm
not really a
big eater!

99
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,366
<i>Uh, what?</i>

100
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,233
But since you
offered...

101
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,366
Yummy!

102
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,833
I'm sure glad you
came by. Y'know for
some reason everyone
at school here seems

103
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,533
to be afraid to
talk to me.

104
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,366
Well, Mako...

105
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,266
Uh, sorry, is
it okay if I
call you that?

106
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,400
Sure...

107
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:42,633
Mako, your mom packs
the best lunch I've
ever tasted!

108
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,366
Oh!

109
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,533
Actually, I made
all this myself.

110
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,600
Wha?! That's
amazing!

111
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,866
<i>You've gotta teach</i>
<i>me how to make these!</i>
<i>Or you can make them</i>

112
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,566
<i>for me! Ha ha!</i>
<i>Just kidding!</i>

113
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,166
What a natural,
Usagi can make
friends with
anyone!

114
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,666
So Mako, I was
wondering, why
aren't you wearing
our school uniform?

115
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>What I'm wearing</i>
<i>now suits me better.</i>

116
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,066
Oh...

117
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,300
(giggling)

118
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,200
<i>Aw! Looks like</i>
<i>Motoki's not</i>
<i>here today.</i>

119
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:12,233
Oh yeah, who's
Motoki? Is he
your...

120
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,633
(embarrassed laugh)

121
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,766
...older brother
or cousin?

122
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,100
No, no, no.
Motoki is a
very special-uh?

123
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:23,700
<i>Hey, Mako!</i>

124
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,700
Usagi!

125
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,666
Huh?

126
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,600
Here you are!

127
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,733
What is it?

128
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,633
Luna says she's
concerned about that
girl over there...

129
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,800
Oh? You mean Mako?

130
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,333
Luna, you worry
too much...

131
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,666
Agh! How did I
lose that one?!

132
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,433
Uh, Mako?

133
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,766
Yeah?

134
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,466
Meet my other
friends. This is
Makoto Kino, she
just transferred

135
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,666
to my Middle
School today.

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,266
Hi there.

137
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,333
Oh-uh, hi!

138
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:49,700
So this is Ami,
who's the really
smart one. And Rei

139
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,733
who's the really
mean one.

140
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,500
Wait-Did you say
I'm the mean one?

141
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,366
Sure did.

142
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,766
Didn't hear that-
You said I'm what?

143
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,266
You're the
mean one.

144
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,466
So tell me what
year, month, week,
day, hour, minute,
and second I was

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,633
ever mean
to you?!

146
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,233
You don't think
that you're being
mean to me right now!

147
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,633
How nice. You get
along so well.

148
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,066
No way!

149
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,600
As soon as we see
each other she
starts an argument
every time!

150
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:10,333
I do not!

151
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,300
You do so!

152
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,366
Well the more you
argue, the closer
you are.

153
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,166
Huh?!

154
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,033
(giggling)

155
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,033
That's a good
one, Makoto.

156
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,166
Oh...
Cute!

157
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,400
That's Luna. She
has a crescent bald
spot on her forehead
and we all think she's

158
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,366
really special.
She lives at my
place!

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,766
(giggling)

160
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,966
What's that?

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,266
(impressed chatter)

162
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,133
(gasps)

163
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,266
Heh!

164
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,066
Oh! Hi there,
Usagi.

165
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,700
Hey there, Yumi.

166
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,133
Did you just
see that?

167
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,500
Mmm-Hmm.

168
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,700
<i>Everyone calls him</i>
<i>'Joe the Crane</i>
<i>Game Troll'.</i>

169
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,866
Why is his nickname
'Crane Game Troll'?

170
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,700
<i>'Cause he's a genius</i>
<i>at that crane game!</i>
<i>I've heard that every</i>
<i>single stuffed animal</i>

171
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:20,300
<i>he sets his sights</i>
<i>on, he gets! He's</i>
<i>got hundreds of 'em!</i>

172
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,533
Wow, awesome.
Mako, isn't- Uh?

173
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,133
He's just like
him...

174
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,566
What're you
talking about?

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,666
My first love...

176
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,266
<i>Hey! Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Earth to Mako!</i>
<i>Wake up! Come back!</i>

177
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,633
I wonder what's
gotten into her?

178
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,033
Huh?

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,433
I found you!

180
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,666
Ahh!

181
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,033
(giggling)

182
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,200
<i>Who are you?!</i>

183
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,233
This will only
take a moment.

184
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:11,633
Zoi!

185
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,233
Ah!

186
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,500
(painful grunts)

187
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:33,133
(painful scream)

188
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:39,100
Stop it!
Ahhhh!

189
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,233
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

190
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,233
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

191
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:06,000
Please stop!
Ahhh!

192
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,100
Stop that!

193
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,100
Huh?

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,566
You shouldn't bully
people weaker than
yourself!

195
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,166
Damn it!

196
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,900
I'll make sure
you regret
interfering!

197
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,466
(punching grunts)

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,900
(giggling)

199
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,500
And just what
was that?

200
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:27,466
<i>I'm not done yet!</i>

201
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,033
Hmph, how barbaric.

202
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:30,233
Ahhh!

203
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:33,566
(throwing grunt)

204
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,466
Ahhh!

205
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:46,033
You prehistoric
witch! You scarred
my precious face!

206
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,900
<i>Mako!</i>

207
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,900
W-what?! Oh no!
A fight!

208
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:50,533
Huh?!

209
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,400
Hey! Are you
okay?!

210
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,433
Are you all right?

211
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:00,966
Mako, what just
happened here?

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,133
Don't touch me!

213
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,100
Just mind your own
business! Leave
me alone!

214
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,333
But...

215
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:09,300
What's his problem?
We were just trying
to help him out!

216
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,533
Oh! Mako!

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,533
<i>What's going</i>
<i>on here?!</i>

218
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,833
I can sense it!

219
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,900
<i>What?</i>

220
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,366
I felt a super evil
aura from that guy
she fought,

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,333
Huh?

222
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,433
That means he might
be from the Dark
Kingdom!

223
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,866
You think so?!

224
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,533
Wait, then...

225
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:26,800
<i>In that case Mako</i>
<i>and Joe are in</i>
<i>serious danger!</i>

226
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,733
Usagi! Wait up!

227
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,366
You need to stop
following me!

228
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm just afraid that
someone else is going
to come after you.

229
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,066
(annoyed sigh)

230
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,033
I can be your
bodyguard.

231
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,766
And just why would
anyone be after me
anyway?!

232
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,766
Uhh, maybe 'cause
you won way too much
of that crane game.

233
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,266
Yeah! Maybe the folks
at the game center
hired someone to hunt
you down and kill ya!

234
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,400
Heh! Not likely.

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,200
Hey! Would you
be able to teach
me how to win at
that crane game?

236
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,933
You could never
do it...

237
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:01,833
(painful gasp)

238
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,366
What's the
matter, Joe?

239
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:06,500
<i>Welcome!</i>

240
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,433
<i>Joe!</i>

241
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,966
I'd like to enjoy
my coffee alone,
thank you!

242
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,000
He's sure got
an attitude!

243
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,366
That's why I
like him.

244
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:18,700
You see...

245
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,966
He reminds me of
the guy who
broke my heart.

246
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,300
Oohh...

247
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,366
Now that is the
face of a girl
who's in love...

248
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,833
(painful grunts)

249
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,266
Really, you can go
on without me if
you're too tired.

250
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,933
Oh no!
Ha ha ha!
Uh!

251
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,833
He wants you to
go in! You see
that!

252
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,300
Uh! What do
I do?!

253
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,466
You gotta stop
talking and
get going!

254
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,333
Come on now...

255
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:56,600
Wait!

256
00:15:56,633 --> 00:16:00,166
There's no waiting
for love! Now get
in there and good
luck!

257
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,366
Uh.. Were you?

258
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:03,833
Have a seat.

259
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:04,800
'Kay...

260
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,266
<i>Don't get the</i>
<i>wrong idea.</i>

261
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,866
Yeah?!

262
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,333
It's just too annoying
to see you standing
around outside just
watching me.

263
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,200
Umm...

264
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,966
I'm great at the
crane game 'cause
I've got this
supernatural power

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,300
I've kinda been
blessed with...

266
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,466
Supernatural
power?!

267
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,366
Ever since I was a
kid, I've had this
weird ability.

268
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,800
(gasp)

269
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:37,100
You understand now?
I've never met anybody
else who can do that.
That's why I know you

270
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,100
could never win
that crane game.

271
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,300
But wait, hold on.
Isn't that considered
cheating?

272
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,966
Cheating who?! I've
got this ability
and I'm putting it
to really good use.

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Oh, I see.

274
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,333
<i>Welcome.</i>

275
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:56,300
Oh, I'll have a large
curry rice. No, on
second thought, Tea
with milk. Hm?!

276
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,900
Ahh!

277
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:02,700
Help me!

278
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,666
It's that
guy again!

279
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,200
You're crawling
away and leaving
Mako behind?!

280
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:15,966
I don't care about
her! She's the one
who decided to
follow me!

281
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,733
What's that?! You
think of yourself
as a man acting
this way?!

282
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:21,600
She's not my
responsibility!

283
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,566
Besides giant girls
like her really
aren't my type!

284
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:38,566
I knew it!
That guy's from
the Dark Kingdom!

285
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,633
Oh Mako! Are
you all right?!

286
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,800
Say something!

287
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,166
That's the second
time a guy I liked
said that about me.

288
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,633
Oh Mako...

289
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,800
I've had it!

290
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,200
(startled scream)

291
00:17:56,766 --> 00:18:00,566
<i>You don't have to</i>
<i>run away. After all,</i>
<i>you're one of us.</i>

292
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,533
O-One of you?!

293
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,666
I'm taking your
Rainbow Crystal.

294
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:11,633
(painful screams)

295
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,833
Got it!

296
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,233
Hold it, you!

297
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,733
Sailor Moon!

298
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,166
(chuckling)

299
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,766
You're a little
too late, Sailor
Moon!

300
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,266
Just who are
you anyway?!

301
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,700
Allow me to
introduce myself.

302
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:38,100
I am one of the
Dark Kingdom's Four
Kings of Heaven,
Zoisite.

303
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,133
What?!

304
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,833
I think I'll let
Gamecen take care
of the rest of this!

305
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,700
He vanished!

306
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,733
Gamecen!

307
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:00,466
Whah! Joe turned
into a monster!

308
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,033
(attack growl)

309
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,666
Ahh!

310
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,233
Ahh!

311
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,866
(crying scream)

312
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,866
Game-cen!

313
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,666
And just what do
you think you're
trying to do to my
hero Sailor Moon?!

314
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,666
That sign!

315
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,166
E-nough!

316
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,600
Wow!

317
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,100
Gamecen!

318
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,133
Look out!

319
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,200
I... can't move!

320
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Sailor Moon!
Hold on!

321
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:38,633
Wait!

322
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,366
Huh?!

323
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Mako! You're a
Sailor Guardian!

324
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,900
You can talk?!

325
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,200
To help Sailor
Moon, hold this
transformation pen
and shout out:

326
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,933
Jupiter Power
Make Up!

327
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:51,466
Please! You must!
It's the only way
to save her!

328
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:56,133
Jupiter Power
Make Up!

329
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,800
Sailor Jupiter!

330
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,433
Wow! Mako
transformed!

331
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,633
Jupiter, my
guardian planet!

332
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:23,500
Bring forth a
storm! Summon the
clouds and bring
down your thunder!

333
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,900
Supreme!

334
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,366
Thunder!

335
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,533
Ga-ga-ga-
Gamecen!

336
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,600
Supreme Sundae?

337
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:38,033
All right, one
more blast!

338
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:39,533
No-don't!

339
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:43,733
That monster still
has a human heart!
Remember he used to
be a human being!

340
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,166
Then how are we
supposed to stop
him!

341
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,566
You have to turn
that monster back
into his original
form!

342
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
But how?!

343
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,033
What is this?!

344
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:58,766
<i>The moon stick!</i>
<i>Now shout, "Moon</i>
<i>Healing Escalation!"</i>

345
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,666
Moon Healing
Escalation!

346
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:12,000
Gaaaaame...

347
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,566
Refresh!

348
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,000
(relaxed sigh)

349
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,666
Mako, you are the
fourth Sailor
Guardian, Sailor
Jupiter!

350
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,033
Me? A Sailor
Guardian?

351
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:30,100
Sailor Moon, listen.
Now that we've found
all four Guardians,
you will lead the

352
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,100
team to find and
protect our
Princess!

353
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,500
Wait! I'm the
leader?!

354
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:37,600
Yes. The Moon Stick
you're holding
signifies your
position as leader.

355
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,966
Agh! Dang it!
Dang it! Dang
it! Aw c'mon!

356
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Who needs boys?!
Why you! Uh?!

357
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,733
Ah! I lost!

358
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,833
<i>Ugh! One</i>
<i>more time!</i>

359
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,366
(nervous laughing)

360
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,533
Oh! Hey Usagi!

361
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:02,733
Oh! Hi there,
Motoki!

362
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:06,066
Hey, I heard Joe the
Crane Troll played
here yesterday.

363
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
Wish I coulda
seen that.

364
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:12,766
Ha ha. Oh, allow
me to introduce you
to my new best
friend, Makoto Kino.

365
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
Nice to meet you.

366
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:18,033
You're just exactly
like my former love
who broke my heart.

367
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,366
Huh?!

368
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,500
Just yesterday you
said that Crane Joe
was exactly like him!

369
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,366
Well, I just
meant his voice.

370
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,866
Huh?!

371
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,900
Oh, Mako. Give me
a break, will ya?!

372
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,333
Oh, brother...

373
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,766
What's wrong, Usagi?
You look worried...

374
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,966
<i>It's Naru. She's</i>
<i>still depressed over</i>
<i>what happened with</i>
<i>Nephrite...</i>

375
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,466
You need to cheer
her up in times
like this!

376
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,233
<i>Yeah...Wait, I</i>
<i>know! People usually</i>
<i>feel better if they</i>
<i>eat good food!</i>

377
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:25,400
<i>Let's see, French,</i>
<i>Chinese, Ethnic.</i>
<i>Ooh, they all</i>
<i>sound so yummy!</i>

378
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,633
Are you sure you're
doing this for Naru?

379
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,766
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon,</i>
<i>"Restore Naru's Smile:</i>
<i>Usagi's Friendship"</i>

380
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,900
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
