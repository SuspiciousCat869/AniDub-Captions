1
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:03,600
You're kidding! A seminar
on how to become a Princess?
It sounds like it was made
for me! They teach you

2
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:09,200
refined conversation and
dignified manners! And at
the end, there's even a
grand ball! But wouldn't

3
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:15,033
you know it! There's evil
lurking in the pretty flower
garden! In the name of all
the elegant young ladies...

4
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,733
...I shall punish you!

5
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:27,200
<i>Let's become a Princess:</i>
<i>Usagi's Bizarre Training!</i>

6
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,733
(panic scream)

7
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,100
I'm gonna be
late for school!

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,733
Oh boy, being a
Princess hasn't
changed anything.

9
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,200
Hey! Good
Morning, Naru!

10
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,500
Morning!

11
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,733
Hmmh. You overslept,
too, didn't you?

12
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,666
Speak for yourself.
I was finishing my
homework.

13
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,433
What?! We had
homework?!

14
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:59,600
Of course, weren't
you paying attention?
There was science, math,
English, social studies..

15
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,233
Oh, and that
Japanese report!

16
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,766
And of course,
the embroidery
for home ec.

17
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,933
I'm so screwed.

18
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:14,200
Wow! What a cool-
looking guy! Who is
he?

19
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,600
Uhh...
Okay...

20
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,866
What's with them?

21
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:24,033
Huh? You mean
you don't know?

22
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,900
Mm-mm.

23
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,000
Those are some of the
girls who are attending
the Princess Seminar at
the Rose Mansion.

24
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:34,500
Oh yeah, now I remember.
That's the place where
Countess Rose lives.
She's the lady who

25
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,700
recently moved here
from England, right?

26
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:41,733
<i>Yup! From what I heard,</i>
<i>she's supposed to be a</i>
<i>famous aristocrat. And</i>
<i>she's and expert on</i>

27
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:45,966
<i>manners and the social</i>
<i>graces. Wealthy parents</i>
<i>send their daughters to</i>
<i>her to learn</i>
how to act

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,866
<i>like a princess.</i>

29
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,000
You can take a
class for that?

30
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:52,600
Apparently. She teaches
them the basics of
elegance and culture.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,033
Hmmm...

32
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,866
Ahhhhhh!

33
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,966
We're gonna
be late!

34
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:05,633
Alright, class. Your
homework, as you will
recall, was to translate
page 53 of your textbook.

35
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,633
I present to you,
Princess Serenity!

36
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
She's so beautiful!

37
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,666
<i>So elegant, and</i>
<i>so refined!</i>

38
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,766
She is truly a
princess like
no other!

39
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:27,966
You're breathtaking,
Princess. May I have
this dance?

40
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,566
Young lady, did you
get your homework
done?!

41
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,700
Silence! How dare you
address a Princess
in that way?!

42
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Forgive me, Princess!

43
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:54,866
(laughing)

44
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,600
Just kidding!

45
00:04:56,633 --> 00:05:00,066
(giggling)

46
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,733
Miss Tsukino...

47
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:03,700
Wake up,
right now!

48
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,800
How dare you address
a Princess in that way.

49
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,933
(embarrassed gasp)

50
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:15,700
You seem to be
babbling. Did you
forget your homework
again?

51
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,366
Uhh, guess I did.
Sorry about that,
again...

52
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,900
Go stand in the hall!

53
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,533
Wahhhh!

54
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:27,066
Mmm. Yeah, this is
becoming a really
big problem.

55
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:31,500
I've got to take my
responsibilities as
a Princess much
more seriously!

56
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,700
<i>Very good!</i>

57
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,433
I'm glad you finally
realized that!

58
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:39,600
Well of course, silly!
If I don't, I won't be
able to dance with Tuxedo
Mask at the ball!

59
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:40,700
She's hopeless.

60
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,733
Endymion...

61
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,800
You shall assist
Kunzite with the

62
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:51,866
task of defeating
Sailor Moon and
recovering the
Silver Crystal.

63
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,866
I refuse. I don't team
up with anyone. I will
work on my own.

64
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,766
That's fine with me.
I will do the same.

65
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,000
Whatever gets
the job done.

66
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:09,633
I expect one or both
of you to bring me
Sailor Moon's corpse
and the Silver Crystal,

67
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,566
as soon as possible.

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,700
Yes. I already have
a plan in motion.

69
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,466
(evil chuckle)

70
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,366
Excellent.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Codename Zero-Zero-
Nine-One, this is Luna.
Passphrase: "The rabbit
on the moon is pounding

72
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,600
rice cakes. Over.

73
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,900
<i>The moon's rice</i>
<i>cakes are sticky.</i>

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,966
And they puff up
when you toast
them, as well.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,633
What is it, Luna?

76
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, sir. Usagi just
isn't serious about
being a princess, and
I don't know what to

77
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,933
do to get her
mind right!

78
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:50,733
That is a difficult
problem, and you need
to...uhh. Oops! I-oh..

79
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,733
(embarrassed laugh)

80
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,966
A-Artemis...

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,566
(embarrassed laughter)

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,400
Well, I guess the
secret's out. The
communicator's been
acting very weird today.

83
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,233
(awkward laughter)

84
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:06,833
You mean to tell me
that you're the one
who's been bossing me
around this whole time!

85
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:07,633
Uhh, yeah...

86
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,733
And why didn't
you let me know?!

87
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,233
You never asked! And
as time went on, it
got more awkward and...

88
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,433
(embarrassed sigh)

89
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,400
<i>Now then...</i>

90
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,566
Today, young ladies, I
shall read you a poem
by Francis Hineck.

91
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,300
As I sank deeply into
the darkness, my beloved
sent me a golden arrow.

92
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:44,400
I confess, I am perplexed
by the sweet poison covering
the arrowhead. I realize as
I sit here, that I am a

93
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,733
prisoner of love.

94
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,866
Hmm. Looks like
they're having
a party.

95
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,666
Ahhhhh!

96
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,233
What is it, Usagi?

97
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:53,933
They're eating
cheesecake from
Charmont! I want
it!

98
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,600
Are you serious?

99
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:56,533
(cough)

100
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,466
Excuse me, but if you
have business here,
young lady, please
us the front door.

101
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,400
(panic screams)

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,866
And how may I help you?

103
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,733
Well, uh, to be
perfectly honest,
I was kinda thinking
about attending the

104
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,200
Princess Seminar!

105
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:18,633
Unfortunately, the
seminar is by invitation
only, through current
members.

106
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:24,333
Invitation, you say?
Well...I got an
invitation from this
prominent lady!

107
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,233
Meow?

108
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,866
We don't accept
invitations from
felines.

109
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>(amused chuckle)</i>

110
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,600
What an imaginative
young lady!

111
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,500
I think an invitation
from a cat would be
fine this time.

112
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:35,166
But madam...

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,066
You're so
understanding.

114
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,833
In my opinion, it will be
amusing to have a unique
person around. However,
there is one condition.

115
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:46,200
Uhh! Condition,
you say?! If it
has to do with,

116
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:50,833
tea ceremony, flower
arrangement, cooking,
sewing, cleaning, even
putting on a kimono.

117
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm afraid I cannot
do any of those things!
Is that alright?!

118
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,300
If not, I understand.

119
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,300
(amused giggle)

120
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,700
How wonderful to
be so unskilled!

121
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,833
(hurt groan)

122
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,400
Edward, if
you would.

123
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,433
Ma'am.

124
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,733
Take this.

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,266
Huh?

126
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,866
Strange as it seems,
the Countess really
enjoys playing Frisbee.
So, if you attend the

127
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,866
Princess Seminar,
you'll have to be
adept at it.

128
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,233
Alright! I've actually
gotten pretty good at
this sort of thing!

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,633
There!

130
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,666
(amazed gasp)

131
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,733
Good!

132
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:33,433
That was splendid!
You may attend my
Princess Seminar,

133
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:34,400
young lady.

134
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,566
Ahhh!

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,066
Woo-Hoo!

136
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,733
Wow. So Usagi really
went to the Rose Mansion
to become a princess?

137
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,566
I bet she just
gives up in a
day.

138
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:50,100
Maybe, but it is good
that she's taken the
initiative to try and
learn the basics.

139
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:53,333
I just hope this course
will turn her into a
proper princes.

140
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:57,266
But really, what would
she have to do to become
a proper princess?

141
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,366
Huh?

142
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,233
I mean, what's wrong
with the way Usagi is
right now?

143
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:06,566
Many things, actually.
The bottom line is, she
has to behave like a
princess in every respect.

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,633
Why is that?

145
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,500
(frustrated groan)

146
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:14,100
Well, among other things.
Only a proper princess
would be able to activate
the true power of the

147
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,566
Silver Crystal!

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,833
Hey! Why don't we
join Usagi at this
princess seminar?

149
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,400
Good idea!

150
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,133
We don't need
five princesses.

151
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:28,433
(playful chatter)

152
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,200
Let me show you
how it's done.

153
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,800
Here!

154
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,466
(scared gasp)

155
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:36,766
(giggling)

156
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,200
If this is all it takes
to be a princess, no
problem at all!

157
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,333
Is everything
proceeding to your
satisfaction, Master
Kunzite?

158
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:46,733
(evil chuckle)

159
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,733
Sailor Moon has a
special technique,
Moon Tiara Action,
which is similar

160
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:55,400
to that game, but
she's also very
clumsy.

161
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:59,733
In other words, the
clumsy girl who knows
how to play that game
well, but who still

162
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:03,333
cannot pass the
Princess Seminar,
is Sailor Moon,
correct?

163
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,100
(affirmative grunt)

164
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:09,466
But that still leaves
one important question.
Will someone with her
amount of experience,

165
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,766
fall for our trap?

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,266
She will.

167
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,033
Sailor Moon's that
kind of girl, my dear.

168
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,433
Here you go!

169
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,033
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,533
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

171
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,658
This dress is so tight
and uncomfortable!

172
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,917
I don't know how
these girls put
up with it.

173
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,717
(ecstatic gasp)

174
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,017
Alright, everyone,
let us dine.

175
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,917
Good deal!
I'm starving!

176
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,184
(loud slurping)

177
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,684
That's not correct,
miss. Try not to
slurp.

178
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:12,951
O-okay.

179
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,751
(quiet slurping)

180
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:18,884
<i>Unacceptable.</i>
<i>Try again.</i>

181
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:23,184
Once again! You
can't make those
noises!

182
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:27,117
Wahhh! This is crazy!
How can eating be
this hard?!

183
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:30,717
A princess's way
of speaking is of
utmost importance.

184
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,684
And let me emphasize
that polite speech
is essential. At all

185
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:39,117
times, one must be
sophisticated, elegant,
and to the point. This-

186
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:42,184
This is so boring!
It's just like school!

187
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,351
Um...

188
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:47,817
For example, what do
you say when you're
offering a guest a
cup of coffee?

189
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:55,569
Huh? Well, let's see.
Would you be so kind
as to please partake
of some coffee? Uh...

190
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:57,202
It's free!

191
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:02,169
(giggling)

192
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:07,635
I appreciate your
concern, but there's
no need to emphasize
that the coffee you're

193
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:12,369
offering is free. In
this case, a simple
'Please have some
coffee' will suffice.

194
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:14,569
Huh? Oh boy.

195
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,769
Gracefully, ladies.
One, two, three...

196
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,102
That's it. Follow
the music.

197
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:33,769
This is the final
session of the
Princess Seminar.

198
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,035
If I come by and tap
you on your shoulder,
you have graduated.

199
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:41,435
(uncomfortable grunts)

200
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,502
Ahhhhh!

201
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:44,002
(giggle)

202
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,269
Sorry about that!

203
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:52,535
This is impossible!
It's the hardest thing
I've ever tried to do!

204
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,402
Well, this isn't
surprising...

205
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,335
Hey! What are you
guys doing here?

206
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,102
We can't let you
have all the fun!

207
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,002
(chuckling)

208
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:00,369
Why are you
on the floor?

209
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:14,102
After all, every single
person has at least
one redeeming feature!

210
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:16,669
(awkward grunts)

211
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:21,302
Everyone has things
they struggle with.

212
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,269
(awkward laughing)

213
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,669
(painful screams)

214
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:30,469
I'm not very good
when it comes to
dancing!

215
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,335
This is not going
well. I wonder...

216
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:36,502
Maybe I'm not cut
out to be a princess.

217
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,302
You pass,
my dear.

218
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:45,035
<i>You passed.</i>

219
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,269
You pass, as well.

220
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:54,269
Young ladies, if I
tapped your shoulder,
proceed to the other
room, and I will give

221
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:56,435
you your graduation
certificates.

222
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:00,269
(giggle)

223
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:01,435
(annoyed groan)

224
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,469
We flunked!

225
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,002
<i>This is kinda creepy.</i>

226
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,102
These statues look
way too real.

227
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,902
It's because they are.

228
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:29,069
As a matter of fact,
all the dolls in this
room, at one time, were
actual young women.

229
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:30,935
What did you just say?

230
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:36,535
(evil laughter)

231
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:43,035
(shocked gasps)

232
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,235
She's a monster!

233
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:47,535
Hello. I am...

234
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:51,435
...Shakokai! Welcome
to graduation.

235
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,369
(scared screams)

236
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:01,869
(evil laughter)

237
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:04,069
(gasps)

238
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:09,569
Hey! What was that?
Did you hear someone
screaming in there?

239
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,935
Something must have
happened to Ami and
the others!

240
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:13,202
We'd better
check it out!

241
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:14,402
(frightened scream)

242
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:15,202
(evil chuckle)

243
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,569
A monster!

244
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,102
What in the-?!

245
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:19,035
Run!

246
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:21,835
Ahhh!

247
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:23,869
(horrified gasp)

248
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:25,935
That is so gross!

249
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:30,069
You three are the only
girls who failed to pass
my Princess Seminar.

250
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:34,935
According to what I
know to be true that
means one of you must
be Sailor Moon. So,

251
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:36,235
which one of you
is it?

252
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,102
What makes you
say that?

253
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:43,535
I was told that Sailor
Moon is clumsy, stupid,
lazy, and unrefined. And
there's no way a girl like

254
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,202
that could ever pass
the Princes Seminar.

255
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:47,602
That kinda
makes sense!

256
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:49,902
Damn, that was
really good
thinking!

257
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:53,135
Will you two stop
agreeing with her!
Whose side are you
on, anyway?!

258
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:56,002
And now to turn you
all into dolls!

259
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:00,969
Ahhhh!

260
00:17:01,002 --> 00:17:02,102
Look out!

261
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:05,135
Get off of me!
I can't see!

262
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:05,835
Agh!

263
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,969
Now!

264
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,502
Moon Prism Power!
Make Up!

265
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:30,269
Mars Power!
Make Up!

266
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:45,169
Venus Power!
Make Up!

267
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:56,402
I said, get off!

268
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,235
<i>So irritating!</i>
<i>Where did those</i>
<i>girls go?!</i>

269
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:03,102
You can't flunk
Sailor Moon without
consequences!

270
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:05,202
Huh?

271
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:11,369
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

272
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,769
I am Sailor Moon!

273
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,135
And I am Sailor Mars!

274
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:19,169
I am Sailor Venus!

275
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:20,969
In the name of
the Moon...

276
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,069
...We'll punish you!

277
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:28,269
You're certainly
welcome to try, but
first, let me give
you all something!

278
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:29,302
(attack yell)

279
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:30,335
Ahhhh!

280
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,202
I'll burn that up!

281
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,002
Fire!

282
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:37,969
Soul!

283
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,335
(evil laughter)

284
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:51,135
Crescent
Beam!

285
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,235
Our Crescent Beam
and Fire Soul are
having absolutely
no effect!

286
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,869
I don't think my
Moon Tiara Action's
gonna slow her down,
either!

287
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,702
(evil chuckle)

288
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:06,969
You're all going
to make exquisite
wax dolls!

289
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:12,135
We'll pass, thanks!
I like playing with
dolls, but I don't
want to turn into one!

290
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:16,869
(gasp)

291
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,102
That rose!

292
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:20,869
Could it be?!

293
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:23,169
Excellent work,
Shakokai!

294
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,069
Master Endymion!

295
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:28,969
It's Tuxedo Mask,
everyone! He's come
here to save us!

296
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,235
Not so sure
about that.

297
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,969
Sailor Moon, hand
over the Silver
Crystal.

298
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:37,802
If you do it now,
I shall spare your
life.

299
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:40,869
But, that's going
against Master
Kunzite's orders!

300
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:43,269
Sailor Moon, will
you give it to me?

301
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:49,202
You're kidding,
right, Tuxedo Mask?
You don't mean that?

302
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:54,935
You have to snap
out of it, Sailor
Moon.

303
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:58,769
This Tuxedo Mask
isn't anything like
the one you used to
know!

304
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:02,635
Come on!

305
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,102
<i>Endymion!</i>

306
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,369
Step back, do
not interfere!

307
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:15,635
What are you
talking about?

308
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:20,969
I was the one who put
this plan in motion.
And I want you to stay
out of it.

309
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:26,635
Ha ha. I've come here
for one thing. To
retrieve the Silver
Crystal. So bug off.

310
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,202
I beg your pardon?

311
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:32,302
So, what is it I
am supposed to be
doing?

312
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:33,502
KIll Sailor Moon!

313
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,602
<i>No, the Silver</i>
<i>Crystal comes</i>
<i>first.</i>

314
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,869
Don't listen to this
dressed up fool.
Sailor Moons comes
first!

315
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:39,935
<i>Silver Crystal!</i>

316
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,869
Shouldn't you be off
serving appetizers
somewhere?!

317
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:47,035
Oh brother! This is
ridiculous! Whose
orders am I supposed
to be following?

318
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,535
<i>Ta-da!</i>

319
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,935
Did you say something
about orders? Does that
mean you're the one who

320
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,135
ordered this cup of
coffee?

321
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:56,302
I'm sorry. I don't
recall doing so, but
that sounds lovely.

322
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:57,969
Now's my chance!

323
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:10,535
Moon Healing
Escalation!

324
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,602
Refresh!

325
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:22,269
Oh my goodness! She
was Countess Rose!
I had no idea!

326
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:26,302
Now it's you turn
Tuxedo Mask! I'll use
my powers to change
you back to normal!

327
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,102
Moon Healing-!

328
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:30,335
(gasp)

329
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,669
Sailor Moon...

330
00:21:31,702 --> 00:21:35,269
You can hold onto
the Silver Crystal
until the next time
we meet.

331
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:36,602
(evil chuckle)

332
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,035
Farewell!

333
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,902
What's happened,
Tuxedo Mask?

334
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:47,569
(confused sighs)

335
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:50,235
What happened?

336
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:05,902
<i>Tuxedo Mask...</i>

337
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:10,702
Ahhhhh!

338
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,969
Hey, what happened
to your Princess
training?

339
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,602
Oh that? I've got
that covered!

340
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,469
Really? How so?

341
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:22,935
I'm gonna become my
own kind of princess,
on my own terms! Mm-Hm!

342
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:24,202
Gotta go! Later!

343
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:27,735
She's never gonna
make my life easy,
is she?

344
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,835
Ahh-Ahhh!

345
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:13,435
Luna, we're
going skiing!

346
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,448
<i>What in the world</i>
<i>are you talking</i>
<i>about?</i>

347
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:18,881
There's a Moon Princess
Contest coming up! If I
don't enter, who will?

348
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,981
<i>Don't you know how</i>
<i>much I hate the</i>
<i>cold?!</i>

349
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:25,281
Oh come on, get over
it! You'll get to see
how good I look in
my ski outfit!

350
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,148
<i>Do you even know</i>
<i>how to ski?</i>

351
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:28,315
Uhhh...

352
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:33,815
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"The Snow, the Mountains,</i>
<i>Friendship and Monsters!"</i>

353
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,315
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
