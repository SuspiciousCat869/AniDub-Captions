1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,366
Here I am, enjoying a
perfect evening, sharing
my first kiss with Tuxedo
Mask in the glow of the

2
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,533
moonlight. It couldn't
get any more romantic!
And then Nephrite comes
along to ruin my magical

3
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:12,566
moment! Unforgivable! I
am Sailor Moon.

4
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,500
...And in the name of the
moon, I'll punish
you!

5
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:23,233
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
It may not look it, but
I'm actually a
superhero!

6
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:26,700
I use a special brooch to
transform and fight evil!
You know me as...

7
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:31,900
...the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice. I am Sailor
Moon!

8
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm friends with the
kindhearted genius, Ami
Mizuno, who's Sailor
Mercury...!

9
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,900
...And Rei Hino, the
hotheaded psychic, who's
Sailor Mars. Both of them
seem to have it a little

10
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,466
more together than I
do...

11
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,600
But, oh well, guess I
just gotta do my best!

12
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,666
[giggling]

13
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,300
Romance Under the Moon:
"Usagi's First Kiss"

14
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:05,266
I'm gonna be late! That
looks like a checkpoint.

15
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,666
I wonder if there's some
special event happening
today.

16
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,466
Hey, morning Naru!

17
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,666
'Morning, Usagi.

18
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,533
Is something wrong? You
sound depressed.

19
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:18,833
[sighing]

20
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,400
So, Naru...

21
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,600
Y-Yes?

22
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:28,133
Has anybody told you
you're the cutest girl
at school?

23
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,233
Cut the acting and reveal
yourself!

24
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:33,733
I know who you are,
you're Sailor Moon!

25
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:38,333
I don't get it. Does
Mr. Sanjoin like me, or
not?

26
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:42,733
C'mon! Don't just stand
there, Naru! Let's go!
We don't want to be
late!

27
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,600
Hurry up, that's
the first bell!

28
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:52,200
That was close!

29
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:57,266
Hey, Usagi, I've got a
really big news flash!
Apparently, at this very
moment, the Princess from

30
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,800
the Kingdom of Diamonds
is arriving in Japan!

31
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,500
Kingdom of Diamonds?

32
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,533
Most of the world's
gemstones come from
there. And tonight..
They're going to be

33
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,800
hosting some big embassy
reception!

34
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,600
That explains the
checkpoints I saw on the
way here.

35
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:14,566
They say the Princess
will inherit the royal
family's heirloom, which
is known as the

36
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,333
'Legendary Secret
Treasure'.

37
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:19,866
They're going to be
unveiling this secret
treasure to the world for
the first time at the

38
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,966
reception.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,466
Secret Treasure? What
do you think that it
could be?

40
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,533
I'm trying to imagine it,
but I've got nothing!

41
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,900
I'll go and take a look
for you... And tell you
all about it.

42
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,766
Huh?!

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Well, as you know, my
family runs a jewelry
store and I guess because
of that, we've been given

44
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,233
a special invitation
to attend tonight's
reception.

45
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:44,533
I wish I could go with
you, Naru! You are so
lucky!

46
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,433
"Tonight the final
mystery of this century
will be revealed."

47
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:55,566
"Princess Diamond, from
the Kingdom of Diamonds,
arrives in Japan with the
royal family's

48
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,466
'Legendary Secret
Treasure'."

49
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,400
I've gotta go
check this out.

50
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:08,366
The Kingdom of Diamond's
Legendary Secret
Treasure... I wonder if
it could possibly be the

51
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,433
Legendary Silver Crystal?

52
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,666
I'll check on it for you
immediately.

53
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,666
<i>Don't bother. I'll</i>
<i>handle this matter.</i>

54
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,666
Nephrite, stop butting
in! Finding the Legendary
Silver Crystal is my job!
I'll do it!

55
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,600
I am responsible for all
activities on Earth.

56
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,600
That's a lot for you to
cover.

57
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:28,200
I'm able to handle it.
Leave it to me.

58
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:33,433
Very well, then.
If this Legendary Secret
Treasure is indeed the
Silver Crystal, then

59
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,500
we must acquire it
immediately.

60
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:40,400
With its immense power,
we would finally be able
to restore our Great Ruler.

61
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:45,333
And the Dark Kingdom
would become the rightful
leader of this world!

62
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,166
B-But my Queen!

63
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,766
Tell me Nephrite.. What
is your plan?

64
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,733
I'd prefer that you just
watch, rather than
explain my entire agenda.

65
00:05:56,366 --> 00:06:00,600
Nephrite has failed every
single assignment! Why
are you giving him
another chance?!

66
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:04,733
Because now he's
forced to succeed. His
back is up against the
wall!

67
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,466
Have patience, my dear
Zoisite.

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,166
...the impatient
one always loses.

69
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,566
But, I can't,
Kunzite!

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,833
For now, let's watch him
carefully and see exactly
what he's got planned...

71
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,766
We can get rid of
Nephrite when it suits us
to do so.

72
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,166
[squawking]

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,433
Huh?! A Princess?

74
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:42,833
That's right, and it
occurred to me as I was
thinking about it, that
maybe this Princess

75
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,766
Diamond is the princess
we're looking for. You
never know, it could be
possible.

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,766
Can't be.

77
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,366
Seems to me we shouldn't
just dismiss Luna's hunch
out of hand. I think we need
to at least look into it.

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,466
Yeah, but now? I'm
sure that Princess
Diamond has lots of
bodyguards around her.

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,300
...And we can't get into
the reception because we
don't have one of the
special invitations to it.

80
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,366
Don't you think we're
all well aware of that
fact?! It's our mission
so stop whining and

81
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,366
let's put our heads
together to figure out a
way for us to get in!

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,600
You don't have to yell in
my face like that. Why do
you always have to be
such a meanie, Rei?

83
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:16,166
[crying]

84
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
Will you just grow up?!

85
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,800
[sobbing]

86
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,266
Well, why don't we meet
up at the embassy tonight
and put our heads together
when we get there?

87
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,800
Maybe, at the very least,
we'll be able to tell if
Princess Diamond is the

88
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,633
princess we're
trying to find. Just
by looking at her.

89
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,833
Mm!

90
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:38,200
Usagi, I've been feeling
out of the loop. I need
to be more involved in
the mission.

91
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,833
[grunting]

92
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,866
I'm home, everybody!

93
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,166
Glad you're back,
sweetie!

94
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,300
Huh? How come you're all
dressed up, Dad? What's
the occasion?

95
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm leaving right now to
go over to the Diamond
Embassy reception.

96
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:54,600
What! You got an
invitation?! That's so
unfair! What about me?
Can't I come with you?

97
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,866
Please!

98
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,800
This is work. The
magazine wants me to
write a story about it.

99
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,900
I'll look at everything
and take notes for both
of us.

100
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:06,333
[groaning]
I gotta get in there,
but how?! I got it!

101
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,700
What are you going to do?
Come on! Tell me!

102
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,800
[giggling]

103
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,866
No, don't!

104
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,366
Moon Power! Transform me
into a beautiful
princess!

105
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,300
[giggling]

106
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:34,566
Luna, check out this
dress! Isn't it lovely?

107
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,533
Yeah, but you shouldn't
be using the
transformation pen for
your own personal use.

108
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,166
Yeah, well actually.. I'm
not.

109
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm only doing all this
for the mission, to
discover if Princess
Diamond of the Kingdom of

110
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,366
Diamonds is truly the
princess we've been
trying to find.

111
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
Oh, really?

112
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,766
[giggling]
La-la-la-la!

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,700
Ugh, You're hopeless.

114
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:10,666
The Silver
Crystal...Please find the
Legendary Silver
Crystal....

115
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,700
I don't understand.
What is this Silver
Crystal?!

116
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,733
[grunting]

117
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,300
That same dream
again.

118
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,700
I guess this must be
where we go to check
in.

119
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,766
Huh?! That's Usagi!

120
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,733
Miss. May I see your
invitation?

121
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:43,400
I am the Princess of
Ivanovich. My presence
was personally requested.

122
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,800
What? I've never even
heard of such a place.

123
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,733
This is so exciting!

124
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,166
[gasping]

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,566
This is so cool! A
masquerade ball! It's
like being in a foreign
movie!

126
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,733
Well, if it isn't...Naru
Osaka.

127
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:15,533
Looks like my lucky
night.

128
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,333
Pardon me, Miss. But
would you do me the honor
of this dance?

129
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,466
Uh--

130
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,366
It's me, Naru.

131
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,266
Mr. Sanjoin?

132
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,833
Did you come here alone?

133
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,333
Uh-huh. In my mother's
place.

134
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:33,666
I never in my wildest
dreams expected to see
you.

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,266
This is turning out to be
the best night ever.

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,866
That's so romantic.

137
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,500
[swooning]

138
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,733
Oh, wow, look,
there's Naru!

139
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm so jealous! She's
already found a dance
partner.

140
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:55,866
Huh?

141
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:01,700
She looks like Usagi. I
wonder if my girl will
grow up to be as pretty
as her one day?

142
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh, it's dad! Guess he
doesn't recognize me,
dressed up like a Princess!

143
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:10,266
[gasping]
Oh no, my gown!

144
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:23,300
If the Kingdom of
Diamond's Secret
Treasure is the Silver
Crystal... Then it might

145
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,566
be able to tell me who I
really am.

146
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:29,433
Uh.. uh.. Oh.

147
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,633
I know that girl!

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,566
A princess?

149
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,733
I'm certain I've met
her before.

150
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,900
Mr. Sanjoin truly is
wonderful, after all. I
don't care what happens
after this.

151
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:10,800
You sparkle like a star
gleaming in the sky.

152
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,366
Please look at
me, Naru?

153
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,266
All right..

154
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,566
[chuckling]
You will now do anything
I say, Naru Osaka.

155
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,433
Yes!

156
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,333
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

157
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,166
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

158
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,600
I finally got to become a
princess. But what's
the point? It's no fun
if I'm all by myself.

159
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,866
Would you do me the
honor?

160
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,133
[gasping]

161
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,566
Tuxedo Mask!

162
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:27,300
Oh, wow! Am I awake? Is
this really happening to
me?

163
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,533
It's like a dream come
true!

164
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,700
But what am I suddenly
sensing?

165
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,600
It's so strange. I feel
as if Tuxedo Mask and I
danced together a long,
long time ago.

166
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,833
Who are you?

167
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:56,133
My name's Naru. I've come
to see the princess. We're
good friends.

168
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,366
You're her what?

169
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,533
Huh?!

170
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,533
Everybody's only
interested in the Secret
Treasure.

171
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,200
If I were pretty, someone
might come to see me.

172
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,500
I feel like I'm just an
appendage attached to the
Treasure.

173
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,200
Huh?

174
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,666
Princess, someone who
says she's your friend is
here to see you.

175
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,200
It's me, your pal, Naru!
May I come in to see you,
Princess?

176
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,233
Of course!

177
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,333
Uh!

178
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,133
You seem like fun. What
did you want to see me
about?

179
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,333
The Legendary Secret
Treasure. It's leaving
here now!

180
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:34,133
[screaming]
[laughing]

181
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,866
[cooing]

182
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,833
Princess, is everything
all right?

183
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,233
[chuckling]

184
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,700
Move! You're in my way!

185
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,200
I have the Legendary
Secret Treasure!

186
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,600
Princess Diamond!

187
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,266
Did she look
purple to you?!

188
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,833
We'd better go get
some help!

189
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:00,300
[alarm ringing]

190
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,933
Uh--

191
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:06,400
Usagi, we have a
situation! Princess
Diamond took the Secret
Treasure and ran up to

192
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,166
the balcony!

193
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,633
Huh?!

194
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,566
Nephrite!

195
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,266
Stop! Pull yourself
together, Princess
Diamond!

196
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,433
Let go of me!

197
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,866
[yelling]

198
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,733
Usagi!

199
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,233
[yelling]

200
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,766
Tuxedo Mask!

201
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,700
[grunting]

202
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,266
It's time for you both to
take a fall!

203
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,366
[grunting]

204
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,933
[meowing]

205
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,666
[gasping and screaming]

206
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:45,533
There seems to be some
kind of problem...

207
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,766
Tuxedo Mask, you pest.
Consider it your lucky
day to die with a
beautiful princess.

208
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,566
Fire Soul!

209
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,666
[grunting]

210
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,200
How dare you! There's
no way I'll let you harm
Tuxedo Mask!

211
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,366
[gasping]
I'm falling!

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,233
[grunting]

213
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,666
Ah!

214
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,833
[sighing]

215
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:26,633
Damn!

216
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,766
[grunting]

217
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,433
Hold it, Nephrite!

218
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,700
Answer me! Just who are
you?

219
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:35,600
I wish I could answer
that question, but I
can't.

220
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:40,633
That's reason I need to
solve the mystery behind
the Legendary Silver
Crystal.

221
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,433
[gasping]

222
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,366
Are you an enemy? Or
are you on our side?

223
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,800
If we're after the same
thing... maybe I am an
enemy.

224
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,666
[grunting]

225
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,466
[gasping]

226
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,333
Isn't that guy
something?!

227
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,533
Stop daydreaming
and transform!

228
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,233
Right! The mission!

229
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:02,600
Moon Prism Power! Make
Up!

230
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,266
[whispering]

231
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,333
Wow, this was unexpected!

232
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,333
I've got a scoop!

233
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:53,500
Come to life... my
little puppet.

234
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,933
[gasping]

235
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:04,900
Get out of my way!
Anybody who tries to stop
me will be sacrificed to
our great ruler!

236
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,700
[gasping]

237
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,766
Huh?!

238
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
[panicking]

239
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
justice! Sailor Moon!

240
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,500
I am Sailor Mercury!

241
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,300
I am Sailor Mars!

242
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,866
I'm telling you right
now, you're going to pay,
you evil monster, for
possessing the soul of

243
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
the pure-hearted Princess
Diamond!

244
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:34,800
[cackling]
I'm taking the Legendary
Silver Crystal! It's mine!

245
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,266
Silver Crystal?

246
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,200
[gasping]

247
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:49,866
Rin Pyo To Sha Kai Jin
Retsu Zai Zen!

248
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,600
Evil Spirit, be
exorcised!

249
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
[gasping]
It's Nephrite!

250
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,166
[struggling]

251
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,866
[laughing]
Die slowly and painfully!

252
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,433
I can barely move!

253
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,800
If he keeps this up,
we'll all be killed!

254
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,133
I'm going to try
something! Cross your
fingers!

255
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,133
Bubble...

256
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,200
Spray!

257
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:33,233
To pull such a mean trick
like that on Princess
Diamond is shameless.

258
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,800
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish you!

259
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,600
Moon Tiara! Action!

260
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,300
[screaming]

261
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,200
Yes!

262
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,700
[laughing]

263
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:09,566
[whimpering]

264
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,333
Princess, are you all
right?

265
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,466
Thank you. But... what
have I been doing?

266
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,700
I wonder. Do you think
it's possible that you
could be our princess?

267
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,700
My glasses. I can't
see you without them.
There!

268
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:28,166
Well? What's your
answer? Are you the
princess we've been
looking for?

269
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
Huh?!

270
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,500
[screaming]
That cat! It
spoke to me!

271
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:36,766
Oh, well. It looks
like she isn't our
princess after all.

272
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Mm-hmm.

273
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,166
What happened? Why are we
lying on the floor?

274
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,166
I'm really not sure...

275
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,466
Ahhh!

276
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,866
My film's ruined!
[sighing]

277
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,166
Pardon me, may I
have your attention?

278
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,733
Thank you all for
waiting. It is my
pleasure to announce that
Princess Diamond will now

279
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:57,633
unveil the last wonder of
the world.

280
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:02,700
Oh! Fabulous!

281
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,233
Huh?

282
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:12,466
How did I end up
here? In the Princess's
suite?

283
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:19,566
I present you a two
thousand- carat diamond,
cut in the shape of the
first Princess Diamond.

284
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
[admiring whispering]

285
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,533
What a waste of my time
and energy!

286
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:33,733
Well this certainly was a
bust. Looks like the
search for our princess
is back to square one.

287
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,866
Now, where did Usagi go
off to?

288
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,900
All this activity was
exhausting! I'm thirsty.
This punch looks great!

289
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,766
Wow! This punch...!

290
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,633
It's really refreshing!

291
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,866
Oops! Excuse me.

292
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:07,733
I can feel it. I kissed
you once a long, long
time ago.

293
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,600
Uh...

294
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:15,400
I believe my memory might
be coming back.

295
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:24,700
This gentle warmth. It
feels so familiar. I
know I've felt it
somewhere before...

296
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:28,500
I've felt it many
times.

297
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,333
Naru! Listen to me! Don't
fall for that guy!

298
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,100
<i>What's wrong, Usagi?</i>

299
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:18,800
Luna, it's terrible!
Naru is being manipulated
by Nephrite! And I'm
telling you right now--

300
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,466
I'm not gonna let anyone
toy with that girl's pure
heart!
