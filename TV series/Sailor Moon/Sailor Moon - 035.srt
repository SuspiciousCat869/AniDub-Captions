1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,956
What could this warm
glow be? Am I really
the Moon Princess? I
don't know how to deal

2
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:12,323
with this, or what
to do anymore! What
can I do? Tuxedo Mask,
everyone, please, lend

3
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:14,190
me your strength!

4
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,590
Mamoru ended up getting
badly hurt while he was
trying to protect Usagi.
Responding to Usagi's

5
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:31,990
tears, the Rainbow
Crystals came together
and formed the Legendary
Silver Crystal! I don't

6
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:36,956
believe it. After all
this time, Usagi was
the Princess we've been
searching for! There's

7
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,256
no mistake! This warm
aura belongs to the Moon
Princess, and no other.
At last, she has awakened!

8
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:56,890
<i>"Returning Memory: Usagi</i>
<i>and Mamoru's Past"</i>

9
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,190
Sailor Moon...

10
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,523
You're the Princess!
Princess Serenity!

11
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,056
What?

12
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,756
Luna, did you just
say 'Princess'? Are
you telling us that
Sailor Moon is the

13
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,790
Moon Princess we've
been searching for
this whole time?

14
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,656
And on top of all
that, Tuxedo Mask
is actually Mamoru?

15
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,723
(stunned breath)

16
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:54,256
So the Princess has
awakened, has she?

17
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,056
Fine. First, I'll get
rid of her, and then
I'll grab the Silver
Crystal! Zoi!

18
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,156
What's this?!

19
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:10,456
(painful yell)

20
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,056
Tuxedo Mask...

21
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,056
You're hurt, all
because of me!

22
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:25,190
S-Serenity!

23
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,456
(gasp)

24
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:31,523
I'm able to remember
everything now.
Serenity!

25
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:34,623
I am Endymion.

26
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,190
Endymion...

27
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,523
That's right, I
remember now, I
am Serenity!

28
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,823
(blushing sigh)

29
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,923
Endymion!

30
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,756
Endymion!

31
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,590
<i>Endymion...</i>

32
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:44,623
You're Endymion!
My one true love.

33
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,790
Endymion...

34
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,123
Sailor Moon!

35
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,056
She's okay!
Looks like she
just passed out.

36
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,556
Oh, thank goodness!

37
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,056
It's understandable.
It must have been her
memories of being
the Princess,

38
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,590
<i>rushing back and</i>
<i>overloading her</i>
<i>mind.</i>

39
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,523
Mamoru, can you
hear me? Please
say something!

40
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:23,556
He's in pretty
bad shape.

41
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,456
I won't let
you get away!

42
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,623
I found her,
Kunzite...

43
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:49,490
It was her all
along. Sailor Moon
turned out to be
the Moon Princess.

44
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:54,390
Yes, I see. Her
awakening explains
it. The Rainbow
Crystals must have

45
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:55,723
been drawn to her.

46
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,990
I will let you
all live just a
little longer.

47
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,290
(gasp)

48
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:20,390
Mamoru!

49
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,956
Where is it they
could have taken
him?

50
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,823
Kunzite, you fool!
Not only did you let
the Silver Crystal
fall into enemy hands,

51
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,356
you have also
awakened the
Moon Princess!

52
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,723
Yes, my Queen, I
have no excuses.
Fortunately, the
Princess has just

53
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:47,656
awakened, and does
not yet have full
control over the
Silver Crystal.

54
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,623
I'll need a
little more time.

55
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:53,523
Very well. Do
not fail me.

56
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,856
Then there's you,
Zoisite. Are you
ready to accept
your doom?

57
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,723
Please, my Queen!
Give me another
chance!

58
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:04,756
You disobeyed my
orders, and tried
to kill Tuxedo
Mask, didn't you?!

59
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,256
Yes, but
that was...

60
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,556
Did you think you
could fool me with
your lies?!

61
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,490
I take responsibility
for that!

62
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:13,056
Please!

63
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,390
Ahhh!

64
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,756
<i>Kunzite!</i>

65
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,856
Hmph! Now dispose
of that trash.

66
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:26,290
Yes...

67
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:35,223
Oh Great Ruler,
Queen Metalia! I
call on you to
awaken now!

68
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,356
Endymion! How
I've missed you!

69
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,723
I must admit, we
never imagined that
the former Prince of
the Kingdom of Earth,

70
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:52,823
would end up being
reincarnated in
this era!

71
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:56,656
Regardless of the
circumstances, heal
Endymion with the

72
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,956
power of darkness
immediately!

73
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,756
Yes, my Queen!

74
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:08,923
Zoisite, please
forgive me. I tried
to convince Queen

75
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,390
<i>Beryl to bring</i>
<i>you back, but...</i>

76
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,256
I'm sure you tried
your best, Kunzite.

77
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,456
I'm just happy,
knowing that I get
to die in your arms.

78
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:28,723
My love, can you please
grant me one last wish?

79
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,523
Anything...

80
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:34,156
I want to die,
in a beautiful
place.

81
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,356
This is perfect.
Thank you, Kunzite,
for everything.

82
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,390
Know this in your
heart, Kunzite. I
will always love you.

83
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:07,623
<i>And I will love</i>
<i>you, Zoisite.</i>

84
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:24,590
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

85
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:37,623
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

86
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,623
Are you sure this
is the way out?

87
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,523
I'm pretty sure,
according to the
sensors.

88
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:55,256
But we do have
a problem.

89
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,790
What kind of
problem?

90
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,856
Amazingly enough,
this appears to be
a complexly sealed,
projective space.

91
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,123
I mean. Theoretically,
it's not connected to
the three-dimensional

92
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:10,823
space we just came
from. It's more of a
two-dimensional space.
You see, the polarity

93
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:15,123
of this tunnel is in
inverse phase, and it's
connected to the other
space through a zero

94
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:15,890
dimension.

95
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:16,723
(sigh)

96
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:19,090
I don't understand
any of those words.

97
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:20,290
(sigh)

98
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,256
Good thing we have
Sailor Mercury for
this situation.

99
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,156
We've gotta move! If
we stick around here,
those guys are sure
to find us.

100
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,390
Right!

101
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,156
Sailor Moon!

102
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,823
I think she's
starting to
come to.

103
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,023
Huh?

104
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,090
Tuxedo Mask!

105
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:55,023
Where? Where is
he? Where is he,
tell me, please!

106
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:58,223
Is he dead?

107
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,690
He's still alive!

108
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,223
Really?

109
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,090
The enemy took him
away. We don't know
where he is.

110
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,123
The enemy?

111
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,590
Oh.

112
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:15,290
Everyone. I want
you to listen.

113
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:19,023
Now that the Princess
has awakened, it's
important that you
hear the whole story.

114
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:22,756
Starting with this.
Luna, when the Princess
finally woke up, did
you notice that all

115
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,190
your memories
returned?

116
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,090
Yes, very clearly!

117
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,490
Wait a minute.
What are you
talking about?

118
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,556
He's talking about
our previous lives.

119
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,223
And more than that.
About the Moon Kingdom,
Silver Millennium.

120
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,090
A long time ago...

121
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,656
...there was a kingdom
called Silver Millennium,
that existed on the moon.

122
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:49,323
<i>It was a very</i>
<i>peaceful paradise.</i>

123
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:24,190
But then, something
terrible happened.
The earth was taken
over by an evil entity!

124
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,090
<i>Within a short time,</i>
<i>its forces attacked</i>
<i>us, to steal the</i>
<i>absolute power of the</i>

125
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:37,990
<i>Silver Crystal, stored</i>
<i>within Silver Millennium.</i>

126
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,456
The Kingdom was
destroyed in a
fierce battle. But
with the power of

127
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,490
the Silver Crystal,
we managed to seal
away the evil entity.

128
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:57,156
And, you four are the
reincarnations of the
Guardians who fought
that battle.

129
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,690
Wait just a minute!
Are you saying that
we're all beings from
the Moon World?

130
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:06,990
Not really. All of us
are beings of this
Earth. The mothers and
fathers that we know

131
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,556
are actually our
true parents.

132
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,923
That was the wish of
the Moon Queen. She
wanted the Princess
and you four girls

133
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:17,490
to live happily on
this plant as ordinary
humans. That's why she
chose this era for

134
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,256
reincarnation.
Because it was
so peaceful.

135
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,923
But it hasn't worked
out quite as she
hoped. Someone has
released that evil

136
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:25,356
entity into the world.

137
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,456
I see now. That
evil entity is the
Dark Kingdom's boss,
isn't it?

138
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,190
<i>That's correct. I'm</i>
<i>sorry it had to come</i>
<i>to this. If it weren't</i>
<i>for them, you would</i>

139
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:37,623
<i>have all lived your</i>
<i>lives peacefully as</i>
<i>normal young girls.</i>

140
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:42,190
But, if we don't
protect the Silver
Crystal and defeat
the enemy, there will

141
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,056
be no future for
any of us!

142
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,190
I feel that it's
our destiny to
fight this battle!

143
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:51,623
Do you all understand?
We can't allow the
tragedies of the past
to be repeated. We

144
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,356
have to work together
and defeat this threat!

145
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,990
Absolutely!

146
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:58,023
We'll fight
it together!

147
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:01,423
Sorry, but
count me out.

148
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:02,390
(surprised breath)

149
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,823
Sailor Moon?

150
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:08,156
I'm sorry, but I'm
sick of fighting!

151
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,890
Are you serious?

152
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:12,523
I'm sick of it!
It's all I ever
do!

153
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:15,890
How can you even
talk like that?
You're the Princess!

154
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:18,990
You say I'm the
Princess, but the
truth is, I don't
feel like one, and

155
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:23,856
I'm not even sure
I want to be one!
I'm Usagi, not
Serenity!

156
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,390
Usagi! Don't you
understand? You
have a mission!

157
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:32,523
I don't care about any
so-called mission! So
what if I had a previous
life?! It has nothing to

158
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,456
do with me right
now! Don't you get
it?! I'm tired of
risking our lives

159
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,323
fighting all
the time!

160
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,990
I keep thinking...

161
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:47,090
...What if all of
you end up just
like Mamoru?

162
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:53,223
I don't ever want
to see that happen!
I'm just so tired
of being sad!

163
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:06,790
How can you talk like
that?! Don't you know
what's at stake here?!
You're a coward, Usagi!

164
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:09,523
You're right!
I'm not strong
like you!

165
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,290
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,990
You crybaby! Mamoru
got hurt trying to
protect you! This is
how you pay him back?

167
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,323
I think Sailor Moon
just needs some time
to think about this.

168
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,656
But Artemis!

169
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,490
Give her a little
space, and I'm sure
the old Usagi will
return.

170
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:35,956
Until then, let's
be patient and
watch over her.

171
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,156
More importantly,
Luna, I found
the exit!

172
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,723
Great! We're not done
with our talk, but I
think we'd better get
out of here while we can.

173
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,123
Let's get going,
everybody.

174
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:51,790
(surprised gasp)

175
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,890
So you found
the exit, very
impressive.

176
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,256
Luna! Artemis! You
need to take cover
right now!

177
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,190
Okay, we
hear you!

178
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:11,090
You be careful,
Venus.

179
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,823
I'll try. You
three protect
the Princess!

180
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:17,390
Hold on! I'm
fighting with
you.

181
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,456
I appreciate that.

182
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,156
You're wasting
your time!

183
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,190
Don't underestimate us!

184
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:24,423
Supreme!

185
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,756
Thunder!

186
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,956
No way! He completely
absorbed my attack!

187
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,156
Hmph!

188
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:46,423
How about this?!
Crescent Beam!

189
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:55,223
It's no use. In this
dimension, he can
absorb every ounce of
energy we can summon

190
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:56,323
up to throw at him!

191
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,256
What are we
supposed to do?

192
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,356
Die!

193
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:03,056
Ahhh!

194
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,923
Arghh!

195
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:07,690
That's not enough
to defeat us!

196
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,790
Is that all you've
got, Kunzite?!

197
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,190
Not at all!
Take this!

198
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,623
Watch out!

199
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,923
(painful groans)

200
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:28,023
(gasp)

201
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:33,656
Look after our
Princess, Mercury.

202
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,156
(nervous breath)

203
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:40,690
Sailor Moon. You
need to accept
your destiny.

204
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:42,790
Be strong. You
can do this.

205
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:45,056
Stop wasting
my time.

206
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:47,823
Fire!

207
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,156
Soul!

208
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:59,056
You fool!

209
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:00,590
(scared gasp)

210
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,790
(forceful grunt)

211
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,390
(restrained groans)

212
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,390
Ahhh!

213
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:07,190
(gasp)

214
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:15,356
And now it's your
turn, Princess.

215
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,056
Not while I'm here.

216
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,690
Don't try to
interfere!

217
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,590
You're a stubborn
one.

218
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,656
(forceful grunt)

219
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,556
Ahhhh!

220
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,223
Mercury, are you
alright?! Hang
in there!

221
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,856
Sailor Moon, you
have to be brave.

222
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,123
Mercury...

223
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:36,956
<i>Usagi...</i>

224
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,723
(gasp)

225
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,790
Believe in
yourself.

226
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:40,956
Usagi...

227
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,290
You can do it!

228
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,656
<i>Rei...Minako...</i>
<i>Mako...Ami...</i>

229
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,623
I'll try!

230
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:58,090
<i>Tuxedo Mask, please</i>
<i>help me! Give me</i>
<i>the strength!</i>

231
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,656
Sailor Moon...

232
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,123
You're with me,
Tuxedo Mask.

233
00:20:03,323 --> 00:20:08,801
<i>Fight, Sailor Moon!</i>
<i>Hold it up! Raise</i>
<i>the Silver Crystal!</i>

234
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:11,234
Right!

235
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:18,867
So you've chosen to
plunge into hell on
your own, is that
right, Princess?

236
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:23,201
That's fine with
me! I will now
have my revenge...

237
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,334
...for Zoisite's
death!

238
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,267
(attacking grunt)

239
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:29,367
<i>Please!</i>

240
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:33,701
Silver Crystal
give me strength!

241
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,267
What is this?!

242
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,234
Ahhhh!

243
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:14,734
Damn her! This is
bad! She's beginning
to learn how to use
the Silver Crystal!

244
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:26,134
Serenity!

245
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:31,201
Endymion. She haunts
you. You still cannot
forget about her.

246
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:36,267
But no matter how much
you love Serenity, it
is a love that can
never be.

247
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:48,901
<i>Thank you so</i>
<i>much, Tuxedo</i>
<i>Mask.</i>

248
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,234
You saved us!

249
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:54,601
(happy gasp)

250
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:57,134
Thank you,
Sailor Moon.

251
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,534
Does this mean
you're still
gonna fight
with us?

252
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:06,334
That's right.
I will.

253
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,867
That completes stage
one, wouldn't you
agree.

254
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:11,301
Yeah, you did
great, Usagi!

255
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,801
And the same goes
for all of you.

256
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,867
<i>Remember, if we</i>
<i>continue working</i>
<i>together and do</i>
<i>our best, we can</i>

257
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:21,734
<i>overcome any</i>
<i>obstacle!</i>

258
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:32,201
I know he's out there
somewhere, Tuxedo Mask,
I'm not going to give
up until I find you.

259
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:09,471
No, it can't be!

260
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:14,952
<i>Ahem! A powerful new</i>
<i>enemy appears before</i>
<i>Usagi, who is still</i>
<i>trying to recover from</i>

261
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:20,686
<i>her emotional scar.</i>
<i>To her surprise, the</i>
<i>new enemy is Tuxedo</i>
<i>Mask! Poor Usagi!</i>

262
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,586
<i>What will become</i>
<i>of Sailor Moon?!</i>

263
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,986
Luna, you're enjoying
this, aren't you?!

264
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:31,119
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Usagi's Confusion: Is</i>
<i>Tuxedo Mask Evil?"</i>

265
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:34,186
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
