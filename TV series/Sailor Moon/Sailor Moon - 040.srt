1
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:02,366
I'm so excited! We
haven't taken a family
trip for ages, and we're
going to a hot springs!

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,100
What?! Why is there a
monster here?! How dare
you interfere with our
family-time together!

3
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:12,333
You're gonna pay for
this, I promise! I am
Sailor Moon!

4
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,500
And in the name of
my Dad, I'll punish
you!

5
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,433
Rise and shine, Usagi.
It's a two-day holiday,
so you can focus on
your studies to become

6
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,833
a princess.

7
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,900
Usagi?

8
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,333
Oh my goodness,
that's unusual.
She's already up!

9
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,133
Where is everybody?

10
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,166
Hm?

11
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,466
Good morning, Luna!
The family's taking a
trip to a hot springs!
We'll be back by tomorrow

12
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,266
night, so watch the
house while we're gone,
okay? I'll bring back
some hot-spring manju

13
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,433
for you! Love, Usagi!

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,966
Usagi!

15
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,933
<i>'The Legendary Lake Yokai:</i>
<i>The Bond of Usagi's Family!'</i>

16
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:14,866
Gosh, you're such a
weirdo, Usagi. Why'd
you leave a note behind
for that cat? It's not

17
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,166
like she can read.

18
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,500
Trust me, I have my
reasons. He's getting
away, you gotta shoot!

19
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,866
It's been so long
since we've all
been on a trip
together!

20
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,066
I'm not too thrilled
about having to spend
a night in a rustic hot
springs inn, though.

21
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,433
Ahhhh! You're
awful at this!
Give it!

22
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,866
Give that back to me!

23
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,033
(fighting grunts)

24
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,133
(gasp)

25
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,466
It's gonna break!

26
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,766
(sigh of relief)

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,300
Ugh!

28
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,433
(chuckling)

29
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:45,133
Now why are you getting
so upset? Did some boy
you like give that to you?

30
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,933
Huh? Umm...
Yeah, something
like that.

31
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,433
What?! A boyfriend?!

32
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,066
(frightened screams)

33
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,133
Dad, what are
you doing?!

34
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,100
<i>Honey, hold</i>
<i>the wheel!</i>

35
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,966
Usagi, have you been
secretly dating someone?!

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,066
No! That's not what's
going on! I promise!

37
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,300
You need to keep
your eyes on the
road, dear!

38
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,300
Well, that's a
relief, anyway.

39
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,466
(chuckles)

40
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,900
For a minute, I
sure was nervous!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

41
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,033
(relieved sighs)

42
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:13,100
Wow! It's so pretty!

43
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:17,633
(giggle)

44
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,666
And it's so
peaceful here!

45
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,033
That's because
there's nothing
here.

46
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:26,333
Actually, there are
beautiful memories
here. This lake is
where your mom and

47
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,233
I first met, many
years ago.

48
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,266
Oh dear. That's
ancient history.

49
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,800
(gasp)

50
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,866
It's Mamoru's
music box.

51
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,133
Mamoru...

52
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,333
Usagi, it's
time to go.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,233
Is something wrong,
sweetheart?

54
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,666
No, everything's
just fine, Mom.

55
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:26,366
Kunzite, is this the
lake where you detected the
abnormal energy reading?

56
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,233
Yes, my Queen. The energy
is very similar to that of
our monsters. There is a
slight difference, but it

57
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,433
is still very powerful.

58
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:38,033
I see. Endymion, I
want you to go check
it out immediately.

59
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,133
Yes.

60
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:42,700
<i>Queen Beryl...</i>

61
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,700
Hm?

62
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:48,100
He's been acting
strangely the past
few days. Do you

63
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:52,000
suppose he's beginning
to finally realize that
his memory has been
erased?

64
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:58,266
Unlikely. But we should
be cautious. I want you
to follow him, observe,
and then report back to me.

65
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,200
Yes, my queen.

66
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:05,600
By all measures, Endymion
is completely under our
control. I seriously
doubt he has any

67
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,700
suspicions about
his past.

68
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,800
(giggling)

69
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,266
This is incredible!
What a view!

70
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,900
Not too bad for a
rustic hot springs
inn, wouldn't you say?

71
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,033
Shingo, what's wrong?
Come over and join us.

72
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:26,100
You'll like it, believe
me! It really feels great!

73
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,000
No way! It's a
co-ed bath!

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,133
What are you so
embarrassed about,
son? There's no one
here but your family.

75
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,933
Hurry and come in,
before you catch cold!

76
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,800
Umm...
Hmm...

77
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,533
(sneaky giggle)

78
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,733
Chyaah!

79
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,600
(giggling)

80
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,166
Ha! I got you!

81
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,533
Oh yeah?!

82
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:47,566
Ahhh! Shingo,
give that back
right now!

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,666
Stop fooling
around, you two!

84
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,233
Oh, let them play.

85
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,533
If you don't give
that back, you'll
be sorry!

86
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,066
Really? Come
and get it!

87
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,366
Shingo!

88
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,033
This view's incredible!
I can see the valley
and the whole lake!

89
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:00,766
Huh?

90
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,133
Got it! You dropped
your guard!

91
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,933
There's someone on
the shore! Look!
Down there!

92
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,266
Huh? Really?

93
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:10,566
(gasp)

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,666
It can't be!

95
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,466
It is! It's Mamoru!

96
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,700
Agh! Wait, please!

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,700
Sis?

98
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,466
What's with her?
She's acting weirder
than usual.

99
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,600
(gasp)

100
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,200
Mamoru!

101
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,966
It's not him.

102
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,800
(gasp)

103
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,433
It's playing again.
The music box.

104
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,200
Huh?

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,933
(gasp)

106
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,866
Mamoru...

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,866
That melody. Why is
it resonating inside
my soul?

108
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,533
Please, Mamoru! It's
me, Usagi! Are you
really here?

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,766
Do you know me...
...at all?

110
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,100
Mamoru?
Usagi?

111
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,533
I don't know them.
Those names mean
nothing to me.

112
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,200
How can that be?!

113
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,133
Mamoru, it's me!

114
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,166
Please! Don't you
recognize me?

115
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,500
<i>Usagi!</i>

116
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,466

<i>Usagi, what's the</i>
<i>matter? Why did you</i>
<i>run off so suddenly?</i>

120
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:52,400
Sorry about that.
It was nothing.

121
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,866
Oh. There's the Legend
of the Lovers. Is that
what you were looking at?

122
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,633
Huh?
What's that?

123
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:05,766
It's an ancient tale
about this lake. A
long, long time ago, a
young man fell in love

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,066
with an angel who had
descended from the
heavens.

125
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:14,566
Another woman who loved
the young man was angry
that he didn't return
her feelings. Consumed

126
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,100
by hate and jealousy,
this woman turned into
a monster, and began
attacking the villagers.

127
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:25,866
The angel and the young
man used the power of
their love to seal the
monster away in the lake.

128
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,633
But having used up all
their strength, the two
died, and ascended to
heaven.

129
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,633
It's the story of
their love for
each other.

130
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,833
Sealed away in
this lake.

131
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,500
Come on, let's go
back. You'll catch
cold.

132
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,100
(giggle)

133
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,800
'Kay, Mom!

134
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,500
You're such a baby.

135
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,200
Mmm...

136
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,833
<i>Listen, Usagi. Promise</i>
<i>me something, if you</i>
<i>ever do fall in love.</i>

137
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:56,533
Huh?

138
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:01,533
Promise that you'll
bring the boy over and
introduce him to your
father and myself, so

139
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,800
we can get to know him.

140
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,033
Yes. I promise.

141
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll do that,
one day...

142
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,800
But it might
be a while.

143
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,666
A monster sealed
away in the lake.

144
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:27,866
I wonder if that could
be the source of the
unusual vibrations.

145
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:38,866
How perceptive. You
may very well have
uncovered the source of
this mysterious energy.

146
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,500
(growing growl)

147
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,933
Hear me, bitter soul
sealed in this lake.

148
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,600
Now, I command you
to return to life!

149
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:00,800
(sharp grunt)

150
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,766
Arise! Oh
ancient spirit!

151
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,266
(gasp)

152
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,233
Give him back!

<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

156
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,782
Give him back!

157
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:08,782
(angry growl)

158
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,782
(amused chuckle)

159
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:18,682
Well now, Endymion. With
your endless curiosity,
you've raised a grudge
from the past.

160
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,249
What will you do?

161
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:24,182
(fierce scream)

162
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:34,782
(fierce yell)

163
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:37,016
Give him back!

164
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:54,449
(attack yell)

165
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,082
Wait! Where are
you going?

166
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,116
Huh?

167
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:04,882
Mamoru, you're
so near, yet...

168
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:09,116
Usagi, is something
the matter?

169
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:09,816
(startled gasp)

170
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:12,549
Oh! It's nothing!

171
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:17,549
I was admiring how
beautiful the moon is.
It's perfect tonight!

172
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:20,116
It is beautiful, now
that you mention it.

173
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,049
It's so pretty, it
just makes me wanna
cry.

174
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:31,582
I'm gonna go soak in
the hot springs and
watch the moon a
while before dinner!

175
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:33,149
If you'll excuse me!

176
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:38,816
She's a mystery. I'm
so confused. I mean,
there are times when
she seems like a

177
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,682
totally different
person.

178
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:41,749
Yeah...

179
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,816
I won't give up,
Mamoru. Even if you
have no memory of me.

180
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:48,882
I've got to find a
way to get through
to you!

181
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:53,149
<i>Give him back!</i>

182
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,649
What was that?

183
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:56,516
Give him back!

184
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:57,216
Huh?

185
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:00,149
No way! Who are you?!

186
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,782
Usagi! What on earth
is that thing?!

187
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:04,682
<i>It's some kind of</i>
<i>horrible creature!</i>

188
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:07,016
It's a monster!
Watch out everyone!

189
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:07,982
(attack roar)

190
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,216
Get down!

191
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,649
Give him back!

192
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:12,549
Ahhhh!

193
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:13,582
(frightened gasps)

194
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:14,849
Run for it!

195
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:16,616
(scared screams)

196
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,916
<i>Look at the trees!</i>

197
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:19,816
It must be some
kind of poison!

198
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,249
That's it! Now
I'm angry!

199
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:26,749
Hey you! What's your
big problem! You're
totally ruining our
family trip!

200
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,649
Go away! Leave
us alone!

201
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:29,982
<i>Usagi, don't</i>
<i>confront her!</i>

202
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,649
Agh! That's right!
Let your dad handle
this!

203
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,549
Hey! Stay away from
my family! You monster!

204
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,849
(scared whine)

205
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:40,849
(aggressive growls)

206
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:41,782
Ahhh!

207
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,682
Look out!

208
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,449
(struggling breaths)

209
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:48,482
Ahhh!

210
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:49,482
Dad!

211
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,216
Moon...

212
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,482
Honey, are you
all right?!

213
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,916
Look at this
tacky freak show!

214
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:04,682
Don't call him that!
He's a good guy...

215
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:06,182
...I think.

216
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,982
Back off, creature!
I'm not gonna let
you go and hurt
innocent people!

217
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,216
(growling)

218
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:14,982
Give him back!

219
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:20,649
Do you think you can
walk all right, dear?

220
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:22,216
<i>Oh, my back!</i>

221
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:26,149
I want to go and
help Tuxedo Mask,
but I can't transform
in front of my family!

222
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,416
Now's your chance!
Run for it!

223
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:31,016
(painful grunt)

224
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,382
Tuxedo Mask!

225
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,116
(angry growl)

226
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:37,116
Ahh!

227
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,649
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

228
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:40,516

Sailor Jupiter!

Sailor Mars!

231
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:44,916
Sailor Mercury!

232
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,116
We are the Sailor
Guardians!

233
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:51,582
Wow! The Pretty Guardians
who fight for love and
justice!

234
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,882
Hey, that's my
catchphrase!

235
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,416
Give him back!

236
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,749
Bubble!

237
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:04,516
Spray!

238
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,716
(screaming)

239
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:10,449
Come on! Now's
our chance! The
inn is that way!

240
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,749
Stay together!
it's not that far!

241
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:15,482
Please be
careful, guys.

(angry yell)

244
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,082
Hey monster,
over here!

245
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:06,616
You can't just run
amok out here! You
have to pay for
threatening innocent

246
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:09,449
tourists and ruining
the Tsukino Family's
vacation!

247
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:12,582
In the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

248
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,016
Tuxedo Mask. You
protected Usagi!

249
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:20,849
You're still the same
good person that I
love so much.

250
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,949
Ahhhhh!

251
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:23,616
(gasps)

252
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:24,682
Sailor Moon!

253
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,882
Crescent Beam!

254
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,482
Supreme!

255
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,382
Thunder!

256
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,516
(painful scream)

257
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:46,749
We got her!

258
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,416
(angry growl)

259
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,682
What?!

260
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:59,416
I don't understand,
why didn't our attacks
work on her?!

261
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,349
Alright, in that case!

262
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,249
Moon Tiara!

263
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:11,282
Action!

264
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:15,516
(painful scream)

265
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:18,049
That should do it!

266
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:18,916
(surprised gasp)

267
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,882
(angry growl)

268
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:26,316
Oh come on! That's
not fair! What kind
of monster is she?!

269
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:31,849
Wait. This evil aura.
That's no ordinary
monster. She's an
evil yokai, born from

270
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:33,616
years of strong
jealousy.

271
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,749
You're right about
that, Sailor Guardians.
The truth of the matter
is, I am the one to blame

272
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:43,249
for awakening this
ancient yokai. You
must stay out of this.

273
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:46,582
That makes sense,
except yokai are my
area of expertise.

274
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:53,249
Cleanse and dispel this
yokai with flames of
purification! Rin!
Pyo! To! Sha! Kai! Jin!

275
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,916
Retsu! Zai! Zen!

276
00:18:55,816 --> 00:19:00,616
Ahh-Ahhhh! Evil
spirit! Be exorcised!

277
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,416
Fire!

278
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:09,782
Soul!

279
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:13,349
(painful scream)

280
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:14,249
Oh, wow!

281
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:15,716
Get her,
Sailor Moon!

282
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,582
Oh! Uh, right!

283
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:31,416
Moon Healing

284
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:35,349
Ahhhhh!

285
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,516
Refresh!

286
00:19:57,182 --> 00:20:02,249
She's going to heaven,
released at last from the
eons of torture brought
on by her jealousy.

287
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:03,616
She's beautiful!

288
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,249
Tuxedo Mask!

289
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:45,549
I was going to say
that you interfered
needlessly, but I'll
let it go this time.

290
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:46,682
Farewell!

291
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:48,649
Don't go!

292
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,482
<i>Tuxedo Mask...</i>

293
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:56,349
Well, Endymion. You
are an odd fellow.

294
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:03,449
Usagi! Where are you?!
Answer me! Hey sis!
Where are you?!

295
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,382
Usagi! Say
something!

296
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,282
Tell us you're
alright!

297
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:10,816
Come on, sis! What
if the monster got
her?

298
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:14,449
If I had known this
was gonna happen, I
would have let her
play with my game.

299
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,316
Okay, hand it over!

300
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,182
Usagi!

301
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,749
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

302
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:18,749
Usagi!

303
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,449
Oh, you had us
so worried!

304
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,116
Sorry, Mom.

305
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:29,282
Dad risked his life to
protect me. Mom thinks
about me every minute.
And Shingo's a pain,

306
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:32,382
but I still love
him. It's great to
have a family.

307
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,149
Ah, this feels
so good.

308
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:36,616
You said it.

309
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,382
Where are you,
Tuxedo Mask?

310
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:46,182
<i>Usagi...</i>

311
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,482
Chin up. Everything
will work out.

312
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,149
Thanks, Mako.

313
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:56,049
But I'll be fine. When
I think about it, I have
all these great friends
who care about me!

314
00:21:56,082 --> 00:22:00,316
I've been wondering
about something, though.
What brought all of you out
here in the first place?

315
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:02,282
Luna said that
you were here.

316
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:04,149
And of course...

317
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:06,016
...Not one of us
wanted you...

318
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,982
...to have all
the fun, Usagi!

319
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:10,049
(giggling)

320
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:12,782
Hey! I got water
up my nose!

321
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,149
<i>You must've</i>
<i>deserved it!</i>

322
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,249
Stop it!

323
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:18,016
<i>You guys, I think</i>
<i>she got the message.</i>

324
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,249
(giggling)

325
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:15,662
Usagi, we've got
trouble! Ryo Urawa
is in danger! It looks
like they're planning

326
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:17,629
to revive the Seven
Great Monsters!

327
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,229
<i>What?! That's crazy!</i>

328
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:21,762
Ami is protecting
him alone! Now
let's go!

329
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:26,062
<i>But, I can't go</i>
<i>outside because it's</i>
<i>so cold! Take care of</i>
<i>things for me, will</i>

330
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,362
<i>you, Luna?</i>
<i>Thanks a lot!</i>

331
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,495
Usagi!

332
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,162
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"I Won't Run Away from</i>
<i>Love Anymore: Ami</i>
<i>versus Mamoru!"</i>

333
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:37,095
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
