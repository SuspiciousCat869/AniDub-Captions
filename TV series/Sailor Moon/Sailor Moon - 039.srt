1
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,666
Unforgivable! How dare
you ruin everyone's
favorite winter sport
by turning it into a

2
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,500
weapon to torment
innocent young girls
who are just excited
to be skating on ice!

3
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:13,266
Well I'm going to make
sure to put a stop to
that! I am Sailor Moon!

4
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,233
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish you.

5
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,266
Oh, wow!

6
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,100
Every move is so smooth.
No wonder Janelyn and
Misha are Olympic Gold
Medalists!

7
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:37,666
(happy laugh)

8
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,033
Flawless!

9
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,700
(falling grunt)

10
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,166
Usagi!

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,066
(awkward laugh)

12
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, maybe her interest
in figure-skating is a
sign that she's finally
serious about becoming

13
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,166
more princess-like.

14
00:02:56,133 --> 00:03:01,166
You might be right,
seeing as how figure-
skating was one the most
popular activities in the

15
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,333
Moon Kingdom.

16
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,633
<i>Yeah, and the Princess</i>
<i>was especially good</i>
<i>at it.</i>

17
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,800
What?! Really?!

18
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,733
(happy laughter)

19
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:16,733
I guess I'm just one of
the lucky ones who happens
to be blessed with an
over-abundance of talents.

20
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,333
(giggling)

21
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:29,300
<i>"Paired with a Monster:</i>
<i>Mako, the Ice Skating Queen."</i>

22
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,200
Figure skating...

23
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:38,366
Why not use what has
always been the most
popular sport among the
girls in the Moon Kingdom.

24
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,133
To entice Sailor Moon.
And while she's busy
participating in the
sport, you will steal

25
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,500
her Silver Crystal.

26
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,300
I stake my
honor on it.

27
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:50,433
<i>How noble of you.</i>
Staking your honor
on such a dirty plan.

28
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,400
Ha-ha!

29
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,500
Endymion!

30
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,200
If you have any pride as
a warrior, you should
have the courage to
challenge her head-on!

31
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:02,333
Battles only have meaning
if they're won. If you
hadn't interfered with
my previous plans, we'd

32
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,433
already have the
Silver Crystal by now!

33
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:07,033
Ha! Don't be so sure.

34
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,066
(angry growl)

35
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:08,833
(angry growl)

36
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,666
All right! Enough!

37
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,333
Kunzite, go ahead with
this plan of yours. I
expect this one to work.

38
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,633
It will.

39
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,366
(painful grunt)

40
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,666
Just what were you
trying to do, Misha!

41
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't lay this on me.
Your timing on that
jump was totally off!

42
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,533
<i>It was your fault!</i>

43
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,633
Damn it! I'm
done for today!

44
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,400
Don't walk out on me!

45
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:40,466
Janelyn, as an Olympic
Gold Medalist pair, the
world expects us to be
the best of the best!

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,633
But that's not happening
anymore with you. It's
time for me to move on
and find a new partner

47
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,133
who can keep up
up with me.

48
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,133
Well, I was about to
say the same thing!

49
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,400
I won't allow you
two to split up.

50
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,133
Huh?!

51
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,966
Congratulations. You
have been chosen to
become minions to serve
the Dark Kingdom.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,166
Huh...

53
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,900
Wow! Look at that!
Huh,I've never heard
of this skating rink.

54
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:07,500
<i>That's because it's</i>
<i>brand new! This is</i>
<i>the grand-opening day!</i>
<i>And the best part is</i>

55
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,366
<i>that Janelyn and Misha</i>
<i>are going to be giving</i>
<i>coaching lessons!</i>

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
That's amazing!

57
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,200
That's great for you
two, buy why drag all
of us along?

58
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:18,233
I really should go
home now. I need to
study for the national
practice exam, being

59
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,366
held tomorrow morning.

60
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,133
Well, you see
the thing is...

61
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,466
...They're offering
free admission, but
only to girls who enter
in groups of five.

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,066
Mm-hmm!

63
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,633
Groups of
five, really?

64
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,600
But why?

65
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,266
Well...

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,100
It sounds suspicious.
Don't you want to
check it out and see
what's going on?!

67
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,366
Just ask and you shall
be answered in the order
in which you ask!

68
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,600
I believe the phrase
is 'ask and it will
be given to you.'

69
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:39,500
Huh?!

70
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:40,866
You sure about that?

71
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,266
It doesn't matter
which it is. Let's
go ask!

72
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:58,100
Wow! Look at the
number of girls who
showed up for this.

73
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,133
It's their chance
to skate with Gold
Medalists.

74
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,600
Last time we were in
a rink was ages ago.

75
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,066
Yeah! Hey,
where's Usagi?

76
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,800
Everyone, hold
on! Here I come!

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,333
That really hurt!

78
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,200
Same thing
as always.

79
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,366
At least she's
consistent.

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,966
Usagi, are
you okay?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Honestly! She's
so embarrassing!

82
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:22,133
Janelyn! Misha!

83
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,200
Where! Where! Where!

84
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,800
Ahh! It's really them!

85
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,066
They're skating!

86
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,066
<i>They're great!</i>

87
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,866
Ah! Misha!

88
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,866
He looks just
like him...

89
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
(crowd cheering)

90
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:09,100
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
Wonderful!

91
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:14,233
Hello and welcome
everyone! Thank you
for your enthusiastic
reception. Now let's

92
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,000
skate together and
have some fun!

93
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:16,933
<i>All right!</i>

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes-yes-yes!

95
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:23,166
All figure skaters must
start with the basics.
Step number one is
getting used to the ice!

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
Yeah!

97
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah!

98
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,466
(giggle)

99
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,100
Okay, how about you
and your group be the
first to try out the
new rink!

100
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,533
Ahh! Yes Ma'am!

101
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,133
I don't have my
skates on yet!

102
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,233
Well, hurry up
and put them on!

103
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,166
I'm trying!

104
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,466
You're so
slow, Usagi!

105
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,033
<i>Aw! Stop being</i>
<i>so mean, Rei!</i>

106
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay. Here I
go. There!

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,233
Wait for me!

108
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,366
Uh, Usagi?

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,666
What is it?

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Is this your first
time? Have you never
skated on ice before?

111
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,700
(nervous laugh)

112
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,133
I'm gonna be just
fine! You see, I was
brilliant skater in my
previous life as the

113
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,233
Moon Princess.
This'll be a
breeze!

114
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,933
Uh. Well, if
you say so.

115
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:07,933
Huh?

116
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:13,700
Look at Mako!

117
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:14,966
She's so good!

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,200
Not bad. But
watch me!

119
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm making my debut.
It'll be spectacular!
Ready to applaud?

120
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,933
(falling grunts)

121
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:31,966
Oh my goodness!

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,133
I'm not surprised.

123
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,300
This can't be
happening.

124
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:36,966
(goofy scream)

125
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,200
Wait! Now I think
I've got it!

126
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,400
(goofy scream)

127
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
This is painful
to watch...

128
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,300
<i>I didn't have high</i>
<i>hopes for Usagi on</i>
<i>ice, but this is</i>
<i>worse than I thought.</i>

129
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:09,866
Come to think of it.
In the Moon Kingdom,
Sailor Jupiter was a
skating pro, every

130
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,633
bit as good as
the Princess!

131
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,933
Mako looks so
amazing...

132
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,033
(crowd cheering)

133
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,300
(embarrassed chuckle)

134
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,100
That was very
impressive!

135
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,633
Everybody get on the
ice! Let's skate!

136
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,633
Yeah!

137
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,866
Hmph!

138
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,700
Hmph!

139
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,600
You can do it!

140
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,833
Almost there!

141
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh-hh! So much for
my spectacular debut!

142
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:51,766
Ahhh!

143
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,166
Hmm...not her.

144
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,833
Or her.

145
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,200
<i>Master Kunzite!</i>

146
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,033
You should be looking
for agility and athletic
skills in order to find
Sailor Moon.

147
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,666
How is your progress?

148
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,866
<i>Don't worry.</i>

149
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,633
As a Gold Medalist, I
know what to look for.
I'll find her.

150
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,700
<i>Good...</i>

151
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:24,933
But do not underestimate
the Sailor Guardians,
Janelyn. Be sure to stay
alert.

152
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,166
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

153
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:30,000
Not her...

154
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,066
Or her...

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Oh?

156
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,933
Huh! There's no way
this could be Sailor
Moon!

157
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,966
I heard she might be
a little bit clumsy.
But this klutz is
beyond that.

158
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:44,800
Huh?

159
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,533
Misha?

160
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,633
You're a wonderful
skater. I'd like to
skate with you.

161
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,966
Well, um, I'm good,
too. I'd love to
skate with you.

162
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,833
(obnoxious giggle)

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,166
He's so dreamy.

164
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:04,600
The way his hair flows,
reminds me of the guy
who broke my heart.

165
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,633
Is this the
free coaching?

166
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,700
She's good. Is this
girl Sailor Moon?

167
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,000
All right.
Here we go.

168
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:21,733
Huh?

169
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,166
Sorry, I'm
so heavy!

170
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,866
It's all right.

171
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,200
Let me try!

172
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,966
(amazement chatter)

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,733
She's able to lift
a man into the air
while skating?!

174
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:41,066
That's the first
time any female has
successfully done
that.

175
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,733
Incredible!

176
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,800
You're the one.

177
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,533
Misha! You can't shut
me out! Were you really
serious about breaking up?

178
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:13,766
Attention everyone,
the free coaching
sessions for today
are done.

179
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,433
<i>Please gather up your</i>
<i>belongings and leave</i>
<i>the rink immediately.</i>

180
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:18,833
But why?

181
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,633
This is ridiculous!

182
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,200
Well I...gotta
go. Thanks for
the lesson.

183
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
I can't let you go.

184
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:33,566
You're too special.
You're the partner
that I've been
searching for.

185
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,633
Really? You're sure?

186
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,566
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

187
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:03,568
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

188
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:15,035
Finally, they're
coming now.

189
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,702
Where are Usagi
and Mako?

190
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:20,868
Mako decided to stay
behind. She's getting
some special coaching
from Misha.

191
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:22,135
I'm so jealous!

192
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,168
Oh. Where did Usagi
go? I thought she
was right behind us.

193
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:28,602
Yeah, well, she's
such a slowpoke!

194
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:30,868
(gasps)

195
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:33,635
What is this?

196
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:34,968
Something's not right!

197
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,535
It's possible that this
is a trap, set up by the
Dark Kingdom.

198
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,735
I hope not!

199
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:43,802
Da-da-da-da-done!

200
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:48,968
No way am I leaving!
Not before I get my
free coaching, anyway!

201
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:54,168
<i>That girl has such poise</i>
<i>and skates so gracefully,</i>
<i>like she's been doing</i>
<i>this all her life...</i>

202
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,768
...with my Misha!

203
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,768
Well, forget that!

204
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,635
Boingy-boingy-boing-

205
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:02,635
(falling grunt)

206
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:06,102
That really hurt.

207
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,135
<i>What's this?</i>

208
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:10,602
Ahghh!

209
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,035
It can't be!

210
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:14,935
Ahh!!

211
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:16,968
Ahhhh!

212
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:23,935
Are you sure this is
your first time figure
skating? I think you're
hiding something. Tell

213
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,735
me the truth. It's
okay, you can trust
me.

214
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,402
Oh, Misha...

215
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,202
Misha!

216
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:32,968
(gasp)

217
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,968
Misha, is this your
way of telling me
we're really done?

218
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:42,468
I'd rather kill you
right now than allow
an amateur like her
to have you forever!

219
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:42,935
Huh?

220
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,068
Janelyn!

221
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:49,968
Run away,
right now!

222
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,668
Don't worry about
her. Calm down.

223
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:55,768
Skating with her all
day was just my way
of testing this girl
to find out if she was

224
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:56,902
Sailor Moon.

225
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:57,702
Huh?!

226
00:14:58,735 --> 00:14:59,602
Liar!

227
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,668
Hear me out! She's
a wonderful skater,
but it takes years
of hard work to

228
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,568
produce a perfect pair.
You're the only partner
for me. You know that!

229
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,102
What?! But
you said...

230
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:10,435
Misha!

231
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:12,735
I can't stop!
It's too late!

232
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,402
Get away from
my Misha!

233
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,102
A monster!

234
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,402
Janelyn!

235
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,502
Triple Axel Kick!

236
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,068
(painful scream)

237
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:35,668
(painful grunt)

238
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,468
J-Janelyn!

239
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,802
Come here. My Misha...

240
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,702
We're partners
forever and ever.

241
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,868
The ultimate pair.
Blended as one when
we skate.

242
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,802
(painful yell)

243
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,368
Misha was a
monster too?!

244
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:05,768
(triumphant laugh)

245
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:09,768
We are amazing! The
best pair-skaters in
the world!

246
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,435
Oh, Misha!

247
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,735
Janelyn!

248
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:15,902
Together we are
Zoilingeller!

249
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:22,068
Now that you've seen
who we actually are,
we can't allow you
to live.

250
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:23,335
No! Wait!

251
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,968
(evil laughter)

252
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:28,535
Combination Jump!

253
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,802
Attack mode!
Ready!

254
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:31,635
(feared gasps)

255
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,335
(painful scream)

256
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:39,568
(evil laughter)

257
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:40,535
Mako!

258
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:41,635
How dare they?!

259
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:46,768
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

260
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:21,002
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice! I am Sailor
Moon!

261
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,635
Hah-ha-ha-ha!

262
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,935
I can finish
her off!

263
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,202
Be my guest!

264
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:28,402
For making a weapon of
the graceful sport of
figure skating...

265
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,302
Huh?!

266
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:33,735
...And taking delight in
using it to torment innocent
girls. I, Sailor Moon, will
never forgive you!

267
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:36,935
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish you.

268
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,235
Sailor Moon!

269
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,602
We've looked for you!

270
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:41,968
And now that you're
here, we'll be taking
the Silver Crystal!

271
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:43,968
We'll see about that!

272
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,335
(attacking yell)

273
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,002
Agh-agh-ahh!

274
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:55,235
(laughing)

275
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,535
What gives?! I transform
and I still can't skate?

276
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:00,635
Sailor Moon!

277
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,235
Time to die!

278
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:03,535
Death!

279
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:04,702
Spiral!

280
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:05,768
Ughh!!

281
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,235
Die!

282
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:13,502
Huh?!

283
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:14,368
That's...

284
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:18,502
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask!
I knew you'd be coming
to save me!

285
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,768
Don't get the
wrong idea...

286
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:24,902
<i>...We're still enemies.</i>
<i>However, there's no honor</i>
<i>in defeating you by</i>
<i>involving the innocent.</i>

287
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,668
Huh?

288
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:29,868
Once I stop these monsters
from their senseless
rampage, I'll be taking
your Silver Crystal.

289
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:30,668
No way!

290
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:33,668
Master Endymion!
Do not interfere!

291
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:36,402
We'll show no mercy!
Not even to you!

292
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:39,235
You actually think
you'll be able to
beat me?

293
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,568
Uhh, I wouldn't provoke
them if I were you.

294
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:42,368
How interesting...

295
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,835
Don't forget we
are Gold Medalists!

296
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:46,602
See?!

297
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,235
Double spin kick!

298
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:50,368
Time to jump.

299
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:51,144
What?!

300
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,202
Here we go!

301
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:53,235
Jump!

302
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,268
Ahhh!

303
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,768
Hey! I'm actually
skating! Ha-ha!

304
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,902
Not for long!

305
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:03,835
Agh! They're coming!

306
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,368
Jump as high
as you can!

307
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:07,768
Give me a break!
I can barely stay
upright!

308
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,535
Die!

309
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:11,468
Ahhh! Do or die!

310
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,268
(leaping grunt)

311
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:19,168
I actually jumped!
I did it all by
myself! I am truly
amazing!

312
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:22,335
Nice jump! You did
good, Sailor Moon!

313
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:23,335
Ah! Thanks!

314
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:23,835
(giggles)

315
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:26,835
Sit! Spin! Kick!

316
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:27,668
Ahhh!

317
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:29,602
Ahhh!

318
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,468
(evil laugh)

319
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:34,268
The time has come!
It ends here!

320
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:37,468
Supreme!

321
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:43,768
Thunder!

322
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:46,768
(painful screams)

323
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,302
Sailor Jupiter!

324
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:52,368
Please, you've gotta
stop this! Turn back
into your former selves!

325
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:53,868
(painful groans)

326
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,335
Curse you!

327
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,202
(attack yell)

328
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,835
Everyone!

329
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,335
(evil laugh)

330
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,835
The gang's all here.
Isn't this lovely.

331
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:11,502
How pathetic, Endymion.
If you hadn't interfered,

332
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:13,468
you wouldn't share
in their fate.

333
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,335
Hnnh!

334
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,368
Aghh!

335
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:29,668
What's going on?!

336
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:33,768
(shivering)

337
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,335
What is this,
Master Kunzite?

338
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:40,302
<i>(evil laugh)</i>

339
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:43,568
This is Absolute
Zero Ice Hell!

340
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:49,635
Very soon you'll all turn
into lovely ice statues.
Then I'll simply return
and recover the Silver

341
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:51,602
Crystal once
and for all!

342
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,135
Damn you, Kunzite!

343
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:55,368
It's so cold!

344
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:57,302
I can't take
it anymore!

345
00:20:57,335 --> 00:21:01,135
(shivering)

346
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:06,402
That's it!

347
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,135
<i>We're saved!</i>

348
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,135
(relieved sigh)

349
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:21,368
(attack roar)

350
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:23,135
Sailor Moon,
you'd better
hurry!

351
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:24,068
Huh?!

352
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,068
Right!

353
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:36,635
Moon Healing
Escalation!

354
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:41,368
(painful screams)

355
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:44,002
<i>Refresh!</i>

356
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:47,768
Janelyn...

357
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:49,402
Misha...

358
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,235
Wait a minute!
Tuxedo Mask?!

359
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:58,035
Where did he go?!
Tuxedo Mask, please
come back!

360
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:06,235
Uh, Mako?
Are you okay?

361
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:07,635
Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:12,302
Don't worry! I'm not
gonna let being dumped
by Misha bother me
forever.

363
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:13,235
(sigh)

364
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:16,602
But I do need to hurry
and find another guy.

365
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,535
Huh?

366
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:22,135
How dreamy!

367
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:23,935
Huh?!

368
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,635
I just love the shape
of his nose! The guy who
broke my heart had one
that was just like that.

369
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:32,602
Mako! Give us a
break, will ya?!

370
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:17,708
Ah! Nothing like enjoying
an ice-cold milk after a
soak at the hot springs!

371
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:20,041
<i>Usagi, will you please</i>
<i>put some clothes on first!</i>

372
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,141
L-Luna?!

373
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:22,975
<i>So, why did you try</i>
<i>to leave me at home?</i>

374
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:24,375
Sorry, no cats
allowed.

375
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:26,341
<i>Aww! That's not fair!</i>

376
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:32,208
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"The Legendary Lake Yokai:</i>
<i>The Bond of Usagi's Family."</i>

377
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:35,141
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
