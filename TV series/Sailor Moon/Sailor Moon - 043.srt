00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:03,066
Dear Dark Kingdom, I'm
writing you today to
inform you that I,
Sailor Moon, am officially

2
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,200
quitting the Sailor
Guardians and like to
join your group. Yours
truly, Sailor Moon.

3
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:13,166
Ha! Now I can finally
have my revenge on Sailor
Mars for the way she
bullies me all the time!

4
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,500
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish
you!

5
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,900
<i>We've got you now,</i>
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

6
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,866
You might as well
give up, Sailor Moon!

7
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
<i>No way!</i>

8
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,566
Oh, really?

9
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,266
Then we've got
no choice!

10
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,500
This is it,
stupid girl.

11
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,500
Sailor Moon!

12
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,166
In the name of Mars,
I'll chastise you!

13
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,166
Fire!

14
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,666
Soul!

15
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,266
Ahhh!

16
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,166
Whoops! Guess
I overdid it.

17
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>"Usagi Abandoned: The</i>
<i>Falling Out of the</i>
<i>Sailor Guardians."</i>

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
(shocked gasp)

19
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:41,833
Hmmm...

20
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,300
That was another unusual
burst of energy.

21
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:50,566
In these past few days,
there have been several
energy reactions similar
to that one.

22
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,100
<i>I suspect it might have</i>
<i>something to do with</i>
<i>the Silver Crystal.</i>

23
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:55,533
How so?

24
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,833
<i>We should have an</i>
<i>answer shortly.</i>

25
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,100
You there,
Oniwabandana?

26
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:00,766
Sir!

27
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,233
Oniwabandana, at
your service!

28
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:09,000
So have you figured out
what's the cause of the
unusual energy readings.

29
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,500
Ban Ban!

30
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,633
See for yourself!

31
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,733
What's this?

32
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,266
Ban Ban!

33
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,533
Oh!

34
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:21,733
Huh!

35
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,900
<i>The source of that</i>
<i>unusual energy turned</i>
<i>out to be the Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians.</i>

36
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,533
It's happening because
Sailor Moon had a
falling out with the
other Guardians and

37
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,966
they're fighting.
Ban Ban.

38
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,900
Is this true?

39
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,900
Sailor Moon and the
Guardians are at
odds with each other?

40
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,866
That's peculiar.
This could be a
trap...

41
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Kunzite, what do
you make of this?

42
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,233
I'd like some
additional proof.

43
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,700
I agree.

44
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,566
Go back there
and watch them!

45
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,566
<i>As you wish!</i>
<i>Ban ban.</i>

46
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,233
Ban ban...

47
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,066
Who's there?!

48
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,900
(startled gasp)

49
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,266
Ahh! It's a monster!

50
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,766
I'll be taking
these jewels!
Ban ban!

51
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,700
Ahhh!

52
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,700
(terrified gasps)

53
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,033
Mom!

54
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:15,900
Ban ban!

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,233
Ahhhh!

56
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,800
Stop right there!

57
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,666
Sailor Moon!

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,200
Huh?!

59
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:25,600
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

60
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,566
I am Sailor Moon!

61
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,100
Ban ban...

62
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,866
In the name of
the moon...

63
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,642
<i>Move it!</i>

64
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:32,261
Agh!

65
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:33,600
Huh?!

66
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,266
Hey! Why'd you
do that?!

67
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,066
Stop acting like
you're the only
cool one here!

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,600
Well, your kick
kinda flattened my
pretty face!

69
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,300
Looks like a big
improvement to me.

70
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,866
What was that?!

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,633
Look, no one
invited you!

72
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,900
You should butt out!

73
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,500
(furious grunt)

74
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,866
I'm the one who heard
about this crime first
anyway, so you can
take a seat!

75
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,033
Don't try stealing
our thunder, okay?

76
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,100
And don't talk about
me like I'm a thief!

77
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,733
Just shut up,
alright?!

78
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,533
<i>You're standing</i>
<i>in my way!</i>

79
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,766
You got in my
way first!

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,900
What's going on
here anyway?

81
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,900
(girls fighting)

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,733
I've had enough
of you!

83
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:13,566
Huh?!

84
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,233
Hey!

85
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,100
Oh no! Paparazzi!

86
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:21,700
Sailor Guardians fighting
each other at the scene
of a crime! This is going
to be a huge scoop!

87
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,600
Who are you?!

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,200
I'm a writer for
the Weekly Dokkiri!

89
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,766
Stop!

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
Cut it out now!

91
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,200
The Weekly Dokkiri?!
That's a photo magazine
that does sleazy stories
that aren't even true.

92
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,100
They print anything,
right?!

93
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:38,900
Pretty much! So what's
the cause of this fight
between you guys?

94
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:39,833
Huh?

95
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,733
Hold on! We get along!
There's no way that the
Pretty Guardians of
Justice would really

96
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,633
fight with each other.
We're a happy team of
heroes!

97
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,833
(nervous laugh)

98
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:50,966
Eh... Right?

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,600
Hmph!

100
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,066
I knew it!
Something's wrong!

101
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,900
Let me guess, you're
tired of dealing with
Sailor Moon messing up
all the time. Or is

102
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,300
there some boy
trouble going on?

103
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,033
This is stupid.

104
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:01,766
I'm going home.

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,466
Yeah, let's go!

106
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey, wait! C'mon
you can tell me!

107
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,100
<i>That sure was a</i>
<i>waste of my time.</i>

108
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,233
What was that
all about?

109
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,966
Uh, hello?

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,566
Huh?

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,133
<i>Oh, that's right!</i>

112
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,900
Where'd that monster
go anyway?!

113
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,300
She got away while
you were busy fighting.

114
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,566
(sad sigh)

115
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,033
So, uh...

116
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:21,633
Yeah?

117
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,700
So could you
help me out?

118
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,300
Oh, wow! Sorry
about that!

119
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,733
Of course!

120
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,133
<i>(nervous laughter)</i>

121
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:36,900
And then the monster
was able to get away.
It was crazy.

122
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,833
Really?

123
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,200
But you know what the
weirdest part was?

124
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,966
Uh...what?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,166
It seemed like Sailor
Moon was having an
argument with the
other Sailor Guardians.

126
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
(nervous laughter)

127
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,833
No way!

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,166
I don't know about the
other Guardians, but
Sailor Moon is cute,
kind and sweet. She's

129
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,133
not the type who
would fight or argue.

130
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,100
Are you sure?

131
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,233
Mm-hmm...

132
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,933
Not her!

133
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,000
Say!

134
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,166
Hey, it's you!

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,533
Tell me more about
what you were just
talking about!

136
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,200
Oh no!

137
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,133
Oh, I should probably
introduce myself to
you, huh?

138
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,266
I'm Nana Asahina,
freelance writer.

139
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,733
Pleased to meet you!

140
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,133
Ohh...

141
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,633
Now then, you two seem
pretty close to Sailor
Moon. So what's the
deal with her?!

142
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,133
Huh?

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
I guess were close.

144
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,000
(nervous laugh)

145
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,700
Ah! So you said Sailor
Moon wouldn't fight or
argue? What exactly
makes you say that?

146
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,133
Uhh, Naru!

147
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,566
I...

148
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,166
One question! My sources
say Sailor Moon's saved
you lots of times, true?

149
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,866
Uhh, Usagi?

150
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,866
You were there last
night so you must've
talked with Sailor
Moon. Was she saying

151
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,800
anything bad about
the other Guardians?

152
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,166
Uh, we're kinda in
a rush here. Gotta go!

153
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,800
Well...

154
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,200
Hey, Usagi! Wait
up for me!

155
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,800
Just give me a call
when you can, okay?

156
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,100
There's someone who
doesn't know when
to quit!

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,933
Hmm...

158
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,533
(kicking grunt)

159
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:13,633
Hah!

160
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,833
What's the square
root of two?!

161
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:16,700
<i>Take that!</i>

162
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,666
Ow! Hey! That hurt
Mars! You kicked me
for real!

163
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,233
Yeah, because that's
kind of the whole point!
We're not playing games
here!

164
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:31,133
Now wait, hold it. I
felt like there was real
hate in that kick, Mars.

165
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:31,866
Huh?

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh yeah? I know
what my butt felt.

167
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:40,233
Hold on! Don't play the
blame game! This whole
plan of us having a big
falling out with you was

168
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:44,066
your idea to begin with!
So don't go acting like
a whiny wimp! Okay?

169
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,200
I am not being a wimp!
It's absolutely up to
us. We must rescue Tuxedo
Mask from the evil clutches

170
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,700
of the Dark Kingdom!

171
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,766
That's exactly why we've
gotta make it look to
whoever's watching, that
we're really fighting,

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,633
Sailor Moon!

173
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,600
But you kicked my butt
so hard now there's a
crack in it.

174
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,833
That's enough!

175
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,566
Listen up! Unless it
really looks like we
mean it, they're sure
not gonna invite their

176
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,200
enemy, Sailor Moon,
to their hideout.
Got it?!

177
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,666
I know, that's
the plan...

178
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,733
Mars is right,

179
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:14,033
this plan of yours
is really dangerous,
Sailor Moon.

180
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:17,566
So you've gotta do
some serious acting to
make them buy this!

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,100
All right! I get
it already!

182
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,100
(worried sigh)

183
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,533
Hey Artemis, did you
happen to find out
anything about that
reporter who showed

184
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,100
up yesterday at
the jewelry store?

185
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,461
<i>Yeah, there's something</i>
<i>very fishy about her.</i>

186
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:30,981
Huh?

187
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:31,833
I knew it!

188
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,233
Look! She already
wrote the story!

189
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,166
<i>Oh no! I look so</i>
<i>stupid in that</i>
<i>photo!</i>

190
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,066
That's how you
always look, Usagi.

191
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,033
What did you say?!

192
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,900
Cut it out you two.

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,100
That girl came from
out of nowhere, and
she's already a very
successful reporter!

194
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:51,633
She's had big scoops
on every political and
entertainment story
out there. It's like

195
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,166
she already knows
where to go before
it even happens!

196
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,600
<i>Could it be that</i>
<i>she's been turned</i>
<i>into a monster?</i>

197
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,266
That's what I think.

198
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,166
<i>All right!</i>

199
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,300
The fact that a monster
is contacting us is good!
Oh yeah! That means this
great plan of mine must

200
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,600
be working!

201
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:07,233
It could be a
coincidence...

202
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,033
Ugh! You think so?

203
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,800
Well, then let's
get this show
on the road.

204
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:16,166
Usagi, your plan's
really risky, you
sure you wanna go
through with it?

205
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,933
Huh? Sure!
Why not?

206
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:23,033
Oh, it'll be fine!
I mean, why worry?
You know we've got
your back.

207
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,900
Do you want me to
go instead of you?

208
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,233
Why are you asking?

209
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,066
Huh?

210
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,933
I go and get myself beat
up training for this and
now you decide to just
take over as the leader?

211
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,233
Huh?!

212
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,700
Aren't you over
thinking this a
bit, Usagi?

213
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:39,000
Well if Rei wasn't
always so hard on me,
this'd be a lot easier.

214
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,033
Then just stop
messing up all
the time!

215
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,566
What was that?!

216
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,133
Self-fulfilling
prophecy...

217
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,066
(annoyed sighs)

218
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:00,766
It should be right
around here somewhere...

219
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,133
Oh! This is it!

220
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,133
Whoa!

221
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,633
What a sweet-looking
apartment building!
I sure I wish I lived
in such a nice place!

222
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,700
<i>This is no time for</i>
<i>you to be admiring</i>
<i>her, Usagi! She</i>
<i>could be a monster!</i>

223
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,066
Oh yeah! You're right!

224
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,633
(chuckle)

225
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,233
(good luck grunt)

226
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,800
(nervous laugh)

227
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,866
Well hello!

228
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,566
<i>Uh, Sailor Moon dropped</i>
<i>by and she asked me to</i>
<i>give you this letter.</i>

229
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,800
This is from
Sailor Moon?

230
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,866
(nervous gulp)

231
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,200
I have decided I don't
want to be the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice

232
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:41,300
anymore! I'm so sick
and tired of working
with those Sailor
Guardians.

233
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,833
I have a shocking
confession I want to
share with you, so meet
me at Juban Cemetery

234
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,633
tonight at eleven
p.m.

235
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,233
Wow! Thanks for the
letter, but why'd she
have you deliver it?

236
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,733
Uh, I dunno!

237
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,133
People have always
told me that I have a
reliable face for
delivering letters!

238
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,800
(nervous laugh)

239
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,733
What kind of
answer is that?

240
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,166
Well thanks to you,
I've got another great
story to report!

241
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,966
I'm glad I could
help you out!

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,966
(obnoxious laugh)

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Hmm...

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,166
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

245
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:33,441
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

246
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:39,407
Oniwabandana,
are you there?

247
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,607
<i>Ban ban.</i>

248
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,407
So how are things
proceeding?

249
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,907
(chuckle)
I see...

250
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,574
<i>Sailor Moon's had a</i>
<i>change of heart and</i>
<i>she's definitely broken</i>
<i>away from the Guardians.</i>

251
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,674
<i>Ban ban.</i>

252
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,641
Then I think it's
time I pay her a
little visit.

253
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,207
(evil chuckle)

254
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:11,207
It's time...

255
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,107
<i>Thanks for your</i>
<i>letter.</i>

256
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:25,607
(startled gasp)

257
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,207
Oh, you startled me!

258
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,107
Is it really true that
you want to leave the
other Sailor Guardians
forever?

259
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,107
That's right! I
don't even want to
ever see them again!

260
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,341
Hmm...
Really?

261
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:38,174
Yes, really.

262
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:40,107
You're sure
about that?

263
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:43,207
I'm definitely sure!
I'm done with them!

264
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:46,274
Good. In that
case.

265
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,607
Huh?!

266
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:54,307
Ban ban ban ban ban
ban ban ban ban ban
ban ban ban ban ban
ban ban ban! Ban!

267
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:55,607
A monster!

268
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:57,807
<i>Master Kunzite!</i>

269
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:58,607
Huh?!

270
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,241
Kunzite!

271
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:05,607
<i>Meeting you wasn't</i>
<i>part of what I agreed</i>
<i>to! I'm here to get</i>
<i>interviewed!</i>

272
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,641
Ban ban! That
interview is off!

273
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,707
<i>Wait?! Really?!</i>

274
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:13,641
So I heard that you've
broken up with the
other guardians.

275
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:18,441
You know, if you join
us, you can see Endymion
any time that you like.

276
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:24,141
Stop being so ridiculous!
I'm the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice and I don't

277
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,341
plan on stopping!

278
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:29,807
Well, that's too bad.
Right now, Endymion
can't even move.

279
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,074
What?! What's
wrong with him?!

280
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:37,241
Hm! Who knows? One
thing's for sure,
seeing you would
help him.

281
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,341
(evil chuckle)

282
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:44,741
Perhaps asking you to
join our side isn't
realistic. But I'm sure
you'd like to pay

283
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,507
Endymion a visit,
wouldn't you?

284
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:47,807
<i>You'll take me to him?</i>

285
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,607
Of course I will,
but on one condition.

286
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:51,441
<i>What is it?</i>

287
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,274
<i>Hand over the</i>
<i>Silver Crystal.</i>

288
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,074
(shocked gasp)

289
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:01,341
If you pass up this
chance you'll never
see Endymion alive
again.

290
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:05,807
Tuxedo Mask must be
very sick. What
should I do?

291
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,641
What's you answer?
Ban ban.

292
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:10,174
Uh, umm...

293
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,574
Give it to us.

294
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:12,641
All right! I will!

295
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:16,141
But first, I want to
make sure Tuxedo Mask
is okay!

296
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,474
<i>All right, it looks</i>
<i>like he fell for it.</i>

297
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,574
Master Kunzite...

298
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,341
Hm?

299
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:28,207
Damn it. So this
really was a trap.

300
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,074
All right, then.

301
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:33,774
I'm ready, so why don't
we get going. If I never
see Sailor Mars and those
others again, that'll

302
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:34,641
be too soon!

303
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:38,274
Hmph. I like your
hate filled resolve.

304
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:41,407
(struggling grunts)

305
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,141
(shocked gasp)

306
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:47,607
Is that?

307
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,141
<i>That's the entry</i>
<i>way to the Dark</i>
<i>Kingdom.</i>

308
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:51,174
Huh?!

309
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,174
(scared whining)

310
00:16:54,507 --> 00:16:56,841
That's sure one
creepy entrance.

311
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:58,207
Having second
thoughts?

312
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:03,374
I'm going, okay?! Man,
you are so mean, you're
just like Sailor Mars.

313
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:06,274
There she goes insulting
me! I'll show her who's
mean!

314
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:07,474
Now, now...

315
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:10,774
Hold on, Tuxedo
Mask. I'm coming
for you!

316
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,341
Ba-ban!

317
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:16,374
Hm?!

318
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:19,707
(shocked gasp)

319
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:25,241
Now, you will hand
over the Silver
Crystal. Ban ban.

320
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:28,441
No! I won't do it
until after I see
Tuxedo Mask.

321
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:31,141
Oh no, it's way
too late for that.

322
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:33,207
I guess you'll
die right here!

323
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:36,841
I'll take that Silver
Crystal from you after
you're dead. Ban ban.

324
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:39,707
No you won't, the
Silver Crystal isn't
even here!

325
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:40,741
What?!

326
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:42,407
She's in real trouble!

327
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,341
Let's save her!

328
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,041
Wait!

329
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:48,274
If we rescue her now,
this whole plan will
have been a complete
waste of time!

330
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:49,407
<i>You're a fool!</i>

331
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:55,674
Once you're gone,
there won't be anyone
left who can use the
Silver Crystal. And now

332
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,207
Sailor Moon, you've
dug your own grave.

333
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,174
Damn it!

334
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,241
Hold on! Just wait!

335
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:02,741
(evil chuckling)

336
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:08,341
Wait, now I get it!
They're using me as
bait to see if Sailor
Mars and the others

337
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:09,474
will come to
my rescue.

338
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,307
Please girls, don't
give in! Don't try
to save me!

339
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,407
(angry grunt)

340
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,641
Let's go!

341
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:16,507
Right!

342
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,407
Hmph!

343
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:18,374
No, not yet!

344
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,023
But she really
need our help
right now!

345
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:21,783
Move!

346
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:22,407
(shocked gasp)

347
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,141
So Mars, turns out
you really do hate
Sailor Moon, don't you?

348
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,074
Jupiter...

349
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,741
Wait, isn't that?!

350
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,507
I wouldn't hold on to
something this important
for someone that I
didn't care about!

351
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:36,241
You see? Mars
feels the same!

352
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,607
Sorry...

353
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,541

<i>Die, Sailor Moon!</i>

356
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,441
Sailor Moon, no!

(struggling grunt)

358
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:51,541
Please! Don't
come out!

359
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,141
(struggling grunts)

360
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:03,807
I've had enough!

361
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:08,407
Oh, so now they go!

362
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,307
<i>Get away from her!</i>

363
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:11,107
<i>Ban ban?!</i>

364
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:12,574
Hnnh!

365
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:16,041
Sailor Mars!

366
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,174
Sailor Mercury!

Sailor Venus!

369
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,807
We're done
playing games!

370
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:29,741
Let her go!

371
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:32,641
No! Why'd you come?!

372
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:37,341
Fools! You think I
didn't see through this
stupid scheme of yours
a long time ago?!

373
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,374
Huh?

374
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,741
I-I don't care! Just
let Sailor Moon go,
you monster!

375
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:44,607
Raging Fire!

376

Soul!

377
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,641
Ahhh!

378
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,707
Supreme!

379
00:19:58,174 --> 00:19:59,641
Crescent!

trick me, you might try
practicing your acting
a bit more!

Huh? What is this?

401
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:06,607
I can't believe you saw
through this plan! After
all, I stayed up all night
coming up with it! I wanted

402
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:10,874
my plan to blossom like
a beautiful flower, not
make me look like a
blooming idiot!

403
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:11,774
<i>Seriously?</i>

404
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,574
Anyway!

405
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:15,541
In the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

406
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,141
We'll see about that!

407
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:20,207
Zip it! Fire!

00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,141
Hot! Hot! Hot! Ow!
Hot! Hot! Ow! Ow!

411
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:30,674
Time to finish this!

412
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:42,041
Moon Healing
Escalation!

Hey, we did it!

416
00:21:55,607 --> 00:22:00,807
Mm-hmm! Wait! Why'd all of
you have to come running
out?! I could've handled
this whole thing on my own!

417
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,541
Well, because you were
crying like a baby!

418
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,174
Just when was I
crying like a baby?!

419
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:09,374
Today at eleven thirty-
three PM and twenty
three seconds!

420
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:10,641
(angry growl)

421
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:13,341
You can't even be
nice when you are
trying to save my
life!

422
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,341
They never quit.

423
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,807
Yeah, but I wish
they would.

424
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,674
<i>Hey!</i>

425
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:29,074
So you two, there's a
rumor that the Sailor
Guardians are splitting
up, is there any truth

426
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:30,141
to that? Huh?!

427
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,174
Oh, c'mon! Enough!

428
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:17,008
There's nothing that
burns as hot as forbidden
love. No matter what stands
between them, their hearts

429
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,241
will always be as one.

430
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:24,508
<i>Endymion, I remember</i>
<i>everything. The day of</i>
<i>that passionate kiss.</i>
<i>And our final moments</i>

431
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,308
<i>as we shared our</i>
<i>last breath.</i>

432
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:30,508
To those of you thinking
this is just going to be
another silly episode,
you're in for a shock!

433
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,574
<i>No kidding!</i>

434
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:36,241
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Usagi's Awakening: A</i>
<i>Message from the Distant</i>
<i>Past."</i>

435
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,508
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
