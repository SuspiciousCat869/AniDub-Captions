1
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,833
A girl's true beauty
isn't found only in her
looks! It's in her kind
heart and in the guts to

2
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,633
do what's right and just.

3
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,666
How can the camera not
see that?!

4
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,966
I am Sailor Moon, and in
the name of the moon, I'll
punish you!

5
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:22,666
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino! It
may not look it, but
I'm actually a
superhero!

6
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,000
I use a special brooch to
transform and fight evil!
You know me as...

7
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:31,533
...the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice. I am Sailor
Moon!

8
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:36,166
I'm friends with the
kindhearted genius, Ami
Mizuno, who's Sailor
Mercury...!

9
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,166
...And Rei Hino, the
hotheaded psychic, who's
Sailor Mars. Both of them
seem to have it a little

10
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,666
more together than I
do...

11
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,966
But, oh well, guess I
just gotta do my best!

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600

"Usagi's a Model: The
Flash of the Monster
Camera"

14
00:02:56,866 --> 00:03:00,600
Lunchtime! Oh, boy! This
looks so good!

15
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,066
Time to dig in!

16
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,300
<i>Wow, those photographs</i>
<i>look amazing!</i>

17
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:10,000
You know what's really
amazing? The kid who took
these pictures is still
only in middle school!

18
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:14,233

"Kijin Shinokawa, a young
prodigy." Cool.

20
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,133
Huh? No way! He goes to
Gohongi Boys' middle
school?!

21
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,300
Let's see, X minus Y
times pi R squared...

22
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,733
Ami! You have to see
this! Did you read the
article about this boy?
He goes to a school

23
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,600
that's right near the
T.A. Girls' Academy that
Rei goes to!

24
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:33,333
Yes, I know.

25
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:36,900
How can you be so calm
about this?! Don't you
understand?! We have the
opportunity to meet

26
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:40,300
someone famous today!
C'mon, let's go and get
his autograph!

27
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,633
Can't. I have cram school
this afternoon.

28
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,866
Aw, Ami, that's all you
ever do! We're only
young once, you know! We
should make the best

29
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,033
of it by having some fun
once in a while!

30
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:53,166
I am having fun,
because I really enjoy
studying.

31
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,133
[grunting]
You are so hopeless.

32
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:07,133
So, Kijin! Tell us
how it feels to win the
prestigious Japan Photo
Contest?

33
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,233
It's great.

34
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,900
Great! And will you continue
to photograph landscapes?

35
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,233
I guess.

36
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,300
There he is! I can't
believe it!

37
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,033
Kijin!

38
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,666
That's far enough!

39
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,433
<i>Rei!</i>

40
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,033
Stop acting like such a
fan girl!

41
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:24,166
What does that mean?!
What's wrong with asking
a celebrity for an
autograph?!

42
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,133
Do you even understand
what his art's about?!

43
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,033
[gasping]

44
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,966
I bet you couldn't
care less about
photography.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,833
You're only going crazy
for that guy because he's
famous, not because you're
interested in his work!

46
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:37,633
Who I ask for an
autograph is my business
alone!

47
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,933
Please stop fighting, you
two.

48
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:41,900
Uh?! Huh?

49
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:57,666
The light at dusk changes
so fast...

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,266
There! That's the shot!

51
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,533
[gasping]

52
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,166
You ought to be more
careful.

53
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,166
Yeah, I will! Thanks for
saving me!

54
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,666
I'm a big fan of yours.

55
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,166
Keep taking those great
pictures, okay?

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,233
Uh, sure...!

57
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,100
The stars see all; the
stars know all! Sirius,
the demon star, shining
bright in the dark night.

58
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:48,833
It points to Kijin
Shinokawa, whose energy
will soon rise to its
peak!

59
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:54,300
With each girl he
photographs, his energy
will build and be all
mine.

60
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,300
[chuckling]

61
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,166
My creative juices are
really flowing.

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,833
Art is an explosion! I
need to take photographs
of girls, any girls,
lots of them!

63
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:14,266
"Be a model! Get your
picture taken by genius
photographer Kijin
Shinokawa!"

64
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,100
That's so cool!

65
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,733
Usagi, the new
communicators are ready
for you and the other
guardians to use.

66
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm going to become a
model!

67
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,633
And I've already gone
ahead and given them to
Ami and Rei.

68
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,900
Then I can tell Ami right
now that I'm going to be
a model!

69
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,100
[sighing]

70
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
What is it, Usagi?
Everything okay?

71
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:39,600
Wait'll you hear this,
Ami; it'll knock your
socks off! I'm going to
apply to become a model!

72
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:44,200
Oh, Usagi! The
communicator should only
be used for serious and
important transmissions!

73
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:49,100
Anyway, I'm kind of
busy solving this math
problem. I'll listen to
your story tomorrow, okay?

74
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:53,966
She hung up! All right,
then I'll just have to
give Rei a call instead.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,100
Uhh--

76
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,866
I bet that you couldn't
care less about
photography.

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,733
You're only going crazy
for that guy because he's
famous, not because you're
interested in his work!

78
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:06,266
On second thought, if I
called her, she'd just
make fun of me again.

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,766
Never mind.

80
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,933
[laughing]

81
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,900
You become a model?!

82
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,766
Why not?!

83
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,933
Aw, gimme a break! That is
never going to happen! A
model needs more than
just a pretty face and a

84
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,266
nice body! She has to
have a sharp mind, too.

85
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,666
Well then I'll just study
really hard from now on!

86
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,266
Too bad that won't do you
any good! A brainless
bunny like you can't
change that easily!

87
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,766
Bam! That's just the way
it is!

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,233
Trust me, there's no
way you'll make it past
the first round of
auditions, so don't

89
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,066
even bother trying.
It's for your own good.

90
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,200
Mom!

91
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,933
Did you hear that?!
Shingo's being mean
again!

92
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:49,133
Don't be silly! Shingo's
just trying to prepare
you so you don't get your
hopes up too much.

93
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,733
No one in my family
understands me.

94
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:55,166
Why won't anyone just
give me some support?!

95
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
<i>Hey. Cheer up, Usagi!</i>

96
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:02,066
You can't give up before you
even start. What's important
is that you embrace the
challenge and try your

97
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,600
hardest, even if
you don't succeed.

98
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,866
Thanks, Motoki. You're
the only one who's
ever nice to me!

99
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,266
You should try your
hardest, Usagi. Although
you probably won't make
the cut.

100
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,966
But even so, go
ahead and give it
a shot.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,966
Nobody asked you! Stop
butting into our
conversation!

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,866
Honestly, though, people
these days have it all
wrong. They believe that
simply having good looks

103
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,233
is what makes a girl
beautiful. But what actually
allows a girl stand out
from everybody else

104
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:31,000
is far more than just
her physical appearance.

105
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,833
Oh? Well, what
is it, then?

106
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:37,866
What's inside! A kind
heart and the guts to do
what she thinks is right
and just, no matter how

107
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,933
hard it might be.

108
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,300
Huh? Girls have guts,
too?

109
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,566
Yeah, but in your case
you're missing both
guts and beauty.

110
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,966
Oh, yeah? So what
if I don't have them,
huh?!

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,100
Listen, Kijin Shinokawa
is willing to photograph
any girl, any time, as
long as she's young.

112
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,900
And I say that taking
pictures with that kind
of attitude makes him
nothing more than a

113
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,300
second-rate or even a
third-rate photographer
at best!

114
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,333
Ugh, I don't even want to
look at you anymore.

115
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:06,733
Yakity, yakity, yak!

116
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:10,966
Mamoru, she really is a
good person. You
shouldn't treat her like
she's just a dumb little

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,900
girl, you know.

118
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:16,600
Well, maybe you're
right, but whenever we
talk, it always just seems
to turn into an argument.

119
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,833
What can I say? I guess
that we weren't meant
for each other.

120
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,800
Hey, why are you
standing there?

121
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,666
No reason!

122
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,766
Oh! I get it! You're
waiting for the mail to
see if you got accepted
as a model, aren't you?

123
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,500
Uh...

124
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,300
Don't be ridiculous!
There's no way they'd
ever choose someone like
you. You're gonna get

125
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,733
rejected for sure as soon
as they see your picture!

126
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:51,233
Look, just leave me
alone and go away!

127
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,666
Mail for you, Usagi.

128
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,633
Here it is!

129
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,200
Probably just some junk
mail...

130
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,833
Yes! I got selected! I
made it past the first
round!

131
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,633
What?!

132
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,833
Ha! It says that I'm
supposed to report to the
pool at the New Japan
Hotel for a professional

133
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:07,633
photo shoot tomorrow!
You see that?!

134
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,633
♪May, mee, my, mo, moo!♪

135
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,766
She sells seashells
down by the seashore.

136
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,166
What are you doing now?

137
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Practicing to be a model,
of---

138
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,066
Stop distracting me with
your questions!

139
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,133
I gotta practice my singing!
Ah! Ahh!

140
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, bunny hopping to and
fro, what makes a bunny
hop just so?

141
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,866
Make it stop.

142
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Now, what should I
wear when I go tomorrow?

143
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:35,666
Oh, that's right! They
said we have to bring a
swimsuit, too...

144
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,933
I think it's in
this drawer.

145
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,600
The moths got it! It's
full of holes!

146
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,233
[crying]

147
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,700
[cheering]

148
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,833
Whoa, it's packed!

149
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:58,033
Art is an explosion!

150
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:02,233
Now, all of you go to
your assigned dressing
rooms and wait your turn
there.

151
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:05,833
And no peeking at the
photo shoot! I don't
want to be distracted!

152
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,300
Come out only at your
allotted time, got it?

153
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,566
[agreeing]

154
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,833
I've got a really bad
feeling about all this,
Usagi...

155
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:13,966
Why's that?

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,833
Kijin Shinokawa's
attitude has completely
changed.

157
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,933
Everyone knows that
artists are eccentric and
temperamental.

158
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:25,300
No matter how I look at
it, I just don't understand
how you were picked to be
a model.

159
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,166
Hey! Luna!

160
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Oh, hi Usagi!

161
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,000
Huh?

162
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,266
So, did you pass the first
audition, too?

163
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,866
Uh, yeah. Naru? And Ms.
Haruna, too?

164
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:38,000
A model should always be
smiling!

165
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,766
Did I put on weight?

166
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,866
Hey, Usagi, you
better hurry and get
dressed in your swimsuit.

167
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,133
Huh? Oh... okay.

168
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,300
You brought one, right?

169
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, I'm
wearing it.

170
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,266
Then let me see it.

171
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,700
Okay...

172
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,300
<i>Wow, how cute!</i>

173
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,133
I covered all the moth
holes with these bows.

174
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,800
Something is really
bothering me about this
whole photo shoot...

175
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,900
[chuckling]

176
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:20,633
Art is an explosion! When
I sense the moment is
right, I get up close,
and boom!

177
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,533
I'm a photographic
genius!

178
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,633
What just happened?

179
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,200
Those girls disappeared!

180
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,100
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

181
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,049
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

182
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:07,283
Listen carefully, Usagi!
All the girls being
photographed completely
vanished!

183
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:08,716
What are you talking
about?

184
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:13,316
I saw it! I'm certain
that this is a sinister
plot by the Dark Kingdom.

185
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,883
You gotta let Ami and Rei
know, now!

186
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:21,183
Leave me alone! I don't
have time for that. I
have to get ready!

187
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,749
Okay, then. I'll tell
everyone about your
swimsuit!

188
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,416
Uh, Fine, you win!

189
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:27,883
What was that? Did you
say something?

190
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,483
No, didn't say a thing!

191
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,349
I did put on weight.

192
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,083
Ami!

193
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:42,149
You have to come to the
New Japan Hotel! So you
can see me all dressed up
for my big photo shoot!

194
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:46,149
Ignore that! There's been
an incident. Come quickly
and bring Rei!

195
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:48,949
Hey, Usagi! It's time
for our photo shoot!

196
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:51,283
I've definitely put on
weight.

197
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:52,283
Let's go!

198
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:53,016
Wait!

199
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,016
Usagi!

200
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,316
[grunting]

201
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:59,016
What are you
doing?!

202
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,716
You're gonna get
it for that!

203
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:02,116
Come here!

204
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,983
Hey!

205
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,749
Stop it, Luna!

206
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:13,349
Uh!

207
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,216
I'm the only one
who's not in the
shoot.

208
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,116
I'm an absolute genius!

209
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:34,383
Uh!

210
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,316
They vanished!

211
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,816
You see? I told you!

212
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,849
How terrible! Let's go!

213
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:49,883
[laughing]

214
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,916
Kijin, what did you do
with everyone?

215
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:57,516
Art's an explosion! Any
girl will do! Kaboom!
Kaboom!

216
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,949
Oh, yeah! I'll shoot them
all!

217
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,816
What you're doing
is wrong!

218
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,649
What?

219
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:09,083
You think that any young
girl will do?! Taking
pictures with that kind
of attitude makes you no

220
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,283
more than a third-rate
photographer.

221
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:14,083
You're just repeating
what Mamoru said!

222
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:15,583
Hmph!

223
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:18,016
Deep down, you're a
photographer who
understands the beauty
of this world.

224
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,016
Please, snap out of
it!

225
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:20,483
Shut up!

226
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,516
[groaning]

227
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:25,849
[chuckling]

228
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,949
Are you okay, Usagi?

229
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:28,783
Mm-hmm.

230
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:31,149
Good, now transform
into Sailor Moon!

231
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:35,916
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

232
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,216
A girl's true beauty
isn't only in her looks.

233
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:18,983
Huh...?

234
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,149
It's in her heart and
having the guts to do
what's right and just.

235
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,149
Who are you?!

236
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,283
[grunting]

237
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:33,116
I am the pretty guardian
who fights for love and
for justice.

238
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,849
I am Sailor Moon!

239
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:39,416
Now, whatever monster has
possessed Kijin... Come
out and show yourself!

240
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:44,116
A lovely photo subject
has just appeared right
in front of me!

241
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,949
A monster has you under
its control!

242
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:51,316
If this continues, the
energy of your passion...

243
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,349
...will completely be
sucked away by the
monster inside you!

244
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,249
Sailor Moon Kick!

245
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,249
Ahhhh!

246
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:08,183
You've got to pull
yourself together.

247
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:10,783
Huh?

248
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,849
[chuckling]

249
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:19,916
You're too late.

250
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,516
I, Kyameran, have stolen
Kijin's energy!

251
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:24,749
[gasping]

252
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,249
Now take this!

253
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:27,783
Ah!

254
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,683
No! Kijin!

255
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:37,149
Watch yourself, now,
Sailor Moon! If Kyameran
takes your picture,
you'll become sealed

256
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:39,049
inside a photograph
forever.

257
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,249
That doesn't sound like
fun!

258
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:43,016
Ahhhh!

259
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:47,049
[screaming]

260
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,816
She's defenseless! Look
out, Sailor Moon!

261
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:52,283
Luna!

262
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,216
Where'd you go?!

263
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,249
[chuckling]
Here...

264
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,483
[gasping]

265
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,216
Luna! Kijin!

266
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,183
Why?!

267
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,349
How could you!

268
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:10,749
And now, Sailor Moon,
you're going to become my
next victim.

269
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:14,216
I'll simply overwhelm you
with my Shutter-Click
Attack.

270
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:15,849
[gasping]

271
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,349
[chuckling]

272
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:18,749
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

273
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:19,483
[grunting]

274
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:25,249
Sailor Mercury!
Sailor Mars!

275
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:26,916
Bubble...

276
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,316
...Spray!

277
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,016
I'll seal your evil
powers!

278
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:43,483
Rin pyo to sha kai jin
retsu zai zen!

279
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:46,049
Evil spirit, be
exorcized!

280
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,049
You brats! Do you really
think that'll stop me?!

281
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,949
I don't understand!
What's happening?

282
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:04,916
[chuckling]

283
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,083
[gasping]

284
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:10,849
Sailor Mercury! Sailor
Mars! Not you, too!

285
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,416
No one can save you, now!

286
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:22,016
[trembling]

287
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,249
Watch yourself, now,
Sailor Moon! If Kyameran
takes your picture,
you'll become sealed

288
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:27,883
inside a photograph
forever.

289
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,916
[gasping]

290
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:31,849
Wait, what'll happen
if she takes her own
picture?

291
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:32,683
That's it!

292
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:35,016
I hope you're ready
for your close-up!

293
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:38,916
What?!

294
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:46,816
[screaming]

295
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:51,183
Oh, no, caught inside my
own camera. No, this
can't be!

296
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,216
I won't let this happen!

297
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:55,149
What you've done is
unforgivable!

298
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:08,083
Uh!

299
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:12,149
Moon Tiara Action!

300
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,716
[screaming]

301
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,783
Uh!

302
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:39,883
I think I've had just
about enough of getting
my picture taken!

303
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:46,849
The demon star has
vanished!

304
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:53,183
Well, well... It seems
that your plan has
failed, Nephrite.

305
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:54,483
Who said that?

306
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,016
Zoisite.

307
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,916
I bet Queen Beryl
would be quite interested
to hear the result of
your fight and that

308
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:05,116
another of your plans has
failed.

309
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:10,249
And what about all your
plans, Zoisite? Have you
found the Legendary
Silver Crystal that will

310
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:12,149
awaken our great ruler
yet?

311
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,116
[growling]

312
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,449
Take care your own
business before you stick
your nose into someone
else's.

313
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:23,483
Don't forget, there are
countless numbers of
people on Earth from whom
I can steal energy!

314
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,983
Countless!

315
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,016
Where's Usagi?

316
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:32,249
<i>She locked herself in her</i>
<i>room and won't come out.</i>

317
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:35,783
She probably embarrassed
herself big time at that
photo shoot of hers.

318
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:39,849
And now she's way too
mortified to face the
family. Not that I'm
complaining...

319
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:44,749
I wanted to make an
announcement, that I've
decided to take a break from
photography for a while.

320
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,316
Why is that and when
will you return to it?

321
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:53,116
Well, I was taught an
important lesson, that a
woman's true beauty is not
to be found only in her looks.

322
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:56,849
It's in her kind heart
and her love for what's
right and just.

323
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:02,483
When I truly understand
that with all of my being,
only then will I take up
the camera once again.

324
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:05,016
Taught a lesson? By whom?

325
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,383
A wonderful young lady.

326
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:12,283
Huh... If only Usagi
would become a wonderful
young lady like whoever
helped him.

327
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:13,249
Like that'll ever
happen.

328
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:16,349
That's too much to ask
from my stupid sister!

329
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:26,016
[laughing]

330
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,316
Hey, Luna? Do you
remember Shingo's
friend, Mika?

331
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:18,016
<i>Yeah, she's the girl</i>
<i>who's good at making</i>
<i>dolls, right?</i>

332
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,149
Right! But I heard she's
been acting weird, making
dolls like she's been
under some kind of evil

333
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:24,149
spell! Do you think?

334
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:27,016
I don't like scary
stories like this.

335
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:32,416
Next time on Sailor Moon,
"Shingo's Love: The
Grieving Doll"

336
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:35,216
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
