1
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:02,433
You dare to turn a
kid's hero like Redman
into an evil monster
and force him to use

2
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:06,800
Lake Akan's famous
Marimo algae balls
as a weapon against
innocent people?!

3
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:11,433
I bet the Hokkaido
Sightseeing Association
didn't give you permission
to do that, did they?!

4
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,333
I am Sailor Moon!

5
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,200
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

6
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:25,166
Hey! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
You know me as the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice.

7
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,866
I am Sailor Moon!
This job's not easy
by the way...

8
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,133
We have to find and
protect the Legendary
Silver Crystal before
the bad guys get it.

9
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:38,600
But in order to do that,
we need to find the Seven
Rainbow Crystals and
the people holding them!

10
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:43,800
Pretty crazy, huh?
But now there are four
of us Sailor Guardians,
so I think everything's

11
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,666
gonna work out
just fine.

12
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,766
(giggling)

13
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,700
<i>"Umino's Resolve:</i>
<i>I'll protect Naru"</i>

14
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,700
Huh?

15
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:13,333
Codename Zero-Zero-
Nine-One. This is
Luna. Passphrase:
"The rabbit on the

16
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:17,133
moon is pounding
rice cakes", please
respond ASAP.

17
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,166
The moon's rice
cakes are sticky.

18
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,400
And they puff up
when you toast
them, as well.

19
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,433
So then, how are the
Sailor Guardians doing?

20
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:30,366
One of them still
has issues with
responsibility, but
the others are really

21
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,133
doing very well
indeed!

22
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,466
The day when all
five Guardians come
together is near.

23
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,900
What you mean that?!

24
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:41,833
Yes. Therefore, now
is the time for you
to explain everything
to them.

25
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,733
You're sure
about that?

26
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,566
We know that the
Dark Kingdom has
been growing more
and more restless.

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,833
We have to prepare
the Sailor Guardians.
They need to know what
they're fighting for.

28
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,633
I understand.

29
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,466
The time has finally
come to tell them.

30
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,400
(yawning)

31
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:10,066
Why would Luna want
to meet with us so
late at night?

32
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,333
Huh?

33
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,766
It's good that
you're all here.

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,233
Has another monster
appeared?

35
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,200
I don't want
to scare you!

36
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,666
Whaa! But you
just did!

37
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,666
Listen carefully
to what I'm about
to tell you.

38
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,966
Huh?

39
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,333
I was sent here
all the way from
the Moon to help
guide you!

40
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,200
What?!

41
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:44,666
The Moon?!

42
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,266
Why?!

43
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,366
No way!

44
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,100
So then why did you
come to Earth, Luna?

45
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,666
I came here to
awaken each of
you.

46
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,366
I dunno. This
story just gets
weirder.

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,333
True, but if Luna
says that she came
here from the moon.
I believe her.

48
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,300
Thanks a lot for
that, Ami.

49
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,400
The Princess you've
been searching for
carries the royal
bloodline of the

50
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,400
Moon Kingdom.

51
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,733
The Moon
Kingdom?

52
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,733
Royal bloodline?

53
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:15,633
There's really a
kingdom somewhere
on the Moon? Now
that sounds more

54
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,033
like a fairytale.

55
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,733
You four girls are
destined to meet
that Princess and
very soon you'll

56
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,366
take on the important
duty of protecting her!

57
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,533
And time is of
the essence!

58
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:31,200
Hey Luna, I just
have one question-
Is there really a
rabbit on the moon

59
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,500
that pounds
rice cakes?

60
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,700
Oh, come on!

61
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,966
Well?

62
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,600
Look at them.

63
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,266
They're truly
lovely.

64
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,233
And yet, their
true beauty will
be revealed only
when all seven

65
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,333
Rainbow Crystals
come together.
Don't you agree?

66
00:05:55,366 --> 00:06:01,795
I'll get those last
three crystals. Then
we'll see their beauty
shine, won't we, Kunzite?

67
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,429
We certainly will.

68
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,062
(happy sigh)

69
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,329
Once we've collected
all of the Rainbow
Crystals, the Legendary
Silver Crystal will

70
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:09,562
be in our grasp.

71
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:13,462
Possessing the Silver
Crystal will surely
please our Queen.

72
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:16,262
Imagine how delighted
Queen Beryl will be.

73
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:17,562
<i>What?!</i>

74
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:19,629
But what about me?

75
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,295
Ooh, that
looks good!

76
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,329
Umino, you wanna
trade a fried shrimp
of yours for some
of my sweet peppers?

77
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:34,762
Sure Naru, if you'd
like it, have one!

78
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,162
Hey thanks!

79
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,662
(wolf whistle)

80
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:40,729
You two sure look
cute together.
So, are the two
of you going out?

81
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,729
Does it look
that way?
Hhah-ha-ha.

82
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:45,695
Whoa! Umino and
I are not together.

83
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,195
We're not dating.
He and I are
just friends.

84
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,529
Oh... We're
friends...

85
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,229
Just friends,
huh?

86
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,629
Y'know Umino's a
really nice guy...

87
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:06,029
<i>And he's smart and</i>
<i>always helps me</i>
<i>with my schoolwork.</i>

88
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:10,395
I like him, but there's
just something missing.
You know what I mean?

89
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:17,662
If you wanna win
Naru over, be
pushy! Pushy!
Pushy!

90
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:20,295
Yeah? But how
should I do that?

91
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:25,095
Then I, with all my
experience in love,
will have to instruct
you on how to do it!

92
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:28,695
We're gonna have to
transform you into
a super cool guy!

93
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,695
A super cool guy,
huh? Like who?

94
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,229
Like who?! Why
like Tuxedo Mask!

95
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,729
So Tuxedo Mask
is super cool?

96
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:41,029
Tuxedo Mask is the
coolest guy ever!

97
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:50,395
Aha! I see! So if I
transform myself into
Tuxedo Mask, then I

98
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,129
could be Naru's
boyfriend?!

99
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:57,629
Well uh, that's not
what I meant. I meant
using Tuxedo Mask as
a role model might-

100
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:02,295
Okay! From now on,
I'm going to be just
like Tuxedo Mask!
Mmm-Hmm!

101
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:06,095
From now on, call me
"Tuxedo Umino Mask!"

102
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:15,562
Do you get the
feeling someone's
following us?

103
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,395
Huh?

104
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,595
Ahhhh!

105
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,529
Fifi! Be a good
doggie and stop
barking!

106
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:30,995
Don't fear!
I'm here!

107
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:36,195
Tuxedo Umino Mask
is on the scene!
How dare you bare
your fangs at Naru!

108
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,962
What're you
trying to do!

109
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,329
How rude!

110
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:45,095
<i>Aww! Did that</i>
<i>weird boy scare</i>
<i>you sweetie!</i>

111
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,495
Umino, what're
you doing?

112
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,029
(chuckling)

113
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,095
I'm no longer
Umino!

114
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:57,629
I'm Tuxedo Umino
Mask! Defender of
love and justice!
Farewell!

115
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,595
What's with him?

116
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,829
(nervous laughter)

117
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,295
Hey, wanna stop
in for a bit!

118
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,462
Sure!

119
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:14,462
You mustn't! Stopping
here on your way home
is wrong! Before you
know it, your whole

120
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,029
allowance will be
gone! And if you
insist on going in,

121
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:22,395
you'll have to do
it by going over
my live body! Hm!

122
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,395
All right then!

123
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:27,429
Ahh! My spleen!

124
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:28,329
<i>Excuse us!</i>

125
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:34,262
Tuxedo Umino Mask
may die, but love
and justice will
live on!

126
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:38,095
What's Umino
trying to do
anyway?

127
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,595
(nervous giggles)

128
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,962
I have no clue!

129
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,862
Hey! How's
it going?

130
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:43,995
Hi Motoki!

131
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:48,962
Oh yeah! I got two
free tickets to a
show, ya wanna go?

132
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,895
Free tickets!
For two?!

133
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,495
I don't believe
it! He's asking
me out!

134
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:58,962
Me on a movie
date with Motoki!
It's a dream come
true!

135
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:02,929
Yeah, I'm way too
old to go see the
Redman Show at the
amusement park.

136
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,895
The Redman Show?!

137
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,895
Oh! Guess you girls
are too old for that
show too, aren't ya?

138
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,329
(nervous laughter)

139
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:11,229
Ah!

140
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,395
We'll take them!

141
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:14,395
Huh? You want
to go to it?

142
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:17,129
You should go
together with
Umino!

143
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:18,329
Huh?!

144
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:20,195
I'd be happy to!

145
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,262
I just don't feel
up to going.

146
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:29,762
He-he! Umino's doing
his very best in his
own way. C'mon at least
give him a chance!

147
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,929
She doesn't care
about me. I might as
well just forget it.

148
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,362
Okay, okay, fine.
I'll go with him.
But you owe me one.

149
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:40,329
(excited giggle)

150
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,595
Oh yeah!

151
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:47,762
All right then! Ah!
Tuxedo Umino Mask
is back in action!

152
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:48,395
(sad sigh)

153
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:49,995
There, there.

154
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,829
New power.
Come forth!

155
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,862
I've improved what
the Dark Crystal
is capable of.

156
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:09,129
With it, we can
turn human beings
into monsters.

157
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:11,095
(evil chuckle)

158
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,795
My dear Kunzite,
Soon I will collect
the remaining Rainbow
Crystals from Sailor

159
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,229
Moon and the others.

160
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,095
(chuckles)

161
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:39,895
To lure Sailor Moon
to me, I will turn
Naru Osaka into a
monster and she will

162
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,229
do my bidding.

163
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:43,262
(door bell ringing)

164
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:44,995
Yes. Who is it?

165
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:47,729
Tuxedo Mask!

166
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:55,162
He's good! He's
already seen through
my plan! Looks like
I'll have to pay the

167
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,295
girl a visit
another time.

168
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:04,962
Gah!

169
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,895
What was that I just
saw?! Wowie! It's a
good thing I was here
to protect Naru.

170
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,962
Hello? Who's
out there?

171
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,729
It's Tuxedo
Umino Mask!

172
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:21,262
What's with you?!
Don't you know it's
almost midnight!

173
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:26,695
Well, we didn't decide
what time to meet
tomorrow, so I thought
I'd just stop by to-

174
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,929
Uh?! Naru!

175
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:33,195
Hey, what time should
I be at the amusement
park to meet you?!
Naru?!

176
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:38,129
Ten? Eleven? Twelve-
thirty?! What time?
Hey!

177
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:40,829
Let's meet
at twelve.

178
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:44,629
Then twelve it is.
That means we can
have lunch together.

179
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:49,729
And Tuxedo Umino
Mask will bring you
lots of your favorite
deep fried shrimp, okay?

180
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:52,262
Okay?!
Hello...

181
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:00,029
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

182
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:13,262
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

183
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,840
So Usagi, now that
you know more about
your mission, what
are you doing to

184
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:30,074
find the Princess?
You weren't even
listening to me,
were you?

185
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:35,874
No, I heard you!
Really! But I just
couldn't sleep if I
didn't know where my

186
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,173
best friend's love
life is going! You
know what I mean?

187
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:43,440
Agh, you need to
work on what's
really important.

188
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,673
Why'd you follow me
to the amusement
park anyway?

189
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:49,607
As a wise messenger
from the Moon, I'm
concerned what actions
a certain foolish

190
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,173
Guardian might take.
Know what I mean?

191
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:54,707
Ah! There
they are!

192
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,207
<i>Hey, Usagi!</i>
<i>Wait up!</i>

193
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,007
Hi-ya!

194
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:00,907
Rawr!

195
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,473
Redman is here!
Hee-yuh!

196
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:05,340
Ahhh!

197
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,940
Redman Leg Attack!

198
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:12,340
I'm glad you didn't
come wearing that
funny costume today,
Umino.

199
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:13,273
(nervous giggle)

200
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,040
Why would I?
But just in case
I brought it.

201
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:19,673
Don't worry Naru,
if you need to be
protected it's in
my pack.

202
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,273
(nervous laugh)

203
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,607
Redman Punch!

204
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,573
(crowd cheering)

205
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:32,407
Dark Crystal,
transform that
girl into a
monster.

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,873
(laughing)

207
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
Hunh?!

208
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:46,873
Victory is mine!

209
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,907
Ooh!

210
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,407
(growling)

211
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
He transformed
into a monster!

212
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,907
Now it's monster
versus monster!

213
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,873
The monster Akan
is born!

214
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,273
Monster?!

215
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:15,307
Oh no, looks like my
crystal's transforming
beam hit the wrong
person!

216
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:17,907
(fighting growls)

217
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,107
This wasn't in
the script!

218
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:24,140
Have some algae
balls from Lake
Akan!

219
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:25,140
Ahh!

220
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,173
You too!

221
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,173
Hey what're you
doing?! Quit it!
Oh!

222
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:32,540
Luna, what's
going on?

223
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:34,973
This must be the
Dark Kingdom's
doing!

224
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,140
Naru!

225
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:39,573
(scared gasp)

226
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,107
Time for some marimo
algae from Lake Akan!

227
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,207
Move! C'mon
Naru! Run!

228
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,073
Usagi!

229
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:47,340
Get back here!

230
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,540
Stop that!

231
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:52,340
(gasps)

232
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,573
Umino!

233
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:57,007
I, Tuxedo Umino Mask
will protect Naru!

234
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,507
Eat fried shrimp!

235
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,907
Hnh...

236
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,807
Umino! Don't
do this!

237
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,773
Take that!

238
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,340
And now take this!

239
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,107
Ahhh!

240
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,207
Umino!

241
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,073
Ugh. Tuxedo Umino
Mask will keep on
protecting Naru!

242
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:23,073
I will keep her
safe even if it
costs me my life!

243
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,307
Umino...

244
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,940
Moon Prism Power!
Make up!

245
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,507
Ahhhh!

246
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,040
(painful grunts)

247
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:12,907
Umino!

248
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:20,940
Naru...
Get away...
Quickly...

249
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:25,807
Leave him alone!

250
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:27,973
Ahh!

251
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,407
Someone help us!

252
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,940
How dare you use a
natural treasure
like marimo algae
as a weapon!

253
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,373
I bet the Hokkaido
Sightseeing Association
didn't say you could use
that algae, now did they?

254
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,273
Akan!

255
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,740
Listen up,
monster!

256
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,307
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights
for love and for
justice!

257
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,373
I am Sailor Moon!

258
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,207
And now, in the
name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

259
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:02,340
(evil giggling)

260
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,973
Nice you could show up
on such short notice.

261
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,673
Zoisite!

262
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:11,407
I've been wanting to
see you Sailor Moon.
I have this very special
favor to ask of you...

263
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,107
And what's that?!

264
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,973
I demand that you
give me the Rainbow
Crystal that you have.

265
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,773
There's no way I'm
giving it to you!

266
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,407
Well if you refuse,
you're going to let
the people encased

267
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,240
in these algae
balls suffocate.

268
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:26,907
Huh?!

269
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,140
It's too bad, because
I don't think these
people are going to be
able to breathe for

270
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,940
too much longer.

271
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,973
(struggling grunts)

272
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,273
(struggling breaths)

273
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,073
How could you!

274
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:45,373
Now, hand over that
Rainbow Crystal!

275
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,840
You heard me,
hand it over!

276
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,073
Now!

277
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:53,073
Oh all right!

278
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:55,873
It's yours.

279
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:59,007
Good girl...

280
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,940
(painful grunt)

281
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,973
Not you again!

282
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,140
Ah! Tuxedo Mask!

283
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:09,940
I can't allow
you to have that
Rainbow Crystal,
Zoisite!

284
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,173
Silence!

285
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,373
(growling)

286
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:17,373
Akan!

287
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:18,907
Ahh!

288
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:23,307
Zoi!

289
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,607
It's Tuxedo Umino
Mask, he's trying
to...

290
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,140
Moon Tiara!
Action!

291
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,607
<i>This might hurt</i>
<i>a little bit!</i>

292
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:06,540
Ak-kanan!

293
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:19,007
Moon Healing
Escalation!

294
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:25,607
Ahhh!
Refresh!

295
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:29,840
(relaxed sigh)

296
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:37,140
(exhausted groans)

297
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,707
Wow! She managed to
defeat the monster
all by herself!

298
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:46,507
Oh no!

299
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:48,507
The Rainbow Crystal!

300
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:49,940
What?!

301
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,773
Thanks for helping
me out with this
Rainbow Crystal.

302
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:56,507
Hey! Hold on!
You give that
back!

303
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,007
Ta-ta!

304
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,873
Curse you Zoisite!

305
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,073
Aww! The Rainbow
Crystal's gone!

306
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,807
Whatever it takes.
I will get that
Rainbow Crystal back.

307
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,173
Thank you so
much Tuxedo
Mask!

308
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,540
Don't thank me.

309
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,207
Once I finally
recover that
crystal, I'll be
keeping it.

310
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,607
Huh?!

311
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Until we meet
again, farewell!

312
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,507
(people cheering)

313
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:27,240
Hi-ya!

314
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,573
(growls)

315
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,607
Redman is back!
Heh-yah!

316
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,607
Was that stuff
before part of
the show?

317
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,507
I dunno, but
it sure was
awesome!

318
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,573
Redman Leg
Attack!

319
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,607
Thank you so much
Umino, you were
really cool today.

320
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,707
Just call me
Tuxedo Umino
Mask.

321
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,707
Tuxedo Umino Mask.

322
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,840
(excited giggles)

323
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,807
Ugh, Usagi?

324
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:07,473
Having that Rainbow
Crystal stolen from
us was a real setback.

325
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:09,773
Hey, are you
listening to me?!

326
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,973
<i>I'm so confused...</i>

327
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:22,773
<i>Why would Tuxedo</i>
<i>Mask say that?</i>

328
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:31,040
Once I finally Recover
that Crystal, I'll be
keeping it...

329
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:16,540
Usagi, we've got real
trouble! A Sailor
Moon impostor has
shown up!

330
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:21,373
<i>What?! He-he-he!</i>
<i>Well if an impostor</i>
<i>has shown up, then</i>
<i>that means I must</i>

331
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:22,907
<i>be super famous!</i>

332
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,873
Oh c'mon! What're
you talking about?
You need to get out
there and stop her!

333
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,573
<i>But what if she's</i>
<i>actually on of us?</i>

334
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,040
Hey wait, that's
Sailor V!

335
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:36,073
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Enter Venus, the Last</i>
<i>Sailor Guardian."</i>

336
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,840
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
