Mm?

She might actually be
a monster sent by the
enemy. Be careful.

Ha ha ha ha ha!
Don't be silly!

159

What's so
funny, Usagi?

Nothing!
Nothing at all!

Hey, listen, Ami,
you want to go
play some video
games with me?

162
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,132
Okay, but I've
never played one.

163
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,868
Don't worry about
that. I can teach
you everything
you need to know!

Yaahh!

Ha ha ha ha ha!

169
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:13,290
Well the buttons are
clearly sticking today.
But that's how it's done.

170
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:16,658
Well why don't you
give it a try anyway?
It's really fun!

171
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,194
Okay. But it
looks hard.

172
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:22,262
Mm! Another smart
observation from the
genius! It is hard!

for my great plan.

Oh, no! Look
at the time!

Sorry, gotta go.

I'll be late for
my cram school!

192

I'm so sorry! I didn't
realize that you had
to go to there today.

193
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,721
I go everyday.

194

Egh!
Everyday?!

195
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,158
Studying's the only

I have to do my best.

It was fun!

Sure!
Anything for you.

203
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:55,337
I think that friend of
yours might have dropped
this on her way out.

Yes?!

Please make sure you're
using your crystal disk.

220
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,923
It'll help you study
more effectively.

221

Remember, you're on a
scholarship, so you must

Sure.

[sigh] When I use that disk,
I get the worst headaches.

It's easier just to
learn on my own.

227
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:23,441
Oh. It says that if someone
uses this newly developed
"crystal disk" thing, they
can become a genius.

228
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,277
Is this the crystal disk
they're talking about?

229
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,545
You should be
careful, Usagi.

230

Huh? I'm just
returning her disk!
You worry too much.

Wait. You think you
can become a genius,

<i>You again?!</i>

Would you please stop
creeping up on me?!

00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:44,924
Whatever. But more
importantly, was that
cat just talking to you?

00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:45,825
Eek!

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:12,814
Huh?

00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:14,715
I panicked and
forgot to give
this disk back!

Hrg! This is all that
stupid guy's fault!

247
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:21,288
Hold on, Usagi, let's
go to the school and
find a computer first!

248
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:22,754
Huh? What for?

249
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:25,390
I want to take a look
at what's on that disk.

You mean you think it's
something suspicious?

Look, I haven't had time to
learn about computers, so you'll
have to figure it out yourself!

00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:37,601
[nervous laugh]
Ha ha ha! Of
course she can
use a computer!

253
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:41,569
Nowadays, everyone should
be able to use a computer.
Even you, Usagi.

254
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,038
Okay I get it.

Explain to me in fifty
words or less exactly
what gravity is!

Aw, come on,

happened! You stopped using the
crystal disk, didn't you?

322
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:52,604
I did! Studying should be done

Oh! The strange energy

she's a Sailor Guardian!
