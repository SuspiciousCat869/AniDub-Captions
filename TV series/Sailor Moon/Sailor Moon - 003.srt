everyone else has!

151
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,240
And I've even sent
them a bunch of love
letters as well!

152
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:31,741
Seriously?! Who do
you write them to?!

153
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,109
I make up future
boyfriends and
write to them.

154
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:35,845
It doesn't really matter,
it's just for fun!

155
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:36,778
That's smart!

156
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,180
Now why didn't I
think of that?

157
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:41,282
My future boyfriend...

158
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:41,849
Uwah!

159
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:42,350
Ah!

160
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,383
Dagh!

161
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,653
I'm so sorry!
I guess I wasn't paying
attention!

162
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,154
Uh, Usagi!

163
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,388

Nghh!

I know walking and
talking at the same time
is difficult for you,

169
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:02,398
but you really should
pay attention to
where you're going.

170

Ha ha ha ha ha!

Oh, shut up!

172
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,502
Hey, Usagi, do you
actually know that guy?!

173
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:09,203
'Cause he is
totally gorgeous.

174
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:11,472
Wrong! There is nothing
gorgeous about him.

Gotta concentrate!

00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,046
Gotta write a love letter!

179
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,615
You know, Usagi, a love
letter is meaningless
unless you give it to
the person directly.

180
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:26,617
Don't talk to me right now!
You got it?

181
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,384
O-kay!

It's no use! I can't do it!
I can't come up with a
single sentence!

185
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,534
There's a reason I
failed creative writing.

186
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,735
I really don't
think that's
the problem.

187

That's it!

Huh?!

189
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:55,872
I'll just go to see J. Daito
from the "Midnight Zero"
radio show,

190
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:59,409
and I'll get him to tell me
exactly how you go about
writing a love letter!

191
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:00,410
What?!

Yes.

197

But we don't do a program
called "Midnight Zero"
here, and we never have!

199
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:15,488
Go on, now.

The show is on!

205

That security guard
flat-out lied to me!

This whole situation
is really strange.

207
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,941
According to this schedule
in the newspaper,

208
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:44,277
FM Ten is supposed to
be airing a different
program right now.

209
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,679
Well, that's clearly
some kind of mistake!

Huh??

225
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,672
So that letter
we heard from
"Haruna in Love..."

226
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,540
...was from our

Usagi, it's time for us
to investigate this!

00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,725
I think that there's
something nefarious going
on at that radio station!

It appears our
experiment was
a success.

260
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,972
Who could have guessed
that the hearts of
girls in love

261
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:16,408
held such incredibly
powerful energy?

262
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:23,746
We simply make them fall asleep
with that innocent-looking
flower brooch and then we siphon
off their dreams of love.

This tool of yours
is very useful!

How does it work?
What do I do?

You just have to shout

are extremely dangerous!

305
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:34,547
[gasp]

306
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,683
If you receive one,
don't touch it under
any circumstances!

307
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:38,617
That's a lie!

308
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,885
Everyone, take a moment
and think about it!

309
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,489
Love letters are completely
meaningless unless you give
them directly to the person
that you're writing them to!

310
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,590
Stop dreaming!

311
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:49,559
Ah! Hey, I was the
one who said that!

312
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:50,760
[nervous laugh]
Ehehehe...

313
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:51,761
Who are you?!

314
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,162
Aaaghh!

315
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:55,030
No! Usagi!

316
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:00,735
[gasp]

317
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:01,901
Ahh!

318
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,506
I won't let you get
away with this!

319
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,006
A monster!

320
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:10,675
Gyahh!

321
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,079
Quickly, Usagi!
Transform!

322
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:19,749
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

323
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:52,975
I am The pretty Guardian
who fights for love
and for justice.

324
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,742
I am Sailor Moon!

325
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:58,779
[chuckle]

326
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,183
Trampling on the innocent
hearts of young girls in
love is crossing the line.

327
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:04,784
And this isn't a crosswalk!

328
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,919
Uh, could have done without
the "crosswalk" part!

329
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:08,019
Oh. Yeah.

330
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:09,220
But, anyway...

331
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:13,791
And now, in the name of the
moon, I will punish you!

332
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,358
So, it's you.

333
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:17,927
You're the one who's been
getting in our way, huh?

334
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,829
Yeah! And I guess you're
the leader of the bad guys!

335
00:19:21,163 --> 00:19:23,531
Yes, my name... is Jadeite.

336
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:26,267
Prepare yourself, Sailor Moon!

337
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,135
Ahh!

338
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,136
Uwahh!

339
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,070
Huagh!

340
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,007
No! You won't escape!

341
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,775
Huh?

342
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,576
Yahh!

343
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,812
Here's where you
meet your end!

344
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,000
Yah!

345
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,249
You're sure persistent!

346
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:47,817
Ha haa!

347
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:49,852

348
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,820
Wah!

349
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:55,123
Fight back, Sailor Moon!
Use Moon Tiara Action!

350
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:58,592
Moon Tiara Action!

351
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,060
Ah!

352
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:03,562
Ha ha ha ha!
Missed me, little girl!

353
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:04,830
Haaaa!

354
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:08,193
Huh?

355
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,001
Unhh!

356
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,203
Huaaaghh!

357
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,673
Nggh!

So, you wish to try your luck
in a fight against me, do you?

360
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:24,712

Heh.

Hrmm!

365
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:41,024
Why you!

366
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,162
Whoa!

367
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:46,696
Sailor Moon!

368
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:47,629
Gyah! Oof!

369
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,001
Ow, that hurts!

370
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:53,701
[gasp]

That's one of
Tuxedo Mask's roses!

376
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,931
Farewell. Until we meet again.

Ha ha ha ha ha!

Ohh Tuxedo Mask! My hero!

Nnn... Huh?

380
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,676
Hmm?!?

382
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:56,383
<i>My dearest Tuxedo Mask,</i>

Oh! Ahh!

385
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,753
You're really still
writing love letters?

386
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,322
Uou know that
Midnight Zero show
is over, right?

387
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,523
That doesn't matter!

388
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,657
I'm giving it to
someone directly!

389
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,991
Give it back to me,
already!

390
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,060
Maybe I should read it
over for you first!

391
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,061
What?! No!

392

Good morning, everyone!

394
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:15,764
I wanted to say that
I'm sorry for making
you all worry about me!

00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:17,766
But I'm fine now!
[Usagi]
Come on, Naru!
It's not funny!

396
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,134
My head is completely clear,
so let's get the day started!

397
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,668
Give me back my
love letter!

398

A love letter? Wait!

399
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,538
I mean it, Naru! Come on!
Give it back to me, would you?!
