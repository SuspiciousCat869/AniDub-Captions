Plus, you also demanded
a kiss from Usagi.

357
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:52,015
Oh, and you broke a
window in one of the
teacher's offices.

Yes! You're right.
I shouldn't worry
so much!

After all, you're
always okay when you
get a bad grade on a
test, aren't you?

366
00:22:17,177 --> 00:22:18,712
