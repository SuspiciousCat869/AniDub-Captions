8
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,166

a guardian in a

told me I have to
fight bad guys!

It's been a while,

remembered my name. I
feel very honored, sir.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,633

business does Queen

express my love for you.

you came.

that. I came here
today to offer you my

(Sigh)

41
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,833
Oh, just imagine
sailing away by the
light of the moon.

42
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:38,966
I know, but I heard
that tickets have been
completely sold out
for a month!

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,433
(Umino)
Looking at those
romantic cruises, huh?

44
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:44,166
They do seem nice!

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,866

room for six hundred

Supposedly the view
of the stars as the
ship travels from Tokyo

47
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,300
(cont'd)
to Yokohama is enough
to make any man and
woman fall in love!

48

Well now you've just
gone and made me
seasick. Thanks a lot.

49
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,266
Hold on, Usagi.
You mean you wanted
to go on that cruise
for real?!

50
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,266
I see. Oh boy,
this is very
unfortunate.

51
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,500
Umino, are you
saying?!

52
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,100
That you have
tickets?!

53
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:14,966
I did, but I'm
afraid that I don't
have them anymore,
because I gave them

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
both to my neighbor.

55
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,133
(Usagi)
How could you pass
up something so
incredible?!

56
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,033
Well, I'm still a
minor. I can't go
without a legal
guardian.

57
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:27,500
And besides that,
did you see when it
sails? It's way past
my curfew!

58
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,900
(Sad sighs)

59
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:32,466
That's probably the
most responsible thing
I've ever heard you say.

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,400
Actually, come to
think of it, the
lottery in the shopping
district was giving

61
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,800
two tickets out
as the grand prize.

62
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,866
Ah!

63
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,966
I'm gonna get it
this time, I know
it!

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Aw, I lost again!

65
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:54,200
Here's a packet of
tissues as a
consolation prize!

66
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,766
Oh, this is so
frustrating!

67
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,766
(Rei)
Usagi?

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,133
(Usagi)
Oh, hi!

69
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,966
(Usagi)
Rei, you won't
believe this! I've
played this lottery

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,966
(cont'd)
ten times so I can
go on this cruise,
and I haven't won!

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,466
(Rei)
Two tickets? I don't
get it. Why would you
even want those?

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,933
C'mon, wouldn't you
want to go on it
too?

73
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,600
Course not!

74
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,900

Usagi! We don't have
time to waste on useless
nonsense like this!

00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:17,933
Hmph!

76
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:20,100
I'd like to give
it a try.

77
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,400
Sure, you got it.

78
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,900

Scary!

80

I still don't see
why I should give
them to you.

It'll be lots of
fun!

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,966
You're supposed to
go with a boyfriend,
you know!

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah, and do you
have one?

93
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,233
Shut up!

94
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,933
Ha! I knew you
didn't have anyone
to bring!

95
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,066
Unlike you, I can
easily get a date
for the cruise.

96
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,266
That's enough you
too! Cut it out,
already!

97
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,166
What's wrong?

98
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,766
Oh, it's just their
usual silly fight.

99

Ami! Rei is being
really mean to me
right now!

Ami, perfect timing.
C'mere!

101

Huh, what is it?

102
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,700

Just get over here,
will ya?

wanted to go.

110
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:16,833
No way! Can you
imagine that dork

But, I...

112
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,800

You can do nautical
research, it'll be
a learning experience.

C'mon!

114
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,300

find a hot boyfriend
just like Tuxedo Mask!

115
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,766
<i>Ha! I knew it!</i>

Okay, let's get
onboard!

123

How do you plan on
doing that, Usagi?

124
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:16,733
What are you talking
about?! Situations
like these, are why
I have this!

125
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:22,033
What?!
You can't, Usagi!
That's only supposed to
be used to fight for good!

I don't wanna go-!

Captain Jadeite, all
of our young victims are
climbing aboard by

131

the dozens! Looks

going well!

132

It's hard to believe
that this is actually
just a broken-down

133

old ship that's been
enchanted with your
seawater magic.

Yes, but you should
know this isn't all

Uhh.. Why did I
decide to wear heels?
This is ridiculous!

140
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:05,400
You know, I've been
looking around, and

00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,033
that are here all
by themselves.

142
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,800
You're right.
I knew this was some
kind of love boat, but
I didn't think it

143
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,033
would be all couples!
I thought there might
be some single guys
here!

144
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:17,633
(Giggles)
Guess we won't be
finding boyfriends!

145
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:30,066
(Luna)
Where are we?

146
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,733
The engine room.

147
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:36,066
Can't be. The engine
room of a ship this big
wouldn't be anywhere
near this quiet.

148
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,566
Well, maybe it's
just idling now.

149
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,133
I don't think so.
It looks to me like
we're moving at full
speed.

150
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,700
Boy, you sure worry
a lot. Maybe they've
just have some kind
of state-of-the-art

151
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:50,866
silent engine
installed. Anyway,
I wonder where Rei
and Ami went.

152
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,766
(Jadeite)
What are you
doing here?!

153
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,566
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

154
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,400
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

155
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:26,966
You're a reporter,
huh? Well, I'm sorry,
but you're in a
restricted area.

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,400
Oh my, what a
cute guy!

157
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:32,900
<i>What's this intense</i>
<i>evil aura that</i>
<i>I'm sensing?!</i>

158
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,166
(Jadeite)
It's dangerous
here.

159
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,933
(Usagi)
Oh, sorry! I got
separated from my
crew when I came

160
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,666
(cont'd)
onboard, and
I got lost.

161
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,833
Oh, I see. You've
got a bit of a
problem, huh?

162
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,800
I know! We can
go look for my
friends together!

163
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,066
Uh..okay.

164
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,400
<i>Something about this</i>
<i>woman bothers me.</i>

165
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:55,733
<i>He would make a</i>
<i>wonderful future</i>
<i>boyfriend!</i>

166
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,633
I just came up with
a really great idea!

167
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,433
Oh? What is it?

168
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,033
<i>(Rei)</i>
<i>Since there are so</i>
<i>many couples here,</i>
<i>there are bound to</i>

169
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,633
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>be at least a few</i>
<i>of them who are</i>
<i>fighting, right?</i>

170
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,233
(Ami)
What are you getting
at?

171
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:14,400
If we can find some
guys who've been
freshly dumped by
their girlfriends,

172
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,333
then we can grab
them on the rebound!

173
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:19,966
(Ami Sighs)
I should've just stayed
home and memorized the
dictionary.

174
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,866
(Jadeite)
I'd like to make an
announcement to the
whole ship that you

175
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,666
(cont'd)
got separated from
your friends.

176
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,666
But I'm afraid that if I
do so, it would ruin the
beautifully romantic
mood that the other

177
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,833
guests are enjoying.

178
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:33,366
Yeah, you do have
a good point.

179
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,566
<i>Besides, I'm perfectly</i>
<i>happy just being</i>
<i>with you!</i>

180
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,566
<i>What is this odd</i>
<i>feeling I'm having?!</i>

181
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,366
<i>(Jadeite)</i>
<i>Why do I feel the</i>
<i>need to be so cautious</i>
<i>around this girl?</i>

182
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,566
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Oh! He can't take</i>
<i>his eyes off me!</i>

183
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,200
<i>(Tetiz)</i>
<i>Captain...</i>

184
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,866
Excuse me.
It's nearly time.

185
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,000
I see. Pardon me.
I have to go now.

186
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,466
Oh, that's too
bad.

187
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,633
Ah! We were just
getting to the good
part!

188
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,900
Usagi! We have a
situation! This ship
is full of evil energy!

189
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,466
Huh?!

190
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,666
The time is near.

191
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Yes, the energy of love
from all the couples
onboard has almost
reached its peak now!

192
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,700
<i>(Tetiz)</i>
<i>And when it does we'll</i>
<i>collect the energy</i>
<i>from over six hundred</i>

193
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,366
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>passengers at once!</i>

194
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,300
So, do you agree
that my plan is a
good one?

195
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,433
If it works you'll
have my praise, but
not sooner.

196
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm ninety-nine percent
certain it will work.
And if it does succeed,
then I believe you

197
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:45,233
ought to start paying
a little more attention
to me, Master Jadeite.

198
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,333
(Jadeite)
I'll consider it...

199
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:49,966
What are they saying?
I can't hear?

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,233
Whatever it is, I'm
sure he's a monster.

201
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,433
But he's my future
boyfriend!

202
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:56,733
Come on! Honestly,
Usagi?!

203
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,733
Ah!

204
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,400
(Usagi)
Oh no, they're
gone!

205
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,566
I bet they're up
to something just
terrible, too!

206
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,800
Um, listen, Rei.
Do you think you
could eat a little
quieter?

207
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,866
Don't tell me
what to do!

208
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,866
(Mouth full)
I've got to take
advantage of this
trip somehow!

209
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,200
Who needs boyfriends?!

210
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:24,566
<i>(Announcer)</i>
<i>Attention, everyone!</i>
<i>Please gather in</i>
<i>the reception hall.</i>

Hey, you think we
should go to that?

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Oh yes!
Anything to get you
away from the food!

214
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,266
She just said the
reception hall!

215
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,700
Maybe we'll find
the monsters there!

216
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:53,900
(People Chattering)

217
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:57,133
Thank you all for
coming.

218
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:06,633
Now cuddle up as you
watch the most romantic
show in the whole world!

(cont'd)
(Laughs)

221
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
What a trick!

222
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,666
This is a pretty
elaborate effect!

223
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,766
Rei, is that-

224
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,333
It's definitely a
monster.

225
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,700
This ship is like a
maze! Which way is
the reception hall?!

226
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:33,066
(Laughs)
All of you will
continue your romantic
dreams, in hell!

(Deep Chuckle)

228
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,800
That's Jadeite.

229
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,500
Hm? Who are you?!

230
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:54,800
Heh. You've made a
big mistake, Tetiz.
You're only stealing
energy from couples.

231
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,200
(Jadeite cont'd)
But your plan doesn't
have any effect on girls
who don't have true

232
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,733
romantic partners.

233
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:03,500
Why did you two come
if you don't have
boyfriends?!

234
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:07,566
Hey, shut up!
We could have boyfriends
if we really wanted
them!

235
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,166
Hmm, I doubt it!
Show these girls the
door!

236
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,100
Ahh!

237
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,000
Gotcha!

238
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,433
Why did I wear
heels?

239
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,500
We can't transform out
in the open, in front
of everyone.

240
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,066
(Rei)
We're in trouble.

241
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,500
Ha! It's useless to
struggle.

242
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:37,600
Master Jadeite,
I may have made a
minor miscalculation
in my plan,

243
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:40,566
(Tetiz cont'd)
But we've still
managed to collect
plenty of Human Energy.

244
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,033
(Tetiz cont'd)
I believe that Queen
Beryl will be very
pleased with us.

245
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,133
(Jadeite)
Agreed.

246
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,600
(Luna)
Here it is, Usagi!

247
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,200

249
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:36,100
(Usagi)
Stop!

250
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,100
It's Sailor Moon!

251
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,300
(Usagi)
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights
for love and for justice!

252
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,600
(Cont'd)
I am Sailor Moon!

253
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,933
(Tetiz)
Just how did you get
on board?!

254
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:55,000
How dare you target
couples and go after
the energy that their
love creates!

255
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:59,266
Love is precious!
Some girls can't even
find boyfriends! It's
so sad!

256
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,133
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

257
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,000
So you're Sailor
Moon?!

258
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,200
I will destroy you!

259
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,933
Ah!

260
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,600
Whoa!

261
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,366
(Luna)
Be very careful now,
Sailor Moon! It looks
like that monster

262
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,333
(cont'd)
has the power to
control seawater!

263
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,166
Take this!

264
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,066
Ah!

265
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,266
(Chuckle)
Excellent job, Tetiz.

266
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,366
(Rei)
Fire Soul!

267
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,866
We've gotta hurry,
Sailor Mars!

268
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:44,400
Damn right! No one
makes fun of me for
not having a boyfriend,
and gets away with it!

269
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,300
Die!

270
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,966
Bubble!

271
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:55,166
Spray!

272
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:59,466
Agh! Damn it!

273
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,133
Fire!

274
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,400
Soul!

275
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,466
(Ami)
Finish her,
Sailor Moon!

276
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,833
(Usagi)
Okay!

277
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,466
Moon Tiara!

278
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,800
Action!

279
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,800
(Gasp)
Ah!

280
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:43,833
(Groans)

281
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:58,000
(Chuckle)
Well, well, I
underestimated you
girls, but then, you've

282
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:01,000
gotten a lot more
skilled since the
last time we met.

283
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,833
It's the end of the
line, Jadeite!

284
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,533
We're not letting you
get away with this!

285
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,900
Both of you, don't
let your guard down!

286
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:11,200
Ha! Insolent.
This ends now!

287
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:14,166
Huh?! Why did he
disappear?!

288
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,333
(Rei)
Did he run away?!

289
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,966
I don't know.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,033
(Jadeite)
Uh?! Q-Queen Beryl!

291
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,933
You used my precious
monster Tetiz without
my permission, and
thanks to your

292
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,266
incompetence, she's
now been killed!

293
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,400
Y-You're mistaken!
This was Tetiz's idea
right from the very
start!

294
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:40,133
I'll hear your excuses
at the palace. Better
choose your words
carefully.

295
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,100
You've already caused
enough trouble.

296
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:44,900
Yes.

297
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,433
<i>Damn it!</i>
<i>I'll get you for</i>
<i>this, Sailor Moon!</i>

298
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,866
Aw, this is just
plain awful!
No love connection
for us!

299
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,333
Well, I'm not just
gonna give up!
The next time there's
a cruise like this,

300
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,833
I'm gonna have a
boyfriend to take
on it with me!

301
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,966
Yeah! And I'll be
right behind you!

302
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,300
Not if you keep on
dressing like that...

303
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,466
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Jean jackets are</i>
<i>making a comeback</i>
<i>you know!</i>

304
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,966
(Luna)
Those two are never
going to learn, are
they?

305
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,100
Think I'll just stick
to studying for now.

306
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,000
(Luna)
Oh, boy!

307
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,833
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Oh, no! Jadeite has</i>
<i>declared war on us!</i>

308
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:15,666
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>We can't let him</i>
<i>win, Usagi!</i>

309
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,633
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Right! We have to</i>
<i>stop him at any cost</i>
<i>to make this world</i>

310
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,633
<i>(cont'd)</i>
<i>a safer place!</i>

311
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,266
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>That's the spirit!</i>

312
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,966
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Now, with that said.</i>
<i>Rei, Ami, do your</i>
<i>best!</i>

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,033
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>Oh, Usagi...</i>

314
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:31,100
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Girls Unite: The End of</i>
<i>Jadeite."</i>

315
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,700
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Hey, that rhymes!</i>

316
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,866
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
