1
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:02,933
Jadeite! Don't
underestimate the
abilities of girls!

2
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,400
We can do a lot more than
just cry, you know!

3
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,600
Now you're finally
gonna pay for your
countless evil deeds!

4
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:15,700
I am Sailor Moon, and in
the name of the moon...
I'll punish you!

5
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,933
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino,
I'm a fourteen year-old
middle school student!

6
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:25,766
I'm a bit of a klutz.

7
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,600
... and some people might
say I'm a little
emotional.

8
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,666
So, one day, this
strange cat named Luna
gave me a special brooch
that transformed me into

9
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,600
a guardian in a sailor
uniform...

10
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,766
...and told me I had to
fight bad guys!

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,466
Boy, does that ever make
me nervous!

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,533
But I'm sure it'll all
work out fine!

13
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,733
[giggling]

14
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:55,233
"Girls Unite: The End of
Jadeite"

15
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:09,533
Jadeite, it's true that
you have collected a
great deal of energy on
Earth for our great ruler.

16
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:13,300
However, it's also true
that you've failed me
many times.

17
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,066
[grunting]

18
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,733
Perhaps your greatest and
most disappointing
failure of all is that
you have been unable to

19
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:25,733
defeat those infuriating
nuisances, Sailor Moon,
Sailor Mercury, and
Sailor Mars.

20
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,800
Queen Beryl, in my
defense-

21
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,433
I do not want to
hear your excuses!

22
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,566
[growling]

23
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,333
You must defeat Sailor
Moon and the others
before they cause any
more trouble!

24
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,400
Or else it's...

25
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,600
...the "Sentence of
Eternal Sleep"

26
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:41,533
[gasping and whispering]

27
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,933
<i>The Sentence of Eternal</i>
<i>Sleep!</i>

28
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,466
How terrifying!

29
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,700
Jadeite, as I'm sure
you're aware... Those who
receive the punishment of
the "Sentence of Eternal

30
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:55,700
Sleep" are plunged into
the deepest darkness,
never to awaken again.

31
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,466
[exhaling]

32
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,933
There's Cygnus...

33
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,300
Sagittarius...

34
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,800
Libra...

35
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,300
The constellation of
Motoki...

36
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,900
The constellation of
Tuxedo Mask...

37
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,666
[giggling]
What am I saying?!

38
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,533
How could this happen to
me? I've fallen for two
different guys! What a
flirt I've become!

39
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:31,233
[sighing and yawning]

40
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:35,366
Don't worry, they don't
even notice you. Besides,
your crushes are like
bubbles...

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,233
... they only
last a moment.

42
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,933
You know... It's tough
being a young girl in
love...

43
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:42,666
But... if only...

44
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,766
Motoki were actually
Tuxedo Mask...

45
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,600
Usagi! How I love you!

46
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,900
Ahhh, that'd
be awesome!

47
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,600
[evil chuckling]

48
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,766
Huh?

49
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,433
What is that?

50
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:05,666
[hissing]

51
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,233
Hear me! I am Jadeite!

52
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:13,333
Now... Sailor Moon,
Sailor Mercury, and
Sailor Mars...

53
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:15,633
[gasping]

54
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,433
Come to Haneda Airport at
one a.m. tomorrow night.

55
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:23,633
Be at Runway F. If you
aren't there...

56
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,200
[spitting]

57
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,200
[gasping]

58
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,500
You... You monster!

59
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,733
That fire was merely an
illusion.

60
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:41,600
But if you're late,
I'll turn Tokyo into a
sea of flames for real.

61
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,633
[gasping]

62
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:51,633
If we don't show up,
Jadeite will set the
whole city on fire,
hurting millions!

63
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,900
What are we
going to do?!

64
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:57,300
Go! When evil issues a
challenge, we must always
confront it!

65
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,633
But we'd probably be
walking right into a
trap.

66
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,900
Mmm...

67
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:04,633
Maybe, but even so, we
have to!

68
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,233
What do you think, Usagi?

69
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,966
We should go and fight
the bad guys, right?

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,166
Mmm...

71
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,300
No, we should come up
with a plan first, don't
you think?

72
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,833
Well, I say... I'm too
scared, and I don't
want to go at all!

73
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:16,800
[shocked]

74
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:21,466
Last night, a mysterious
figure suddenly appeared
in the night sky.

75
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,900
The authorities believe
the strange image was
projected into the
atmosphere as part of a

76
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,600
malicious prank to
frighten the public.

77
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:32,400
However,... the police
plan to station officers
at Haneda Airport
tomorrow night so they

78
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,466
will be ready to protect
Tokyo from any dangers
that might arise.

79
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,933
We should go, too!

80
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,900
Yeah, let's check it out!

81
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:44,700
This is not good! If all
these people come to the
airport, then they'll get
caught in the battle!

82
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,033
Yeah...

83
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,733
Well, you know... Maybe
this is a sign that we
shouldn't go at all!

84
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:49,466
Usagi.

85
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,633
Just kidding!

86
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,933
<i>So what do you think,</i>
<i>Usagi?</i>

87
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,233
This whole thing's just a
mean prank, right?

88
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,966
You're wrong! It's not!

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm certain that was
actually an alien from
outer space who's come to
this planet to give

90
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,900
humanity a warning about
its corrupt ways before
it's too late!

91
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:08,600
What?! Come on, Umino,
you've just read way too
much third-rate science
fiction manga!

92
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:13,600
Whatever it is, it sounds
exciting! Let's get a big
group together and go to
Haneda Airport tonight to

93
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,633
see what happens!

94
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,666
Not so fast, you guys!

95
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,833
Forget it! Absolutely
not! You middle-schoolers
have no business whatsoever
being out that late at night!

96
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:25,333
That's right! I agree
with Ms. Haruna! We
really shouldn't go!

97
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,233
Why not?

98
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,433
Because it's dangerous!

99
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,933
But how can you be so
sure?

100
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:29,733
Well, because...

101
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:32,466
You know something, don't
you?!

102
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,600
No, I don't! But if you
have the time to go out
and play at night,

103
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,300
wouldn't it be better
to spend it studying
at home?

104
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,833
[gasping]
Miss Tsukino!

105
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:44,466
You're speaking so
sensibly...

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,666
No fever... Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

107
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,733
<i>Maybe you should go</i>
<i>lie down in the</i>
<i>nurse's office.</i>

108
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:53,833
Hey! Is it really so out
of the ordinary that
I'm making sense?!

109
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:57,633
I mean... Why is everyone
so mean to me?!

110
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,200
[laughing]

111
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,433
Wasn't that so mean?

112
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:05,433
You may not want to hear
this, but I agree with
your teacher.

113
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:09,400
Part of your charm is
that you have your own
point of view, that you
don't think the same way

114
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,133
everybody else does.

115
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,600
And personally, I like
girls who have unique
personalities and who
aren't afraid to speak

116
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,566
their minds, either.

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
Oh? Yeah?!

118
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,333
Woo hoo!

119
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,666
He said he likes me!
[giggling]

120
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,600
Oh--!

121
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:26,966
Oh, no...

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,500
<i>Ouch!</i>

123
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,533
Oh! Sorry about that!

124
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,300
You again?!

125
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,600
I think this is the
second time you've hit me
with your shoe! Are you
trying to hurt me?!

126
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,333
Hey, it's your fault for
standing there like a
numbskull!

127
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:42,866
Man, you're really rude,
you know that? Can't you
keep your shoes on and
just pretend to be even a

128
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,200
little bit
well behaved?!

129
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,000
No!

130
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:50,700
Look, I'm not gonna go
changing myself! Not when
there's an awesome guy
out there who likes me

131
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,233
just the way that I am!

132
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,233
Are you serious? That guy
must be a total loser!

133
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,333
He's not! He's way more
charming than a big jerk
like you!

134
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:04,366
Like attracts like. Even
a cracked pot has a cover
of its own. And every Bun
head has her loser.

135
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,866
Uh! You're so mean! I
understand insulting me,

136
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,533
but how could you say
that about Motoki?!

137
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:15,866
Hey... Stop...

138
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,633
[crying]
You big meanie!

139
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm sorry, but, uh,
something came up, and I
have to go!

140
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,700
Here's your shoe back.
See ya! Bye now!

141
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,800
[crying]

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,300
I have no use for
inconsequential humans.
Take a nap.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,566
[grunting]

144
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,900
[sinister chuckling]

145
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,500
Now come, Sailor
guardians.

146
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,933
Hurry up, Usagi, or
we'll leave you behind!

147
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,466
<i>Stop being so bossy!</i>

148
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,466
<i>Now's not the time to</i>
<i>be arguing!</i>

149
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,966
Uh-oh... It looks like we
missed the last train!

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,633
Well, we'll just have to
take a taxi, then.

151
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,300
[gasping]
The door opened!

152
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,866
What do you think?

153
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,966
Seems the enemy has
sent us an invitation.
I accept.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,366
Hey, wait!

155
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,600
[groaning]

156
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:37,800
[gasping]
They locked us in!

157
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,333
Not good...! We might've
just stepped right into
the enemy's trap!

158
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,500
There sure are a lot of
police officers here!

159
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:17,500
It looks like nothing's
happened yet.

160
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,766
You're right, but don't
let your guard down.

161
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,866
Behind you!

162
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,400
[gasping]
Oh, no!

163
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,900
Why are these police
officers attacking us?!

164
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,766
This way! Quickly!

165
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,833
What is wrong with our
government, hiring people
to attack innocent young
girls! Hold up, you two!

166
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:36,900
Don't leave me!

167
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,966
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

168
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,566
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

169
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,933
[panting]

170
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:07,800
Uh!

171
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,466
Wait a minute.
Something's not right...

172
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,300
Mm!

173
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,466
Mercury Power Make Up!

174
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,466
All right, I'm in, too!

175
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,833
Mars Power Make Up!

176
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,533
[groaning]

177
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:52,433
What, seriously? Am I
really the last one to
transform!?

178
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:56,333
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

179
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,600
[gasping]
I knew it!

180
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,833
Those officers aren't
real humans! They're just
clay golems!

181
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:54,400
If that's the case...
There's no need to hold
back!

182
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,433
Fire...

183
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:00,833
...Soul!

184
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,700
[grunting and groaning]

185
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,133
Feel the burn.

186
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,300
Ami was right,
they're made of clay!

187
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,766
Sailor Mars, you are so
awesome!

188
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,633
I know!

189
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,966
<i>[laughing]</i>

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,966
At last you're here,
Sailor Moon, Sailor
Mercury, and Sailor Mars!

191
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,366
And you've shown me your
true identities!

192
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,433
[gasping]

193
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,900
Oh, great! We've been
outed!

194
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:34,666
The joys of life are
short-lived, and its
ordeals many, but that's
not your concern since

195
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,566
your lives end today!

196
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,300
Hold on... They say that
beauty is short-lived. So
does that mean that he's
gonna go after me first

197
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,900
because I'm so beautiful?

198
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,433
And what exactly about
you is beautiful?

199
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:48,733
Just look! You can't deny
that I'm more beautiful
than you are!

200
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,333
Okay, I'll humor
you 'cause you're
dumb.

201
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:54,333
Well, my nose is clearly
more beautiful than yours.

202
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:58,766
[laughing]
What nose? It looks like
somebody put a thumb tack
on your face!

203
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,566
That is so mean!

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,333
I told you, now is not
the time to be arguing!

205
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,900
Oh, right. Sorry!

206
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:08,933
We still have an
important mission to
fulfill! So we can't
afford to lose here!

207
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:12,233
I'll send you three
pathetic kids to the
depths of hell!

208
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,466
Whoa! No way!

209
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:33,600
That plane is
gonna crush us!

210
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,866
Run, quickly!

211
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,633
[panting]

212
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,333
There's another one
coming!

213
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,700
Somebody do something!

214
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,033
Right! I'll use
Fire Soul!

215
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:54,966
No! Do you know how much
an airplane like that
costs?! A lifetime of all
your allowances put

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,966
together wouldn't even
come close to covering
it!

217
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,333
Huh?!

218
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,266
It's that much...?!

219
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,533
Then there's just one
thing left to do!

220
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,033
What?

221
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,600
We keep running!

222
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:04,600
What?!

223
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,400
It's one thing to get
run over by a car,

224
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:12,433
but it'll be too
embarrassing to say I
got run over by an
airplane!

225
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,300
And we're running out of
runway!

226
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,333
[gasping]

227
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,366
This is bad!

228
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,466
[laughing]

229
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,566
It's over!

230
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,933
The airplane! It stopped!

231
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,433
Picking on young girls is
your idea of fun?

232
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,800
So it's you once again,
Tuxedo Mask.

233
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,900
Guess I'll have to send
you to hell along with
those girls.

234
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,466
You'll pay for the
crimes of using innocent
people to carry out your
evil deeds.

235
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,666
Tuxedo Mask!

236
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,866
You're through!

237
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,400
Ahhh!

238
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,866
No! Tuxedo Mask!

239
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,733
[gasping]

240
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,833
Oh, no!

241
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,866
[chuckling]

242
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,633
It's Jadeite. He's
still alive!

243
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,700
So then- What happened to
Tuxedo Mask?!

244
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,666
[laughing]

245
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,600
Your last hope, Tuxedo
Mask, is now dead! Go on
and cry!

246
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:41,833
Do you need a man to do
everything for you?!
Women are such shallow,
useless creatures!

247
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,733
[laughing]

248
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:48,233
Only old-fashioned idiots
like you still believe in
nonsense like that! Those
days are long gone!

249
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:51,833
You got that right!
Denigrating women is a
relic of the feudal age!

250
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,833
Down with discrimination!

251
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,566
All right! Let's show
that jerk what girls are
made of!

252
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:01,533
You foolish girls! Just
witness my power!

253
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,666
Oh, great! Not again!

254
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,800
Come on! This way!

255
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:12,500
[panting]

256
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,400
Don't get distracted by
that airplane!

257
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:18,333
The real enemy is
Jadeite! He's the one
that you have to take down!

258
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,766
Luna's right! We have to
focus!

259
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,433
Let's all combine our
powers!

260
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,400
Yeah, and kick
Jadeite's butt!

261
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,433
Then since we're all in
agreement, you run and be
the decoy!

262
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,533
What?! Why me?!

263
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,433
Bubble!

264
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:35,866
...Spray!

265
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,200
[screaming]

266
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,266
This isn't fair, you
guys!

267
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,966
Where have those other
two gone...?

268
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,333
Right here!

269
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,966
I'll finish you!

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,266
[grunting]

271
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,533
[laughing]

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Rin pyo to sha kai jin
retsu zai zen!

273
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,333
You can't escape!

274
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,633
Now die!

275
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,266
What's happening?!

276
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,333
Why are they coming
toward me?!

277
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,500
Don't underestimate what
girls can do!

278
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,733
We don't just stand
around and cry when we're
faced with serious problems.

279
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:38,800
I don't understand it!
Why aren't my mental
powers working?

280
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,233
Because your evil
will never control us!

281
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:44,833
You're falling victim to
your own trap! We'll never
be fooled by you!

282
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,800
Now you're gonna pay for
your countless evil
deeds!

283
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,733
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

284
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,666
Moon Tiara Action!

285
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:13,700
[grunting]

286
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,800
Huh?!

287
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,766
[screaming]

288
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,766
Queen Beryl...

289
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:38,233
Pathetic fool! You had
the nerve to run back
here to me?!

290
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:42,233
Queen Beryl, I've
discovered the true
identity of the Sailor
Guardians!

291
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:49,433
Enough talk and
excuses! You're a
disgrace! Now sleep for
all eternity!

292
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,633
No! Please, Queen
Beryl...!

293
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,300
[screaming]

294
00:20:56,966 --> 00:21:02,933
[whispering]

295
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:07,566
Mark my words...
Useless failures must be
disposed of!

296
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,633
Nephrite, you'll carry
out my next plan!

297
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:21,733
Jadeite was incompetent.
But you can count on me.
[chuckling]

298
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,633
My poor Tuxedo Mask...!

299
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:32,600
[whimpering]

300
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:36,866
Girls, we can't stay
here forever. It's sad,
but we have to accept it.

301
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,766
No way! I won't!

302
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
<i>Thanks for your concern.</i>

303
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:41,900
[gasping]

304
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,900
Tuxedo Mask! It's really
you! You're still alive!

305
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,766
You can't get rid of me
that easily!

306
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm glad! But Tuxedo
Mask, tell me something: why
do you always risk your life
to come and save us?

307
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:02,900
I bet that I know! It's
because you love me!
That's why, isn't that
right?

308
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,766
Tell us who you
really are!

309
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,766
I'm afraid I can't reveal
my true identity yet.

310
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,966
But listen: Sailor Moon,
Sailor Mercury, and
Sailor Mars...

311
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,400
Cherish the bond that
exists between the three
of you. Farewell.

312
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:19,800
[swooning]

313
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,266
Luna, let's play tennis!

314
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,733
<i>Why the sudden interest</i>
<i>in that?!</i>

315
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:18,366
There's this tennis
coach named Masato
Sanjoin, and he's like
super hot!

316
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,833
<i>Careful, Usagi. I'm</i>
<i>sensing something evil!</i>

317
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:24,433
He's tall with long,
luxurious hair. He's so
handsome!

318
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:27,733
<i>This aura is much</i>
<i>stronger and more evil</i>
<i>than Jadeite's!</i>

319
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:33,566
Next time on Sailor Moon,
"A New Enemy Appears:
Nephrite's Evil
Crest"

320
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,866
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
