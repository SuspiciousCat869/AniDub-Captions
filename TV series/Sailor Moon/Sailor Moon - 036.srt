1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,500
You offer free haircuts
to girls who have little
money, but want to look
great. But you don't

2
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:07,933
care about their feelings
when you tamper with their
hair! You devious monsters
are unforgivable!

3
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:11,400
You agree with me,
don't you, Tuxedo
Mask?

4
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:16,300
I am Sailor Moon!
And in the name of
the moon, I'll punish
you!

5
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Endymion!

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,366
(gasp)

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Endymion!

8
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
No more...

9
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,633
I don't want to be a
Moon Princess anymore.

10
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,000
Constantly fighting
the Dark Kingdom
and monsters.

11
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,500
I just don't want
to do that. I want
to be a normal girl.

12
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:10,233
Don't say that Usagi.
You can never forget
that you made a promise.

13
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,966
It looks like her trauma
was more serious than I
thought. Now I'm getting
really worried.

14
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,233
(gasp)

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,300
Usagi, Usagi, wake up,
you're crushing me!

16
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,333
I'm so worried about
you. Where are you
right now?

17
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:30,566
Please be safe.
Tuxedo Mask.

18
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,700
Usagi...

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,200
<i>"Usagi's Confusion:</i>
<i>Is Tuxedo Mask Evil?"</i>

20
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:57,900
Check it out, Usagi!
This ad says a new hair
salon just opened up
in the Juban district!

21
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:03,300
It happens to be owned
by Kariko Tokoyama,
last month's World Hair
Design Contest winner.

22
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,733
But here's the best
part! Hold on to your
seat. Are you ready?

23
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:11,233
She's having a grand
opening and offering
free haircuts to
everybody who attends.

24
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,733
Isn't that great?!
We all have to go!

25
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,900
Yeah, sure...

26
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,866
(awkward sighs)

27
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,833
What's the matter?
You seem like your
really depressed.

28
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,766
Yeah, sure...

29
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,866
Usagi hasn't been
sleeping well. Just
when I think she's
finally dozed off,

30
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,866
she starts talking
in her sleep, and
having nightmares
about Tuxedo Mask!

31
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Oh, my...

32
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:43,733
Do we know what happened
to Tuxedo Mask after he
was abducted by the enemy?

33
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,900
We don't. We only
know he's still
missing.

34
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,266
Usagi is so worried
about him that she
she can't think of
anything else!

35
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
<i>It's painful seeing</i>
<i>her like that.</i>

36
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,800
That's a real problem.
We need Usagi to get
serious about being the

37
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,900
Princess before
something bad
happens!

38
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,233
But, you really
can't blame her.

39
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:11,566
The one she loves has
been taken away and we
haven't heard a word
about him since then.

40
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,566
I totally understand
what pain she must
be going through.

41
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,800
It's highly unusual
to see you sympathizing
like this with Usagi.

42
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:28,900
Usagi, you crybaby!
Mamoru got hurt trying
to protect you! This is
how you pay him back?!

43
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:31,166
Oh, sorry.

44
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,733
As hard as it might
be, now is not the
time for Usagi to
be flakey.

45
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:40,100
Right! I agree that
in order to crush
the Dark Kingdom's
ambitions...

46
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:45,433
...we have to get her
back on track as a full-
fledged Princess, and we
have to do it soon! She

47
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,766
needs to use the
Silver Crystal!

48
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,733
There must be
something that we
can come up with
that will help her.

49
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,333
Crying doesn't suit
you, Bun-head.

50
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:19,066
You're just
being mean.

51
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:24,166
Is he mean? Or is
my hair style really
that weird?

52
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:29,133
This ad says a new
hair salon just
opened up in the
Juban District!

53
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:32,600
Oh, I see you're
looking at that ad
for the new hair
salon.

54
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,100
Minako?!

55
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,233
Hi Usagi! Sorry, I
called but there was
no answer, so I just
came over.

56
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:45,366
Hey, I just had a
thought. Why not try a
new hair style? It might
make you feel better.

57
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,300
Yeah?

58
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,600
Something like a
sophisticated and
sleek bob-cut.

59
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:05,333
Maybe a wavy style
that's bold and
bouncy.

60
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,766
Or how about long and
straight for a classic
and chic look?

61
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:15,400
Sometimes changing
your hairstyle is just
the kind of thing a
girl needs to pick up

62
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,633
<i>her spirits.</i>

63
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,100
Yeah...

64
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,466
<i>Maybe I'll give</i>
<i>it a try...</i>

65
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,066
Kunzite...

66
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,266
<i>Queen Beryl...</i>

67
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:48,266
We must secure the
Legendary Silver
Crystal from Sailor
Moon no matter what

68
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,066
it takes.

69
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,266
Yes, my queen.

70
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:54,433
I assume you've
discovered Sailor
Moon's identity
by now?

71
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,500
Please, give me
a bit more time.

72
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,433
Be very quick
about it.

73
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:02,633
Uncover Sailor Moon's
identity as soon as
possible, so that we

74
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,933
can retrieve the
Silver Crystal.

75
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:10,233
Leave it to me. My
new plan is ready to
be put into action.

76
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,533
Oh?

77
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:23,333
This is a strand of
hair from Sailor Moon,
which I obtained in
battle. I intend to

78
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:28,366
find the girl who has
matching strands of
hair. Then I will have
uncovered Sailor Moon's

79
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,933
true identity!

80
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:33,166
Very well. Proceed
with caution.

81
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,166
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

82
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,333
Welcome...

83
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:53,666
Thanks for coming to
Hair Salon Kariko.
How may I help you?

84
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,366
I'd like you to take
a look at her hair
and see what new style
would look best on her.

85
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,300
Why of course.

86
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:04,266
Oh! What beautiful
hair. Come this way.

87
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,400
O-Okay...

88
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:12,433
Let me know if I
pull you hair or
massage your scalp
too hard.

89
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,333
Okay...

90
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:21,033
I sure hope this
works to cheer her
up, so she can be
her old self again.

91
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,933
Please stay still
for a moment.

92
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:59,933
She's not Sailor Moon.
So far none of these
girls have hair that
matches up.

93
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,333
<i>Thank you for</i>
<i>waiting.</i>

94
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,200
Huh?

95
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,866
Please, follow me to
the hair steamer.

96
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,566
Ah. I'm not here to
have my hair done. I
just came with a friend.

97
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,866
While you're waiting,
you really should try
our revolutionary
hair steamer.

98
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,366
We use a special steam
that instantly repairs
split ends and sun damage,
which sometimes you're

99
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,866
not even aware you
have!

100
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,833
(impressed laugh)

101
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:25,166
Sounds pretty good,
and after all it
is free!

102
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,466
<i>Just sit still</i>
<i>for a bit.</i>

103
00:10:58,966 --> 00:10:59,766
(gasp)

104
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:08,800
Yes, I've found
you, Sailor Moon.

105
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,266
Could you massage a
little more on the
right, please?

106
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,733
(evil chuckle)

107
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:19,133
Finally! I've
discovered Sailor
Moon's true identity!

108
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,766
(evil chuckle)

109
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

111
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:53,131
Uhh, Miss Kariko, are
you finished with my
shampoo yet?

112
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:56,964
<i>I know who you are.</i>
<i>You're Sailor Moon!</i>

113
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:58,331
No!

114
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,231
Stop!

115
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:00,064
<i>What?!</i>

116
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:01,464
<i>Minako!</i>

117
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,398
(dazed sighs)

118
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,531
<i>You idiot!</i>

119
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,431
Don't you dare
sleep yet!

120
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,131
C'mon! Hand over
the Silver Crystal!

121
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:21,464
What? What are
you talking about?

122
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,764
<i>Don't play dumb!</i>

123
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:26,431
My computer says your
hair is an exact match
to Sailor Moon's so

124
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:29,098
don't you dare
tell me otherwise!

125
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:30,131
My hair?

126
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:38,898
I must've gotten
some of Usagi's hair
tangled in mine when
I was brushing it!

127
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:39,864
(forceful grunt)

128
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,531
I want that Silver
Crystal and I want
it right now!

129
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:48,131
If you still refuse,
I have ways to make
you change your mind.

130
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:49,198
(scared sigh)

131
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,164
(evil chuckle)

132
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,498
(evil laugh)

133
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:08,331
She's a monster?!

134
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:13,098
This is horrible. The
Dark Kingdom turned
Miss Kariko into a
monster just so they

135
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:16,531
could get to me!
Hold on, Minako.
Don't worry, I'm
gonna save you!

136
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:20,564
Moon Prism Power!
Make up!

137
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:01,531
(evil chuckle)

138
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:02,931
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

139
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:03,431
Huh?

140
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:07,864
<i>That girl isn't</i>
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

141
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,564
That's impossible!

142
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,331
You offer free
haircuts to girls
who have little money.

143
00:14:12,364 --> 00:14:15,831
But you don't care
about their feelings
when you mess with
their hearts!

144
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:18,164
I, Sailor Moon,
will not forgive...

145
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,098
...such devious
monsters!

146
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:25,131
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish
you.

147
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:32,364
Ha! So you walked
in here on your own.
Just like a slug
jumping into salt.

148
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,298
A slug dissolves
in salt!

149
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:39,131
I am Mitsuaami and
I shall melt you...

150
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,298
...into goo!

151
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,298
Ahhh!

152
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:45,031
I have to help her...

153
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:48,431
Let me dry your
hair. It looks
wet.

154
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:50,098
(attacking yell)

155
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:55,231
Ahhhhh!

156
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:58,031
Now it's time to
shave off all
that hair!

157
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,198
(scared gasp)

158
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:05,364
(crazy laughter)

159
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,198
No-no-no-no-no
no-no-no-no-no!
Ahh!

160
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,098
(choking cough)

161
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,231
Curse you!

162
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,831
All right Mitsuaami!
It's time to end this!

163
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:30,898
I'm going to use this Moon
Stick to turn you back
into Miss Kariko Tokoyama,
the hair designer!

164
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,131
Moon Healing...

165
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,064
(painful gasp)

166
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:40,231
(gasp)

167
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,864
A rose...

168
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,398
Could it be?

169
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:49,064
Am I imagining it?

170
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:01,298
That you?
Tuxedo Mask?

171
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,231
It really is you!

172
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,398
Thank goodness!

173
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,898
You're mistaken,
I'm not Tuxedo Mask.

174
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,298
What?!

175
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:19,398
<i>I am the commander</i>
<i>of the Dark Kingdom.</i>

176
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:22,098
I am Endymion.

177
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:25,131
You-You can't be!

178
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:28,731
Sailor Moon, hand
over the Silver
Crystal.

179
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,731
What did they
do to you?

180
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:38,198
(forceful grunts)

181
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,931
The trimmer's powered
up and ready to go!

182
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:43,631
(scared gasp)

183
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,764
Ahhhh!

184
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:50,198
Mitsuaami! Retrieve
the Silver Crystal!

185
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,331
Yes, sir!

186
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,998
Oh no! It
can't be!

187
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:58,731
I'm going to give you
such a good trim, you'll
never need to come back
for more!

188
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,031
No thanks!

189
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:08,331
I need to let all
the Guardians know
right away!

190
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:11,264
Tuxedo Mask has
become an enemy!

191
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:18,664
Venus Power!
Make up!

192
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,098
(angry growl)

193
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,764
(scared scream)

194
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:40,931
(attack yell)

195
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:42,031
(scared whimper)

196
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:46,698
Stop moving! I still
want to give you your
cut!

197
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,298
Ahh!

198
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:51,298
Huh?

199
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,131
You need to be more
careful! You could
take somebody's head
off with that thing!

200
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:57,598
Stop wasting
time, Mitsuaami!

201
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,731
Get that Silver
Crystal!

202
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:01,064
No way...

203
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:04,298
(attack scream)

204
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:05,998
Ahhh!

205
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:11,164
(evil chuckle)

206
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:14,764
Time for that
trim, my dear!

207
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:15,998
<i>Stop right there!</i>

208
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,131
Huh?

209
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,564
All right!

210
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,798
Fire!

211
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:29,131
Supreme!

212
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:31,731
Soul!

213
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,798
Thunder!

214
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,598
(painful yell)

215
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:42,664
Bubble!

216
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:49,031
Spray!

217
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:54,898
Now! Sailor Moon!

218
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:08,731
Moon Healing!
Escalation!

219
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:13,964
Shampoo!
Rinse!
Refresh!

220
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:16,864
Refresh!

221
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:23,898
<i>Tuxedo Mask!</i>

222
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,664
I'm so glad you're
back safe and sound.

223
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,031
Mamoru...

224
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:30,498
<i>Sailor Mars...</i>

225
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:34,764
That guy is not the
Tuxedo Mask you used
to know, believe me!

226
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,031
He's now one of the
commanders of the
Dark Kingdom! He's
Endymion!

227
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:39,964
(gasp)

228
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:41,498
N-No!

229
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:46,698
She's kidding, right?
Tuxedo Mask, please
tell me what she
said is not true!

230
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:53,131
Roses have many thorns.
And you should know
that even red roses turn
black when they wilt.

231
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:56,164
What are you saying?

232
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,931
Are you really
planning to fight
all five of us?

233
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,598
Hurting young women
has never been my
style, but to get
the crystal, I'm

234
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,564
prepared to do
what's needed.

235
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:06,064
(gasp)

236
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:13,464
Endymion, retreat
for now.

237
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:14,131
Hm?

238
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,598
This is a direct
order from Queen
Metalia!

239
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:24,698
Sailor Guardians,
your death at my
hands has been
postponed.

240
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:25,531
Huh?!

241
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,831
A woman's friendship
is quite fragile.

242
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:32,631
<i>Even a slight breeze</i>
<i>can make it fall</i>
<i>apart, like a flower</i>
<i>in the wind.</i>

243
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,798
Be careful of that.

244
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:36,564
(gasp)

245
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:37,531
Farewell!

246
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,898
Queen Metalia, why
have you called me
back?

247
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:05,764
Endymion. I
cannot let you
die.

248
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,031
Huh?

249
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:14,598
It appears that Endymion
has become a warrior of
the Dark Kingdom, both
in body and soul.

250
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:18,098
Yes, the brainwashing
was extremely effective.

251
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:18,831
(laughing)

252
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:24,698
Now that Endymion has
proven himself to be
dedicated to us, we
must think of ways

253
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:26,964
to make good use
of his loyalty.

254
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:30,331
(evil laugh)

255
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:38,531
Hm?

256
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,531
Miss Kariko was turned
into a monster because
of me. If we don't stop
the Dark Kingdom, more

257
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:46,931
innocent people like
her will suffer. I
won't let that happen.

258
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:51,064
Hey! Sounds like she's
accepting her Princess
responsibilities.

259
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:57,598
Yay! Tuxedo Mask is
safe! All is right
in my world!

260
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:58,931
(cheerful giggling)

261
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:03,831
I don't know Artemis,
she sounds pretty
much the same to me.

262
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,831
Well, I think she's
putting on a brave
front by making light
of everything.

263
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:11,431
At the very least,
she's showing that
she's grown up and
is moving on.

264
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,864
You should, too.

265
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,998
You can't let it
bother you forever.

266
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,931
Mm. You're right.

267
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:19,398
(determined grunt)

268
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,364
I'm sure that Tuxedo
Mask was tricked by
the bad guys into
believing he was one

269
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:26,464
of them and they've
got him in their
clutches! And now
it's up to me to

270
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:30,264
turn him back to
normal with my
overwhelming power
of love!

271
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:15,450
Well, it's official!
I have signed up and
entered the Princess
Training Program!

272
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:19,217
<i>You don't look very</i>
<i>good, Usagi. Did you</i>
<i>get food poisoning</i>
<i>or something?</i>

273
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,150
I have learned to
become an elegant
and proper lady.

274
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,917
<i>I don't think you're</i>
<i>quite there yet!</i>

275
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,784
Now I'll be able to
share a dance with
Tuxedo Mask at the
ball!

276
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:28,084
<i>Oh, boy.</i>
<i>Good luck!</i>

277
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:34,117
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Let's Become a Princess:</i>
<i>Usagi's Bizarre Training."</i>

278
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,950
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
