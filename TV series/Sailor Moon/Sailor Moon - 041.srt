1
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:02,300
What?! They're trying
to bring back the Seven
Great Monsters, after
all the trouble we went

2
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:06,166
through to turn them
back into humans? If
they want to recycle
something, then try

3
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,100
recycling cans! They
can't recycle people!
It's absolutely
unforgivable!

4
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,633
I am Sailor Moon!

5
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,966
And in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you!

6
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,166
(tired sigh)

7
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:42,866
Huh?

8
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,466
Who's there?

9
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,400
(evil chuckle)

10
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,533
I've been looking for
you, Miss Nishimura.

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,266
But, maybe you'd prefer
I call you Rikokeida,
which is your true
given name as one of

12
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,200
the Seven Great
Monsters.

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,266
What are you
talking about?

14
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,433
Come on! Do not
resist. Join us
once again.

15
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:14,333
(painful grunts)

16
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,900
Four down, three
more to go...

17
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:45,900
<i>"I Won't Run Away From</i>
<i>Love Anymore: Ami</i>
<i>Versus Mamoru."</i>

18
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,300
Hello. This is Ami.

19
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,433
<i>Hey Ami, it's</i>
<i>me. Ryo Urawa.</i>

20
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:02,433
Oh! Hi, Ryo. It's
good to hear from
you!

21
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,533
<i>Ami, are you</i>
<i>anywhere near</i>
<i>a TV?</i>

22
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:07,166
Yep. I've got one
right in front of me.

23
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,166
<i>You need to turn</i>
<i>it on. Right now!</i>

24
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
(gasp)

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,866
The woman that you're
looking at is Miss
Yumemi Yumeno. She's
the fifth of former

26
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,200
Seven Great Monsters
to go missing.

27
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
<i>W-What are you</i>
<i>saying, Ryo?</i>

28
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:27,133
I'm saying the next
target could be me...

29
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:32,166
...or your friend Rei's
grandfather. You have
to believe me. I used
my precognitive powers

30
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,600
<i>to figure it out.</i>

31
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:37,100
Where are you? If
you're here in town,
I can come protect
you right now.

32
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:40,400
<i>No! You need to stay</i>
<i>away from me so you</i>
<i>won't be in danger.</i>

33
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,300
You should go
and protect Rei's
grandfather instead.

34
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,333
Don't worry, I can
handle things on
my own.

35
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:52,966
You must stop the Dark
Kingdom's plans at all
costs, or terrible
things will happen. Go!

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Ryo?! Ryo!

37
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,266
It's better this way.

38
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:08,366
I wish I had Ami and
the others help. But I
can't become dependent
on them again, I need

39
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,966
to be able to take
care of myself.

40
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,766
Hold on. Wasn't that?

41
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,733
This is Makoto.

42
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,366
Mako, something's
come up! Meet us at
the Hikawa Shrine
right away!

43
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,100
Got it. Mm-hmm

44
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,033
Queen Beryl, I'm curious
about what Endymion is
doing. Why is he trying
to retransform the

45
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,700
humans into the Seven
Great Monsters right now.

46
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,233
(evil chuckle)

47
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,133
Well, as you know,
each one of them was
purified by the Moon
Stick and returned

48
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,633
to human form.

49
00:05:56,233 --> 00:06:00,200
However, by using our
Dark Energy and the
power of the Dark
Crystal, we can turn

50
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,133
them back into
monsters again.

51
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,966
But why go through all
that trouble? They were
defeated by the Sailor
Guardians, which makes

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,766
them useless.

53
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Ha! Well, here's
what you don't know.

54
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:22,200
Once the seven are
together, they will
combine as one to
become the largest

55
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:25,933
and most powerful
monster ever to
be seen.

56
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,600
Ahhhh!

57
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,600
Ahhhh!

58
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,733
Ahhh!

59
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:39,000
And when that happens,
we will finally be able
to put an end to the
Sailor Guardians, once

60
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,766
and for all!

61
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,966
Something I've been
striving to do. So why
would you assign this
important task to

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,233
Endymion and
not to me?!

63
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:50,766
Are you questioning
my decision, Kunzite?
Is there a problem?

64
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,100
No, Ma'am, no
problem, but...

65
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:57,933
Then hold off on
your judgment and
let's watch and see
how Endymion does.

66
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,900
Hmph. Fine.

67
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,733
So tell me, Ami. Is
your friend Ryo's
precognitive power
really accurate?

68
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,166
Yes, it's extremely
accurate.

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Hey. You'd better
believe that if the
Dark Kingdom is
rounding up the

70
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:23,000
Seven Great Monsters,
that can only mean one
thing. They're planning
something awful.

71
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay, Ami, let's
go. Come on.

72
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,833
Huh? Where are
we going?

73
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:31,600
I thought it was
obvious! We have to
go look for Ryo and
give him protection!

74
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:35,566
But we don't even know
if he's in town or where
to begin to look for him.

75
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,566
I saw him. I know he's
in the neighborhood. We
just have to walk around.
We'll run into him.

76
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,066
You guys better keep an
eye on Rei's Grandpa.

77
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,766
Wahhhh!

78
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,733
What is it? What's
the matter, Usagi?

79
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,233
I feel so sorry
for the hero of
this manga!

80
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:55,800
Hey! You should ask
permission before
you read my manga!

81
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,533
What's the big
deal? You weren't
reading it.

82
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,766
And now I can't
because you're
crying all over
it!

83
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,300
They're at it again.

84
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,800
And this won't be
the last time either.

85
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,033
(disappointed sighs)

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,166
I'm close. He must
be somewhere right
around here.

87
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,800
Ryo Urawa, I presume?

88
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:28,233
And you're Endymion
from the Dark Kingdom?

89
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:34,166
I see your precognitive
skills prepared you for
my arrival. That's very
impressive, Mr. Urawa.

90
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,733
So you know what's
next. What your
immediate future
holds for you?

91
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:43,200
I do. I've been there
before. You plan on
drawing me into the
Dark Crystal.

92
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:48,533
That's very good. Now
don't resist. Come with
me and we'll get this
over quickly.

93
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:53,500
Sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't accommodate you.
You see, someone once
told me that my future

94
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,766
is something that I
create for myself.

95
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,033
So what does
that mean?

96
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,200
It means, I'm not
going to give up!

97
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,533
(painful grunt)

98
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,666
Murderer!
Help me!

99
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,666
<i>Back off!</i>

100
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,933
No! It's not true!

101
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,566
<i>Get out of here!</i>

102
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,833
Let's go back. I
feel sorry for Ryo,
but there's not much
we can do for him at

103
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,766
this point. It's
probably too late.

104
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,000
You just feel sorry
for him? I always
thought Ryo was your
boyfriend, Ami.

105
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:34,766
No way, he's not
my boyfriend. He's
just a friend of mine.

106
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,633
Eh-uhh, are you really
sure about that Ami,
that you're not just
in denial?

107
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,966
<i>Well, uh...</i>

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Ami, I hope you
haven't forgotten
that Ryo is in love
with you!

109
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,700
Yeah, I know that.
But we have an
important mission
that takes priority

110
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:52,533
over everything
else. I can't allow
myself to return
his feelings.

111
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,866
That'll leave you
with nothing! Only
regret for the rest
of your life!

112
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,133
Even Sailor Guardians
are entitled to fall
in love.

113
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,400
Or at least go on a
date with a boy they
really care about.

114
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:07,633
You're just
running away,
Ami!

115
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,800
That's why you want
to go back now. It's
another excuse to keep
yourself from getting

116
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,800
attached to him.
You're afraid to
fall in love.

117
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:18,166
Admit it, you're just
not being honest with
yourself.

118
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
Th-that's not true.

119
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,033
(gasp)

120
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,566
There he is!

121
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,433
Listen, I completely
understand why you'd
hesitate to get
involved. It can be

122
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,933
difficult. A-Ami,
where are you going?

123
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,566
Hey, come back!
I wasn't finished!

124
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,466
I just saw him!

125
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,866
What? You saw Ryo?

126
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,700
Yeah...

127
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,533
Let's go!

128
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,466
Ami...

129
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,733
I-I mean Sailor
Mercury!

130
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,600
How's it going?
You all right?

131
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't worry, we're
here. So you'll be
safe now.

132
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,600
(amused laugh)

133
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:03,866
Oh, how reassuring
to know that.

134
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,666
(determined grunt)

135
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,566
Huh? Mamoru?!

136
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:15,366
Mamoru? Recently
someone else also
called me by that
name...

137
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,466
...But all of you
are wrong!

138
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,066
My name is Endymion!

139
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,600
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

140
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,494
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

141
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:04,361
Sailor Mercury, take
Ryo away from here.
I'll handle this.

142
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,894
No, I'm fighting
with you!

143
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:10,427
What are you talking
about? Right now
protecting Ryo is
our top priority!

144
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,261
But...

145
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,727
Go, now!

146
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,627
Okay!

147
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:15,194
<i>This way, Ryo!</i>

148
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:20,594
Mamoru. No.
Endymion!

149
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:24,427
I really don't want
to have to fight you.

150
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,394
But since I must,
I won't hold back.
I promise you!

151
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:33,361
That's fine by me.
But are you sure you
can handle me all by
yourself?

152
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,561
I'll give it
everything I've
got!

153
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:39,727
Supreme!

154
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:46,627
Thunder!

155
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,394
Hah! I'm so scared!

156
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:56,527
This is Sailor Mercury!
Ryo is safe! He's with
me right now!

157
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,594
Good work,
Sailor Mercury!

158
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:04,694
But right now Sailor
Jupiter is fighting
Mamoru alone to buy us
some time to get away!

159
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:05,994
Did she say Mamoru?

160
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:09,627
Will Sailor Jupiter
be all right fighting
him by herself?

161
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:12,527
Not sure, but we
need Sailor Moon
right away!

162
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:17,061
The Moon Stick might
be our only hope to
return Mamoru to
the way he was!

163
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,494
Get up, Usagi!

164
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:22,961
Uhh, all right.
Let's go! C'mon,
Luna.

165
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:27,661
Uhh, point me in the
right direction, 'cause
I don't know where I'm
going.

166
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:31,261
(fighting grunts)

167
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:37,627
What's the matter?
Have you worn yourself
out already?

168
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,294
I'm not done
quite yet!

169
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:44,127
I admire your fighting
spirit. But I don't
have time to play games
with you all day.

170
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:47,094
Let me show you
what a real attack
should look like.

171
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,061
(fighting grunts)

172
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:02,594
Ahhh! Yahh!

173
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:03,661
(terrified scream)

174
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:09,961
Hah-ha.

175
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:18,961
Just as I thought.
You're way out of
your league. Look me
up when you're an even

176
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,894
match. Maybe I'll
come out to play!

177
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,994
Damn you!

178
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:29,627
<i>Sailor Mercury...</i>

179
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,227
Huh?

180
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,994
Do me a favor.
Look!

181
00:14:32,994 --> 00:14:34,994
C'mon! Run this way!

182
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:39,061
I'm freezing and I
don't think this
cold is good for
my complexion!

183
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:43,027
You've gotta run
faster! That'll make
your complexion nice
and rosy!

184
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,994
Oh, yeah, that's
easy for you to
say!

185
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,094
Ahhh!

186
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:49,194
Wahh! That hurt!

187
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:51,094
What happened,
Usagi!

188
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:54,561
Sailor Jupiter,
you're all right!
Thank goodness, we
got here in time.

189
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:59,527
But you didn't. Luna,
by any chance did
Endymion pass this
way?

190
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:01,161
I don't think so.

191
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:03,827
Damn it!
Where'd he go?

192
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:19,527
Ryo, what's up?
Why did you wanna
come in here?

193
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,527
Sorry, it's just I've
always dreamed about
going to an amusement
park with you.

194
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,161
<i>That's really sweet.</i>

195
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:33,561
Now I have no regrets.
My dream's been fulfilled.
But it would be best if
we split up right away.

196
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:38,461
We can't. There's no
telling when the Dark
Kingdom will be coming
after you again.

197
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:41,894
I'm prepared to give
up my life to fight
them!

198
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:45,461
I want you to be free
of me, to fulfill your
own mission!

199
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:49,894
My life is no big
loss. I wasn't human
to begin with. But if
giving my life can

200
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,294
save the world, then
I've accomplished
something.

201
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:57,461
I believe we're two
of a kind, always
running away from
something. Something

202
00:15:57,494 --> 00:15:58,927
we truly want.

203
00:15:58,961 --> 00:15:59,561
Huh?!

204
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:06,194
That's what a friend
of mine told me. She
said I was in denial
and that I should just

205
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:08,027
be more honest
with myself.

206
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:10,061
Uh... but, Ami.

207
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:16,261
Sacrificing yourself,
is certainly noble.
But be honest, wouldn't
you really rather keep

208
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:18,461
on living as a human
being instead?

209
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:24,061
Seems like you've
forgotten about the
people who will be
very sad if you die.

210
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,227
(surprised breath)

211
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,327
It's time that we
stop running away.

212
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:33,161
No matter what the
obstacle is, let's
tackle it head-on!

213
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:39,061
Those are all truly
admirable thoughts,
Sailor Mercury.

214
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:49,327
What is it that
you want.

215
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,894
Look at that!

216
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:53,894
Huh?!

217
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,861
C'mon. Let's
check it out!

218
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:56,827
<i>Right!</i>

219
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:05,927
Listen, Mamoru. I'm
not going to hesitate,
even a moment, to fight
you anymore!

220
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,327
Prepare yourself!

221
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,361
I look forward to it.

222
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,461
I was planning on
waiting until the
other Sailor Guardians
were drawn here by the

223
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:17,194
light of the ferris
wheel, but I take it
you don't need them
to fight me.

224
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:19,827
Bubble!

225
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,427
Spray!

226
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,094
(startled gasp)

227
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:36,094
Hold on. I have one
piece of business to
take care of, before
I fight you.

228
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:36,994
(grunt)

229
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:39,794
(painful grunt)

230
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:40,429
(gasp)

231
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:41,127
Oh no!

232
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,261
Ryo!

233
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:43,761
(painful grunts)

234
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:45,161
Ami!

235
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:52,261
(evil laugh)

236
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:53,761
Thanks for waiting.

237
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:57,761
You horrible monster!
How could you!

238
00:17:57,794 --> 00:18:00,427
I don't care if the
Dark Kingdom forced
you to do this!

239
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,827
I'll make you
pay for what
you've done!

240
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:07,027
Douse yourself in
water, and repent!

241
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,927
Hmph! If you're hoping
to bring your boyfriend
back here. You'll have
to destroy this, the

242
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,161
Dark Crystal.

243
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,261
But of course, that
means you'll have to
defeat me first to
get your hands on it.

244
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,827
So let's fight!

245
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:30,727
(surprised gasp)

246
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:36,327
Hah. I just want you
to know that, because
I respect you, I won't
hold back.

247
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:40,227
I know I don't
stand a chance.
But I have to try.

248
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,927
Bubble Spray!

249
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:49,327
Again? Is that
all you've got?

250
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:54,661
Why, you deceptive brat!

251
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:59,594
No more deceptive
than you! Now I have
a mission I need to
get done first, as well!

252
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:03,927
(angry growl)

253
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:11,661
(delighted sigh)

254
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,227
You're all right!

255
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:17,394
Yeah, and you Sailor
Mercury, look much
more confident than
you did earlier.

256
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:21,061
Thanks. I really
owe it all to you,
Sailor Jupiter.

257
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:25,627
Hey! Looks like you
single-handedly
crushed the Dark
Kingdom's plan!

258
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:31,194
Sailor Moon. Listen.
Right now you've got
to turn Tuxedo Mask
back to normal!

259
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:34,094
Not if I get rid
of the three of
you first!

260
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:37,694
<i>From now on...</i>

261
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:42,194
When you're in the
mood to recycle, only
recycle cans! Don't
try to recycle people

262
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:45,027
who are living peaceful
lives. It's unforgivable!

263
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:48,027
In the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

264
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:51,294
Supreme!

265
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:57,894
Thunder!

266
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,694
Bubble!

267
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,927
Spray!

268
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:08,894
(painful screaming)

269
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,261
Now, Sailor Moon!
You've gotta be
quick!

270
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,061
Jeez, I know that!

271
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:26,127
Moon Healing
Escalation!

272
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,194
No!

273
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:42,827
(painful grunts)

274
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:45,627
It looks like it's
working to a degree,
but he needs more.

275
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,594
Increase the energy,
Sailor Moon.

276
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:49,261
(forceful grunts)

277
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:51,727
(painful groans)

278
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,827
Refresh!

279
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,027
You did it! You
brought the real
Mamoru back!

280
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,594
Thank goodness!

281
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:05,494
(exhausted sighs)

282
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,194
Great job,
Sailor Moon!

283
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:11,027
Huh?!

284
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:17,894
He vanished!

285
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,461
But how?

286
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,161
It must be the
work of the Dark
Kingdom.

287
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,827
Oh no!

288
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:33,527
As I feared, Endymion
hadn't lost his past
memories, after all we
had done to ensure it.

289
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:37,927
So there's more work
to do. We need to
infuse him with the
energy of our Great

290
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:43,961
Ruler. And this time
we'll turn him into
a loyal servant of the
Dark Kingdom forever!

291
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:51,794
(people chatter)

292
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,161
Let's come here
again, all right?

293
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:57,861
(gasp)

294
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:59,161
Sure!

295
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,094
(giggle)

296
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,427
We can't let
this happen!

297
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,761
If Ami's side-tracked
from her important
mission because of her
interest in this new

298
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,027
relationship,
who's gonna keep
us together?

299
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,727
Isn't that supposed
to be your job, Usagi?

300
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:12,861
Uh...

301
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:15,761
I think you're
jealous of those
two. Isn't that
right?

302
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:17,727
You're jealous, too!

303
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:23,561
Oh, come on guys,
just cool it. Let's
be happy for them
and let them be!

304
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,750
Minako's crush is a
handsome boy from
England!

305
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:17,283
Nice, very nice!

306
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:18,883
<i>Hey, don't forget!</i>
<i>You have Mamoru!</i>

307
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,116
Yep! That's right!
There was this one
time when, underneath
the gentle moonlight,

308
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,750
Mamoru and I
shared a...

309
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:25,650
(giggle)

310
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:26,750
<i>What did you</i>
<i>share exactly?</i>

311
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:29,216
I'm too embarrassed
to say it!

312
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:35,150
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Sailor Venus's Past:</i>
<i>Minako's Tragic Love."</i>

313
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,516
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
