Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino
and I'm fourteen-year-
old middle school
student!

8
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm a bit of a
klutz...

9
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:29,300
...and some people
might say I'm a
little emotional.

10
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,733
So one day, this
strange cat named Luna
gave me a special
brooch that transformed

11
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:38,233
me into a guardian
in a sailor uniform
and told me I had to
fight bad guys!

12
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,600
Boy, does that ever
make me nervous!

But I'm sure it'll
all work out fine!

But what are we
supposed to do now?

33

As I've said, you

read, strange things
have been happening
down there lately.

What kind of things?

Yes?

59
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:54,033
I'm not going to
give you many more
chances to redeem
yourself, you know.

60
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:58,066
I've already begun
a new plan to collect
a large amount of

<i>(Queen Beryl)</i>
<i>Really?</i>

62

sailor guardians won't
be a problem once I

63
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,466
(cont'd)
eliminate them.

Maybe, but still,
fifty of your visitors
have gone missing

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,566
so far!
Surely that's not
a coincidence!

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,966
(Jadeite)
We have looked into
it. And the number
of people who've

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
(cont'd)
entered the park is
the same as the number
who've left.

73
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,466
(cont'd)
So, they haven't
gone missing here.

enough! You're
disrupting our business!

they going missing

Hmm..

84
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:18,633

that everyone who's
gone missing has
come to this park.

Yeah, that's weird.

Hey, Usagi's
gone. Where did
she go?

suspicious of
Princess Dream?

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,433
Yeah, and my
intuition is
usually right.

144
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,300
But, I mean her
name is Princess
Dream, so..

145
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,433
You just don't
get it, Usagi.

146

Ah, look!
Isn't this the
cutest little bunny!

147
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,433
And I can bet that
thing's smarter
than you are...

148
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,200
Why are you
always so mean?!

Oh, no!

No! Don't get
on those animals!

151
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:57,966
Why not? They're
just machines.
They're perfectly
safe.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,733
Just get him
down!

153
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,066
Hm?
Very well.

154
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,733
You can come
back and ride
them later.

155
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,133
Well, I say
we should just
ride it now!

Hey!!

157

You don't
understand this
at all, do you?!

159
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,366
You're way too
suspicious about
everything! Stop
being such a drag!

160
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:26,000
No way!!

161

Yes way!!

You know, this

embarrassing.

170

What, are you
kidding me?!
This is the best
way to patrol, ever!

171

(Panda)
Sorry! I just
got the signal
to stop.

172
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,766
Hold tight,
we'll have to
wait a moment.

173

Pretty rude,

178

Ha! Bun-head?!
That's classic!
And it fits you
perfectly!

179

<i>Tuxedo Mask!</i>

291
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,900
Hold on a second!

292
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,233
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>It's a trap!</i>

293
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,700
Come on!

294
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,166
(Giggling)

295
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
Are you listening?!

296
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,733
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>this is just what</i>
<i>the enemy wants you</i>
<i>to do!</i>

297
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:08,766
Yes, it is what I
want. And now I'm going
to take all their energy
while they dream.

298
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:15,666
Huh?

299
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,633
(Giggling)
(Usagi)
Wait for me..
Uh..

300
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>Stick to dreaming</i>
<i>only when you're</i>
<i>asleep. Farewell!</i>

301
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,300
Huh? Where's
Tuxedo Mask?

302
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,700
Oh, boy...

303
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:36,800
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>That rose! Then</i>
<i>Tuxedo Mask really</i>
<i>was here!</i>

304
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:41,333
I guess I'll have
to put you back in
the dream world
again...

305
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,300
I think we'd
better run for
it!

306
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:53,266
Oh boy, I guess
I shouldn't have
come by myself...

307
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,500
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Ami! Are you</i>
<i>all right?!</i>

308
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,666
(Ami)
Yeah, what
happened?

309
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,300
There's not really
time to explain.

310
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,533
(Gasp)

311
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:04,833
(Ami)
That apple is
what's absorbing
everyone's energy!

312
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,466
The apple, huh?

313
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,300
(Luna)
All three of you
need to attack
together!

314
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,333
Mercury Power!
Make up!

315
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,633
Huh?

316
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,466
Now, aim for
the apple!

317
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,433
(Both)
Okay!

318
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,433
Bubble!

319
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:42,333
Spray!

320
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,266
Huh? Where
did they go?

321
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,300
Evil spirit!
Be exorcized!

322
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,166
Moon Tiara!

323
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,166
Action!

324
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,466
Fire!

325
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,200
Soul!

326
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,100
I-can't-move.

327
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,333
Uh-oh.

328
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,266
We did it!

329
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:56,100
Curses! Those
sailor guardians!

330
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:59,166
<i>(Jadeite)</i>
<i>I'll get them</i>
<i>for this!</i>

331
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,866

and talking)

332

<i>lesson.</i>

333
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:08,633
(cont'd)
You three were able
to win today because
you all fought as

334
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,433
(cont'd)
a team! So make
sure you don't
forget that!

335
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:12,666
<i>(Ami)</i>
<i>Right!</i>

336
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,000
Hey, how come your
ice cream cone is
so much bigger
than mine?

337
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:19,700
Maybe it's 'cause,
you eat too fast!

338
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,300
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Give me your</i>
<i>cone!</i>

339
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,166
(Rei)
Mmm- No way!

340
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,966
(Usagi)
Hand it over!

341
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,033
Ahh!

342
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,400
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>A night tour on</i>

<i>Now that's romantic!</i>

343
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:15,333
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>Usagi, a sailor</i>
<i>guardian doesn't</i>
<i>have time for that!</i>

344
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:18,066
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>What's better than</i>
<i>talking affectionately</i>

345
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,433
