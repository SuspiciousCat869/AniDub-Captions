Yeah...

We have to tell Naru
that Masato Sanjoin is
actually Nephrite,

Shouldn't we just
wait and see if it
becomes a problem?

42

Naru feels so strongly
about him, she might
not believe what we
tell her.

her, we won't know

us or not!

we do, Usagi?

we should tell her
but I...

Come on! Make
up your mind!

of something! Just let

Is everything all
right?

That's none of your
concern. Now get lost!

66
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,033
Well, here's some
friendly advice, I'd
suggest you give all
this up before you

67
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,233
make Queen Beryl
even angrier.

68
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:41,533
Ridiculous! I will
acquire the Silver
Crystal and I'll rub it
in your face!

69
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,233
Mmh! How dare you!
Finding the Silver
Crystal is my job!

70

It may well be your
job, but whoever finds
it first, wins!

71
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:52,166
If I get hold of
that Crystal, I'll be
able to redeem myself!

72
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,633
Nephrite! You'll pay
for this!

73
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:02,866
To think that I'd let
the likes of Zoisite
get to me, how pathetic.

The Dark Crystal.

79

me to the Silver
Crystal.

80

It's that girl!

Let Nephrite do
what he wants.

84
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,033
But what if he
somehow finds it?

Ah! That's a great
idea, Kunzite.

Meanwhile, I suggest you
have some of your

So, I just changed
my mind! That sort of

It happens all the

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,000
Uhh...
What should I do?

95
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,533

What now?

97
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,900

Yeah, coffee sounds

I've got to get this
off my chest.
Masato Sanjoin is a
bad person!

146
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
In fact he's not
even human!
Wait! I didn't mean
that!

00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,866
But he's very scary,
so you really shouldn't
go out with him ever!

148
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,233
Better to cut it off
right now! I beg of
you as your friend, try
to understand!

149
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,000
But, why should I?

150
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,900

her guy was an evil creep

Um?

I didn't, but I'm

What are you doing?

281
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:27,400
I won't let anyone
hurt Mr. Sanjoin!

282
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,833
Naru, what are
you doing?!

283
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,733
Tiara attack,
stop now!

284
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,466
It-it stopped.
I did it.

285
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
Stop trying to hurt
Mr. Sanjoin!

286
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,433
Look, we can't let
him get away with
what he's done!

287
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,266
Now move out of
the way!

288
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,466
Never! You'll have
to kill me to get to
him!

289
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,300
<i>(Nephrite)</i>
<i>Why is she doing this</i>
<i>for me?</i>

290
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,166
Why are you risking
so much to protect
that man?

291
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,533
Because I love him.

292
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,866
I love him with
all my heart.

293
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,133
And I'll defend him
even if it winds
up costing me my life!

294
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,200
Awh, Naru...

295
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:16,566
Does this mean the
Dark Crystal also
responds to kind
hearts, as well.

296
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,366
The sacrificing of
one's self for another.
I think this could be
what humans call love.

297
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:26,133
<i>(Yasha)</i>
<i>Is that the legendary</i>
<i>Silver Crystal?!</i>

298
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:26,566
Huh!

299
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,166
Hah! Huh! Hhmp!

300
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,266
(Gasps)

301
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,200
Hand that over to
me!

302
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,366
Ahh!

303
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,766
Naru!

304
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:42,800
I don't believe it,
he saved her!

305
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:47,666
Mr. Sanjoin, he
protected me from
that monster!
(Faints)

306
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,600
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Naru!</i>

307
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:56,433
Curse you, Nephrite!
Why are you protecting
a human?!
Ahhh!

308
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,433
Ugh!

309
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:09,066
Traitors like you,
must die!

310
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,666
Moon Tiara!

311
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,133
Action!

312
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,300
What?!

313
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,466
Ahh!

314
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,200
Curse you!
Curse you all!

315
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:41,400
Hold it, Nephrite!
Why can't you try to
understand the feelings
that Naru has for you?!

316
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,566
I did save her!

317
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,566
That's it! You really
don't have anything else
to say!

318
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,100
Have you ever thought
of anyone else's
feelings?!

319
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,566
I guess you can't
when you have no
heart!

320
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,200
You're all so naive!
When I finally get a hold
of the Silver Crystal,
the entire universe will

321
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,033
belong to the
Dark Kingdom!

322
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,766
The Silver Crystal?
What are you talking
about?

323
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,700
<i>The Silver Crystal?</i>
<i>Why does that sound</i>
<i>so familiar?</i>

324
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:07,700
(Nephrite)
Just know that you
three won't be able to
play hero much longer!

325
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:12,533
But feel free to keep
blabbering on about
your silly love and
justice! Farewell!

326
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:14,466
(Laughter)

327
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,333
Uh, Mr. Sanjoin?

328
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:22,066
Oh, Naru...

329
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:27,366
<i>Shooting star, please</i>
<i>hear my wish. If</i>
<i>Nephrite really does</i>

330
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,500

<i>A pure love story like</i>
