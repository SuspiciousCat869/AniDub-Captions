287
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:30,783
Thanks,Tuxedo Mask!

288
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:33,716
It's up to you now,
Sailor Moon!

289

Got it!

Moon Tiara!

291
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,883
Action!

292
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:55,949
Agh!

293
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:01,549
Ah-Ah-Ahh!

My hero!

(Mr. Kokuritsu)
Ami, I don't remember.
What happened to me?

299
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:33,116
It's all right.
Don't worry now.
<i>You were just having</i>
<i>a bad dream.</i>

300
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:36,049
Good grief, what a
horrible experience.

301
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,549
Mamoru! Are you sure
you should be up
and about?!

302
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,816
Yeah. Pretty sure
I'm doing okay.

303
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:46,049
Hey, you know what I
think? I bet Mamoru
is secretly Tuxedo Mask!

304
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,183
There is no way an
annoying guy like him
could be Tuxedo Mask!

305
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:52,649
Huh?!
What's that?!
Who's this Tuxedo Mask?

306
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:55,649
Oh, don't worry about
it! He's no one, really!

I've been looking
for you!

311

Well, since I found
you, let's finish our

What are you talking
about, Usagi? You're
the one who asked me
out!

316
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:19,883
Don't you remember
that?!

317
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,749
Uoh, so that's your
type, huh?

318
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:25,583
No, it's not like
that!
