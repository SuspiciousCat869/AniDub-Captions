1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,633
Autumn is the season of
love for all living
creatures. Earthworms
crickets, heck even Rei

2
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,400
falls in love! And I
won't forgive those
who try to ruin the
love between people,

3
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,200
or animals for
that matter!

4
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,466
I am Sailor Moon!
And in the name of
the protection of
animals everywhere.

5
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,300
I'll punish you!

6
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:25,366
Hey! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
You know me as the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice.

7
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,233
I am Sailor Moon!
This job's not
easy by the way!

8
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:33,266
We have to find and
protect the Legendary
Silver Crystal before
the bad guys get it!

9
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,900
But in order to do that
we need to find the Seven
Rainbow Crystals and the
people holding them!

10
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,266
Pretty crazy, huh?
But now there are
four of us Sailor
Guardians, so I

11
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,766
think everything's
gonna work out
just fine!

12
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,466
(giggling)

13
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:55,866
<i>"Loved and Chased:</i>
<i>Luna's Worst Day Ever"</i>

14
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,700
(Luna screaming)

15
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:23,533
Huh?

16
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,466
(bossy growl)

17
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,400
(confused meow)

18
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,166
Eeh...

19
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,833
(scared meows)

20
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:04,733
(scared meows)

21
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,466
(disgusted gasp)

22
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,766
<i>Rhett Butler,</i>
<i>where are you?!</i>

23
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,333
There you are!
I was so worried!
Ahh-h!

24
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,433
Isn't my idea of
what a 'Rhett Butler'
would look like.

25
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,833
Oh, my...

26
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:06,300
I never would've
guessed that our
last target would be
a cute little girl.

27
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,333
But she's got the
Seventh Rainbow
Crystal.

28
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:12,233
And this one will
be easy to get.

29
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,233
Sounds like you had
one hectic morning.

30
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:31,500
Tell me about it.
I don't want anything
more to do with stray
cats, their turf wars

31
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,000
or whatever else
they're doing!

32
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,733
<i>We're here!</i>

33
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,333
Sorry to keep
you waiting!

34
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,000
Hey, where's Rei?

35
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:43,000
Ah... Um... She
mentioned something
about going on a date
because it's Sunday.

36
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,166
Hi! It's Mamoru...

37
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,266
(gasp)

38
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,366
Hi, it's Rei!
How's it going?

39
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,433
...I'm not home at
the moment. Please
leave a message
after the beep.

40
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay...

41
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,033
Hi, Mamoru! This is
Rei! I found this
wonderful little shop
that has an unusual

42
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:13,433
cake called Tiramisu,
I mean it may not be
that unusual, but
I've never tasted it.

43
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:16,200
Anyway, I was
wondering if you
would like to go
there with me...

44
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:21,933
<i>The Seventh Rainbow</i>
<i>Crystal. I'm going</i>
<i>to get my hands on it.</i>

45
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,700
So what are you
doing there, Ami?

46
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,966
I'm trying to track
down the Seventh
Rainbow Crystal.

47
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,366
Huh? That's odd, my
Moon Stick isn't
reacting one bit.

48
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,300
The Moon Stick works
when we're close to
it, so we'll use the
computer to calculate

49
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,433
its location. We've
gathered the data,
but putting it in
takes so long!

50
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,433
(whining groan)

51
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:43,333
All done!

52
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,333
You've finished
inputting the data,
huh?

53
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,133
According to this,
the Seventh Rainbow
Crystal is right there!

54
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:54,966
Wow!

55
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,333
Hmmm...

56
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,400
So you think the
Rainbow Crystal is
somewhere around
that house?

57
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,566
If the data's
right, it should
be.

58
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,200
Hm?

59
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,233
Oh brother! Just
my luck! That
cat lives here!

60
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,233
Let's go.
C'mon!

61
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,900
You go on. I
think I'm just
gonna hang back.

62
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,133
Huh? But
what for?

63
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,433
I've got stuff
go do.

64
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,566
Your stuff can
wait. This is a
very important
mission, Luna.

65
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,633
Try to remember what
your duties are!

66
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:34,133
Stop being so rude!
I've never looked
that ugly in my
life!

67
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
It's all right.
We'll do fine!

68
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:40,133
<i>There are times when</i>
<i>even Luna doesn't want</i>
<i>to go on missions.</i>

69
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,133
I guess I'll have
to accept that.

70
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,366
Wait for us right
here so we can
find you!

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,033
Don't move even
an inch!

72
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,166
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:52,966
Frankly, I wish Usagi
would always show
such initiative.

74
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,066
Hm?
Uh?

75
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,233
(aggressive meows)

76
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,300
Uhh...!!

77
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,466
Ahh!!

78
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,566
Yes?

79
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,466
Hi! Sorry to
bother you.

80
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,033
Is your mother or
your father home?

81
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:27,566
No, they're not.
They won't be home
until tonight.

82
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:30,733
(gasp)

83
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,566
I know. My Stick's
reacting.

84
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,166
<i>Could that little</i>
<i>girl be a monster?</i>

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Stop! Come
back here!

86
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,900
Rhett Butler!
Please stop!

87
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,533
Rhett Butler?

88
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,900
(evil chuckling)

89
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,066
(fearful scream)

90
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:11,000
(angry meows)

91
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,233
Ahh!

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,033
(surprised meows)

93
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,200
(nervous meows)

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,866
Meow?

95
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,500
Ahhh!

96
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,133
Meow?

97
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,200
Wo-oh-oh!

98
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:47,966
Meow!

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,500
Ahhhh!

100
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,733
Meow!!

101
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,066
(chuckle)

102
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Now then. It's time
for me to take the
Rainbow Crystal.

103
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,733
Huh?!

104
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:23,066
What's going on?
Why isn't the
Rainbow Crystal
appearing?!

105
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,433
(gasp)

106
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:28,466
It was right in front
of my eyes. That ugly
fat cat is the monster!

107
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,433
How could I have
been so careless?!

108
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,733
The final Great
Monster was reborn
as an animal, not
a human!

109
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,866
Stop right there!

110
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,733
Now that we've
arrived, you won't
be getting your way
Zoisite!

111
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,233
We won't let you
turn that child
into a monster!

112
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:48,200
In the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

113
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,033
Hah!

114
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:49,966
Zoi!

115
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,900
(scream)

116
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,433
Bubble...

117
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,733
Sailor Moon,
you're in my way!

118
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,833
I can't help it!

119
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,433
I'm done here.

120
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't have time
to play these games
with you.

121
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,733
You're not getting
away! Now, supreme...

122
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,833
H-Hey wait!

123
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:10,800
We'll all be
electrocuted!

124
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Uhhh...

125
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,366
It smells really
rotten down here!

126
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,433
Why does that ugly
fat cat have to hang
out in such a stinky
place? This is exactly

127
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,800
why I hate non-
human monsters!

128
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,266
O-Oh no!

129
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:39,800
This might be the
greatest challenge
that I'll ever have
to face!

130
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,200
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

131
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,066
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

132
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:16,064
I wonder where Luna
went. It's been a
while since we saw
her.

133
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:19,904
I told her not
to move but did
she listen?! No!
She's abandoned

134
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,770
us in the middle
of an important
mission!

135
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,837
Luna would never
do anything like
that!

136
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,837
I'm worried that
something might
have happened to
her!

137
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,204
Oh?

138
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:33,237
Ahh! This little
girl has a copy
of the Sailor V
video game! Look!

139
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,904
Oh, Usagi.

140
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:39,070
We should stay on
alert. We don't know
when Zoisite will try
to come after her again.

141
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:42,670
I still can't believe
that this little girl
has a Rainbow Crystal.

142
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:43,570
(Usagi yelling)

143
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:45,637
Which means, she'll
turn into a monster.

144
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,937
(chuckling)

145
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,770
It's so close!

146
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:57,870
That ugly fat cat is
quite near by, now.

147
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,737
<i>It feels warm.</i>

148
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,437
Huh?

149
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:13,970
(screaming)

150
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:19,037
It's a moving
wall of rats!

151
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,870
I wonder where
Mamoru went? I was
sure we were getting
together today.

152
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:30,604
This isn't how I
wanted to spend my
Sunday afternoon.

153
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:31,637
Rei!

154
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,404
Huh?

155
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,904
Yuichiro?!

156
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:38,704
Hey, you! Looks like
you have today off,
too, am I right?

157
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:43,470
Yeah. I'm just sort
of hanging out. Would
you like to have a
cup of tea with me?

158
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,770
Well, I'm not
sure. I may have
other plans.

159
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,404
Oh, yeah, what was
I thinking, springing
this on you last
minute. A beautiful

160
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,770
girl like you is
probably all
booked up.

161
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,637
Huh?! Yeah...
I guess...

162
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,070
Ah! Got it! Oh
well then. Have
a nice day!

163
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:05,104
Huh?! Uh-h...

164
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:11,670
Oh wow, he sure took
off in a big hurry.
He's just gone with
the wind. See ya!

165
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:15,770
Aww, I don't see
an exit anywhere!

166
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:26,170
Ugh! Well we're sure
going nowhere. If
you had just stayed
away...

167
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:27,070
(gasp)

168
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:30,870
W-What happened to
you? Your leg is
hurt!

169
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:35,804
Did you injure it
when you leapt down
from that high wall
to rescue me?

170
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:41,570
Come to think of
it, you risked your
life two times to
help me...

171
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:44,337
Does that mean you
like me or something?

172
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:48,704
What a purr-
dicament!

173
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,437
Huh?!

174
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,037
Th-that's!

175
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,570
It's Zoisite!

176
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,770
I've found him! The
Seventh Great Monster!

177
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:12,437
What?! You have the
Rainbow Crystal that
we're all looking for?!

178
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,970
Quickly! Go through
that hole! He won't
be able to get in!

179
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,670
You won't get
away from me!

180
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,770
Ahhh!
Go-go-go-go!

181
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,704
Huh?

182
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,637
Ahh!

183
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,270
I'm taking the
Rainbow Crystal!
Nothing will stop me!

184
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:49,704
(fearful screams)

185
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:54,570
Ahhh!
Faster!

186
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:03,370
Look! There's
the exit!

187
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,504
(wishful sigh)

188
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,737
I should have said
yes to Yuichiro. Then
at least I could say
I had a date.

189
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:15,637
It's Luna! I didn't
know she had a
boyfriend. She's
pretty sly.

190
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,904
Huh?

191
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,937
Ahhh! What's
going on?!

192
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:27,070
Oh!

193
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,304
I should have noticed
this sooner!

194
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:32,870
The Moon Stick isn't
reacting! There's no
reaction at all!

195
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,604
But that means...

196
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:37,337
She has nothing
to do with the
Rainbow Crystal.

197
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,604
So then, why did the
Moon Stick react when
we arrived here earlier?

198
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,404
(gasps)

199
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,704
You don't think?!

200
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,470
It has to be that the
stick was reacting
to the cat!

201
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:50,604
(screams)

202
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,304
Game over!!

203
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:58,337
Faster! Run
Faster!

204
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,904
Ahhh!

205
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,337
Ow!

206
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:07,037
(scared whines)

207
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,837
What looked like a
disaster has turned
into my good fortune.

208
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,737
And in the end,
everything has
worked out to my
advantage!

209
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,270
<i>Fire Soul!</i>

210
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:22,304
(luna screaming)

211
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:34,704
Sailor Mars, the
Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and
for justice is here...

212
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:37,170
...to save the day!

213
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:40,437
I won't let you get
in the way of their
beautiful cat love!

214
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,337
You've got it
all wrong!!

215
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,304
The flames of love
are burning!

216
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:47,637
The flames of
justice are
burning!

217
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,237
I can't forgive those
who get in the way
of love...

218
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,870
...between people and
all living creatures!

219
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:57,604
So in the name of
Mars. I'll chastise
you!

220
00:17:57,804 --> 00:18:00,304
Ha! You little fool!

221
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:03,837
Zoi!

222
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,570
(nervous gasp)

223
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:08,637
You should try
getting a grasp of
the situation before
you show off!

224
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,437
This time I'm getting
the Rainbow Crystal
for sure.

225
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:28,170
(screaming meow)

226
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:31,304
(gasps)

227
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,337
(screaming meow)

228
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,504
Oh no! Rhett Butler!

229
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:51,670
(scared gasps)

230
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,737
(growl)

231
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,404
Rhett Butler!
Is that you?!

232
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,437
Now get rid of them,
Great Monster!

233
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,404
They don't have any
back-up. It's a
piece of cake!

234
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:09,604
(painful whine)

235
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,104
I'll be taking the
final Rainbow Crystal.
Farewell!

236
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:18,570
Curse you!

237
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,270
Tuxedo Mask, you
thief! Come b-b-back
with my Rainbow
Crystal!

238
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:25,604
Oh no! It looks
like he's headed
into town!

239
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:26,337
Stop!

240
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,570
Luna!

241
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:32,237
Stop-stop-stop-stop-
stop! Please don't
move! Just stay still!

242
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,037
My friends will come
to help you soon,
I promise!

243
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,470
(vicious growl)

244
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:41,137
(screaming)

245
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,337
Luna!

246
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:51,737
(gasp)

247
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:57,737
Y-you saved me
again...

248
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,537
It'll be all right.
Usagi'll be here
soon and turn you
back to normal.

249
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,670
I knew it! Those
two are madly in
love!

250
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,170
Bubble!

251
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,470
Spray!

252
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:35,637
Oh no! You ruined
the moment!

253
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,504
Sailor Jupiter!

254
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:53,337
Sorry we're late!

255
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,537
Yeah, you'd better
be! What took you
so long to get here?

256
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,970
Sorry, I got a little
distracted by some
video game noise.

257
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:03,504
Me too, and it's
really not because
Usagi was playing
all those games.

258
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,604
Right! Usagi was
just trying to
have some fun!

259
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:10,104
Uh... You know,
you girls aren't
really helping me
a whole lot.

260
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:13,704
Hey! Enough already!
You need to get
serious!

261
00:21:15,337 --> 00:21:16,437
Right!

262
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:18,104
(growls)

263
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:26,704
Moon Healing
Escalation!

264
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,570
Meow-fresh!

265
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,037
Oh, thank
goodness!

266
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,337
(giggling)

267
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,570
Oh, I was so worried
about you. Did you
miss me, Rhett Butler?

268
00:21:50,604 --> 00:21:53,270
She's so happy to
have her kitty back!

269
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:56,304
Now, are you sure
you don't want to
say goodbye to your
boyfriend, Luna?

270
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:59,204
Get out! You and
that cat were
lovers, Luna?!

271
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:01,470
Woah! How'd you
come up with
that idea?!

272
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,470
Whoo-hoo! Luna's
hot, and love is
bitten!

273
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:06,237
(annoyed groan)

274
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:11,970
Even Usagi's making
fun of me! I don't
appreciate being the
victim of idle gossip.

275
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:32,037
Ooh... Give me
a break.

276
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,237
A new hero makes
an appearance on
Sailor Moon!

277
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,870
<i>Everyone already</i>
<i>knows who he is,</i>
<i>but he's dressed</i>
<i>in a tuxedo and</i>

278
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:20,437
<i>wears a black</i>
<i>cape!</i>

279
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,037
And like the wind,
he appears out of
nowhere to protect and
fight just for Naru!

280
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,870
<i>Everyone...</i>

281
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:25,670
Meet...

282
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:28,104
<i>...Tuxedo Umino</i>
<i>Mask!</i>

283
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:32,970
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon,</i>
<i>"Umino's Resolve: I'll</i>
<i>Protect Naru"</i>

284
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:37,737
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
