1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,100
You monster! How dare you
dress up in a tuxedo just
to toy with an innocent
girl's feelings! I'm

2
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:09,700
never, ever, EVER going
to forgive you for this!
You hear me?!!

3
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,700
I am Sailor Moon!

4
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,833
And in the name of the
Moon I'll punish you!

5
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:23,000
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino! It
may not look it, but
I'm actually a
superhero!

6
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:27,166
I use a special brooch to
transform and fight evil!
You know me as...

7
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,766
...the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice. I am Sailor
Moon!

8
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,866
I'm friends with the
kindhearted genius, Ami
Mizuno, who's Sailor
Mercury...!

9
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,733
...And Rei Hino, the
hotheaded psychic, who's
Sailor Mars. Both of them
seem to have it a little

10
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,133
more together than I
do...

11
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,000
But, oh well, guess I
just gotta do my best!

12
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,566
[giggling]

13
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,866
"Usagi's Joy: A Love
Letter From Tuxedo Mask"

14
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:04,033
The stars see all, the
stars know all!

15
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:10,200
Hear me Regulus, ruler of
the southern skies! Oh
vast constellation of Leo
the Lion!

16
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:15,266
Show me a weakness
something I can use to
eliminate those Sailor
Guardians forever.

17
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,300
[grunting]

18
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,933
Tuxedo Mask!

19
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:33,633
Moon Tiara Action!

20
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,766
Fire...

21
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,066
.... Soul!!

22
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,133
Till we meet again,
Sailor Guardians.

23
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,833
[swooning]

24
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,833
My hero...

25
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:58,233
Aha! So, she has a
weakness for Tuxedo Mask!
Then that's how I'll
crush you!

26
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:03,066
Hello, Nephrite. Queen
Beryl would like to have
a word with you.

27
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,700
Nephrite, I'm told that
you are having trouble
gathering human energy
for our great ruler.

28
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,133
Is this true?

29
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,333
The universe wasn't
built in a day, my queen.

30
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:19,033
You'll watch your tongue!
Question my orders again
or fail to take care of
those

31
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:24,333
Sailor Guardians and
you'll soon find yourself
right alongside Jadeite
in the Eternal Sleep!

32
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,700
[trembling]

33
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,833
A sentence worse
than death.

34
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:33,200
I am Nephrite, proud
member of the Dark
Kingdom's Four Kings
of Heaven! And I will

35
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,066
succeed in my mission!

36
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,266
In fact, I now know just
how to deal with Sailor
Moon.

37
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,766
Sounds a lot like the
story we used to hear
from Jadeite.

38
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,266
What's your plan?

39
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:50,033
Queen Beryl, I promise
you that this time,
Sailor Moon will be dealt
with and eliminated.

40
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,700
[chuckling]
Very well, then.

41
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:58,266
I'm going to destroy her
with her own love! Ha ha
ha ha ha ha!!

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,900
Huh?

43
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
[gasping]

44
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,966
Aaaghh! No way--no way!!

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,566
I don't believe it!
It's from Tuxedo Mask!

46
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:19,200
My heart yearns for
you. Please come meet
me at the MS mall in
Shinjuku tomorrow night.

47
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,600
Ahhh! Yes!

48
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:28,133
Well, that's certainly
nice and all, but why
would Tuxedo Mask send a
love letter to you?

49
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,900
Oh, come on, Luna,
isn't it obvious?

50
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,966
[giggling]

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
He's in love with me!

52
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,933
Okay, let's say for a
second that your
delusions are real. How
does he know you're

53
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:39,966
Sailor Moon?

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's amazing!

55
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:48,300
That's just how powerful
his love for me is! His
heart can see into mine and
right through all my secrets!

56
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,700
There's nothing but truth
between true loves.

57
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:54,933
Well, just because Tuxedo
Mask is always helping us
doesn't mean we should
trust him.

58
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,966
Maybe he's on our side
and maybe not.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,600
[kissing noises]

60
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,566
<i>I can't wait!</i>

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,233
No way! You're all
lying! I don't
believe it!

62
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,333
But it's true, Usagi.
We all got letters from
Tuxedo Mask.

63
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,333
I got one too!

64
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,133
Same here!

65
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:14,933
Me too!

66
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,066
Who is this Tuxedo
Mask anyway?

67
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
No clue!

68
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:24,566
I really wish we knew
which guy it's from.
It would be so great if
it was from him.

69
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,933
<i>[laughing]</i>
Come on, give
it back.

70
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:33,200
Now class I've heard
about the love letter
prank and I want you
girls to remember that

71
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,833
distractions like that
are enemy number one when
it comes to learning,
understand?

72
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,633
[agreeing]

73
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,233
And since we don't know
what kind of person sent
them, I want everyone to
avoid going

74
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:47,333
out alone at night.
Especially to the MS mall
in Shinjuku.

75
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,200
Understood?

76
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,266
Yeah!

77
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,766
Good answer!

78
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:58,066
Why didn't I get a love
letter, mister mysterious
Tuxedo Mask?! What am I,
chopped liver?!

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,600
There's something very
suspicious about this
love letter business,
Ami. Don't you think so?

80
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:07,600
You're right, we should
probably go talk to Rei
and see what she thinks
about it.

81
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:13,266
Huh? A lover letter from
Tuxedo Mask? What's
that about? Aagh!!

82
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,333
Apparently he sent one
out to every girl in
town.

83
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,100
Think it's some kind of
advertising?

84
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,566
It could be, but who
knows what's really
going on.

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,033
Huh?

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,300
[sighing]

87
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey, hi Usagi!

88
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,000
[sighing and groaning]

89
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,866
Huh?

90
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,100
What's up? You look
kinda bummed out.

91
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,900
Sigh!

92
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:38,766
Ahh, I bet I know what's
goin' on here. The other
girls got a mysterious
love letter, but you

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,633
didn't get one.

94
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,700
Doesn't that sound
about right Motoki?

95
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,666
Yeah, that's gotta sting
a little!

96
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,866
No, that's not right! I
got a letter too, you
jerk!

97
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,800
[gasping]

98
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,933
Oh, well then why were
sighing just now?

99
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,166
Because it's just so
mean!

100
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,233
All this time, Tuxedo
Mask's been cheating
behind my back and now
he's even sending love

101
00:07:56,266 --> 00:08:04,000
letters to other girls!
[sobbing]

102
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,233
Oh no, Rei! I didn't
know you were sick!

103
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,966
I woke up this morning
with a fever and a sore
throat.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,033
It stinks, but I don't
think I'm in any shape to
go out, even if it is for
Tuxedo Mask.

105
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,233
[coughing]

106
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,600
Sorry.

107
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:22,000
There's no need to
apologize, Rei. Here, let
me go get you some ice.

108
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:36,633
All is in place.
Sailor Moon's love for
Tuxedo Mask will force
her to show up here tonight.

109
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,300
And when she does, it
will be her end!

110
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,833
<i>Mr. Sanjoin?</i>

111
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:41,700
Hm?

112
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,333
Hello there!

113
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:48,833
Sorry... you probably
don't remember me. I'm
Naru Osaka.

114
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:52,166
Sure, I remember you.
Are you shopping?

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,366
Uh-huh.

116
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,866
This is going to
sound weird but can
I ask you something?

117
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,966
Sure.

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,133
Mr. Sanjoin, I was
wondering if you're
Tuxedo Mask.

119
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,833
Tuxedo-!?

120
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,900
Course not, why would you
ask that?

121
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:07,133
I know, it's kind of
a strange question, but

122
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,966
it would be nice if
you were Tuxedo Mask.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,833
Does she suspect it was
me who wrote the letters?
Impossible! But why else
would she ask that?!

124
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:18,966
The real question
is: Could she be Sailor
Moon?!

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,166
Just forget I asked I'm
not usually this
nervous.

126
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
So Naru.

127
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,500
Y-Yes?

128
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,566
Has anybody told you
you're the cutest girl
in school?

129
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,466
[swooning]

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,966
I mean it, I felt drawn
to you since the first
time we met. Hope you can
make it tonight.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,033
Tonight?! Wait a minute!

132
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,033
It has to be him!

133
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,100
Has anybody told you
you're the cutest girl
in school?

134
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:53,300
I mean it, I felt drawn
to you since the first
time we met.

135
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,233
[swooning]

136
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:57,333
I feel the same
way, too.

137
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,233
This makes no sense.

138
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,133
Why would Tuxedo Mask
write love letters to a
whole bunch of other
girls and not just to

139
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,633
me?! I don't
get it!

140
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,933
Well I guess the only way
to figure this out is to
go to the mall and ask
him myself!

141
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,066
The first rule of getting
ready for a date...

142
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,166
Wear a clean pair of
underwear!

143
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,100
And wear a clean
dress to go with it!

144
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,133
The second rule of
getting ready for a
date...

145
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,333
Is to wear just the right
amount of perfume!

146
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:27,866
And the third rule
for getting ready...

147
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,733
Is to brush your teeth
and get rid of stinky
breath!

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
And now for the finishing
touch!

149
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,266
Just exactly the right
shade of lipstick!

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,533
Then get ready for
magical things to happen!

151
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,600
[laughing]

152
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,066
Oh, who am I kidding!

153
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,900
Ooh but what if it did,
what if it totally did?!

154
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,000
Huh?

155
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,633
Is anybody here?

156
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:22,300
It's me, Naru--are you
here Tuxedo Mask? Or
should I call you Mr.
Sanjoin?

157
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,800
Here I am!

158
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,966
[swooning]

159
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,333
I'm glad you came.

160
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,833
I know that voice!

161
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,966
I was right all along!
It's you, Mr. Sanjoin.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,666
You recognize my voice?

163
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,100
I'd know your voice
anywhere! And no mask or
hat can hide your beautiful
face or hair!

164
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,266
Are you genuinely that in
love with this Masato
Sanjoin?

165
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes, ever since this
afternoon, all I could
think of was you. I am
madly in love with you,

166
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,133
Mr. Sanjoin.

167
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,966
Enough of this charade!

168
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,766
Cut the acting and reveal
yourself!

169
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,900
I know who you really
are--you're Sailor
Moon!!

170
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,000
Huh?!

171
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,166
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

172
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:24,648
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

173
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,315
Hmm, I just realized...

174
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:35,582
I really should've let
Ami and Rei know where I
was going tonight.

175
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:40,415
Where in the world are
you Usagi?

176
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:43,982
Yeah funny you should
ask. I'm actually in
Shinjuku right now.

177
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,248
[gasping]

178
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:50,015
That little sneak!--More
like she decided to have
a date with Tuxedo Mask
without us!!

179
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:51,615
[coughing]

180
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,748
Uhh, what's wrong,
Mr. Sanjoin?

181
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,748
Spare me your lies!
Just transform already!

182
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,315
I don't get what
you're saying.

183
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:03,582
But, you have to be
Sailor Moon! Why else
would you come to meet
me?!

184
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,715
For love.

185
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:07,548
[grunting]

186
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:09,915
[grunting]

187
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,982
Look at the energy
she's giving off!

188
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:15,348
Mr. Sanjoin.

189
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,315
Naru!!

190
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,482
But why? Why would Tuxedo
Mask do this to her?

191
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:35,782
Hold on! That's a fake!
That guy isn't Tuxedo
Mask!

192
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,482
Hang in there,
Naru!

193
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:41,482
Moon Prism Power Make
Up!!

194
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,548
[grunting]

195
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:24,948
Not again!

196
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,215
My head!

197
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:46,248
So this one didn't turn
out to be Sailor Moon, but
the energy I gained from
her was amazing.

198
00:14:46,682 --> 00:14:48,282
<i>Get your hands off of</i>
<i>Naru!</i>

199
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,715
Huh? Who's there?!

200
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,448
How dare you dress up
in a tuxedo to toy with
an innocent girl's
feelings!

201
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,548
So you're here!

202
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:57,615
I am the Pretty
Guardian.

203
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,315
Who fights for love and
for justice!

204
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:06,348
I am Sailor Moon!

205
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:09,282
And in the name of the
Moon I'll punish you!

206
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:13,648
How were you able to
figure out I wasn't the
real Tuxedo Mask?

207
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:16,282
A girl can always
recognize her true love!

208
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,448
Sailor Moon Kick!

209
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:24,582
So you want to play
rough? Here, I'll give
you back your little
friend!

210
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,715
Naru!

211
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,615
[growling]

212
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,315
[grunting]

213
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,682
Wait a minute!--You're
Masato Sanjoin!

214
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:39,015
No, I am Nephrite, one of
the Dark Kingdom's Four
Kings of Heaven!

215
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,748
Nephrite, huh?!

216
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:45,682
I came to destroy you
once and for all, Sailor
Moon and that's just what
I intend to do!

217
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:48,748
[gasping]

218
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,248
Hear me now Regulus, the
brightest of the southern
skies!

219
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,848
Give me your strength!

220
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:07,848
Ahhhh!

221
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:10,315
Devour this girl now,
Leo!

222
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:12,348
Aaghh!!--Oh no not that!!

223
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,382
[panting]
Ah!

224
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:20,548
Who did that?!

225
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:21,748
Uh!

226
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:28,648
You really thought I'd
let you get away with
using my name on all
those phony love letters

227
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,882
so you could draw out
Sailor Moon?

228
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:31,815
Not a chance!

229
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:35,282
Ohhh! Nothing's
better than the
real deal!

230
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:36,582
Damn it, Tuxedo
Mask!

231
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:37,782
Hyah!

232
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,682
I'll handle these
guys! Now, get going!

233
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:44,682
Right! There's nothing
I won't do for the real
you!

234
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:50,515
You fools! She thinks you
can save her from me?!

235
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:56,748
Bring it!

236
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,448
Whoa, what am I doing
leaving him all alone!?

237
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:16,648
Moon Tiara... Action!

238
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,548
[roaring]

239
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:25,715
No way! Why's it not
working?

240
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,682
Sailor Moon! Get into the
elevator!

241
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:28,748
Okay!

242
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:29,748
[roaring]

243
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,448
[panting]

244
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,915
Ha ha ha ha! They fell
for it completely!

245
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:41,982
I should have known!

246
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:43,815
What's wrong?!

247
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:48,848
Yes, it was a trap. Now,
what do you suppose is
gonna happen when this
elevator reaches the top?

248
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,782
Just tell us already!

249
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:55,748
Since you insist... the
elevator cable is going
to snap!

250
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:59,815
And you'll be
pulverized after
plummeting to the
basement of this building!

251
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:02,248
Waaaahhhhhh!

252
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,682
I'm too young to be
pulverized!

253
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,382
[sniffling]

254
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,615
Well, as long
as we're alone...

255
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:13,448
We need to find
a way out.

256
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:18,982
What's wrong with me? I
should be terrified right
now, but all I can think
of is how happy I am

257
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,515
being alone with Tuxedo
Mask.

258
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,015
Sailor Moon, listen...

259
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:25,548
[cooing]

260
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,982
Now what are you doing?
We need to focus here.

261
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,515
Huh?--Oh, right!!

262
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:34,848
Take my hand!

263
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,482
We've reached the top
floor! Get ready to jump!

264
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:39,971
'Kay.

265
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,471
[grunting]

266
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,705
[chuckling]

267
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,571
[laughing]

268
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,905
At last!
[laughing]

269
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:08,371
[groaning]

270
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,038
Can't hang on!

271
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:14,471
Don't give up, Sailor
Moon! I'll get us outta
this! In the meantime
just think about

272
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,138
something else to get
your mind off of it!

273
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,605
Okay!

274
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:21,871
Um... I know! Tell me why
you always come to my
rescue!

275
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:25,471
I don't know why, but
something inside of me
tells me to.

276
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:31,605
I've got a foothold so
climb up and onto my
back, now Sailor Moon.

277
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:35,138
[grunting]

278
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,438
I know why you save me.

279
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,938
I think you're in love
with me but you just
aren't ready to tell
me yet.

280
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,538
Ah! Oh, no. Did I
say that out loud?! I
was only kidding.

281
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:47,905
Sorry but I was
wondering...

282
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,038
[grunting]

283
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,471
Just who are you under
that mask?

284
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:56,905
Wait, don't tell me!
You're Motoki aren't
you?! Ha! There I go
again saying dumb stuff!

285
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:57,938
Sailor Moon...

286
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,805
Yeah?

287
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:04,071
This may sound strange...
But I have the feeling
that there was some kind
of connection between us

288
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:05,971
somewhere in the past.

289
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,671
It's there in the corner
of my mind, but I can't
remember what it was.

290
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:10,671
[grunting]

291
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:13,871
Ahh! I shouldn't
have had that other
pork bun!

292
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,338
Just stay calm!

293
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:19,605
Oh! Okay talk about
something else, got any
less dangerous hobbies?

294
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:24,105
Oh!! Why am I such an
idiot? I can't think of
any normal questions,
'cause I'm not a

295
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:28,005
normal girl!
[wailing]

296
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,738
Uh!

297
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,371
Tuxedo Mask!

298
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,471
You know better than to
go out on a mission
without telling us about
it Sailor Moon!

299
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,805
Sorry about that!

300
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:44,338
[coughing]
That was too close for
comfort!

301
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:46,538
Thanks for the
rescue, you two!

302
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:53,371
This is unbelievable.
I'm stuck with a nasty
cold while you get to
sneak out and flirt with

303
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:55,138
Tuxedo Mask! It's just
no fair!

304
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,838
Huh?! Well it's not
exactly like that...

305
00:20:57,871 --> 00:20:59,638
Not now Sailor Mars.

306
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:04,005
Are you taking her side?!
You were just as mad as
me before!

307
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,671
Yes, but right now the
most important thing is
for us to get Naru here
to a hospital.

308
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:12,505
I wish you girls would
get along better!
Farewell for now!

309
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,871
Tuxedo Mask!

310
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,905
Why does he
always disappear?

311
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,905
If there's anything I
can't stand it's a girl
fight.

312
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:35,538
<i>Queen Beryl, as you may</i>
<i>recall Nephrite swore to</i>
<i>defeat Sailor Moon. Yet</i>
<i>he failed once again.</i>

313
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:38,438
You must sentence him to
the Eternal Sleep.

314
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,771
[grunting]

315
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:44,938
Ordinarily I would agree
and his sentence would be
swift and without mercy.

316
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,605
But this amazing energy
he stole earns him a
reprieve.

317
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:50,471
But My Queen!

318
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,438
This discussion is over!

319
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,505
You Zoisite, should
remember your place and
your own mission to bring
me the Silver Crystal!

320
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,105
[gasping]

321
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:02,338
[chuckling]

322
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,605
It all makes sense now...

323
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:11,505
Everyone becomes obsessed
with someone or something
at least once in their
lives, and focuses all

324
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,171
their energy on it...

325
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:17,538
Still I never would have
expected that girl Naru
to produce such
incredible energy.

326
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:22,071
She has truly
fallen in love with the
Masato Sanjoin persona
I've crafted.

327
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,138
The poor, pathetic
fool.

328
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:31,905
[laughing]

329
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:15,071
Wow, just look how
beautiful this place is!
The blue sky, the
sparkling ocean!

330
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,805
<i>Don't forget you're here</i>
<i>for training.</i>

331
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,771
Oh, I know, I know, I
know!

332
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:22,971
But what am I supposed to
do with all these gorgeous
men on the beach?!

333
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:26,371
Ugh! Why is our
hotel so dilapidated?

334
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:33,105
Next time on Sailor Moon:
"The Summer, The Beach,
Youth And Ghosts!"

335
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,005
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
