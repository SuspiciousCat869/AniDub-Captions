00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Oh, no! The blue-eyed doll
has been smashed into
pieces by a monster!

2
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:08,566
How could you! That doll
was filled with the true
heart of its maker!

3
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,333
Even the Girls' Day
Dolls are angry!

4
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:16,233
I am Sailor Moon, and in
the name of the moon, I'll
punish you!

5
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,333
Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino! It
may not look it, but
I'm actually a
superhero!

6
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:27,666
I use a special brooch to
transform and fight evil!
You know me as...

7
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,500
...the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice. I am Sailor
Moon!

8
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:36,833
My friends are the
kindhearted genius, Ami
Mizuno, who's Sailor
Mercury...!

9
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:41,700
...And Rei Hino, the
hotheaded psychic, who's
Sailor Mars. Both of them
seem to have it a little

10
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,333
more together than I
do...

11
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,700
But, oh well, guess I
just gotta do my best!

"Shingo's Love: The
Grieving Doll"

14
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:05,466
Nephrite, have you made
any progress in
eliminating the Sailor
Guardians?

15
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,400
Everything's under
control, I assure you.

16

[laughing]

17
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,666
Really? You seem to be
having quite a struggle
with them. I'd be happy
to help out.

18
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,400
After all, the two of us
can carry out a plan
better than only one.
Don't you agree, my Queen?

19
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,233
Yes, that's a good idea.
Nephrite, you will work
with Zoisite.

20
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,500
Never.

21
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,833
Oh, my! You're actually
going to defy Queen Beryl
like that?

22
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,666
That's enough, Zoisite!
I'm not doing this for
Queen Beryl!

23
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,433
I am doing it for
myself!

24
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,966
Now excuse me!

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,333
Damn you, Nephrite...!

26
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:52,000
Perfect! Everything is
going exactly as I
planned! Now Queen Beryl
will distance herself

27
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,633
from Nephrite...
[giggling]

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,466
Wow, Usagi, you're up
early today.

29
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,666
Uh huh!

30
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,466
Normal people do this

[groaning]

32
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,266
Oh! Shingo, I heard Mika
won a prize in a French
doll-making contest.

33
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,866
Really?

34
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,966
I knew she would. After
all, her mother is a
well-known doll maker,
right, dear?

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Like mother like
daughter!

36
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:21,300
Mr. Shingo Tsukino, tell
me, how does it feel to
have a celebrity for a
girlfriend?

37
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,900
Cut it out!

38
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,500
And that's the news,
now, back to you, Tom!

39
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:30,400
Dumb Usagi! You're going
to be late for school
again, like always! See
ya!

40
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah, right. I got up
early today so I won't be
late!

41
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,733
Is that really the time?!
I'm going to be late!

42
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,000
<i>Miss Tsukino! Go stand in</i>
<i>the hallway.</i>

43
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,400
You never get tired of
being tardy, do you?

44
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:45,833
Leave me alone.

45
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,933
Are you Shingo's big
sister?

46
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,666
Uh... Yes, I am...

47
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,633
Maybe you can tell us why
Shingo's so mean!

48
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,666
What did he do this time?

49
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,566
Well, today at school...

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,966
Shingo...? Shingo...!

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Oh, Mika! Congratulations
on that doll contest!

52
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,433
Thanks! And Shingo...
Here.

53
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:08,833
What's this?

54
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,666
I'd like for you to have
the doll that won me the
prize in the contest.

55
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,666
You sure it's okay for me
to have something so
important?

56
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,933
Yeah! You were always
there when I needed
someone to talk to...

57
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,300
Everyone, look at the
lovebirds!

[crying]

68
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,433
And after all
that, Shingo didn't
even apologize!

69
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,533
Everyone felt so sorry
for Mika.

70
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,666
Mm-hmm!

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,233
Can you please tell
Shingo to apologize to
Mika?

72
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,300
Oh, I will! What he did
was wrong!

73
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,566
Thanks so much!

74
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,433
I guess you'd better have
a big heart to heart talk
with him.

75
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:26,500
Mmm-hm! Don't worry,
girls. Just leave this to
his smart and pretty big
sister!

76
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,933
I'm gonna make him
apologize to him for
sure.

It's so dark in here.
Is everything okay,
honey?

81
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,966
It's easier to
concentrate this way.

82

You're already working on
your next one?

Yeah...

85

But it's still well-made.
Why don't we take a look
at the doll that won the
prize and see how it compares!

doll today, so you've
gotta go over to her house

Sanjoin. I called
earlier.

00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,466
Oh, right.
One moment...

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh, they have company.
Guess I'd better come
back later.

123
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:58,833
All this time, I have
believed that Pierre
Dumaux was the only
person who could truly

124
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,366
create dolls that are
made in the French
tradition.

125
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,633
But after seeing your
work, I've changed my
mind.

126
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,666
You know how to
flatter a girl!

I was incredibly
impressed with the doll
that you entered into
that contest.

It was really
wonderful.

is, uh... Mika, why don't
you show him the doll
that you've been working

134
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,600
on lately?

135
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:26,766

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,466
Let me look closer...

138
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,300
This sorrowful expression
is sublime...

Kayama's energy to its
peak and then take it all
away!

140

Isn't this wonderful,
Mika?

141
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,800
[giggling]

142
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,533
Tell me, do you think
that you'd be able to
make ten copies of this
doll for me?

143
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:02,800
Ten?! That's a lot!

144
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,533
But I'm sure I'd be able
to sell ten easily.

145
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:10,233
I'll be holding an
exhibition of my work
this Saturday. Of course,
Mika's dolls will be on

146
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,000
display, too. I hope
you'll come.

147
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,933
I'm looking forward
to it.

148
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,333
Wow, you finished that
one so quickly!

149
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,600
I don't know why, but I
feel very motivated. Now
I'm going to start the
second one!

150
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:30,933
I'm glad you're eager,
but it's bedtime! You
have school tomorrow!

00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,933
I'll be fine, mom!

152
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:37,333
Now, don't be like that.
Let's put everything
away.

153
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,500
Don't bother me!

154
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,177
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

155
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:22,110
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

156
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,777
How's Mika doing?

157
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,010
She's been making dolls
since yesterday. She
hasn't even gone to
sleep! I tried to stop

158
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,943
her, but she won't
listen.

159
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:44,110
I just don't know what to
do anymore...

160
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,410
Well, would it be all
right if I go talk to
her?

161
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:49,143
Mika? Shingo is here.

162
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,343
<i>I don't want to see him.</i>

163
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,310
But Mika! I really
need to talk to you!

164
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,710
<i>Go away!</i>

165
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:07,143
I guess Mika's still
really mad at me...

166
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,443
Shingo.

167
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:10,743
Here.

168
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:13,077
Huh? What's wrong with
you?!

169
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,443
As your kind older sister,
I can't let you stay as
depressed as this without
trying to cheer you up!

170
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:18,977
[grunting]

171
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,743
You apologized to Mika,
right?

172
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:23,043
Well... uh...

173
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,743
Oh, so that's what
happened, huh?

174
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:30,943
I've never seen Mika act
like that before. She's
always been really nice
to me!

175
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,377
Do you think I hurt her
so badly that she'll
never forgive me?

176
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,743
Cheer up. We'll fix it.

177
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:40,277
Wait, I know! Next time
you go there, bring
something nice for her.

178
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,477
Girls are big
softies for presents!

179
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,810
Yeah, thanks!

180
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:46,410
What's the matter, Usagi?

181
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:50,977
I didn't want to worry
Shingo, but something's
fishy about Mika's
behavior.

182
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,843
Usagi, you're being very
perceptive today!

183
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:58,077
Well, when it comes to my
little brother, I try to
do my absolute best,
Y'know?

184
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,377
Besides, the thought of a
"doll's curse" sounds so
interesting!

185
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,910
Wait a minute! I don't
like the sound of that!

186
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,343
But you know, it's
possible that all of this
is the work of the Dark
Kingdom, so we'd better

187
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:09,710
keep an eye on Mika.

188
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:11,810
Oh, yeah. Could be...

189
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:14,810
In that case, I say that
we just let Ami and Rei
handle it!

190
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:15,843
<i>Usagi!</i>

191
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,210
Yeah, yeah. I know.

192
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:22,143
How's it look, Luna? Can
you see anything?

193
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:25,277
No. The curtains are all
shut, so I can't see
inside.

194
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,077
According to what Shingo
said, she hasn't been
going to school for a few
days now.

195
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,143
The only clue left... is
this doll exhibition that
begins tomorrow.

196
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:46,310
Everyone likes Sailor V,
but I think Sailor Moon
is cooler! What about
you?

197
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,077
<i>Yeah, me, too!</i>

198
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:51,210
That's it! That's what my
present will be!

199
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,310
You're making a gift
for Mika?

200
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:55,243
Yeah!

201
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:58,377
Wow! It's so cute! Really
nice job, Shingo!

202
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,243
You think so?

203
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:01,410
Yeah! Who wouldn't love a
little piggy!

204
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,943
It's supposed to
be Sailor Moon!

205
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,943
Oh, yeah? I'm sure
she'll be thrilled.

206
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,810
But, really, it's the
thought that counts,
isn't it?

207
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,810
Well, she is the
messenger of love and
justice!

208
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:13,292
<i>Yeah!</i>

209
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:20,977
The dolls that this woman
makes are amazing and
cute, too! Just wait till
you see them all!

210
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,277
Oh, we're here now!

211
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,710
<i>Marvelous! This</i>
<i>exhibition is a huge</i>
<i>success.</i>

212
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,210
Thank you very much.

213
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,743
Where's Mika?

214
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:36,043
She's still in the back
room putting the final
touches on her last doll.

215
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:39,010
I almost feel bad for how
hard she's worked on all
of them!

216
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:40,377
I see.

217
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:53,810
I don't see anything out
of the ordinary so far...

218
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:57,477
Look. It's Rei!

219
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,277
Oh, yeah! It is!

220
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,143
Aw, how adorable!

221
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,443
See? Aren't they cute,
Mamoru?

222
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:04,843
[sighing]

223
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:08,343
And that one was made
by the doll maker's
daughter! Ã­^ You see that?

224
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,243
Huh?

225
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:10,110
Is something wrong?

226
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:12,943
Sorry, I don't really
follow dolls...

227
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,343
Oh, do you dislike them
or something, Mamoru?!

228
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:18,743
No, not really. I
wouldn't say that I hate
them....

229
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,143
Oh, good. Come on! Let's
keep going!

230
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,910
Uh... yay!

231
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,977
May I help you?

232
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:39,310
Sorry. I thought you were
someone else.

233
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,143
Mamoru, hurry up!

234
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:44,277
How is Mika doing,
anyway?

235
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,243
Okay...

236
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,243
Listen, Sis, I don't
think we should do this.

237
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:49,910
Don't you back
out of this!

238
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:54,343
Mika's in the back room
right now. I'm sure that
she'd love to have a
visit from you.

239
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:56,977
Oh, yeah? Come on,
let's go, Shingo!

240
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,810
Okay.

241
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,777
Huh? Usagi?

242
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:07,743
Done.

243
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,943
Mika, I brought-

244
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:23,210
Her energy has peaked!
Come forth, Jumou!

245
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:29,977
Hmmmm!

246
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,877
Ah!

247
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,443
[struggling]

248
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,210
Mika!

249
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:38,310
[struggling]

250
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:42,343
Mika! Mika, no!

251
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:45,243
[grunting]

252
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,243
[gasping]

253
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,277
Usagi! Transform!

254
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:56,943
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

255
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,943
I am the pretty
guardian...

256
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,443
...who fights for love
and for justice.

257
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:42,543
I am Sailor Moon!

258
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:46,810
How dare you go and break
the cute little doll that
Shingo made just for
Mika!

259
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:51,177
You evil monster! Don't
you realize that doll was
filled with the true
heart of its maker!

260
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,410
Even the Girls' Day dolls
are angry!

261
00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:56,110
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

262
00:18:56,777 --> 00:19:00,477
Boy, she seems super gung
ho today. I hope she's
going to be all right...

263
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,143
[screaming]

264
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,377
[trembling]

265
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:14,443
Someone, help me!

266
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,910
I should've known...

267
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,143
You can't escape!

268
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:19,343
Ah!

269
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:20,777
Sailor Moon!

270
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,143
Bubble...

271
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,677
...Spray!

272
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,043
That was close.

273
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:37,843
Sailor Moon, are you all
right?!

274
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,310
I guess we got here too
soon. Heh.

275
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:42,877
Careful, something's
coming!

276
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,277
[screeching]

277
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,010
Not this again!

278
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:53,510
Rin pyo to sha kai jin
retsu zai zen!

279
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:55,910
Evil spirit, be
exorcized!

280
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:05,110
<i>I... can't breathe!</i>

Usagi!

00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:08,210
Mmm.

284
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:09,977

Hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot!

289
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:23,277
All your attacks are
useless against me!

290
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,410
Those things are as sharp
as knives!

291
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:32,977

293
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:39,743
I'm getting an energy
reading from the
monster's right leg!

294
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,443
Sailor Moon! Target that
thing's right leg!

295
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:44,843
Moon... Tiara...

296
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,043
[coughing]
I can't do it!

297

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,243
Thanks, Tuxedo Mask!

301
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:57,143
Finish her!

302
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,110
<i>Right!</i>

303
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,877

00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,877
[gasping]
Shingo!

309
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,443
[grunting lightly]

310
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:41,243
<i>Are you two okay?</i>

311
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,910
Wow! Sailor Moon!

312
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:49,243
I took care of the monster.
Now, it's your turn to make
up and be good friends again.
So long!

313
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:53,043
Wow, Sailor Moon actually
saved us. How cool is
that?!

314
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:53,810
[gasping]

315
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:56,443
Oh, no, your present!
It's ruined!

316
00:21:56,477 --> 00:21:57,377
<i>For me?</i>

317
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,310
Listen... sorry about the
other day...

318
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:04,810
It's all right. And
besides, you did come
here to save me, after
all, Shingo.

319
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:05,843
Thank you.

320
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:11,143
Shingo, this is for
coming to help me the
other day.

321
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:17,210
Wow! Thanks! It looks
just like her! Sailor
Moon's so cool!

322
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:19,443
Oh, so you like Sailor
Moon more than me, huh?!

323
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:21,977
You've got it all wrong.

324
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,910
No, Mika! Come back!

325
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,810
What can I say?
Women love me.

326
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:14,043
Nice! Someone sent me a
love-letter!

327
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,410
<i>Okay. Who's this</i>
<i>admirer with questionable</i>
<i>taste?</i>

328
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:20,710
Who else? Tuxedo Mask!
I'm so happy!

329
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:23,410
<i>Strange, looks like Rei</i>
<i>and Ami got the same</i>
<i>letter!</i>

330
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:24,977
What?! That's a lie!!

331
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,277
<i>Who knew Tuxedo Mask was</i>
<i>such a playboy!</i>

332
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,343
Next time on Sailor Moon,
"Usagi's Joy: A Love
Letter From Tuxedo Mask"

333
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:36,743
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
