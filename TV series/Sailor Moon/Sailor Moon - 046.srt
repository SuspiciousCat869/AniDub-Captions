1
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:05,215
Thank you everyone, for
giving me the courage
to never give up.

2
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,782
Evil being!

3
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:10,148
I am Princess Serenity!

4
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:15,948
In the name of the Moon,
I will now seal you away
forever!

5
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,982
So, this is the Dark
Kingdom's lair...

6
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,882
Ami...

7
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,015
Rei...

8
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,482
Mako...

9
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:34,182
Minako...

10
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:37,415
I'll do my best
until the very end.

11
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:46,315
<i>"Usagi's Eternal Wish:</i>
<i>A Brand New Life."</i>

12
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,848
So, you're finally
here...

13
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:54,315
I will personally seek
to it that you will go
straight to hell.

14
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:57,415
Huh?

15
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:58,348
Ah!

16
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:01,815
Ahhhh!

17
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:14,382
Welcome, Princess. You
did good to get this far.

18
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:19,148
I commend you for that.

19
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,782
You're Queen Beryl?

20
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:25,382
Yes. The one and
only, in the flesh.

21
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,482
Endymion.

22
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:35,082
<i>Make yourself useful.</i>
<i>Kill the Princess.</i>

23
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,715
As you wish.

24
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:53,948
Moon Healing
Escalation!

25
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:02,882
Useless.

26
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:09,115
Even with the Silver
Crystal, you're still
inexperienced as a
princess. You won't be

27
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:13,482
able to dispel Queen
Metalia's dark energy
from within Endymion's
body.

28
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,448
(evil laughter)

29
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:19,082
Stop you futile efforts
and hand over the Silver
Crystal like a good girl.

30
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,282
(forceful grunt)

31
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:22,448
(gasp)

32
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,082
Ah!

33
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:30,215
Sailor Moon...

34
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:31,782
(gasp)

35
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:33,382
Die!

36
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:38,415
(scared screams)

37
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,982
(painful screaming)

38
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,882
(evil laughter)

39
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,382
Ahhh!

40
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,182
Mamoru...

41
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,915
<i>Hey, Bun-head.</i>

42
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:03,248
Ahhhh!

43
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:09,315
Mamoru...

44
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,182
<i>Ahhh!</i>

45
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,982
(struggling breaths)

46
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,182
Ahhhh!

47
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,448
(evil laughter)

48
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:40,048
Very soon the entire sun
will be consumed by Darkness.
And finally, Queen Metalia
will be resurrected.

49
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,115
(struggling grunts)

50
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:45,315
You can stop that
now, Endymion.

51
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,815
Cut off the
Princess's head.

52
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:52,948
Now.

53
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,748
It's no use.

54
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:09,315
Once Queen Metalia is
resurrected and back
among us. She will have
the strength to unleash

55
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:15,348
the Silver Crystal's full
power, and she will fill
this world with Dark energy
forever!

56
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:20,382
Everything you and your
friends have fought to
protect, will become
meaningless!

57
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,915
(upset gasp)

58
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:45,482
Ahhhhh!

59
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,882
(struggling breaths)

60
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:16,782
(painful grunts)

61
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:26,248
We made sure the dark
energy seeped inside
every pore of Endymion's
body.

62
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:29,348
You'll need to come
up with more than
that to defeat him.

63
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,048
(painful grunts)

64
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:33,382
Please, stop.

65
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:36,282
Sailor Moon!

66
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,015
Stop it.

67
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:39,782
Ahhhh!

68
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:41,248
Die!

69
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:43,782
Stop this now!

70
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:06,215
Please, try to
remember. It's me,
Princess Serenity.
Long ago we pledged

71
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:10,015
our love to each other.
I am Serenity of the
Moon Kingdom.

72
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:14,282
Anybody who dares to
defy the Dark Kingdom
must die!

73
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:20,915
You've been poisoned by
bad energy that's made
you cruel. But kindness
still beats in your heart.

74
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,382
(conflicted grunts)

75
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:26,448
I don't want this.
Please don't force
me to fight you.

76
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:32,182
Please.

77
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,915
What?! What is that?!

78
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,415
(painful scream)

79
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:02,248
What happened?
Who am I?

80
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:04,815
I can't remember
anything!

81
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:08,048
I'm all alone!

82
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,182
<i>No, you're not.</i>

83
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,415
I'm here for you.

84
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:16,482
Huh?

85
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,215
<i>You're not alone.</i>

86
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:21,482
I'll always be
with you.

87
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,148
(surprised gasp)

88
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:40,382
Mamoru! No!

89
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,348
Usagi...

90
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,215
(surprised gasp)

91
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:47,448
Thank you.

92
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,148
Mamoru...

93
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,815
You're back!

94
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,482
You'll pay for
this Princess!

95
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:06,448
I cannot and will not
forgive you for once
again trying to take
Endymion away from me!

96
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:09,915
(attacking yell)

97
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,048
(throwing grunt)

98
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,915
(painful grunt)

99
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,282
Mamoru!

100
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,482
(painful whimpers)

101
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,315
Endymion!

102
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:28,015
Why must you protect
that little girl? If you
had chosen me, you'd now
be ruling as king of both

103
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:29,982
the Moon and the Earth!

104
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,915
What's happening?!

105
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,015
Mamoru! Don't die!

106
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:42,048
Why? Why is his rose
able to defeat me?

107
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:43,448
(painful grunt)

108
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:46,048
Is it his energy?

109
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:52,148
Is the power of Endymion's
love for that girl so strong
that it could destroy my
whole body?

110
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,148
(painful grunt)

111
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:54,848
I refuse...

112
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,748
I refuse to
believe that.

113
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:01,882
Please wake up.
Mamoru...

114
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:06,215
Leave now. Get out
of here quickly.

115
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,182
Huh?

116
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:11,815
Go back to being an
ordinary girl without
any worries.

117
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:14,315
Find yourself a
really cool boyfriend.

118
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:18,282
Nobody's cooler
than you, Mamoru.

119
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,415
(gasp)

120
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,148
Mamoru?

121
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,082
Mamoru!

122
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:38,482
(crying)

123
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:47,382
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

124
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,339
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

125
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:10,906
(painful grunt)

126
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:16,639
Queen Metalia, I beg
of you, please grant
me your energy...

127
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:23,706
...with enough power to
crush that despicable girl!
Please Queen Metalia,
I will do anything!

128
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,273
As you wish...

129
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:35,073
The time has come to
instill hatred and greed
into all living creatures
in the universe.

130
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:44,006
Queen Beryl! Eliminate
all beings who attempt to
resist, and turn the world
into complete darkness!

131
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,773
Ah!

132
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:54,139
(painful screams)

133
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,006
I'm sorry, but I
can't kiss you.

134
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:16,106
Rei, Ami, Mako, Minako,
all of them died without
having a chance to kiss
the boys they liked.

135
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,206
Right now, nothing would
make me happier than
kissing you, but I can't

136
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,406
I'm sorry, Mamoru.

137
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,739
But I'm not going to
run away. I still have
something left to do.

138
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:34,739
Watch over me.
I'll do my best.

139
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:08,739
(evil chuckle)

140
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,573
At long last, all the
dark energy is mine!

141
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,039
I will now rule
the entire world!

142
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:18,539
(evil laugh)

143
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:29,139
You'e here, you
little irritant.

144
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,173
(chuckle)

145
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,706
I'll finish you
off, this time.

146
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:38,406
(attacking growl)

147
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,406
Princess!

148
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,273
Die!

149
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:55,106
(shocked gasp)

150
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:19,373
This is it. The
world is coming
to an end.

151
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:23,106
Queen Metalia's Dark
energy has been
unleashed upon us!

152
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,406
Wait! Luna!

153
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,473
Out of my way! I
have to go to the
D-Point now!

154
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:33,206
What for? It won't do
any good! There's nothing
more we're able to do!

155
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:36,073
Don't you think I
know that already?

156
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:42,139
But if we don't somehow
stop Usagi. She's going
to release the power
of the Silver Crystal!

157
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:47,106
And if she does that,
you know she'll die!
Like the way Queen
Serenity did!

158
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,139
I know that! But there's
no other way left to
save the world now!

159
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:54,539
Don't do it, Usagi!

160
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:58,373
You must not release
the power of the Silver
Crystal!

161
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:02,706
If you do, you'll
be gone forever!

162
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,306
(attacking yell)

163
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,173
Moon Healing!

164
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,039
(attacking grunt)

165
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:37,306
Escalation!

166
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,706
(angry yell)

167
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,406
(powerful grunt)

168
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:56,773
Tell me, why are you
so determined to
defeat me?

169
00:16:56,806 --> 00:17:02,106
You dream of a lovely
future that will never
come to pass. One day,
you will realize that

170
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,073
this world is already
filled of ugliness and
filth!

171
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:09,339
You're wrong. I
believe in it! I
have faith!

172
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:14,306
Faith in what?
Everlasting love?
Indestructible
friendships?!

173
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,773
(amused laugh)

174
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:18,773
All of it! I believe
in this world...

175
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,506
...and the Guardians
who fought for it.

176
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:26,406
You're a fool! There's
nothing worthwhile in
this putrid world for
anyone to believe in!

177
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,239
(attacking roar)

178
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,039
(struggling grunts)

179
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,206
Silver Crystal!

180
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:48,139
Please give me strength!

181
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:54,606
I need everyone's
combined faith in love
to fight for the world
we believe in!

182
00:17:56,273 --> 00:18:00,139
Love is no laughing
matter, but you get a
happy feeling from it.

183
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,073
(giggle)

184
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:06,606
Stop saying I'm in
love with him! I just
feel bad for Yuichiro
and that's all.

185
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:12,006
So what if he already
has a girlfriend? I
think it's worth
giving it a shot!

186
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:17,373
It's all right. All
that matters is that
Alan and Katarina are
happy.

187
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:21,139
My friends...

188
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:25,406
I won't be sealed
away by the Silver
Crystal, now that all
the Dark energy's mine!

189
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,306
(forceful grunt)

190
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:35,106
Everyone, give me
all your strength!
Please!

191
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,339
Right now!

192
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:51,639
Mercury Power!

193
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,506
Mars Power!

194
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,106
Jupiter Power!

195
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:56,773
Venus Power!

196
00:18:56,806 --> 00:19:01,106
Moon <i>Prism Power!</i>

197
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:05,806
(gasp)

198
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,306
What's that?!

199
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:08,506
(painful scream)

200
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:15,473
(horrified gasp)

201
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,573
Ahhhh!

202
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:26,706
Thank you, everyone.

203
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:49,506
When I wake up in the
morning, I feel the breeze
as it rustles the white
curtains in my bedroom.

204
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:56,706
My cuckoo clock tells
me it's seven a.m. Then
I hear my mom say, "C'mon
sleepy head, time to get

205
00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:03,306
up or you'll be late!"
But it's so hard to wake
up. So I think to myself,
"Just three more minutes

206
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,039
and I'll get out of bed."

207
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,706
Of course, I'm late
for school every day.
Ms. Haruna makes me
stand out in the hall.

208
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,539
And all my tests are
covered with red marks.

209
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:19,406
On our way home from
school, we all stop for
some crepes, then go
check out the party dress

210
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,673
on display in the
store window.

211
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:27,439
It's those simple things
that made my life so
happy and fun.

212
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,773
I wish...

213
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,606
...I wish I could
go back...

214
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,106
...to being just
a normal girl.

215
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,039
Ahhhh!

216
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,573
<i>(screaming)</i>

217
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:54,573
I'm going to be
late again!

218
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:57,006
Bye!

219
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,339
<i>It's a miracle!</i>

220
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:10,406
Not only did the dark
spots on the sun disappear,
but all of the girls have
been reincarnated.

221
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,606
It's sad.

222
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:19,306
I feel sorry for them.
Every single memory they
had of being together is
completely gone now.

223
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,006
That's okay.

224
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,273
Hm?

225
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,439
They always have the
chance to become
good friends again.

226
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:28,673
You're right!

227
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,506
(whining)

228
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:41,639
I guess I should
have studied a
little bit more.

229
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:45,273
<i>Oh I hate you,</i>
<i>you stupid test!</i>

230
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,039
Watch where you're
throwin' things,
Bunhead.

231
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,073
Thirty percent?

232
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,606
Looks to me like you'd
better study harder next
time, Bunhead.

233
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:54,773
How rude!

234
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:00,506
Jerk in his purple
pleated pants!

235
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:01,773
What a strange kid.

236
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,173
(chuckle)

237
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:07,406
Admit it. He's cool!
And pretty good
looking, to boot.

238
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,073
No way! He's just
a stuck-up jerk!

239
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:15,173
That's what you say
now, but how knows? You
might've just met your
soul-mate back there.

240
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:20,473
Ugh! Give me a break!
I know exactly what my
dream guy will look like!

241
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,939
You have a dream guy?

242
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:27,639
<i>Yep! In my dream he always</i>
<i>comes to my rescue. And</i>
<i>although I don't know what</i>
<i>he looks like yet, I know</i>

243
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:31,073
<i>nobody in the world</i>
<i>is cooler than he is.</i>

244
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:15,585
Sailor Moon is all
pumped up as we go
into a new story arc!

245
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:20,151
<i>We finally return to</i>
<i>our peaceful lives, when</i>
<i>powerful new enemies</i>
<i>suddenly appear!</i>

246
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,351
Seriously?

247
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:23,351
<i>It'll be full of thrills,</i>
<i>and full of laughs.</i>

248
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:25,485
Guess we'll just have to
go as far as we can go!

249
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:27,618
<i>In your case, you've</i>
<i>gone too far already!</i>

250
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:33,251
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon R:</i>
<i>"Moon Returns: The</i>
<i>Mysterious Aliens Appear."</i>

251
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:36,085
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
