1
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,133
What?! Really?! We
interrupt this narration
to inform you that Rei's
grandpa has turned into

2
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:07,533
a full-blown monster!
Wait! Does that mean
Rei will become a
monster, too?

3
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:13,066
To those fiends who
turned my dear friend
Rei and her kind grandpa
into monsters, I say this!

4
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,233
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish you.

5
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,066
Hey! I'm Usagi Tsukino!
You know me as the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice.

6
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,133
I am Sailor Moon!
This job's not
easy by the way...

7
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:33,066
We have to find and
protect the Legendary
Silver Crystal before
the bad guys get it.

8
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,866
But in order to do that,
we need to find the seven
Rainbow Crystals and the
people holding them!

9
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,000
Pretty crazy, huh?
But now there are four
of us Sailor Guardians,
so I think everything's

10
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,933
gonna work out
just fine!

11
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:46,900
(giggles)

12
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,033
<i>"Grandpa Loses Control:</i>
<i>Rei in Danger."</i>

13
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,266
Ahh... What a
lovely moon...

14
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:18,100
On a night like this,
some dumplings and a
glass of sake would
sure taste great!

15
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,500
Huh?

16
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,900
Who are you!

17
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,800
Zoi!

18
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,033
Hnh? I sense evil!

19
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:39,366
Ha ha! Just as I
suspected, this old
man's one of the
Seven Great Monsters.

20
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,766
(painful screaming)

21
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:51,866
And now old man,
allow me to remove
that Rainbow Crystal
from your body...

22
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,866
(painful screaming)

23
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,933
Evil spirit!

24
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,333
(giggle)

25
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:02,366
Now it's time!
Return to life,
Jiji!

26
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,533
(resisting grunts)

27
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,166
Ahhhh!

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,033
Ahh! Damn you!

29
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,800
I thought you were
nothing more than a
weak old man, but
you're good!

30
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,133
Zoi!

31
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:16,900
(screaming)

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Ahhh!

33
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,066
Huh?!

34
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,466
Huh?! Hey! Get away
from me, you foul
crows!

35
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,133
<i>Grandpa!</i>

36
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:31,733
Phobos! Deimos!

37
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,800
Are you okay
Grandpa? What
happened to you?!

38
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,366
(yawning)

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,266
What was that noise?

40
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,233
<i>Who's there?</i>

41
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,200
Huh?

42
00:04:53,133 --> 00:05:00,733
Hi! My name's Yuichiro
Kumada and I beg of you!
I have one request. Make
me your apprentice!

43
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,300
Huh?

44
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:11,000
The Rainbow Crystal
inside the old man
has already begun
to awaken...

45
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:14,766
That Rainbow Crystal
of yours will be mine
before you know it!

46
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
(evil laugh)

47
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:24,766
So wait, you mean
your grandpa's been
acting even weirder
than he normally does?

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,100
Yeah that's
for sure...

49
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,366
Ahhh! Hah!

50
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,766
(screaming)

51
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,833
Ha! Ha ha ha!

52
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,133
Okay Yuichiro!
Your turn!

53
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,333
(nervous moans)

54
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:46,733
But why do I have
to do these things?!

55
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,400
It's training
stuff!

56
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,366
Uh, okay...

57
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,700
Ahhhh!

58
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,800
(nervous screams)

59
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,766
Is this how I'm
going to spend
my youth? Oh boy!

60
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,366
(gasp)

61
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,133
C'mon now. This
isn't nap time.

62
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,933
Grandpa, what's
going on here?

63
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:14,933
(giggling)

64
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,933
That green cape
sure looks cute
on you!

65
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,300
Are you listening
to me?

66
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,066
You out of shape
wimp! You're an
embarrassment to
you master and to

67
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,966
this shrine!

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,266
Who is he?

69
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,800
That's Yuichiro
Kumada, he's training
as Grandpa's apprentice.

70
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,066
Ohhh...

71
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,033
Are you all
right Yuichiro?

72
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,333
Hi Rei, boy do you
look great in your
school uniform...

73
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,900
You must've hit
your head.

74
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,100
Does his training
have to be so
brutal?!

75
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,800
Don't question my
methods! Training's
always strenuous. It
has to be tough!

76
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,933
Going soft on
him won't work!

77
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,633
How else can he
prove he's got
real guts?!

78
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,266
Huh?!

79
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,333
What am I going
to do? You, my
granddaughter, are
the only one who

80
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,666
can take over
this shrine. I'm
all alone here!

81
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:09,833
See? Poor Grandpa's
been an emotional
wreck about everything
lately...

82
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,133
He's only crying
'cause he needs my
help! So even though
his training's tough,

83
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,566
I will step up!

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,866
Please give me
more strength! I am
committed to endure
every challenge!

85
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:22,700
<i>Ahh!</i>

86
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,133
Huh?!

87
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,933
Wha-ha-ha! Gotcha!
You fell for my
crying act hook,
line and sinker!

88
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:28,766
Wha-ha-ha!

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
That's not funny!

90
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,100
(laughing)

91
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,266
Usagi, stop!

92
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,833
Isn't this
a hoot!

93
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,866
Yeah Gramps, you
sure nailed him!

94
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,766
You're the only
one who gets my
jokes, Usagi!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

95
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,666
(laughing)

96
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,066
Grandpa! This has
gone on long enough!

97
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,233
Ha-ha-ha...

98
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,066
Excuse me...

99
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,800
But if it's me
you're worried
about...

100
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,700
You need to keep
quiet, mister!

101
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,533
But I just
thought...

102
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:50,300
I said quiet!

103
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,000
Right!

104
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,233
You and your stupid
whacked out jokes
are going to totally
wreck the great

105
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,733
reputation that this
shrine has built in
the community!

106
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:00,600
Now, now, stop being
such a stick in the
mud about this. I mean
we all gotta have a

107
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:01,833
little fun sometimes.

108
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,133
Yeah! What
she said!

109
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,666
Usagi! This is our
shrine's problem
not yours. So stay
out of our business!

110
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,633
Wahh! Why is
Rei being so
mean to me?!

111
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,700
Usagi, you can't
go crying over
every little thing
that happens...

112
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,300
But why shouldn't I?

113
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,266
But come on Rei, you
really didn't have to
shove her to make your
point, did you?

114
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,700
Hmph!

115
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,000
Well now!
Fine!

116
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,233
If you're going to
act like that Rei,
I'd be better off
going to cram school

117
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:31,233
to study. Bye!

118
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:34,666
And I'm gonna go
practice my kung
fu. See ya!

119
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:39,933
That's just great!
I've got a problem
and you two just run
off. Fine! Goodbye!

120
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,033
Excuse me, Rei?

121
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:41,933
You shut up!

122
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:42,800
Right!

123
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,600
(disappointed sigh)

124
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,233
So what did you
want to talk about?

125
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,566
It's about my
master...

126
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,933
Oh c'mon, it's not
like my Grandpa's
really your master.

127
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,066
In autumn, a person's
feelings can change
quickly...

128
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
Huh?

129
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:04,133
It's a season when
the biorhythms of
the mind and body can
become easily disturbed.

130
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,666
<i>What is it your</i>
<i>trying to say?</i>

131
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,733
I think that when
the sunnier days of
spring return, then
Master will become

132
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,200
rational and
calm again...

133
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:15,000
But for now, maybe
we should keep a
close eye on him for
a while to see how

134
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,466
he's coming along.

135
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,600
(giggles)

136
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,200
What's so funny?

137
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:23,966
You're so sweet.
And you're actually
a lot smarter than
you look, Yuichiro!

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,700
Huh?!

139
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:29,733
Girls are confusing,
aren't we? We call
ourselves friends, but
sometimes when things

140
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,800
get too tough. We
tend to check out.

141
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:37,666
Aww! Looks like
Rei really likes
Yuichiro...

142
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,833
Great! I know what
I'll do! I Usagi,
will act as their
Cupid!

143
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:45,866
Usagi, do you honestly
think Rei would want
you butting into her
business?

144
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,866
Are you kidding me,
Luna? Me doing this
is my big chance to
make up with her!

145
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,566
(excited giggle)

146
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,100
There she goes
overreacting
as usual...

147
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,533
Ta-da!

148
00:09:57,066 --> 00:10:00,766
Wha?! Usagi! You
can't be using the
Transformation Pen for
something like this!

149
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,700
Moon Power! Turn
me into a fortune-
teller of love!

150
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,800
All right! This
should do the trick!

151
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,600
There goes trouble!

152
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,466
<i>Hello!</i>

153
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Prepare as I will
now predict your
future! Hmh!

154
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:33,700
Now listen, I am
the famous wandering
fortune-teller for
love and for lovers.

155
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,700
Huh?!

156
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,933
<i>I will now tell</i>
<i>you your fortune!</i>

157
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:37,866
Huh?!

158
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,100
Ahhh...

159
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,000
Haah!

160
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,466
Huh?

161
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,066
(embarrassed moan)

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,066
Hah!

163
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Whoo!

164
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,566
Ee-yow!

165
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:56,633
The sticks have
spoken to me. If
you two choose to
kiss right here

166
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,966
and now, your
love will come
true!

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh no!

168
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,900
Kuh-Kuh-Kiss?!

169
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,966
This is stupid!
C'mon let's go!

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,300
But I thought-
It didn't work.

171
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:15,100
What was that
about, Usagi?!

172
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,633
Nothing, you
knew it was me?

173
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,800
You know I already
have Mamoru as my
guy, so what are you
trying to pull here?

174
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,966
Stop messing with
my life. You're not
my friend anymore!

175
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,466
Not you're
friend?

176
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,733
It's not like
I didn't try
to warn you!

177
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,400
Hmph!

178
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:45,033
Now I've gone and
made Rei even madder
than she was before...

179
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:49,800
Don't beat yourself
up, Rei may get angry
quickly, but she also
forgets quickly, too.

180
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,633
I'll bet by tomorrow
the two of you will
be friends again.

181
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,566
She doesn't wanna
be friends anymore.

182
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,366
That's just because you
were acting pretty weird.
She blurted that out
without thinking!

183
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,966
Good grief, c'mon!

184
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,433
These daifuku rice
cakes are so
delicious!

185
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,366
How can you eat at
a time like this?

186
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,966
'Cause they're
really good! Mmm!

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,566
Mmmm...

188
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,466
Hey! This daifuku
is delicious!

189
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:18,900
See?

190
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:25,600
Oh yeah! I know!
I'll take all
these rice cakes
over to Rei!

191
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:30,266
I'll use these yummy
daifuku as a peace
offering so I can make
up with Rei!

192
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:31,400
(pleased giggle)

193
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,066
What a good idea!

194
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,800
You think so?
Seeing her now
could just make
her mad again.

195
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,533
She'll be fine
with it, really!
She likes food!

196
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,633
Don't go!
You're making
a big mistake!

197
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,666
Once she locks onto
an idea, you can never
change that girl's mind.

198
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,833
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

199
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,599
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

200
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,266
Ready! Set!

201
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,666
Go!

202
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,233
Training!
Train!
Train!

203
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:20,299
For you Rei!
I'll do my
very best!

204
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,499
(giggles)

205
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,633
You're so sweet.

206
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,633
(nervous laughter)

207
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:38,198
Ahhhh! This
is training!

208
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:44,765
So Phobos, Deimos.
What do you think
about all this?

209
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:48,098
Do you believe
Grandpa's strange
behavior could
really be caused

210
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:51,098
just by the change
of season?

211
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:58,165
(spirit chanting)

212
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,998
I see that you're
back, you evil
spirit!

213
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:06,065
Tonight I'll take
that Rainbow Crystal
from you!

214
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,832
<i>Zoi!</i>

215
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:14,332
(gasp)

216
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:16,232
An evil presence!

217
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:18,632
(attack scream)

218
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:24,632
Zoi!

219
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,865
(trembling yell)

220
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:30,265
Give up, old man!

221
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:33,932
(painful scream)

222
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:39,832
That Rainbow
Crystal is
mine now!

223
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,032
(annoyed grunt)

224
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:51,898
You again!
Tuxedo Mask!

225
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,065
I'll be taking
that crystal.

226
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:58,198
Attack him now!
Get Tuxedo Mask!

227
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,532
(painful groans)

228
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:07,932
Oh no!

229
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,865
Jiji!

230
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:13,898
Jiji!

231
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,965
(giggling)

232
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,932
Tuxedo Mask!

233
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:24,265
Jiji is sure to
make short work
of you! Attack!

234
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,798
Jiji!

235
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:29,532
Zoisite you coward!
Why don't you fight
me yourself?!

236
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,932
(giggling)

237
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,632
Jiji!

238
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,798
It's a-! A monster!

239
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,065
Jiji!

240
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:42,632
(scared screams)

241
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,198
Jiji!

242
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:47,698
Damn! I lost him!

<i>Crystal. Good night.</i>

246
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,132
Rei! There's a
monster at the
shrine! Ahhh!

247
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,465
Ah! No, don't
look!

248
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:03,965
Right! I saw! Oh!
But this is not
the time to worry
about that.

249
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:05,132
Well I'm worried!

250
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,165
You have to get
out of here quickly!

251
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:09,665
Jiji...

252
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:11,832
Jiji!

253
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:12,965
What's wrong?!

254
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:14,665
Ah! A monster!

255
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:15,432
Jiji!

But Yuichiro!

263
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:36,898

Get away!

00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,432
Yuichiro!

did this happen

Jiji!

Grandpa!

284
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,732
You've gotta snap
out of it! It's
me, your dear
granddaughter, Rei!

285
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,132
You remember,
don't you?!

286
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:36,865
Jiji!

287
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:40,098
I know you're being
possessed by something.
Because if any of your
kind heart were still

288
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:44,032
in there, you wouldn't
be so evil and keep
attacking me like you
are right now!

289
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,865
Ji-Jiji?

290
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,798
Can you hear me?

291
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:52,065
Jiji!

292
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,932
Wha!! Well that
didn't work!

293

Jiji!

294
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,498
You stop that!

295
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:04,665
If you think I'm
gonna let you pick
on my dear friend
Rei, you've got

296
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,098
another thing
coming!

297
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:10,765
Moon Prism Power!
Make Up!

298
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:44,498
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights
for love and for
justice!

299
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,432
I am Sailor Moon!

300
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:50,965
And now, in the
name of the moon,
I'll punish you!

301
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:52,665
Jiji...

302
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,565
You really saved
me, thank you.

303
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:57,698
My pleasure! By
the way, have you
had one of these
daifuku? They're

304
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,032
just really
delicious,
you'll love it!

305
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,498
Huh?

306
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:03,965
Have you completely
lost it?! This is
not the time to be
eating daifuku!

307
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:07,432
Oh, you're right.
Okay, now!

308
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:11,432
Wait, hold it!
somewhere inside
that evil creature
is my Grandpa!

309
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,765
Huh?! Really?!

310
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:16,498
That monster's
your Grandpa?!

311
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:21,665
I get it! He was
acting strange because
these changes were
already underway!

312
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:22,865
Jiji!

313
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:25,765
(scared screaming)

314
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,298
Jiji!

315
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,232
Ahhh!

316
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:32,532
Ahhh!

317
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:36,998
If that scary monster
is Rei's Grandpa, we
have a problem!

318
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:41,265
Rei, use you talisman!
It'll stop that monster
from chasing us!

319
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:41,932
Jiji!

320
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,765
Right! That will
wake him up!

321
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,365
Evil spirit!
Be exorcized!

322
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:49,798
Jiji!

323
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,332
Sailor Moon,
do it! Quickly!

324
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:56,665
Jiji!!

325
00:19:56,698 --> 00:20:00,365
Okay Gramps, turn
back into a good
guy!

326
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:06,332
Moon Healing
Escalation!

327
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,298
Jiji!

328
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,965
Refresh!

329
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:17,598
Ahhhh...

330
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:19,232
Oh, Grandpa!

331
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:25,232
So it worked...

332
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,598
Yeah...

333
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,498
Oh...
Mako!

334
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:33,532
Hey, Ami! So where
are you off to?

335
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,532
I just can't stop
thinking about the
fight that Rei had
with Usagi. I was

336
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:40,865
hoping we could
talk Rei into
forgiving her and
being friends again.

337
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,932
You know, I thought
the same thing.

338
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,932
Great! Then we've
gotta help them.

339
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:48,598
Once there's a
problem, friendships
between girls can
crack and fall apart

340
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:52,898
quick. So I think the
sooner we get those
two seeing eye to eye
again, the better.

341
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,032
Um-hm!

342
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:01,232
Boy! You're right,
these daifuku are
tasty!

343
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:02,632
I told you!

344
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:05,932
By the way, where
did that strange
monster end up
going anyway?

345
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,098
What strange
monster?

346
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,865
Oh c'mon! You mean
you don't remember
what you did to-

347
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:14,365
Ha-ha-ha! Monster?
What monster? There
are no monsters here
right, Usagi?

348
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:18,798
Yuichiro, you must've
just had a bad dream
or something about
monsters!

349
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:19,932
Yeah! A bad
dream!

350
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:23,498
You think so? It
sure didn't feel
like a dream to me.

351
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:26,732
Oh well, whatever!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

352
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,165
Hey Yuichiro...

353
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,065
Huh?

354
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:34,565
You might seem like
a big blockhead, but
inside, you're a guy
who's really very kind

355
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:35,565
and brave!

356
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:36,398
Hah!

357
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:43,198
Ahh! Now I feel
alive with youth and
all it's wonder!

358
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:44,732
Ha-ha-ha!

359
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,798
Rei's in love with
Yuichiro! Aren't
you, you sly little
minx?

360
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:51,465
Huh?! Don't be
silly! I'm not in
love with him! It's
just that Grandpa's

361
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:54,198
always telling him
off, so I kinda just
felt bad for him!

362
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,565
Sure you do!

363
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,065
You've got it
all wrong!

364
00:21:57,098 --> 00:22:00,698
Rei! I'm not going
to let you marry
Yuichiro! You'll
have to tell him no!

365
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:01,765
Huh?

366
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,632
Marry him Rei!
Marry him!

367
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:04,832
Hey! Stop
saying that!

368
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,332
The two of us
married!?!

369
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,098
It will never
happen!

370
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:09,665
I'll show you!

371
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:10,532
Oh no!

372
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:11,665
What the- ?

373
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:21,332
(yelling at each other)

374
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:25,398
I guess this must
mean Rei and Usagi
made up and are
friends again.

375
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:27,798
It's good they
settled things so
peacefully.

376
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:15,532
I saw everything, Luna!
You were on a date with
you boyfriend yesterday,
weren't you?!

377
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:17,365
<i>Huh?! No way!</i>
<i>I'm single!</i>

378
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,165
Well, we do have
a witness...

379
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:20,698
<i>You've got it</i>
<i>all wrong!</i>

380
00:24:20,732 --> 00:24:24,098
Oh c'mon! There must
be at least a couple
cats ready to purpose
to you, right?

381
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:28,098
<i>Well, I'm actually</i>
<i>pretty popular with</i>
<i>the guys, which can be</i>
<i>a bit of a problem!</i>

382
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,632
Psh! Stupid cat...

383
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:34,665
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon,</i>
<i>"Loved and Chased:</i>
<i>Luna's Worst Day Ever."</i>

384
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,398
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
