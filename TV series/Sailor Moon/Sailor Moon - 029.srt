1
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,700
What?! Motoki has
a girlfriend?!

2
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:04,500
Back off, Zoisite!
Anyone who gets in
the way of love
deserves to be

3
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,633
stomped into the
ground by a horse!

4
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,100
Oh, you have nothing
to do with it?
Well, I don't care!

5
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,400
Sailor Moon is
looking for a
boyfriend!

6
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,166
Hey! I'm Usagi
Tsukino!

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
You know me as the
Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and
for justice!

8
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,800
I am Sailor Moon!

9
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:31,200
This job's not easy
by the way. We have
to find and protect
the Legendary Silver

10
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,166
Crystal before the
bad guys get it.
But in order to do
that, we need to

11
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,733
find the seven
Rainbow Crystals
and the people
holding them.

12
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:43,266
Pretty crazy, huh?
But now there are
four of us Sailor
Guardians, so I think

13
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,600
everything's gonna
work out just fine.

14
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:46,600
(giggles)

15
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:55,166
<i>Total Chaos: The</i>
<i>Messy Love Rectangle.</i>

16
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,733
For today, there's
only a ten percent
chance of rain in
the forecast.

17
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,833
Oh brother!

18
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:12,700
You can never
trust those
weather
forecasters!

19
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,100
I'd certainly call
this more than a
ten percent chance
of rain!

20
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,666
Darn it! Why don't
you watch where
you're going?!

21
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,733
Sorry...

22
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,733
If sorry resolved
things, we wouldn't
need police!

23
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,200
That voice...

24
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,733
Is that you,
Motoki?

25
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,533
Here, let me
help you up.

26
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,000
Thanks...

27
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:40,300
I'm sorry about that.
I had a lot of things
on my mind. I wasn't
watching.

28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,100
You don't have an
umbrella. You're
going to get soaking
wet in this downpour.

29
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,033
Why not share mine
until it lets up?

30
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:50,366
<i>His voice just</i>
<i>reminds me so much</i>
<i>of my former love.</i>
<i>Oh, if only we can</i>

31
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,566
<i>stay like this</i>
<i>forever!</i>

32
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,733
Mako?

33
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,466
Huh?

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,566
Let's go.

35
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Oh.. Uh...
Yeah!

36
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,266
I heard you're
a fabulous cook.
Is that true?

37
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,600
I guess...

38
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,133
That's cool. One
of these days
you'll have to make
me something.

39
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,533
I'd love to,
anytime!

40
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,133
I could clean your
place too! I'm
really good at it!

41
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,666
That would be
a huge help!

42
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,300
Here! Write down
your address and
phone number, and
list your favorite

43
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,366
foods as well!

44
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,333
Done. Mako,
you sure are
interesting.

45
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,000
(giggle)

46
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,166
Yeah, I get
that a lot.

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,700
Ah, I see hayashi
rice is your
favorite.

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,733
I wish the rain
hadn't stopped.

49
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:32,600
Huh?

50
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,400
(nervous laugh)

51
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:38,033
Sorry, Mako. I
have to drop by
the school for a
little while.

52
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,533
Sure, no
problem...

53
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,733
But I'm gonna come
over to your place
this Sunday and make
hayashi rice for you!

54
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,433
Gotta go!
Buh-Bye!

55
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,200
Uhh...

56
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,500
<i>Looks like you and</i>
<i>that cute girl are</i>
<i>quite friendly.</i>

57
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,600
Reika!

58
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,433
Mamoru was talking
about somebody having
a new girlfriend. I
guess he meant you.

59
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,133
Oh! Give me
a break.

60
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:57,633
(chuckle)

61
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,233
I'm just kidding.

62
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,700
I know. So, seeing
how you're dressed,
it appears you're
about to cancel

63
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,033
our date again.

64
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,533
I'm so sorry. I'm
going to be working
really late.

65
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:10,400
No worries. But
more importantly,
have you reached a
decision yet?

66
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,000
No, I'm still
working on it.

67
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,533
Take your time.
It's going to
affect the rest
of you're life,

68
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,933
so you want to
make sure you've
made the right
decision.

69
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,533
You're so sweet.

70
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,566
Thank you.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
(gasp)

72
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,600
<i>Hey you two!</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

73
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh, Mamoru! We
didn't see you
there!

74
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,366
(chuckle)

75
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:36,433
Sorry, gotta run!
Mamoru, can you do me
a favor and take my guy
out for some coffee?

76
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,466
I'll call you
later!

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,566
(sigh)

78
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,366
Something's
bothering you.
What's up?

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,933
It's Reika...

80
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:49,600
There's a possibility
she'll be going to
Africa to pursue her
research study.

81
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:53,066
Africa? What
kind of research
would require her
to move there?

82
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,133
It's pretty impressive
stuff! She's going to
be exploring the area
where all life on

83
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,400
earth supposedly
originated.

84
00:05:58,433 --> 00:05:59,433
So now what's
the plan?

85
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,166
Not sure. She
can't make up
her mind yet.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,966
I'm not talking
about her. What
do you want?!

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,566
Well, I want to tell
her to stay here with
me. But, I just can't
be that selfish and

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,933
get in the way
of her future.

89
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,566
That's so
like you.

90
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:16,533
Hey, by the way,
are you a big fan
of hayashi rice?

91
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,100
Sure, why do
you ask?

92
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:21,466
Because Mako said
she was gonna come
over to my place on
Sunday to make a

93
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,200
whole batch of it.
Why don't you come
by for a taste?

94
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:28,600
Mako? But she's
Usagi's friend.
I'm sure you're
aware that Usagi

95
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,066
has eyes for
you. Right?

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,433
Sure, but both
of them are
pretty cute.

97
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:36,066
But a minute ago
we were talking
about Reika. I got
the impression

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,200
you were hung
up on her.

99
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,333
I'm not about to
hook up with a
middle-school girl.

100
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,866
Hi there, sweetie!

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,300
They're cute but
you've got me all
wrong. I think of
Mako and Usagi as

102
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,866
being little
sisters to me.

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,466
Little
Sisters,
huh?

104
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,166
<i>Oh, brother!</i>
<i>Motoki is in for</i>
<i>a rude awakening!</i>

105
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,033
(chuckle)

106
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,933
<i>Who's there?</i>

107
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:07,233
Hey, good morning,
Motoki! It's Makoto
Kino. I'm here!

108
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,566
Just a-
Just a minute!

109
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,466
Hey Mako, what
brings you here?

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,366
Stand clear,
I'm coming in!

111
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,033
Uh, the place
is a mess.

112
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:22,866
No problem! <i>Guys</i>
don't clean up
a lot. Or in your
case... not at all.

113
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,900
And this is
pretty bad.

114
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,033
(attack yell)

115
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,100
Let's do this!

116
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,100
Huh?! Let's do
what now?

117
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,866
You know what!
Clean up this big
mess, of course!

118
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,166
Now, if I don't
do this in thirty
minutes, I'll be
late for school.

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
So, let's go!

120
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,300
Who's this girl
with you?

121
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh her? Well,
that's Reika.

122
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,366
I'm guessing she's
not your sister.

123
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,300
<i>No...</i>

124
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,166
Ah! She must be
your girlfriend,
right?

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Uh...
Yeah...

126
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,266
Ahhhhh!

127
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:12,800
It's unusual to
see you looking
so sad, Mako.

128
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,333
What's going on?
A depressed face
will give you
wrinkles!

129
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,300
Ha! Ha! Someone
broke your heart
again. Am I
right?

130
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,133
You picked the wrong
day to mess with me.

131
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,033
It was just
a joke.

132
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,333
Don't stress out.
Think of me as your
personal Cupid. I'm
here to fix it and

133
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,766
make it right!

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I think it would
be a better idea
to work on your own
love issues first.

135
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,966
Luna!

136
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,400
Still maybe I can
help. Tell me the
name of the person
who broke your heart.

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,900
Motoki...

138
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,166
Ahhhh!

139
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,733
Do you really have
to be so shocked?

140
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:51,266
Yes, of course I
do. I can't believe
it. This is so
upsetting.

141
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,700
Because I'm...
I'm in love with
Motoki too!

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
What?! You
like him too?

143
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,466
How could you
do this? How
could you?!

144
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,733
But, I thought you
were in love with
Tuxedo Mask?

145
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:07,800
Yes, I love him
too! I've fallen in
love with them both!

146
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,400
Well, you have
to choose one!

147
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:13,366
Both of you stop and
think about it for a
moment. The guy gets
to choose too, it's

148
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,700
not a one-way
street.

149
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:15,433
<i>Aha!</i>

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh boy, now
what?

151
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:21,433
If Mako had her heart
broken by Motoki,
that can really only
mean one thing.

152
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:24,666
Motoki has chosen
someone else to be
his girlfriend!

153
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,800
And that someone he
has chosen must be...

154
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
...cute
little me!

155
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,766
Wrong! It's
someone named
Reika.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
What?! How can
that be?!

157
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,733
I can't take
it anymore...

158
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:39,733
<i>Don't give up</i>
<i>so easily!</i>

159
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,700
So what if he already
has a girlfriend. Even
if we get rejected, it's
worth giving it a shot.

160
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,166
But Mako...

161
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,266
Crying isn't going
to get you anywhere.

162
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,366
You're right! We're
Pretty Guardians
after all!

163
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,266
And if we don't
fight...

164
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,733
There's no
tomorrow!

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,133
Why do I get the
feeling there's no
tomorrow, no matter
what?

166
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:03,300
Let's do this!

167
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,866
And whoever wins,
no hard feelings,
right?

168
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
Yeah!

169
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,700
So, let's decide the
order of who goes
first by height.

170
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:12,200
This isn't exactly
gym class, you know!

171
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,200
Hey! What are you
girls up to.

172
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,933
Something we don't
need you for!

173
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:20,866
Bun-head and Bigfoot
together. Let me guess,
you're here to confess
you're love to Motoki.

174
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,300
Forget about him.
I'm saying this
for your own good.

175
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,933
What we're doing here
happens to be none
of your business!

176
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,566
Yeah, get lost!

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm telling you the
truth. Motoki only
thinks of you as cute
little sisters to him

178
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,866
and really nothing
more than that.

179
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:36,066
Little sisters?

180
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,700
You're lying!

181
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:41,733
No, I'm not. If you
don't believe me, why
don't you go ask him
yourself, Bun-head?

182
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't need you to
tell me what to do!
And I'm not Bun-head,
I'm Usagi Tsukino.

183
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:49,666
Get that into
your thick skull!
You <i>walking</i>
fashion disaster!

184
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,566
<i>Whatever!</i>

185
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,833
Motoki, where
are you?

186
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:59,966
Oh. Hey, Usagi.
Motoki's not here.
He's off 'til
tomorrow.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,333
(annoyed sigh)

188
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,200
Do you know Motoki
already has a
girlfriend?

189
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah, so what?

190
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,933
Man, I'm way out of
touch on how middle-
schoolers think
these days.

191
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:17,133
Huh. But maybe, if
she decides to leave
to study abroad, you

192
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,666
might still have a
fighting chance.

193
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,000
What?! She's
going away?!

194
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,766
Give me details!
When is she
leaving?!

195
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,333
I shouldn't
have said
anything.

196
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,066
Guess I got
carried away!

197
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,966
Are next target is
this young lady.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,966
A student at the
Azabu Institute of
Technology.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,133
And she's quite
lovely too...

200
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,000
You're cruel,
Kunzite. How can
you suggest she is
more lovely than me?

201
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,266
Underneath she
is just an
ugly monster!

202
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,833
Shh! I'm kidding.
Don't let envy ruin
your beautiful face.

203
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:01,000
Look at me.

204
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,233
Go away!

205
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:06,133
This rose can't
compare with the
beauty I see in
your face.

206
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,800
Thank you,
my dear.

207
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,200
In return, I will
bring you the
Rainbow Crystal.

208
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,100
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

209
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,733
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,133
I've come here to
encourage Reika
to study abroad.

211
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,566
But now that I'm
here. What can I
possibly say to her.

212
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,000
Tomorrow, let's
try raising the
temperature of the
specimen a bit more.

213
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,600
<i>Yes, that would</i>
<i>be interesting.</i>

214
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:51,566
See you tomorrow.

215
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,733
Right. Good
night.

216
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:54,500
That's her...

217
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,533
Excuse me.
Can we talk?

218
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,966
Oh, you were with
Motoki the other
day...

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,666
<i>What did you want</i>
<i>to talk to me</i>
<i>about?</i>

220
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,866
Are you planning
on going away
to study, Reika?

221
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,200
My! News travels
fast. Did Motoki
tell you that?

222
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:10,200
Please don't
avoid the
subject.

223
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:13,733
I don't know.

224
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,333
Huh?

225
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:18,066
I can't decide.
There's a professor
I'd like to learn
from and work with

226
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,700
in Africa, but I'm
having trouble
bringing myself to
leave Motoki...

227
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,700
But, if he tries
to stop me...

228
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,633
You'd better start
now and get your
priorities straight!

229
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,666
If you'd give it
all up for Motoki,
then I don't think
you're very serious

230
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,733
about your
profession!

231
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,866
You need to choose
one path! Study
abroad or love!

232
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
You can't have
it both ways.

233
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,833
I only came here
to convince her
to go to Africa!

234
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:46,166
The weight of this
bag is the weight
of my love. Heavy!

235
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,966
We take a
right here.

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,633
You know the way
pretty well, Mako.

237
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,866
I'll finally be in
Motoki's apartment.
How I've dreamed
of this!

238
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,933
Hello, Motoki.

239
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,933
Usagi, you look
amazing in that
apron.

240
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:02,866
Will you accept
my proposal to
become my bride?

241
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,066
It's rather
sudden...

242
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,133
Give me your
answer...

243
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:12,066
I just... I'm
not sure if I'm
ready to settle
down yet.

244
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100
But for you, of
course I will.

245
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,800
Usagi...

246
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:18,733
Stop!

247
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:23,400
Well, at least we
know that's never
ever gonna happen.

248
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,166
Hey! Thanks for
dropping by,
you two!

249
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
C'mon in!

250
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,666
Wow! It's as tidy
as I'd imagined
it'd be!

251
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,366
Good-looking guys
keep their places
so neat!

252
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,433
(gasp)

253
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,766
An unfinished
cup of coffee.

254
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,800
Oh, Motoki's
manly scent!

255
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,833
Remember why
we're here.

256
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,633
Usagi...

257
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:47,466
I have to prepare
myself. I'm not
emotionally ready.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,833
Aha! You're amazing,
Usagi. You prepare
yourself to get in
the zone emotionally,

259
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:52,766
even for cooking!

260
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,666
Huh?!

261
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,966
Let's get
started.

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,100
All right, let's
do this! Uh, what
do I do?

263
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,033
First, peel
the carrots.

264
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm not really
a good peeler.

265
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,100
Then you can
dice up all
the onions.

266
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,566
I can't. They
make my eyes
water!

267
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,533
Then cook up
the rice.

268
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,100
I don't know how
to do that! I'm
taking a pass!

269
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,066
Some co-cook you
turned out to be!

270
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,666
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

271
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,466
Hello?

272
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,533
Reika!

273
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,200
Motoki...

274
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:26,100
I know it's taken
me a while, but I've
finally made up my mind
about going to Africa.

275
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,566
<i>What? I couldn't</i>
<i>here what you said.</i>

276
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,433
I've made my
decision. I want
to see you tonight.

277
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,766
Okay, I'll come
as soon as I can.

278
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,066
What?!

279
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,366
Girls, I'm very
sorry to have to
do this to you...

280
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
Well, don't keep
her waiting.
Hurry back!

281
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,766
You were
listening?

282
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,733
That was
dumb.

283
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,500
Could you watch
the place while
I'm away?

284
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:46,166
Thanks!

285
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,466
Ow! I just cut
my finger!

286
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,300
(sigh)

287
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,066
He's still not
back yet.

288
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,900
<i>No wonder I haven't</i>
<i>seen them for hours.</i>
<i>They're still here!</i>

289
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Oh no! There
must be a Rainbow
Crystal close by!

290
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,400
Luna, is that you?

291
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,900
You both need
to transform now!

292
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:17,333
Great! First Motoki
leaves, and now
this! I've had it!

293
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,433
Yeah, who does he
think he is, leaving
two pretty girls
here alone to watch

294
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,666
his house! That's
no way to treat us!

295
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,733
Usagi...

296
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,266
I'm kidding!

297
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,766
Moon Prism Power!
Make Up!

298
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:34,933
Jupiter Power!
Make Up!

299
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,966
(giggle)

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
How very brave
of you.

301
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,266
But it's a wasted
effort. Now move
aside.

302
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,566
Ahh!!

303
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,333
What a
barbarian...

304
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,733
Zoi!

305
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:28,400
(gasp)

306
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,833
Ahhh!

307
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,200
(gasp)

308
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,600
Oh, how sweet!

309
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:36,966
You monster!

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,433
Well now, it takes
one to know one.
You're a monster
yourself. And I

311
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:44,366
mean the real you.
One of the Seven
Great Monsters.

312
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm one of the
Seven Great
Monsters?

313
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,300
(chuckle)

314
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,766
That's correct.
Now pay close
attention.

315
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,733
Look into the
crystal...

316
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,500
Ahh!

317
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,733
I am Rikokeida!

318
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:10,866
No! We're
too late!

319
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,066
Is that really
Reika?!

320
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,466
Sailor Moon,
Sailor Jupiter,
you need to be
very careful!

321
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,733
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights
for love and for
justice.

322
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,300
I am Sailor Moon!

323
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,400
Today we're not...

324
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:23,933
...the same as
usual!

325
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:27,633
We're ten thousand
volts of heartbreak-
power, looking for
a boyfriend!

326
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,366
Not you too, Mako...

327
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:34,266
In the name of
the moon...
I'll punish you!

328
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,500
Girls without
boyfriends are
pathetic!

329
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,200
Oh, yeah, well
it's your fault
for messing up
our chances!

330
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:39,866
Take this!

331
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,733
<i>Watch out!</i>

332
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,333
(chuckle)

333
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:47,233
The fifth Rainbow
Crystal belongs
to me.

334
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:48,666
Hey!

335
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,800
You're forever
butting in where
you're not wanted!

336
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,766
I'm not about to
let you have the
Rainbow Crystals.

337
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,233
Oh! It's my guy,
Tuxedo Mask!

338
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,566
Hey, aren't you
forgetting about
your guy, Motoki?

339
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,700
That's a little
complicated. Right
now I'm into Tuxedo
Mask!

340
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:08,866
Take that!
And that!

341
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,066
Ew, gross!

342
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,733
What are they?!

343
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:23,433
The foundation of all
life, including you,
originated from these
single-celled organisms.

344
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:24,500
Huh?!

345
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,833
So says the
single-celled
brain.

346
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:32,200
Jupiter, my guardian
planet, bring forth
a storm! Summon the
clouds and bring

347
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,733
down your thunder!

348
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,366
Supreme...

349
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
...Thunder!

350
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,366
Big Flask!

351
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,000
Ah!

352
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,466
She's collecting
my lightning!

353
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,066
(laughing)

354
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:54,166
C'mon let's go!

355
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,500
That was
too close!

356
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,700
She used the
lightning from
my Supreme Thunder
to attack us!

357
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:02,166
You dodged that one,
but there's still a
lot of lightning
power left!

358
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,266
Sailor Jupiter, do
something or we're
both gonna be fried!

359
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:08,466
I'm going to enjoy
destroying the
two of you.

360
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,166
Bubble...

361
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:17,300
...Spray!

362
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,000
What?!

363
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,266
Mercury!

364
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,200
And Mars!

365
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,633
Luckily we got
here in time.

366
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,733
It took us forever
to find you two.

367
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,633
Fire...

368
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,600
...Soul!

369
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,033
Show some respect
for your lab
equipment!

370
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,366
Stop wasting
resources meant
for good!

371
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,233
Shut up and take
her out already.

372
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:46,433
Mmm! You're
not the boss!

373
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,400
Hmph! Well, you've
been too boy-crazy
to be the boss.

374
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,733
Boy-crazy?!

375
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,033
Just do it
already!

376
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,966
Moon Healing
Escalation!

377
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,966
Refresh!

378
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,033
Ha! Looks like
your monsters
been defeated!

379
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,333
It seems I've lost
as well. You may
take the Rainbow
Crystal.

380
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,766
(giggle)

381
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Huh?

382
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,200
You're so naive that
you'd really believe
I'd give you the
Rainbow Crystal?!

383
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,200
Sooner or later,
I'll get you for
this, Zoisite!

384
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,033
<i>Motoki!</i>

385
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,466
Reika!

386
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,600
Passengers who have
not yet checked-in
for Flight Six-Fifty-
Eight to San Francisco,

387
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:49,666
please hurry to
the terminal.

388
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,400
Reika, I really don't
want to say goodbye
to you.

389
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,733
I know. I promise
to write you.

390
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,466
And I'll be waiting
for you to come back.

391
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,166
Motoki...

392
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,266
Well, I'd
better go...

393
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,933
Take care...

394
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,633
(crying whines)

395
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,666
So sad! Maybe we
should forget about
Motoki. Whaddya
think?

396
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,666
I think Reika will
meet someone special
in Africa and she'll
never be back!

397
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,966
You do not!

398
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,633
So you've
dropped out!
Good!

399
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,066
What I didn't
say that!

400
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,466
Motoki is
all mine!

401
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,700
That's just
wishful thinking!

402
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:30,033
Wishful thinking
is thinking you
can cook!

403
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:31,466
Nooo!

404
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,466
(crying)

405
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,200
What's wrong,
Usagi?

406
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,933
<i>It's-It's Rei! She</i>
<i>said we're not</i>
<i>gonna be friends</i>
<i>anymore!</i>

407
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:20,866
I'll be okay. I'm
sure she was just
a little on edge

408
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,800
because of her
Grandpa when she
said that.

409
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,133
<i>Oh! Gramps,</i>
<i>turn back into</i>
<i>a good guy!</i>

410
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:31,366
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Moon, "Grandpa Loses</i>
<i>Control: Rei in Danger"</i>

411
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,166
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
