1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,800
I don't believe it!
That jerk was Tuxedo
Mask all along?! And
now he's fighting

2
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:09,466
Zoisite right in front
of me. Ahh! Just what
the heck is going on
here?! Never mind,

3
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,566
what's important right
now is for me to fight
evil!

4
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,466
In the name of the
moon, I'll punish
you.

5
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,533
Zoisite decided to
disguise himself as
me so he could lure
Tuxedo Mask into a

6
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:28,400
trap! When we tried
to stop him, another
member of the Dark
Kingdom named Kunzite

7
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:33,800
appeared and sealed us
inside a barrier! Then
that bad guy Zoisite
succeeded in wounding

8
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:38,533
Tuxedo Mask, leaving
us in serious trouble!
Just when all of us
thought our luck had

9
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:42,433
really run out, Sailor
Venus, the fifth
Guardian, surprised
everyone by showing

10
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:46,533
up and saving us! I
wonder if she could
be the Moon Princess
we're looking for?

11
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,533
<i>"The Shining Silver</i>
<i>Crystal: The Moon</i>
<i>Princess Appears"</i>

12
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,900
Sailor V, I mean
Sailor Venus...

13
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:10,900
Wait a minute,
could you be the
Moon Princess?

14
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:15,766
I'm not. But like all
of you, I'm a Guardian
dedicated to protecting
the princess.

15
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,666
I don't believe it!
My hero Sailor V is
right here in front
of me!

16
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,500
It's really nice
to meet you, all
of you.

17
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,200
<i>Nice to meet you!</i>

18
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:24,033
Hi there!

19
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:24,788
<i>Glad to have</i>
<i>you here.</i>

20
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:25,988
This is great!

21
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:35,767
While it is nice that
all of you finally met,
I need you to realize
we're in the middle of

22
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,767
an important
investigation here.

23
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,234
<i>We'll share the</i>
<i>details with you</i>
<i>tomorrow night</i>
<i>when we meet at</i>

24
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:42,801
<i>the Hikawa Shrine.</i>
<i>See you later, Luna.</i>

25
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,834
Right Artemis,
see you then!

26
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,901
Bye everyone! Later!

27
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:49,967
Well, there
she goes.

28
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,867
She sure doesn't
waste any time.

29
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,767
Yeah, and
she's so cool!

30
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,634
Queen Beryl...

31
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,101
Why did you order
us to retreat from
battle?

32
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:04,701
We were so close to
getting the Rainbow
Crystals and finishing
off Tuxedo Mask!

33
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,701
Orders have been
given from the
Great Ruler.

34
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,867
And what are
those orders?

35
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:15,801
You are not to kill
Tuxedo Mask. Instead,
you will bring him to
me alive.

36
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,634
But why do that?!

37
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,667
I don't need to
explain myself
to you!

38
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,067
Understood.

39
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,501
Damn it!

40
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:44,501
Why couldn't I protect
her?! I failed her!

41
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,567
Sailor Moon...

42
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:16,034
<i>You have a very</i>
<i>lovely place...</i>

43
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,667
How did you
find me?!

44
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:23,034
Actually finding you
was quite an easy
task! Once I learned
your true identity.

45
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:23,701
(chuckle)

46
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:24,934
Mamoru...

47
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,201
So what do
you want?

48
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:31,867
Hm! Well, now that
we know each other,
I think the timing's
right for us to get

49
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,801
things settled
once and for all.

50
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,467
Go on, I'm
listening.

51
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,267
<i>Good.</i>

52
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:41,734
We both want possession of
those Rainbow Crystals,
so I suggest a battle
between us with the

53
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,167
winner taking all.
How's that sound?

54
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:47,167
Hmph! Sounds fair,
I accept your
challenge, Zoisite.

55
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:52,601
Nice. That's a good
boy. Now as for where,
how about that wonderful
structure in the bay

56
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,601
area, the Starlight
Tower?

57
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,501
Yeah, that'll work.

58
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:00,134
Very well, the
Starlight Tower
it is. I'll see
you there today

59
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,001
at 5 o'clock,
until then Mamoru.

60
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:16,934
All right Ms. Haruna,
bye now! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

61
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,501
That's just great!

62
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:22,901
Ms. Haruna goes and
gives me detention
on a day when I've
got everybody waiting

63
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:26,467
for me! I can already
hear what Rei's going
to say to me...

64
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,834
You're such a worthless
blockhead! You're a
dimwit!

65
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,834
Hey, I know
those pants.

66
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,334
(painful grunts)

67
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,867
Hey there! How
ya doin' guy?!

68
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,034
What's wrong?

69
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,601
Oh hey, Bun-head.
You're sure cheerful
today...

70
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:50,934
Well excuse me then!
It just so happens
that I'm a cheerful
person all of the time!

71
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:52,734
(chuckle)

72
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:56,601
I hope you'll always
be that way. Take
care, okay?

73
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:57,901
Huh?

74
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:03,867
Whoa. What's with
him? He isn't acting
like himself.

75
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,034
(gasp)

76
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,534
Blood? How'd
that get there?!

77
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:13,901
Wait a sec...
Could he be hurt
in some way?

78
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,567
Ahhh!

79
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,767
Bun-head?!

80
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,834
What was
that about?!

81
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,867
You startled me.
What are you up to?

82
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,067
I dunno, I just got
really worried about
you, so I decided to
follow you.

83
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,667
Worried about me?

84
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,034
I know that you're
hurt! You need to go
see a doctor before
it gets even worse!

85
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,934
Hmph. Look, that's
none of your business.

86
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,367
Well, maybe
not, but...

87
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,501
So just bug off!

88
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,034
Well you didn't
have to be so
rude about it!

89
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,401
Hey wait! We
need to have
a talk!

90
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:06,734
(annoyed sigh)

91
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,301
It's show time.

92
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:17,434
(startled grunt)

93
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,301
Zoisite!

94
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:19,801
<i>Oh no, what's</i>
<i>happening?!</i>

95
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:20,567
Huh?!

96
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,634
It's all red!

97
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,567
You idiot! Why did
you follow me?!

98
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,267
I'm sorry!

99
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,967
Usagi always shows up
late, but this is way
too late.

100
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:42,234
I called her but
she's not at home.

101
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:43,834
She wasn't at
school, either.

102
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:47,334
Something's wrong.
She's not answering
her communicator
either.

103
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,467
<i>I don't have a</i>
<i>good feeling</i>
<i>about this.</i>

104
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,767
Me either, let's
split up and find
her.

105
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:53,601
She's at the
Starlight Tower.

106
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,667
Huh?!

107
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,667
Who are you?

108
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:04,201
Who are we? Have you
already forgotten us?

109
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:07,301
Artemis! Then
you must be...

110
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:08,934
<i>...Sailor Venus?</i>

111
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:12,201
Yes, my real name
is Minako Aino.

112
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:16,267
Based on what we've
been able to figure,
the enemy's involved
in some activity at

113
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:17,834
the Starlight Tower.

114
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:20,967
The fact that we
can't reach Usagi's
communicator proves
it. She must of

115
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:25,434
<i>somehow figured out</i>
<i>the enemy's plan and</i>
<i>gone after them alone,</i>
<i>at Starlight Tower.</i>

116
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:29,801
If Usagi were as
good as you say,
my job sure would
be much easier.

117
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:35,534
C'mon. We've got to
help her by getting
to the Starlight
Tower!

118
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:36,801
Right!

119
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,701
Welcome...

120
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:56,401
I'll place the Rainbow
Crystals that I have
right here. Now, let's
see yours.

121
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:59,801
Before I do that,
you need to let
this girl go.

122
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:03,701
Only if you put your
crystals with mine,
first.

123
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,301
Fine!

124
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:16,667
(hysterical laughter)

125
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,234
What's so funny?

126
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:22,801
You are, I'm laughing
at how foolish you
actually are!

127
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,467
Kunzite!

128
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:29,801
Now all the Rainbow
Crystals are ours!

129
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,167
You-You lied to me!

130
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:37,767
Ah-ah, better stay where
you are Mamoru, or your
cute friend will be
turned into ashes.

131
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,867
Zoisite, you
handle to rest.

132
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,101
Sure...

133
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:56,267
Uh, Zoisite?! Why's
Mamoru fighting
Zoisite?

134
00:10:56,301 --> 00:11:02,567
Ugh! How dare you do
this to my face, you
worm. I'll get you yet!

135
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:07,501
Mamoru Chiba! If
you want to get the
Rainbow Crystals back,
come to the top floor

136
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,901
observation deck!

137
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,234
The Rainbow Crystals?
What would Mamoru want
with the Rainbow Crystals?

138
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:18,501
Ahh, allow me to
give you an icy
cold taste of fear.

139
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:22,201
<i>Watch out!</i>

140
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:22,734
Ahhh!

141
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,301
Keep running!

142
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:34,134
His shoulder's hurt!
Tuxedo Mask got his
shoulder hurt yesterday
too. No, it couldn't be!

143
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:35,849
(gasp)

144
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,267
I can't take anymore
of this! It's making
me crazy!

145
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,134
We've gotta get
to that elevator!

146
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,567
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

147
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,367
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

148
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,512
<i>Oh c'mon!</i>
<i>Open! Open!</i>

149
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,631
Whew! We're
safe now!

150
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,298
I wouldn't
count on it.

151
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:21,964
Huh?

152
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,431
Ew, gross!
What is all
this?!

153
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:38,264
It's no use,
we're trapped in
this thing...

154
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,664
So this is the
Starlight Tower,
huh?

155
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:45,031
<i>Wow, that's one</i>
<i>huge building.</i>

156
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,098
(gasp)

157
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,598
Usagi and Mamoru
are both trapped
in the elevator!

158
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:55,298
What?!

159
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:56,998
They're trapped
up there?!

160
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,698
Not good! All the
doors are sealed
shut!

161
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:02,564
You mean there's no
way to get inside?

162
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,131
What now?

163
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:08,698
Jupiter, my guardian
planet! Bring forth a
storm! Summon the
clouds! And bring

164
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,464
down your thunder!

165
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,198
Supreme!

166
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,498
Thunder!

167
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,031
We'll force our
way in! C'mon!

168
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:27,164
Uh, right!

169
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:31,564
Hmph! Pesky ants.

170
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:37,131
We now possess all the
Rainbow Crystals and
we've got Mamoru as
well. If we can destroy

171
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,031
the Sailor Guardians
while they're here...

172
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,164
(chuckle)

173
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:43,464
That would be our
revenge for that
cut cheek of yours.

174
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,464
This elevator sure
is taking its time.
Feels like we've been
in here for days.

175
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:54,064
Say, I was wondering
why do you want those
crystals? Oh! Sorry!

176
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,631
I understand if you
don't want to talk
about it.

177
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:59,198
It's got to do
with my past.

178
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,998
If I have all those
Rainbow Crystals,
they'll help me find
the Legendary Silver

179
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:06,398
Crystal. Then I can
figure out my past
once and for all.

180
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:09,031
<i>He even knows about</i>
<i>the Silver Crystal?!</i>

181
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:15,298
When I was six, my
parents and I were in
a bad car accident
and I lost them.

182
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:22,064
I'm sorry, but neither
of the parents survived.
But miraculously, their
only son, Mamoru, did

183
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:23,564
manage to pull
through.

184
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,998
Who am I?
I dunno.

185
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,231
I can't remember
what happened to
me, I can't remember
anything!

186
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:39,198
I've never been
able to remember
what happened.
Since then, I've

187
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:42,264
been having the
same dream over
and over.

188
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,998
The Silver Crystal.
Find the Legendary
Silver Crystal.

189
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:58,364
I want to have my
memories back. And
I know the Silver
Crystal will help.

190
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,231
I don't know why
I told you all
of that.

191
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:11,064
You know what? Before
I used to think you
were the worst person
in the whole wide world.

192
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:11,539
Hm?!

193
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,431
But not anymore...

194
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,931
Now you're the
second worst.

195
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,264
(chuckle)

196
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,998
Thank you.

197
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:24,931
Huh?!

198
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:30,998
Tuxedo Mask? No, he
can't be him! That's
just impossible!

199
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:38,498
Yes, Sailor Guardians.
This will be the perfect
place for you to die.

200
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:52,964
Huh?!

201
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,764
What's going on?!

202
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:58,998
Sailor Venus!

203
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:11,764
Why'd it stop?

204
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:16,964
(evil chuckle)

205
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:24,098
Goodbye, you two.

206
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,198
What's that?!

207
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:37,764
What should I do?!
If I transform into
Sailor Moon now,
he'll know who I am!

208
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,864
But if I don't,
we're both going
to die!

209
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,464
I guess I've got
no other choice!

210
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:51,998
Moon Prism Power
Make up!

211
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:02,231
(gasp)

212
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:21,698
Huh?!

213
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:27,364
Sailor Moon?!

214
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,731
Mm-hm!

215
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:49,864
I'll report to Queen
Beryl that Mamoru
Chiba perished in
an accident.

216
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:51,364
<i>You call that</i>
<i>an accident?!</i>

217
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:56,064
Well here's what I
think! You're going
to pay big time for
all the suffering

218
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:59,264
you've caused,
especially for trying
to kill us with your
dirty tricks!

219
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:05,064
I am Sailor Moon!
And in the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you!

220
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:09,098
Hmph! Well Sailor
Moon, I'll get rid
of you and Tuxedo
Mask!

221
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:14,131
What are you saying?
What do you mean
Tuxedo Mask? He's
not even here!

222
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,331
Yes I am!

223
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,098
It can't be?!

224
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:24,131
(gasp)

225
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:42,998
Uh, no way!

226
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:48,864
<i>Looks to me like</i>
<i>you'd better study</i>
<i>harder next time,</i>
<i>Bun-head.</i>

227
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:52,664
<i>Sailor Moon, crying</i>
<i>isn't going to solve</i>
<i>any of your problems.</i>

228
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,631
<i>Your little Miss</i>
<i>Bun-head, here, is</i>
<i>getting all puffy</i>
<i>because she's being</i>

229
00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:57,131
<i>ignored by you!</i>

230
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:59,798
<i>Tonight, it's you</i>
<i>who saved me.</i>

231
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:03,631
<i>If you keep on eating</i>
<i>like that, then you</i>
<i>might just turn into</i>
<i>a pork bun.</i>

232
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,331
Farewell, Sailor Moon!

233
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,898
You really are
Tuxedo Mask.

234
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:17,131
You were very brave
today, Sailor Moon.
Now you can leave
the rest to me.

235
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:19,831
You can't! I know
you're hurt!

236
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,798
Please! Get out
of here quickly!

237
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,131
Sailor Moon, I
will protect you.

238
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:30,131
Oh Tuxedo Mask...

239
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:36,998
Playtime is over,
children. Now we will
finally settle this,
Tuxedo Mask.

240
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:42,731
Very well, but first
you must promise me that
you'll leave Sailor
Moon out of all this.

241
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,764
<i>Why of course. We'll do</i>
<i>this fair and square.</i>

242
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,531
(evil chuckle)

243
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:54,264
All fair and square.

244
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,031
Die!

245
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,964
(fearful gasp)

246
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,864
(painful grunt)

247
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:21,798
(shocked gasp)

248
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,098
No! Don't die!

249
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:28,664
Are you all right,
Sailor Moon?

250
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:34,931
Stop looking like
you're about to cry.
I'm so glad that
you're safe.

251
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:38,564
Tuxedo Mask!
Tuxedo Mask!

252
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,264
We're too late.

253
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,764
No! Not Tuxedo Mask!

254
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,064
Tuxedo Mask.

255
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,064
Hm?

256
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,631
Wha?!

257
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:29,198
(surprised gasp)

258
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,164
The Silver Crystal!

259
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:38,498
It is! The Legendary
Silver Crystal!

260
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,564
Sailor Moon!

261
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,631
Wha-What's
going on?

262
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:10,131
It's her! The
Moon Princess!

263
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:12,431
She has awakened.

264
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:18,416
Why do these bad things
have to happen one after
another? Now, because of
me, Mamoru is...

265
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:19,677
<i>C'mon Usagi!</i>

266
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,877
I can't take it anymore!
I don't want to see people
I care about getting hurt
because of me!

267
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:28,443
<i>Usagi, pull yourself</i>
<i>together! You're the</i>
<i>princess. You have to</i>
<i>accept your destiny</i>

268
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:29,310
<i>and fight!</i>

269
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,377
Luna...

270
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,443
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon:</i>
<i>"Returning Memory:</i>
<i>Usagi and Mamoru's Past"</i>

271
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:39,343
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
