1
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:03,199
A powerful evil energy is
about to be unleashed into
the world. And we're the
only ones who can stop it.

2
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:09,233
Oh sacred light of the
Moon, give us the strength
to succeed in this fight.
Sailor Jupiter, Mercury,

3
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:14,966
Venus, Mars! No matter
what happens, we'll
always be together!

4
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:24,366
The dark spots on the sun
continue to spread at an
unusual pace. Earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions,

5
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:29,733
hurricanes and other
catastrophes believed to be
caused by this phenomenon,
continue to occur throughout

6
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:34,666
the world. The National
Weather Bureau is calling
this an unprecedented
atmospheric event and has

7
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,899
released a statement
saying they-

8
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,666
We will have to
act quickly!

9
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,666
<i>"Death of the Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians: The Tragic</i>
<i>Final Battle."</i>

10
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:57,366
Dinner's ready, hope
you're all really hungry!

11
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,033
Tonight's menu features
my very special curry!

12
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:03,933
We're thrilled you made
such an effort to make
us dinner, Usagi!

13
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:07,033
Oh Dad, you make it
sound like this is
such a big deal!

14
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,366
Well it is! Shall
we dig in, everyone?

15
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,333
Is it really edible?

16
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:16,899
Don't be rude. Maybe
it doesn't look great,
but the taste will
blow you away!

17
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:29,799
Uh, Is something
the matter, Usagi?

18
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,299
<i>What's wrong??</i>

19
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,233
It's hot!

20
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,999
See, I knew it.

21
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:43,366
Is everyone ready?

22
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,166
Yeah. Let's do this.

23
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,299
Well, there's no
turning back now.

24
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,966
Hey, uh, Rei!

25
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,199
Hm?

26
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,299
Do did you at least
give Yuichiro a kiss
before leaving home?

27
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,399
And just why'd you
bring that up?

28
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:00,933
I just thought, what if
something bad happens,
you'd have regrets.

29
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,699
Nothing bad is gonna
happen to us!

30
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,299
Ow! You don't have to
yell at me like that!
I was just concerned
about you!

31
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,199
Just mind your
own business!

32
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:13,999
Usagi, let's stop all
this thinking about
'what if?'

33
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:19,766
I agree, when this is
all over I intend to get
out there and experience
all the love I can.

34
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,666
Really, Mako? I guess
all of you are right.
Sorry.,,

35
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,466
Love, huh?
I'd like that.

36
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:28,299
Oh?

37
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:28,933
Oh?

38
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:29,408
Hm?

39
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,699
Ohh?

40
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:35,666
All right, that's enough
talking girls. It's time!

41
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,999
Let's go everyone!
Transform!

42
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,766
Moon Prism Power!

43
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,999
Make Up!

44
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,033
Mercury Power!

45
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,399
Mars Power!

46
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,766
Jupiter Power!

47
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,266
Venus Power!

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,699
Make Up!

49
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,699
All of you need to get
to the D-Point in the
Arctic Circle at once!

50
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,033
<i>But how?!</i>

51
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,433
By putting all of your
powers together and
teleporting yourselves.

52
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:22,899
<i>Since we're both injured,</i>
<i>we'd only get in your way.</i>
<i>So we're going to stay</i>
<i>here. But you girls can</i>

53
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,799
<i>handle this, right?</i>

54
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,833
If you Sailor Guardians
combine all of your powers,
there's no doubt you will
defeat Queen Beryl!

55
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,866
Sailor Teleport!

56
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,833
Good luck, girls.

57
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:29,333
Please, come back
to us safely.

58
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,766
Yi-Yi-Yikes!
It's freezing!

59
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,666
How come all of you
aren't shivering in
this cold?!

60
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,166
<i>Pull yourself together</i>
<i>and you won't feel the</i>
<i>cold!</i>

61
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,799
Speak for yourself!
You have more body fat!

62
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,866
We're not off to a
great start, are we?

63
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:46,966
Huh?

64
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:52,366
Hey, I found it! There's
a strong evil aura that's
coming from over in that
direction!

65
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,233
Ahh-Choo!

66
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:07,866
Very soon now, Queen
Metalia will be fully
resurrected. I'll make
sure of it!

67
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:12,299
Whoever thinks they can
eliminate these foolish
Guardians, step forward!

68
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,299
<i>The DD Girls will</i>
<i>finish them! Leave</i>
<i>the task to us!</i>

69
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,299
Wait!

70
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,199
Hm?

71
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,333
The evil aura's
getting much
stronger.

72
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,133
Here they come!

73
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,999
Tuxedo Mask...

74
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,966
It's Tuxedo Mask!

75
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,799
Wait! It could
be a trap!

76
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,999
Isn't that obvious
by now...

77
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,733
But I...

78
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,799
C'mon! They're doing
this because they know
you'll run to him!

79
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,633
Let's see...

80
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,099
Help me Sailor
Moon, please...

81
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,899
Sailor Moon...

82
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,999
I can't! I've
gotta go help him!

83
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,799
No! Don't!

84
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,933
Control yourself!

85
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:18,199
But can't you see?!
He's suffering! I
have to help!

86
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,033
He needs me!

87
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,633
(shocked gasp)

88
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:23,833
<i>Watch out, everybody!</i>
<i>That's a monster!</i>

89
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:24,866
Huh?!

90
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,299
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

91
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:32,966
See? I told you so!

92
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,833
I didn't wanna
believe it!

93
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,233
(evil laughter)

94
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:43,933
Hey you monster! How
dare you trick me! You
guys are really mean for
trashing the pure love a

95
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:47,933
young girl can have for
someone special, even
though I was a little
stupid to fall for your

96
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:52,366
silly trick. Now you've
gone and made me really
angry! So I'm going to...

97
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,199
We get it.

98
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,266
So anyway...

99
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:59,999
Now, in the name
of the Moon. I'll
punish you!

100
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,833
(unimpressed laugh)

101
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,199
There's five of them?

102
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,399
You girls don't stand
a chance against us,
not while you're here
in the D-Point!

103
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:15,966
Sailor Moon, I
love you...

104
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:20,199
Hunh! What kind of idiot
would fall for the same
stupid trick twice?

105
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,766
Hey didn't you
hear what I said?

106
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,799
But he needs me!

107
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,866
What if this time it's
for real and he's not
actually some kind of
monster?!

108
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,766
Ahhhh!

109
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,421
See?!

110
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:30,100
<i>Sorry!</i>

111
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,133
I've had enough of this!

112
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
Back off!

113
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:38,733
(shocked gasp)

114
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:39,666
Motoki!

115
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,233
(gasp)

116
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,066
Ahhh!

117
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,633
(startled gasps)

118
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,333
Moon Tiara!

119
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,166
Fire!

120
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:09,966
It's not good! We'll
end up hitting Jupiter
as well!

121
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:13,999
Never mind me! You've
got to make your move
to go stop Queen Beryl!

122
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:14,899
(painful grunt)

123
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,066
(gasps)

124
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:20,366
(painful grunts)

125
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,699
Allow me to give you
girls a taste of what
real thunder feels like.

126
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:25,199
What?!

127
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,999
Go to hell!

128
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:32,133
Supreme Thunder!

129
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,266
That's enough
from you!

130
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,666
Die!

131
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:45,233
(painful scream)

132
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,799
(gasps)

133
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,033
<i>Curse you!</i>

134
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,966
(strained grunts)

135
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:11,633
(gasp)

136
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,866
Jupiter!

137
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,966
Hey girls...

138
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:25,799
I'm coming!

139
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,333
I'm not gonna
make it...

140
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:35,199
So, go, get her. Get
Queen Beryl. Hurry!
Leave me here.

141
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:39,799
No we won't! We
have to go back
there together!

142
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:44,633
Remember what you said
Mako? How when you get
back you're going to find
all the love you can!

143
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,666
You weren't lying
to us, were you?!

144
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:53,799
Just stay with us. Don't
give up. If you lied, Lord
Enma will pull your
tongue out!

145
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:59,933
There's no time for
crying. You must go...
Princess...

146
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:03,666
(gasp)

147
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,733
(shocked gasp)

148
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:19,233
No! Mako! You
can't die! Mako!

149
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:29,299
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

150
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,066
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

<i>to go. Come on, Sailor</i>
<i>Moon.</i>

152
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:54,933
Forget it! If stuff like
this is going to happen,
we should just give them
the Silver Crystal!

153
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,799
How can you even
say that?!

154
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,333
It's true. That's really
what we should've done
in the first place!

155
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:01,899
Queen Beryl!

156
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:02,866
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>
<i>Stop it!</i>

157
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,966
You can have the
Silver Crystal
right now!

158
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,133
Let go! That Crystal's
why Mako died!

159
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,766
<i>We should just</i>
<i>give up!</i>

160
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:17,366
Sorry I did that, but
listen. Don't let
Jupiter's death be
in vain...

161
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,966
They're coming!

162
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,599
Right!

163
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,199
<i>No! You three need to</i>
<i>keep going. I'll hold</i>
<i>them off here.</i>

164
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,333
<i>But, Mercury...</i>

165
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:37,899
You and Venus have more
firepower than I do, and
Sailor Moon needs all the
support you can give her!

166
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,099
Now go!

167
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,199
Wait Ami, you're not?

168
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,966
Don't be silly!
I'm not gonna die!

169
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,699
Do you promise!

170
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:47,866
Yeah.

171
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,299
Come and get me!

172
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,399
(gasp)

173
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,133
Ryo...

174
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:18,666
So now it's my turn
to see illusions of
someone special.

175
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:24,166
Huh?

176
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,066
Bubble!

177
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,699
Spray!

178
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,233
Ahhh!

179
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,866
It's actually an illusion,
but it possess the heat
of the real thing! The
illusion's source is that

180
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,299
jewel on her forehead!

181
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,366
The only way to stop
them, is to destroy
the source of this
illusion!

182
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:05,166
Bubble!

183
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,899
Spray!

184
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,866
Ahhh!

185
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,833
No you'll roast
like a pig!

186
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:23,933
I'm no pig!

187
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,666
How about a
baked potato?

188
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,266
Hah! Now die!

189
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,233
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

190
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,366
(exhausted sigh)

191
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,066
<i>(evil chuckle)</i>

192
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,233
Guess I won't be
using this again...

193
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:46,933
(attacking grunt)

194
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:56,766
Damn her! Now I
can't create my
illusions anymore!

195
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:01,666
(shocked gasp)

196
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,133
<i>Ami is...</i>

197
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,099
Ami is dead!

198
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,699
Why?! Why did she
choose to stay
behind!

199
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:23,333
Crying over everything
won't help us!

200
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,399
They're gonna keep
attacking us! They
won't stop!

201
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,733
But...But, I'd never
thought it'd turn out
like this.

202
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:34,967
(gasp)

203
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:35,847
Look out!

204
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:38,833
Ahhhh!

205
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,133
No! Minako!

206
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,199
<i>Stop it! Now!</i>

207
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,799
I'll give you the Silver
Crystal if you'll just
let Minako go!

208
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,266
If you do that I'll
never forgive you!

209
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,899
Ahhhh!

210
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:58,933
You Guardians are fools!
Begging for your teammate's
life. That Silver Crystal
will be ours, but only

211
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,199
after we kill every
last one of you!

212
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,867
Starting with this one!

213
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:04,608
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

214
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,528
Minako!

215
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:12,966
(painful screams)

216
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,299
Crescent!

217
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,066
<i>Beam!</i>

218
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,299
Ahhhh!

219
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,899
Ahhhh!

220
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,233
Minako!

221
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:53,799
You know what...

222
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,633
What?

223
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,666
I really had fun
arguing with you
all the time.

224
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:00,133
Wait! Why'd you
just say that?!

225
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,099
I thought I'd tell you
in case something bad
happens.

226
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,899
Stop it! This isn't
the time to be joking!

227
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:10,899
Wait!

228
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,766
I can handle the rest
of what needs to be
done here. I'll defeat
them and Queen Beryl

229
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,199
then I'll come home!
So please Rei, just
go home!

230
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,399
I don't want
you to die!

231
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:28,099
I appreciate your concern,
but I'm afraid I can't let
you do that. You need to
save your strength for the

232
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,066
bigger battle.

233
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:36,099
Besides, you've never
seen anyone come close
to beating me!

234
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:39,766
Give me two minutes,
then we'll go finish
Queen Beryl together!

235
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,999
Fire!

236
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,166
They're fast!

237
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,666
Ahhh!

238
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:55,833
Rei!

239
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:57,933
Ahhh!

240
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,299
What happened?

241
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:16,199
Now you're mine!

242
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:22,866

Ahhh!

244

She's alive!

245

Damn you!

<i>(painful screams)</i>

247
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:53,033
Well now, that leaves
just you, Princess.

248
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,999
Rei, no!

249
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:59,833
Now it's your turn!

250
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:09,099
I'm not done yet!

Ahhhh!

255
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:36,699
Usagi, turns out you
were right about
Yuichiro, I...

256
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:42,066
Should've kissed him.
Too late now...

257
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:54,199
Mako...Ami...
Minako... Rei...

258
00:20:57,099 --> 00:21:01,799
I get it. This is
a dream. A dream...

259
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:11,166
When I wake up, they'll
say "good morning" like
always. And Rei will call
me "silly Usagi" as usual.

260
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,966
Hey now. no
need for tears.

261
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:31,266
Be strong, Usagi.

262
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,266
Don't you ever
give up hope.

263
