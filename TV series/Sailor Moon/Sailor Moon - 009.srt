<i>Hi! I'm Usagi Tsukino,</i>
<i>and I'm a fourteen-year-old</i>
<i>middle school student.</i>

6
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,633
<i>I'm a bit of a klutz.</i>

7
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,633
<i>...and some people might</i>
<i>say I'm a little emotional.</i>

8
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,443
So, one day, this strange cat
named Luna gave me a special

9
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:37,033
brooch that transformed me into
a guardian in a sailor uniform.

10
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,166
<i>And told me I had</i>
<i>to fight bad guys!</i>

11
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,133
<i>Boy, does that ever</i>
<i>make me nervous!</i>

12
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,400

Well, then. That's all the
more reason that you must
gather energy quickly for
our great ruler!

19
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,066
Of course, Queen Beryl, and I
already have an ingenious plan
in mind to do exactly that.

20
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,233
Oh?

Wow! There are so
many people here!

28

Is this really your
first time at a place
like this, Ami?

29
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,033
Yes, although I have
read about them.

30
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,133
That's sad! There's
more to life than

Oh. Sorry.

32
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,433
Don't be sorry!
There's no need
to apologize!

Okay!

34
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,433

Yeah, a whole
lot of stuff!

What kind of stuff do
you read for fun, Ami?

52
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,533
I'll show you
if you show me.

58
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:51,700
Sure is.

<i>[Ami]</i>
<i>Clocks and watches, huh?</i>

61
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,433
Everything's fifty to

62
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,033
Wow, that's a great deal!
We really should go and
check it out!

63
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:06,366
Well, I don't need a watch.
I got one from my mom
as a present.

64
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,566
What?! Where's your
adventurous spirit!

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,966
Shopping isn't just
about buying.
It's about having fun!

Welcome to
our store.

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,966
Please, feel free
to look around.

68

<i>[Usagi]</i>
<i>Whoa! Look at those prices!</i>

69
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,100
Are watches usually
this inexpensive?

70
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,966
No! They're having a special.
It's unbelievable!

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,966
<i>Look at this weird one!</i>

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,066
<i>[giggle] That's so cute!</i>

73
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,466
<i>Sure is!</i>

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,033
<i>[Usagi]</i>
<i>No way! This one</i>
<i>looks just like Luna!</i>

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,166
I think I might
have to buy it!

76
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,366
Maybe it will help me
get to school on time!

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,533
Ah, the cat clock.

78
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,533
Good eye. It's quite a bargain.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,366
Yeah, it sure is!
Your prices
are so low!

80
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,100
Oop!

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,466
Ouch! They're practically
giving these clocks away and
I still can't afford one.

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,366
But if I'm late to class
again, I'm gonna set a
new school record!

83
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:06,633
Usagi, I can come by your house
in the morning to make sure
that you wake up on time.

84
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,633
Please don't cry.

You're the best!
I love you!

[hammering]
Welcome back!
You're in for a treat!

88
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,200
I bought you something
really nice today!

89
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,600
Yeah?!
I'm so excited!
What?

90
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:25,266
I went shopping today with
Umino's and Naru's mothers,
and I picked this up. Here!

91
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,466
It's from that clock store!
Wow, you were there, too?

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,100
Yeah, they were
having a sale!

93
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,133
Umino's mom bought
seven clocks!

94
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,133
I want to go back
and get more myself!

95
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,033
Oh! Awesome!

96
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,066
<i>Isn't it cute?</i>
<i>You're always</i>
<i>oversleeping, so,</i>

97
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,066
Maybe this'll be able to get
you out of bed in the morning.

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,333
Thank you mom!

99
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,066
<i>Luna's going to be so excited!</i>
<i>It looks just like her!</i>

100
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,566
Oh please. That clock
doesn't resemble me one bit!

101
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,566
Come on, I'm much better
looking than that thing!

102
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,500
Okay! If you say so!

103
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,033
I just hope it keeps me
from oversleeping again!

104
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,633
I don't like the vibe
of that clock at all.

105
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,333
It's got a sinister
feel to me.

106
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, great! Good night!

107
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:08,200
Come on, Usagi!
Don't do that!

108
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,533
Unh! Do I really look as
sinister as that clock does?!

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Huh?

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,066
Huh??

111
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,666
This cannot be good.

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,433
<i>Coming!</i>

113
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,333
Oh! Ami!

114
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,566
Good morning.
Is Usagi
still asleep?

115
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>No, she's</i>
<i>long gone!</i>

116
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,466
Already?! But it's only
seven o'clock in the morning!

117
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,866
I know; she got a late start.

118
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,600
Her brother Shingo
was already on his
way before six!

119
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,066
Listen, you'd better hurry up,
or you'll be late, too!

120
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,566
Ahhh! I'm gonna be late!
See you later!

121
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,633
Have a nice day, honey!

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,100
Well, no time to waste!
Gotta start cleaning,
washing and doing laundry--

123
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,266
Oh, and then it'll be
time to get supper ready!

124
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,300
Why's everyone so late?!

125
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,266
[grumble]

126
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,433
That's it! I can't
just wait all day!
I'm gonna go call everyone!

127
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,666
Yeah, really! I can't just
sit around here, waiting!

128
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,666
Okay that's it, I'm gonna go
run laps around the school!

129
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,533
That's enough!
We'll have
self-study today!

130
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:52,933
It's eight o'clock, and so many
people are still not here!
I can't wait any longer!

131
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,166
I have four dates lined up for
today. I can't keep hanging
around here with you slowpokes.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,700
I've got to go home and
get ready for all of them!

133
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,966
Class dismissed!

134
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,500
Then I'm going home, too!
There's nothing for me to
do now that I've finished
my entire lunch!

135
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,466
Yeah, good idea!
You know the old saying:

136
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,400
"Life is short, so grab the
first guy with glasses and a
blue school uniform you see!"

137
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,000
No one ever said
that but you!
No one ever said
that but you!

138
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,966
Anyway, we can't waste
any more precious time
waiting around here!

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,133
Right! Let's go home!

140
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,266
Why are all these stores
opening up so early?

141

Huh?

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,966
Thank goodness
I found you!

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,200
Of all the days for Usagi
to leave early, she may
have picked the worst one!

145
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,266
What's the matter?
What's the big
rush about?

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,700
This clock. Something's off
about it. You think you could
take a look at it for me?

147
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,966
Hm. All right, then.
Why don't we take a
quick look inside it?

148
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,433
Oh, hold on.

149
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,466
What's this thing?

150
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,666
In simple terms,
that is a supercomputer.
A very compact one.

151
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,066
<i>It comes in handy</i>
<i>for calculations</i>
<i>or analyzing data.</i>

152
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,666
Really?! I actually
get to keep this?!

153
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,133
Yeah. I was gonna give
it to Usagi, but I'm
not sure she'd get it.

154
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,300
I believe you'll be
able to make better
use of it, Ami.

155
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,500
Wow, thanks, Luna!

156
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,300
<i>Now check that clock.</i>

157
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,133
Right! Sure thing!

158
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:19,456
Ah!

161
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,933
Ami, look
inside here!

162
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,566
<i>[Ami]</i>
<i>It's empty!</i>

I knew it! This isn't
an ordinary clock!

164
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:34,166
I'll bet everyone who's been
acting so strangely just bought
a clock from that new store!

165
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,400

Oh, no! I'm hurt!

00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,792
I've gotta get to the
hospital right away!

169
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,392
Oh, no, I'm going to
miss my plane now!

170
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,925
That means I'll have
to run all the way
to Paris instead!

<i>the greater amounts of energy</i>
<i>we can extract from you!</i>

173
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,592
If I'm able to gather up
all of this nervous energy,

174
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,359
I'm certain that our great ruler
will be most pleased.

175
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,425
Ha ha ha ha ha!

176
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,759
No matter how far away the
humans get from this clock,

177
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:57,259
it will continue to harvest
all of their frenetic energy.

178
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:04,259
You really do
have quite a way
with time, Ramua!

179
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,825
Your magic has
undermined the humans
and their sense of time!

180
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,792
You have done an
excellent job with this.

181
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,959
What kind words.
I thank you, Master.

182
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,592
I'll leave the rest to you.

183

But be warned that this
disturbance may bring
those two guardians.

184
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:20,192
You would be wise
to use caution.

185
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,725
Yes, sir.
I'll handle it.

186

[traffic, honking]

187

Too slow! Too slow!
We're going too slow!

188

Hey! Why is
this bus going
so slowly?!

189
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,959
Just quiet down!
I'm as impatient as
you are to get going!

190
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,725
Well, then do
something about it!

Hehe! haha! hahaha!

I need to get off!
Stop this bus
immediately!

201
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,959
Sorry, this just
became an express!

We're not going to make
any stops until we reach
our final destination!

203

Shut up and
stop the bus!

It's no use.
No one's answering
at the school.

206

But if Usagi's not there,
then where do you think
she could have gone?!

207
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:18,992
I don't know.
This might be dangerous
with just the two of us.

208
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,725
Yeah, we really should
find Usagi first before
we do anything else.

Usagi!
Not so loud!

219
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,159
You can't just stand out
there in the open like that!

220
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:48,759
The enemy
could spot us!

Ohh, What are we waiting for?
Didn't you say that clock
shop is suspicious?!

00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,692
Let's just storm in
there right now and
finish this, Luna!

223
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:58,925
Usagi, you've been completely
bewitched by the monster's
spell! Can't you feel it?

224
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,659
I simply don't have time to
discuss that kind of thing!

225
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,259
I have a lot of things
to accomplish today!

226
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,725
First off, I have to get home,
then eat a pork bun,

227
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,192
after that, finish
playing my video game,

228
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,292
take a bath and then--

229
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:09,992
Oh no look what
time it is already!

230
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,959
Okay, Usagi,
calm down.
We get it.

231
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:16,325
Just try to hold on for a
moment, and we'll think of a
way to get inside. Right, Ami?

232
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,625
Well, I suppose that
we could try sneaking
in from the back.

233
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,392
But the enemy might
expect that and be
waiting for us.

234
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,125
Oh we'll go in
through the front!

235
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,992
The enemy's going
to attack us either
way so let's just hurry
up and transform!

236
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,225
Come on, Ami,
let's do this!

237
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,225

I am the pretty guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

253

I am Sailor Moon!

here very quickly.

anyone get away with wasting
a girl's precious time!

258
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,925
I bet even the cuckoo in
a cuckoo clock is angry!

Come on!

Be careful, Sailor Moon.
That monster has probably
set a trap here.

00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,925
This is so

00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:41,448
Uh...

297
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:44,359
I am Sailor Moon, the
shriveled-up guardian.

298
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,292
Mmh! Oh man! What a
terrifying thought!

299
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,859
Strange. No one's here.

300
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,759
<i>[Sailor Moon]</i>
<i>What's taking so long?!</i>

301
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,825
Give me one
more second.
Augghh!

302
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,692
<i>[Sailor Mercury]</i>
<i>Just as I thought!</i>

303
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,592
Oh, yeah?

304
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,125
There's a pattern to this
labyrinth, and I think
I can figure it out.

305
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,859
Great! So where can
we find the monster?!

306
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:19,192
I'm seventy-eight
percent certain that
she's... this way!

307
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,925
Come on,
let's go!

308
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:21,659
Yeah!

309
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:34,692
[chuckle]

310
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:38,092
You have done well to make
it this far, Sailor Moon.

311
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,292
But it's over!
You've reached
the end!

312
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,692
Wrong! You're the one
who's reached the end!

313
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,792
[weak]
Ah! Ahh...

314
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,092
I can't stand up!
What's happening to me?

315
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:53,259
[Ramua]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

316
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,825
The effects are finally
starting to show.

317
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:00,025
By now, Sailor Moon,
my clock has drained away
nearly all of your energy!

318
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,125
[gasp]

319
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:02,725
Her energy?!

320
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,892
Now take this!

321
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,159
My face!

322
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,125
Waaaaah!

323
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:09,959
Sailor Moon!

324
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:11,159
Back off!

325
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,159
Haaa!

326
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:15,225
Aagh!

327
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:20,925
<i>Can't move!</i>

328
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:25,959
[snickering] I have stopped
time entirely for you!

329
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,759
And now you will get to
watch in silence as I
make Sailor Moon suffer!

330
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,892
Ha ha ha ha ha!

331
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,992
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

332
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,892
Ah ha ha ha ha!

333
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:39,325
<i>[Sailor Moon]</i>
<i>Help!</i>

334
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:42,648
Huh?

335
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,192
Ha ha ha ha!

336
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,359
Huh??

337
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,092
Ah! My energy's coming back!

338
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:54,959
The Energy!
it's escaping!

339
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,192
Ah! I can
move again!

340
00:20:58,825 --> 00:20:59,859
Bubble...

341
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:06,725
...Spray!

342
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,859
Where are you?!
Damn it!

343
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,659
Are you okay,
Sailor Moon?

344
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:15,592
Thanks a lot, but
I'm all right now.

345
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,125
The monster's
right there!

346
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:20,359
Got it!

347
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:38,625
Moon Tiara Action!

348
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,992
Ahh! Ahhh!

349
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:55,625
Ah!

350
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:58,059
Usagi! Ami!
You're okay!

351
00:21:58,092 --> 00:21:58,892
[chuckle]
[chuckle]

352
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:04,125
Oh, boy, that was
totally exhausting!

353
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,092
I think I've had just about
all the excitement that I
can handle for one day!

354
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,025
Usagi! I have
huge news!

355
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,792
The bakery is offering
free cakes to whoever can
eat them the fastest!

356
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:13,892
What? No way!

357
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:14,825
We gotta hurry!

358
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,425
[giggle]

359
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,092
Ack!

360
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,425
Owowowowowow!

361
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:24,592
She's gonna be like
this for the rest of
her life, isn't she?

362
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:27,092
Yep! She sure is!

363
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:31,259
Waahhh!
