Huh?

I don't know, but
Sis has been acting
really strange the
last couple of days.

170
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,250
She's become so
aggressive whenever
she plays tennis.
In all the time we've

171
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:08,417
spent together, she's
never been like this.
It's as if she's become
a different person.

172
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,750
Do you think she's
just on-edge because
of the big tournament
coming up?

173
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:15,750
That was my first guess
too, but now I think
it's more than that.

really terrible has
happened to make her

(Screams)

289
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,260
Sailor Moon!

290
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,294
Well, what do you
know.

291
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:33,827
Looks like she's
finally becoming a
guardian in her own right.

292
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,527
Heh. (Gasps)
He's gone!

293
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,660
Tuxedo Mask looked
bad. I hope he's doing
all right.

294
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:49,160
I talked to Sis the
other day and she
says she can't remember
anything that happened

295
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:50,694
during the last few
days.

296
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:54,060
As long as she's doing
okay now, that other
stuff doesn't really
matter!

297
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:55,460
Hm- I guess.

298
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:59,360
(Laughs)
Naru, you want to play
a set with me?

299
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:03,194
Sure! That sound's
like a whole lot of
fun!

300
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:05,527
(Chuckles)

301
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,094
(Naru)
Go easy on me,
though!

302
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,294
<i>(Rui)</i>
<i>Sorry, no can do!</i>

303
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,427
<i>(Rui)</i>
<i>Why don't you serve</i>
<i>first?</i>

304
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,360
<i>(Naru)</i>
<i>Okay! Watch out!</i>
<i>Here comes my killer</i>
<i>serve!</i>

305
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:21,627
(Sighs)
It would be so great
if I could play tennis
with Tuxedo Mask!

306
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,494
<i>(Naru gasps)</i>
<i>Look out!</i>

307
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:27,660
Oy-yoy-yoy.

308
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,160
<i>(Naru)</i>
<i>Sorry, Usagi!</i>

309
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:33,227
<i>(Naru)</i>
<i>Usagi, pull yourself</i>
<i>together!</i>

310
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,494
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>Hey, Usagi! What are</i>
<i>you doing?</i>

311
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:16,094
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Shh! Rei is in the</i>
<i>middle of a date!</i>

312
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,627
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>Why are you snooping</i>
<i>on them?</i>

313
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,527
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Quiet! Oh, man! She's</i>
<i>got her arm around him!</i>

314
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,194
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>What, are you jealous?</i>

315
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:26,360
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>Am not! I think dating</i>
<i>is stupid!</i>
<i>(Forced Chuckle)</i>

316
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,460
<i>(Luna)</i>
<i>Then what are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>

317
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:33,994
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon,</i>
<i>"Usagi's Panic: Rei's</i>
<i>First Date."</i>

318
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:37,160
<i>(Usagi)</i>
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
