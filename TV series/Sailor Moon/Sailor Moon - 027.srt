1
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,093
Unforgivable! How
dare you corrupt an
innocent young man's
feelings!

2
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:07,993
As long as the moon
shines in the sky,
no evil deed will
go unnoticed!

3
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,893
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights
for love and for
justice!

4
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:17,093
I am Sailor Moon!
And in the name of
the moon, I'll
punish you.

5
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,627
Hey! I'm Usagi
Tsukino!

6
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,693
You know me as the
Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and
for justice!

7
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,627
I am Sailor Moon!

8
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,793
And now, a fourth
Sailor Guardian has
appeared! She has a
heart of gold and

9
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:42,060
is super strong!
She is Makoto Kino,
also known as Sailor
Jupiter!

10
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:45,960
When the four Pretty
Guardians get together,
nothing can stop us!

11
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:47,693
(giggles)

12
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,793
<i>Crushing on Ami:</i>
<i>The Boy Who Can See</i>
<i>The Future.</i>

13
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,360
There are seven
Rainbow Crystals in
total. And we will
not be able to obtain

14
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:05,760
the Legendary Sliver
Crystal unless we
gather all seven.

15
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,893
I'm sure you're
already well
aware of this.

16
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,227
Yes.

17
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,827
At the moment, we
have one of them
in our possession.
Only one...

18
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,693
Because you failed
to bring me another
one. Instead you
allowed Tuxedo Mask

19
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:18,627
to take it.

20
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,160
I apologize,
my Queen.

21
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,327
Don't worry, Queen
Beryl. That's not
about to happen
again. I'm sure

22
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,127
he's about to go
after all the other
Rainbow Crystals.

23
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,327
The next time he
appears, we will
destroy him and
reclaim the Rainbow

24
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,993
Crystal that
he possesses.

25
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:35,960
That better happen
soon and don't forget,
I want the other
five crystals as well.

26
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:40,960
We need to have all
seven of those crystals
in our possession to
revive our Great Ruler!

27
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:52,327
Miss Mizuno!
Please wait up!

28
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,060
Oh, hi Ryo!
Good morning!

29
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,927
G-Good morning!
Uh, I was, uh...

30
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,693
What is it?
Is something
wrong?

31
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:05,793
Oh no!

32
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:07,560
<i>Look out!</i>

33
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:19,027
(shocked breath)

34
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,193
Are you
all right?!

35
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,060
<i>Did you</i>
<i>get hurt!</i>

36
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:36,960
Ugh. Mom's gonna
be mad at me again.

37
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:40,227
Well she should be,
that's one awful
score you got there.

38
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,927
You have to study
a lot harder.

39
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,860
(chuckling)

40
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:44,193
You and me
both!

41
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,260
(laughing)

42
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:48,693
This sucks...

43
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:52,760
Who's this Ryo
Urawa? He got
a perfect score!

44
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,927
<i>Ami came in</i>
<i>second?!</i>

45
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,993
I can't believe
there's somebody
better!

46
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:58,227
Ami!

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,293
What a bummer,
huh?

48
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:03,827
Yeah, I was one
point short of a
perfect score. I
guess I'll need to

49
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
study even harder
next time.

50
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:08,827
Wow, I really
don't get her
sometimes...

51
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:13,693
Ryo Urawa, the guy
who got the perfect
score, is in the same
class as you, right?

52
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:16,993
Yeah! What makes it
even more impressive
is that he just
transferred to this

53
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:19,193
school. Oh,
hi Ryo!

54
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:23,227
Hm? Oh, uh...
Miss Mizuno.

55
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,760
Ohh!

56
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:53,927
Here. You should
try to relax and
not get so upset.

57
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:56,693
Good luck!

58
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,527
<i>Miss Mizuno...</i>

59
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,727
Just as I suspected,
you have a crush
on Ami!

60
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,060
That's an old article
about her when she
took first place in
the nation!

61
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:11,693
By the looks of it
you've had a major
crush on her forever,
haven't you?

62
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:15,593
It's not that at
all. All I'm trying
to do is study as
hard as I can so

63
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:17,693
eventually I can
be as smart as
she is.

64
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:22,893
And thanks to all
that extra studying,
now you've actually
beat her! Way to go!

65
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,093
Not true!

66
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,927
This time I just
happened to get
very lucky.

67
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:32,127
I don't even come
close to her level
of intelligence.

68
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,160
And what's more. How
I might feel about
her doesn't make a
bit of difference.

69
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,627
Huh?

70
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,427
Just forget it...

71
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,860
Have no fear! I'm
an expert when it
comes to solving
love problems!

72
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:54,760
Just let me
handle it!

73
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,827
Wait! Miss
Tsukino!

74
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,727
You should be
careful today,
whenever you're
near any water.

75
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,827
Huh? Water?

76
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
All done!

77
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,493
Ahh!

78
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,460
Guess I should've
mentioned that
sooner.

79
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:11,160
(crying)

80
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,027
That's cold!

81
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,727
Sorry about
that...

82
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,493
I'll leave it up
to you, Mamoru.
Where should we
go next?

83
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,493
Uhh...
Well...

84
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm starting to
learn about my
past, little by
little. But there

85
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:30,060
are still so many
things I don't
know. Guess the
only way to pull

86
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:33,593
it all together
is to turn into
Tuxedo Mask and
find the Legendary

87
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:34,727
Silver Crystal.

88
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,560
Hey there,
I'm waiting!

89
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,393
Oh! I'm sorry.
What did you say?

90
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:42,993
You've been acting
weird lately. What's
going on? Has
something happened?

91
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,493
No. Same stuff as
always. Let's go.

92
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,060
(giggles)

93
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:57,827
Here! This is
for you!

94
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,427
I can...
keep this?

95
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,527
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,060
Now you don't have
to carry around that
newspaper clipping!

97
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,627
<i>Pretty cute,</i>
<i>huh?!</i>

98
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,560
You don't often
see her making
that kind of face.

99
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:18,593
The Moon Stick
is reacting. I
wonder if this
boy could be...

100
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:21,527
I really love it.
Thanks so much for
giving it to me.

101
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,493
Oh, you don't have
to thank me! More
importantly, have
you thought about

102
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,027
when you're going
to tell Ami how
you feel?!

103
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,593
Hm... My mind was
made up from the
very moment I found
out I was transferring

104
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:36,327
to the same school as
Ami. I decided I'd tell
her when I measured up
to her academically.

105
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,527
Well, that means
you're good to
go any time.

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,493
Ah... Yeah,
but...

107
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:43,427
So, here's the
plan! Once Ami
is finished with
her cram school

108
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,427
today I'll get
her and bring
her to you!

109
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,893
Wait for us,
all right?

110
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,760
Take your time!

111
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,593
I'm not
ready, yet.

112
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,327
(evil chuckle)

113
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:09,793
So completely innocent
and naive. It's almost
difficult to believe
that he is one of the

114
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:11,593
Seven Great
Monsters.

115
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:17,760
Usagi...

116
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:20,960
There's something
I've been meaning
to tell you. But I
wanted to be sure

117
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,427
before I said
anything.

118
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,393
What is it?

119
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,693
(giggling)

120
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,493
Hey there, Ami!

121
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,293
Oh, hi, Usagi!
What brings
you here?

122
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,527
Well, I'd thought
I'd take you to
this awesome place
I just found!

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,093
Huh?

124
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,427
C'mon, Ami!
Let's go!

125
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:38,760
Hey!!

126
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,193
(giggling)

127
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:55,293
Welcome home.
I've been dying
to meet you.

128
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,393
So you must
be Zoisite!

129
00:09:58,427 --> 00:09:59,293
S'cuse me?

130
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,727
Explain yourself!
How do you know
my name?

131
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,360
Ever since I was
little I've had the
power to know about
things before they

132
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:12,760
happen. Lately this
ability to see into
the future has been
growing stronger.

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm now fully aware
of my true identity.
Even though I would
rather not be.

134
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,627
Ha ha ha! That
makes my job a
lot easier. Now,
transform into

135
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,893
your Great Monster
persona and kneel
before your master.

136
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,360
No I won't!

137
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,260
I would rather be
put to death right
this minute, than
become a slave...

138
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,227
...to a demon!

139
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,493
Zoi!

140
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,260
Ahh!

141
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,160
Now be a good
little boy and
accept your fate.

142
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,227
(painful grunts)

143
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,560
C'mon! Hurry up!

144
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,393
Wait, look
it's Zoisite!

145
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,727
(painful grunts)

146
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,293
Oh no, he's
attacking Ryo!

147
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,493
Both of you
transform
immediately!

148
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:10,627
Moon Prism Power
Make up!

149
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:53,693
Mercury Power!
Make up!

150
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,493
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

151
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,427
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

152
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,127
That's enough!

153
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,393
Zoisite!

154
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:37,093
As long as the moon
shines in the sky,
no evil deed will
go unnoticed!

155
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:39,827
I am the Pretty
Guardian who
fights for love
and for justice!

156
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,560
I am Sailor Moon!

157
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,560
And I am
Sailor
Mercury!

158
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,260
Let that
boy go!

159
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:51,593
How dare you
interfere!

160
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,260
Sailor Mercury,
take Ryo someplace
where he'll be safe!

161
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:56,760
Right!

162
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:09,327
I don't have the
time to play games
with you little girl.

163
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,460
Zoi!

164
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,760
Ahh!

165
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,427
Where'd he go?
Huh?!

166
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:30,493
We should be safe
for now, but how
are you feeling,Ryo?

167
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,027
Thank you so much
for saving my life.
Miss Mizuno.

168
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,993
(gasp)

169
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,027
He said my name.
How does he know
I'm Sailor Mercury.

170
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:47,127
How far did Mercury
go? There's no sign
of them anywhere!

171
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,393
Try using your
Moon Stick!

172
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:53,193
Trust me on this.
If you use the Moon
Stick, you should be
able to find Ryo and

173
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:56,327
Sailor Mercury
right away. It
will react to
their location.

174
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,693
What are you
talking about?
Ryo would have
to be a Rainbow

175
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,660
Crystal Monster
for that stick
to work!

176
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,227
Well, he is one!

177
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,093
What?!

178
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:07,227
If we don't hurry
Sailor Mercury is
gonna be in danger!

179
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,393
Are you sure?

180
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,060
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

181
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,427
Ahh!

182
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,127
Huh?

183
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,460
What's he doing
with a photo of
me?

184
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:42,927
Not again...

185
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:46,060
I think you were
having a very
bad dream.

186
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:50,593
I wasn't dreaming.
I was seeing a
glimpse into the
future.

187
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:51,327
Huh?

188
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,260
I have a mysterious
power that allows
me to predict the
future. That's how

189
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,227
I was able to get
a perfect score on
the midterm exam.

190
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,260
What are you
talking about?

191
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,960
I know who you
really are, Miss
Mizuno...

192
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:08,093
I've looked up to
you for a long time.
And now, as much as
I've tried to deny

193
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,027
it, apparently
it's my fate to
fight you.

194
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:12,260
(giggle)

195
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,760
You don't believe
me, do you?

196
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:18,260
I don't. You seem
so sure about what
will happen later
on, but maybe you've

197
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:23,027
got it all wrong.
Like mistaking me
for this Miss
Mizuno...

198
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:28,160
All right then, it's
obvious you don't
understand what I'm
trying to say. But...

199
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,660
What?

200
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:34,927
When I do turn into
an evil monster.
Don't hesitate to
kill me immediately!

201
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:39,527
That's my future.
And it cannot
be changed.

202
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:46,493
You're wrong! The
future is something
you create yourself.

203
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:51,027
If you give into
negative thoughts,
nothing will change.
You can create any

204
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,327
fate you want, if
you just believe in
yourself enough to
know you can do it.

205
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,827
Hm.

206
00:15:56,827 --> 00:16:00,927
You're right.
Thank you,
Sailor Mercury.

207
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,927
Oh my...
How touching...

208
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:10,260
Do you really think
you can escape from
the power of the
Dark Crystal?

209
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,493
Zoisite!

210
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:17,227
Ah. You're defending
him. I wonder if you'll
still be willing to do
that when you see him

211
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,027
in his true form.

212
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,327
Ahhh!

213
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,260
Ryo!

214
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,260
Watch closely, as
you are about to
see the emergence
of Bunboo, one of

215
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,060
the Seven Great
Monsters!

216
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,960
C'mon, Bunboo, get
her! I want you
to destroy that
Sailor Guardian!

217
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,027
Are you okay?!

218
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,360
Bunboo!

219
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:57,827
Ryo, is that you?

220
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,927
The future is
something you
create yourself.

221
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:10,227
(gasp)

222
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,160
Bunboo!

223
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,327
(painful grunt)

224
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:19,027
(gasp)

225
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,993
He still has
human emotions!
Fool!

226
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,360
Bunboo!

227
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:33,093
You will obey me!
Sailor Mercury is
your enemy!

228
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:37,893
Go! Take back
the Rainbow
Crystal that
belongs to us!

229
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,793
Bunboo!

230
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,027
Hey, Zoisite!

231
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:49,960
Unforgivable! How
dare you corrupt
an innocent young
man's feelings

232
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,960
for your own
selfish purposes!

233
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:54,460
I'm afraid you've
got the wrong
idea about him.

234
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:57,693
That boy's true
form is the monster
you see now!

235
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:03,027
Unforgivable!
Absolutely
unforgivable!

236
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,293
Now, in the name
of the moon, I'll
punish you.

237
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,460
Sailor Moon, wait!
Please use your Moon
Stick and turn Ryo

238
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:12,327
back into a
human first!

239
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,127
Got it!

240
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:21,260
Moon Healing
Escalation!

241
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:24,793
<i>Bun-boo!</i>

242
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:26,327
I don't get it!
Why isn't it
working?!

243
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,127
It's no use! Ryo's
completely under
the control of their
evil power right now.

244
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,060
In order to turn him
back, you'll first
have to weaken his
energy levels.

245
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,393
Do it! We have
no other choice,
Sailor Moon.

246
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:51,227
When I do turn into
an evil monster.
Don't hesitate to
kill me immediately!

247
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,927
It'll be all right,
Ryo. We'll make sure
you return to normal
again.

248
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,860
Bunboo!

249
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:00,727
Ahhh!

250
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:03,893
Ahhh!

251
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,260
Bunboo!

252
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,293
Fire!

253
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,327
Soul!

254
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:17,993
Supreme!

255
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:24,360
Thunder!

256
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,360
We almost missed
all the action. It's
a good thing we made
it in time!

257
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:34,993
Yeah, that's
for sure.

258
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,593
Bubble!

259
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,260
Spray!

260
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,627
Bunboo...

261
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,093
Now, Sailor Moon!
Use your power to
restore Ryo back
into a human!

262
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,127
Moon Tiara!

263
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:08,160
Action!

264
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:16,193
Ahhh!
Bunboo!

265
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:20,160
His monster energy
has weakened a lot!
Do it, Sailor Moon!

266
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:29,693
Moon Healing
Escalation!

267
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,160
(struggling breaths)

268
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:34,827
Refresh!

269
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:40,627
Ryo!

270
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,993
I'll get you
next time!

271
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,660
Talk to
me, Ryo.

272
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:54,160
Are you
all right?

273
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,293
You saved me...

274
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,993
So, the third Rainbow
Crystal is now in the
hands of the Sailor
Guardians. I shall

275
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,260
leave them alone
for tonight...

276
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:18,660
<i>You're transferring</i>
<i>to another school</i>
<i>again? Why can't you</i>
<i>just stay here?</i>

277
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:22,960
Well, it wasn't my
idea, but it can't
be helped. My dad
got a work transfer.

278
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:25,927
We were all
becoming friends.
It's just not fair!

279
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,660
Yeah, you're right.
Um, Miss Mizuno?

280
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:32,060
Ryo, just call me
Ami, all right?

281
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:36,027
Uh, Ami, I
better give this
photo back.

282
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:47,227
I'm gonna study hard
and when I'm able to
outscore you on my
own merits, then I'll

283
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,227
come back for it.

284
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,927
Here's a
different one...

285
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,193
I think this photo
is a better one for
you to remember me
by. I'd like you to

286
00:21:58,227 --> 00:21:59,093
keep it.

287
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:12,969
Don't be so worried
about impressing me
with your grades.

288
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:15,969
You can come visit
me anytime, Ryo!

289
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:12,969
I'm so lucky! I've
been asked to become a
model for a painting!

290
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,335
<i>Really? By who?</i>

291
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,535
None other than the
famous Yumeni Yumeno!

292
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,069
<i>That's amazing!</i>

293
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,902
The only problem is,
I have to pose with
this guy who I really
don't like...

294
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:22,969
I guess you've gotta
take the good with
the bad!

295
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:25,469
<i>Rei will strangle</i>
<i>you if she finds</i>
<i>out!</i>

296
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:26,869
Don't say that!

297
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:33,002
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon,</i>
<i>"The Painting of Love:</i>
<i>Usagi and Mamoru Get</i>
<i>Closer."</i>

298
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:36,035
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
