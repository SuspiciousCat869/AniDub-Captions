1
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:04,200
Oh please, God!
Please! Can you help
mend a sweet young
girl's broken heart?

2
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:10,100
Zoisite! You committed
evil on sacred ground!
You're not gonna get
away with it!

3
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,466
I am Sailor Moon!
And in the name of
God. I'll punish you!

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,333
Hey! I'm Usagi
Tsukino!

5
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:30,033
You know me as the Pretty
Guardian who fights for
love and for justice, I
am Sailor Moon!

6
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:35,166
And now a fourth
Sailor Guardian has
appeared! She has a
heart of gold and is

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,533
super strong!
She's Makoto Kino,
also known as
Sailor Jupiter!

8
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,266
When the four Pretty
Guardians get together,
nothing can stop us!

9
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,733
(giggles)

10
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:56,100
<i>Restore Naru's Smile:</i>
<i>Usagi's Friendship</i>

11
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,766
Please...

12
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,266
Hurry and find the
Silver Crystal.

13
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,666
I don't understand!

14
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,966
What is the
Silver Crystal?
<i>And who are you?!</i>

15
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,400
The Silver Crystal...

16
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:30,500
Find the Silver
Crystal and all
will become clear.

17
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:35,000
Find the Silver
Crystal and all
will become clear.

18
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,433
That dream again...

19
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:55,100
Who is that princess?
Am I Tuxedo Mask?

20
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,566
Silver Crystal...

21
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,966
If I find it, maybe
my questions will
be answered.

22
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,333
As of now, we have
obtained one of the
Rainbow Crystals.

23
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,266
So Zoisite, what is
your next move?

24
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,966
Well, The Dark Crystal
has just detected
another of the
Rainbow Crystals.

25
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,266
Zoi!

26
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:36,400
The next Rainbow
Crystal is inside
this man.

27
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,166
Good. Now
retrieve it.

28
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:54,533
Naru didn't come to
school again today.

29
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:00,200
Nephrite, we're
safe now...

30
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,166
I'm sorry...

31
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Huh?

32
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:09,400
Don't think we'll
be having chocolate
parfait together.

33
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:10,566
(upset gasp)

34
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,200
Please stay!

35
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:21,466
No! You can't go!
You promised that
we would have a
chocolate parfait

36
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,833
together! You can't
just break a promise!
You can't!

37
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:35,200
(sobbing)

38
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,366
Nephrite!

39
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,866
Naru...

40
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,366
Hm? So you're going
to go visit Naru's
house?

41
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,166
Yep. I mean she
hasn't shown up at
school in well over
a week now. I guess

42
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,366
she really hasn't
gotten over
everything yet.

43
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,433
Huh?

44
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,066
You mean it's
something more
serious than
a cold?

45
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,866
Are you kidding
me? How can anyone
possibly be so dense.

46
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,500
Huh?

47
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,400
Nothing... Just
make sure to cheer
Naru up once we get
to her place, okay?

48
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:16,200
Whatever you say
Usagi! I am ready
and willing! You can
totally count on me!

49
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:28,100
I know it's rude to
just show up, but we
were wondering, you
know, how you're doing?

50
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:32,500
Yeah, I mean all this
time, I just assumed
you were gone because
of a really bad cold

51
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:36,900
or something...
Or did somebody just
break your heart?

52
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,233
Don't go there!

53
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,133
Hey! What did you
have to go and
do that for?

54
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,333
Think of another
subject to talk
about!

55
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:50,733
Huh?! Uhh... Did you
wanna go get some
chocolate parfaits
or something?

56
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,866
I cannot
believe you!

57
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,933
<i>Usagi...</i>

58
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,000
Huh?

59
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,033
Let's get out
of here...

60
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
(gasp)

61
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,133
Why don't we all
go out and get
something good
to eat!

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,266
You mean it?

63
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,833
(silly giggle)

64
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,433
A power that's
capable of
destroying the
planet?!

65
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:20,166
<i>Yes. If the Silver</i>
<i>Crystal falls into</i>
<i>the wrong hands, it</i>
<i>could mean the end</i>

66
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,933
of all life as
we know it!

67
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,966
Wow, now that's
a scary thought.

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,933
So, where exactly is
this Silver Crystal?

69
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:30,100
Well we're not really
sure where it is but...

70
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:33,466
We do know that
there are fragments
of it, called
Rainbow Crystals.

71
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,666
Rainbow Crystals?

72
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,933
Yes. The Rainbow
Crystals are pieces
of the Silver Crystal.

73
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:42,033
This all happened a
long, long time ago.

74
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:54,766
A group known as the
Seven Great Monsters
used to serve the
Dark Kingdom.

75
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,833
Someone was able to
seal these evil
monsters in the
fragments of the

76
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:01,000
Legendary Silver
Crystal.

77
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:09,333
Once they were inside
the Rainbow Crystals,
the evil monsters
became good and

78
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,900
descended down
here to the Earth.

79
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Here, they were
reborn as humans
with the Crystals
deep inside of them.

80
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,366
And lived their
lives in peace.

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,166
But Zoisite is
trying to extract the
Rainbow Crystals from
those seven people.

82
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,933
If he obtains all
seven of the Rainbow
Crystals, not only
will he have awoken

83
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:32,300
these fearsome
monsters, but he
will have the Silver
Crystal in his grasp.

84
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,400
Thus our enemy will
have the power to
destroy our world.

85
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,433
Hmph!

86
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:45,733
Well as long as you
got me around, there's
no way that this villains
plan is gonna succeed!

87
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:48,900
<i>Dang it! That was</i>
<i>just what I was</i>
<i>gonna say!</i>

88
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:53,666
Luna, how do we
identify people who
have Rainbow Crystals
inside of them?

89
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,233
The Moon Stick I
gave Usagi reacts
to their presence.

90
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,900
Huh?!

91
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,266
If that's the case,
I'm totally against
leaving the Moon
Stick with Usagi.

92
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,866
<i>Why?</i>

93
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,833
It's useless in her
hands. She'll probably
try to use it as a
hammer or something.

94
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,100
<i>Oh, that's</i>
<i>ridiculous!</i>

95
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,166
<i>Actually, she</i>
<i>might do something</i>
<i>like that...</i>

96
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,366
Hey! I have faith
that Usagi can
handle it!

97
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,966
I know that Usagi is
unreliable and only
has the faintest
sense of duty.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,633
But that's exactly why
I want her to be the
leader, so she can
gain some confidence.

99
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,733
Gain some
confidence?

100
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:36,166
Yes. It's my belief
that if she is given
responsibilities, she

101
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,833
will rise to
the challenge!

102
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,933
I don't think
that'll ever
happen.

103
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:42,766
Come on! Try and
have some faith
in her!

104
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,800
<i>Please, accept</i>
<i>Usagi as your</i>
<i>leader!</i>

105
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,700
Say what you will,
I'm still opposed!

106
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,566
I guess...
She deserves
a chance.

107
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Ami...

108
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,866
(painful groan)

109
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,666
But, maybe we should
see how she does
before committing.

110
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,900
Yep.

111
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,600
Aww, I wish you
guys would believe
in her a little more.

112
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,633
<i>To be fair...</i>

113
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,866
I haven't known
her long enough
to decide.

114
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,200
That's it! If you
get to know Usagi
better, I know
you'll want to

115
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,966
give her a
chance, Mako!

116
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,900
Hey there!

117
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,833
Uh, hey Usagi!

118
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:25,266
<i>We're in the middle</i>
<i>of an important</i>
<i>meeting, here. Do</i>
<i>you think you could</i>

119
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,833
<i>come by for</i>
<i>a bit?</i>

120
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,266
Oh, sorry!

121
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,066
You actually caught
me on my way to
Chinatown with some
friends. The three

122
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,133
of us are going to
have the yummiest
meal ever together!

123
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,300
You see? She has
zero responsibility!

124
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,133
Uh... What's
the matter?

125
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,866
How come you two
are just standing
over here like this?

126
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,633
You do know that
Chinatown's right
over there.

127
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,566
<i>And you brought lots</i>
<i>of money with you,</i>
<i>right Usagi?</i>

128
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,066
There are so
many graves in
this cemetery.

129
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,066
But there's no
grave for Nephrite.

130
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,900
Naru...

131
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,033
Yes! Peking duck
sounds excellent!
They say there's
nothing as tasty

132
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:23,833
as Peking duck!
Oh, I'm so happy!
I've dreamed of
eating Peking duck

133
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,300
since I was
a child!

134
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,800
Oh? Maybe you'd like
me to cook you like
a Peking duck?!

135
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,633
I just want
to eat it...

136
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,133
Huh? Where'd
Naru go?

137
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,133
Hm?

138
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,766
Uh! N-Naru!

139
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,833
<i>Pastor!</i>

140
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,133
Hm?

141
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,100
I don't know
what to do!

142
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,866
Please sir, I
really need you
to tell me.

143
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,033
Someone has died.
Someone dear to me.

144
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:11,100
He was living with so
much pain in his heart.
And I- I just couldn't
save him from it.

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,733
Your feelings for
him are admirable.

146
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,566
I am certain that
his soul's at peace.

147
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,566
But...

148
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,066
But now that he's
gone forever, I'm
left with nothing!

149
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,433
I don't think
that's true.

150
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:28,100
Even now, you are
surrounded with love.

151
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:32,466
All you need to do
is turn around and
love will be there
for you.

152
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Turn around?
Huh?!

153
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,600
Uh, who are you?!

154
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,200
What do we
have here?

155
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,766
(gasp)

156
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:53,466
You again?!
You're the guy
who attacked us!

157
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,900
What a coincidence...

158
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,400
<i>...running into</i>
<i>you here.</i>

159
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,866
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

160
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,900
<i>Sailor Moon!</i>

161
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,133
Naru!

162
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,133
<i>Naru!</i>

163
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:34,433
Where on earth
could she have run
off to? Huh?

164
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,033
What is that?

165
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,866
Oh no! The stick's
picking up a signal!

166
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,866
Luna! What're you
doing here?

167
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,366
Never mind that!
Just take the stick
our of your bag,
quickly!

168
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,333
Right! No need
to yell at me!

169
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:54,933
That means the Stick
has just located one
of the seven Rainbow
Crystals!

170
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,033
Seven Rainbow
Crystals?

171
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,933
I'll explain
everything later!

172
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:02,100
<i>There's a chance a</i>
<i>monster might appear</i>
<i>at the signal's source!</i>

173
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,066
What?!

174
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,700
<i>Call Mako on the</i>
<i>communicator!</i>

175
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,466
Wait, you mean
Mako's in the
area too?!

176
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,566
The signal is coming
from the cemetery?
Got it!

177
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,366
I'll be right
there!

178
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,966
The signal is
getting stronger!

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Hurry!

180
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,333
And just who
are you?

181
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:25,400
Wouldn't you rather
know more about
yourself than about
a stranger?

182
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm just a
simple pastor.

183
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,533
(amused chuckle)

184
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,033
<i>Is that what</i>
<i>you think?</i>

185
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:34,800
Why don't we let
this Dark Crystal
reveal to the world
who you really are?

186
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,066
That crystal
belonged to
Nephrite!

187
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,066
Stop!

188
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,433
<i>Let go!</i>

189
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,033
Stop using that
for evil!

190
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,833
Oh no, it's
Naru!

191
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:44,933
You should wait
until Mako gets
here!

192
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:48,500
How do you expect
me to wait? Naru's
in danger!

193
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:53,333
<i>Moon Prism Power</i>
<i>Make Up!</i>

194
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,066
This violence
must stop!

195
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,733
How compassionate.
You really should
worry about yourself.

196
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,466
<i>Hold it right</i>

197

Who's there?!

198
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,000
Sailor Moon!

199
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:45,000
Trying to commit evil
on sacred ground?
You won't get away
with it!

200
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,666
(amazed gasp)

201
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,966
In the name of
the Moon, I'll
punish you!

202
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Heh! Well, look
who's here...

203
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:55,466
<i>It's too late!</i>
<i>I'll be taking the</i>

207
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,333
Oh no!

208
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,200
That's it!

209
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,933
It's mine. Come
forth, Rainbow
Crystal!

210
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,866
Ahh!!

211
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,200
Leave him alone!

212
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,666
The Crystal's
getting away!

213
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,366
<i>Pastor!</i>

214
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,533
Where did it
go? Where's the
Crystal?

215
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,600
Pastor, you're
safe...

216
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,800
Wrong...

217
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,933
I am no pastor...

218
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:52,200
I have been reborn!
My name is Boxii!

219
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,666
No way...

220
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,833
(chuckles)

221
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:59,266
I hear the roaring
of the crowd as the
fans cheer me on!

222
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,266
(crowd cheering)

223
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm the champion!
Wow!

224
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:11,300
Boxii, be a good
sport and knock out
Sailor Moon!

225
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,633
Hold on! I don't
know anything about
boxing!

226
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,866
Great! Let's fight
and see who's the
real champion!

227
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Ehh, I told you
I don't box!

228
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,333
Come on!

229
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,300
No way!

230
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,733
I'm a champion!
Lovely punch!

231
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:32,533
Ahh!!

232
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,166
Sailor Moon!

233
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,233
Aww, come on,
hurry up Mako!

234
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,366
I, am the king
of kings.

235
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,133
Stop it!

236
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:45,366
Boxii, I'm begging
you! Please turn
back into the kind
pastor!

237
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,333
I've heard enough
of your yapping!

238
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,700
Naru!

239
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,733
Ahh!!

240
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:00,133
Umino!

241
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,633
I'm a champion!
Lovely punch!

242
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,666
Look out,
Sailor Moon!

243
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,666
(gasp)

244
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:10,700
(shocked gasp)

245
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,733
Thank you,
Tuxedo Mask!

246
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,566
Huh?!

247
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,300
Boxers are gentlemen!
They never hit beautiful
young ladies!

248
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,600
They embrace them
with tenderness!

249
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:30,500
Boxii! Knock out
that pathetic
nuisance, this
instance!

250
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,733
All right!
C'mon!
Lovely punch!

251
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,800
Ahh!!

252
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:40,133
(angry growl)

253
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:47,533
I'm a champion!
Triple Punch!

254
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,333
Child's play!

255
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,266
What's this?

256
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,633
Mako! Transform!

257
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,766
Got it!

258
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:02,100
Jupiter Power
Make up!

259
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Sailor Jupiter!

260
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,633
Oh? A new
challenger!

261
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,900
(angry growl)

262
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:31,300
Jupiter, my
guardian planet!
Bring forth a storm!
Summon the clouds!

263
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,600
And bring down
your thunder!

264
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:42,033
Supreme
Thunder!

265
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:46,100
Ahh!

266
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,166
Do it!
Sailor Moon!

267
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Right!

268
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:04,500
Moon Healing
Escalation!

269
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,300
(struggling grunts)

270
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,700
Refresh!

271
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:24,400
Do you believe in
God? I believe in
Him. Go forth, and
love your fellow man!

272
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,066
(laughter)

273
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
The Crystal!

274
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,466
I'll be taking the
Rainbow Crystal!
Farewell!

275
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,633
I promise I will
take it back from
you someday!

276
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:41,133
Sailor Moon! Go
get that Rainbow
Crystal back!

277
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,633
Tuxedo Mask
saved me...

278
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,933
(nervous laughter)

279
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:08,266
At last, I finally
understand who I
really am.

280
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,633
I have been Tuxedo
Mask all along.

281
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,433
There...

282
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,266
Thank you
very much!

283
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,800
Naru, but
that's...

284
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah, but it's fine.
Umino did get hurt
trying to save me
back there.

285
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:27,500
(nervous giggle)

286
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:28,433
Yeah...

287
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:29,766
<i>Usagi...</i>

288
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,233
I'm sorry that I
made you worry. I'll
be back at school
tomorrow.

289
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,000
Sounds good!

290
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:58,533
I'm sorry, Mako.
I was hoping you'd
see Usagi's good
side, but it looks

291
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:00,933
like it was
nothing but a
waste of your
time.

292
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:05,066
Well, I'll admit
that she does seem
to care a lot about
her friends.

293
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,166
That's true!

294
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,400
That music...

295
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:14,266
It's nice.
Where's it
from?

296
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,166
Oh...

297
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,333
You know...

298
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,966
Hey Luna, it looks
like Ami might have
a boyfriend!

299
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,233
<i>Maybe so, but she's</i>
<i>still working hard</i>
<i>on her academics.</i>

300
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,966
<i>Compared to her</i>
<i>Usagi, you're just</i>
<i>so...</i>

301
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,433
What are you implying,
Luna? I'm working very
hard to find romance!

302
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:25,866
<i>It's the only thing</i>
<i>you're working on!</i>

303
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,766
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Moon, "Crushing on Ami:</i>
<i>The Boy Who Can See</i>
<i>the Future"</i>

304
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,800
The moonlight is
a messenger of love.
