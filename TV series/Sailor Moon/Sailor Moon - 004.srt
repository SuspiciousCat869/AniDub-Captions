00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,035
Keep in mind that a mere five
minutes in the Shape Ray,

156
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:34,739
and you'll be the fittest
that you've ever been in
your entire life!

157
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,477
That's it! I bet that's
how Ms. Haruna got that
fit in just one day.

158
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:40,511
I'm going in!

159
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:41,480
Yeah!

160
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:42,413
I will, too!

161
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:43,549
Heh.

Yes. I'm here,

No need to worry.

168

We are continuing to
gather a large amount
of human energy for
our great ruler.

169
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,541
I see. Then proceed as planned.

170
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,478
Right! These foolish women
are determined to lose
weight no matter what,

171
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:47,715
so I'm sure that
this plan will be a
complete success.

I... feel so...

173
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,724
So tired...

174
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,460
Isn't that a small price
for how attractive you
all will become?

175
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,562
Yeah!

176
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:02,831
It is.

177
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:03,865
Totally!

178
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,601
And if you come
back tomorrow,

179
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,571
you'll become
even more stunning.

I still can't believe that Naru
and the rest of the girls just
left me behind at that gym!

188
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,771
Boy, some friends they
turned out to be!

189
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:15,907

Those are some

pork buns!

Er... Eh...

195
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:34,427
Mom! A scary girl tried
to take my pork buns!

196
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,563
I've been dazzled
by pork buns.
How pathetic!

197
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:40,899
I just can't stop
thinking about food!

198

Maybe.

You want to go
to a hospital?

205

I'd much rather
go to a restaurant.

Huh?!

207
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:04,892
I haven't eaten a single
thing since yesterday!
So hungry.

Motoki...
Yes, I think so!

212

Good, just stay strong.
And hopefully the energy
of love will help you to
recover quickly.

213
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,722
The energy of love?

214
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,859
That's right.
My love for you.

Well, I'm glad you're
feeling better!

223
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:12,296
But what did you mean when
you said that you hadn't
eaten since yesterday?

224
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,398
Ah! Umm...

225
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:18,669
Don't tell me you did so
poorly on a test that your
mother refused to feed you for
a day or something like that!

226
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,904
Of course not;
it's nothing like that!

227
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,674
I just thought that I'd go
on a little diet, that's all!

228
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:26,076
A diet?!
Ha ha ha ha!

229
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:29,113
What is it?!
What's so funny?!

230
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:34,785
Sorry! I don't mean to
laugh, it's just that I
don't know where you got the
idea that you need to diet!

231
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,955
If anything, you could
stand to gain some weight!

232
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,156
Huh?

233
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,591
Personally, I find
curvy people to be
much more attractive.

234
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:44,096
I mean, I can't understand
why a girl would want to be
nothing but skin and bones.

235
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:46,165
What? Really?

236
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:47,699
Yeah!

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,569
Wow, you're the best!

238
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:54,139
So good! Nothing's
better than a pork bun!

239
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:56,709
I'm still young,
after all.

240
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,345
I can carry a little
extra weight!

241

<i>What do we</i>
<i>have here?</i>

242
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,050
Now, would you call that
cannibalism, a bunhead
eating a pork bun?

243
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,888
Just leave me alone!
Why do you care what
I eat, anyway?!

244
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,758
If you keep eating like
that, you just might
turn into a pork bun.

245
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:13,659
Oh, shut up!

246
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:15,996
What a catch!

247
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,632
Thanks for this!

248
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,668
Plus it means one less
for you to eat, bunhead.

249
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:24,971
That jerk and his
dumb glasses!

250
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,773
He does kinda have
a point, though.

251
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:27,741
Huh?

252
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,945
If you keep eating like
that, then you're just
going to have to work
even harder to stay fit!

255
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:40,755
Motoki told me that I'm
pretty just the way I am.

256
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:44,625
But I wonder if you
might be getting all
this wrong, Usagi.

257
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,294
How so?

258
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,461
He said that he prefers
girls that aren't just
skin and bones,

259
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:50,865
but you can go
too far the other
way, too, y'know?

260
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:51,732
Mmff!

261
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,002
But never mind that!
There's a bigger problem!

262
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:55,803
Oh no, you're right!

263
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:58,907
Let's see,
One, two, three, four...

264
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,109
I ate six pork buns today!

265
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:04,046
I mean Ms. Haruna has been
acting really strange lately,

266
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,814
and she looks like she's
wasting away to nothing!

267
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:08,684
Oh, boy. Six?!
That means...

268
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:10,653
Ah! No way!

269
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,521
And it isn't
only Ms. Haruna!

270
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,125
A lot of the girls who went
to work out at Shapelin
have become far too thin!

271
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,661
Something is going on
down there at that gym!

272
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,129
Hey, are you
listening?

273
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,797
Then it's gotta
be Shapelin!

274
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,932
Yes!

275
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,071
Shapelin is the only thing
that can save me from turning
into a total nightmare!

276
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:32,075
Wait! Usagi! That's
not what I was saying!

277
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,143
Oh, boy.

278
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,679

282
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,191
Hold on!

283
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:49,259

is gonna pay the price!

310
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:00,867
[whimper]

311
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,869
<i>If we don't hurry,</i>

312
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:03,503
Ms. Haruna could
really die,

313
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:07,074
so you have to turn into
Sailor Moon right away
and save her, Usagi.

314
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:09,176
What? Just like that?
But it's so sudden!

315
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,912
Shut up and just do it!

316
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,914
[whimper]

317
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:17,018
Okay, okay! I get it!
[sob]

318
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:18,919
Actually, I don't
get it at all!

319
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:23,324
Moon Prism Power Make Up!

320
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,034
[terrified moans]

321
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:07,137
Hm. Just a little more
until we reach our goal!

322
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,440
<i>Release Ms. Haruna</i>
<i>at once!</i>

323
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:10,406
Huh?!

324
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,044
Preying on the dreams of
girls who want to be fit!

325
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:16,212
You're an unforgivable
enemy of all women!

326
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,183
Heh. So it's you again?

327
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,051
You bet it is!

328
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:22,286
I am the pretty guardian,

329
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,356
Who fights for love
and for justice!

330
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,163
I am Sailor Moon!

331
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:37,269
And now, in the name of the
moon, you will be punished!

332
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:41,306
Heh! You impudent brat!
Take care of her!

333
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,009
[chuckle]

334
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,244
Raaagh!

335
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:48,378
Raaghaha!

336
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:49,412
Ahh!

337
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:52,882
Oh no, they have
me surrounded!

338
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:55,418
[menacing chuckles]

339
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,487
Go ahead and
finish her off!

340
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:02,425
Luna! Help me,
do something, quickly!

341
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:06,263
Sailor Moon, they're being
controlled by the headbands
that they're wearing!

342
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,332
If you can destroy those,
then you'll be safe!

343
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,103
No! I'm too scared!

344
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,039
Stay strong! Remember,
if you fight you might
lose weight!

345
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:16,441
Wait, what did
you just say?

346
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:20,077
I said that if you
fight these guys, it'll
help you get in shape!

347
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,315
Ah! Really?!
Then I'll do it!

348
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:27,685
Raaagh!

349
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,421
Sweat once,
and get fit!

350
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:33,025
Sweat twice,
get even more fit!

351
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,497
Sweat three times,
and I can do anything!

352
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:42,200
<i>Never mess with a girl's</i>
<i>will to get into shape!</i>

353
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,170
Now!

354
00:21:00,153 --> 00:21:03,990
Moon Tiara Action!

355
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:08,762
Ogh!

356
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:09,996
Uagh!

357
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,101
Bye, boys!
Been fun!

358
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:19,139
[in unison]
Hold on. What are we doing
down here?! Man, that's weird!

359
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,476
Mmm-mm!

360
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:24,511
Wow, that really
was a good workout!

361
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:39,059
Jadeite, you have done very
well to gather this much
human energy for our ruler.

362
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:43,098
I'd say you can call your
plan mostly a success.

363
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:46,134
Yes. Thank you very much,
Queen Beryl.

364
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:49,304
And next time, I'll
get that Sailor Moon!

365
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,345
Mmmm!
So nice...

366
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,247
<i>Usagi, I put out</i>
<i>a towel for you!</i>

367
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:01,050
Thanks, mom!

368
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,520
So is Ms. Haruna
feeling all better now?

369
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:07,389
Yeah! She just took a
week off school to rest,
but she's back now!

370
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:09,191
Wow, what
an ordeal!

371
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,530
You know, mom, I really
don't think that you should
go on a diet, either!

372
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,398
Yes, you have to be
careful about that.

373
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:16,332
Usagi, too.

374
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,268
Seems like Usagi's
back to normal.

375
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:21,504
<i>[Usagi]</i>
<i>Huwaaaa!?</i>

376

See?

377
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:26,309
Oh, no!
I've gained weight!
Come on!

378
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:29,279
But I just got all
of that exercise!

379
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:31,514
Why me?!?

380
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:15,293
