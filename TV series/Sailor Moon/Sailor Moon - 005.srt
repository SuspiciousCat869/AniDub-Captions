Yup! Her name
is Luna.

She's perfect for Usagi.
They're both obnoxious.

a minor catalyst to
activate them,

out as a mass of energy!

we'll be able to

Oh, hey!

154
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,358
Brreow!

155
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:39,396
That's it, Luna!

156
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,331
Hrrmh!

157
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,099
Mrowwrr!

158
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,734
Ahh!

159
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:47,037
Starting today, this
Chanela is my pet;
my only pet!

160
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,173
So hurry up and get
rid of that cat!

161
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:52,911
[sniff]

162
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,947
Stop being so mean
to Luna, Shingo!

163
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,882
Wahhh!

164
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,285
Nnnghh!

165
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,121
Waaah!

166
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:03,823
It's okay.

167
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:06,859
I'm so sorry Shingo
did that to you!

168
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,395

<i>Usagi, I've</i>

169
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,164
Coming!

170
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:15,401
Mmh.

171
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,104
That new pet of yours
really does smell nice!

172
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:20,774
I know! And it's easy
to take care of, too!

173
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,044
A Chanela doesn't
need to be fed!

174
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:26,781
Wow, that's one
economical pet!

175
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:31,853
[mouth full]
And even I have to
admit that little
guy is pretty cute!

176
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:35,090
Well, why don't
you keep both Luna
and the Chanela?

177
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:38,226
I agree!

178
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,756
No way!
Never!

179
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,836
You're just
the cutest!

180

Shingo! Hey, are
you listening?

182

Huh??

184
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:05,022
You and I will be
together forever!

185
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,093

What do you think
of my Chanela?
Isn't it great?

189
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,965
Eh. My Chanela
smells better.

190
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,467
<i>Let me see...</i>
<i>No, it doesn't!</i>

191
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:50,104
Wow! Those Chanelas
are really popular
right now, huh?

192
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:53,175
I know! They're huge!
Everyone has one!

193
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,912
But I really don't think
people should be bringing
their pets to school!

194
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:58,280
Oh! Ms. Haruna!

195
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,383
Hey guys! Hurry
up and hide them!

196
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:05,255
- Oh! She's coming!
- Ah!
- She's here!

197
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,622
Okay, let's get started.

198
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:09,954
Everyone open your
textbooks to page two
hundred and thirty-four.

199
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:18,202
[fidgeting]

200
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,472
Dagh! I gotta
see my pet now!

201
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:21,739
I can't wait
anymore!

202
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,642
- Driving me crazy!
- Can't wait!
- Wanna play with it!

203
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:27,312
Aw... So cute!

204
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:29,447
What's that!?
Give it to me please!

205
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,283
No way!
Stop! No!

206
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:32,050
[crash]

207
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,119
Ms. Haruna!
Are you all right?

208
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,322
I'm out of here!

209
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,490
<i>Me, too!</i>

210
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:38,661
Yeah!

211
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,334
Those girls sure were
acting strangely.

212
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,902
Yeah!

213
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:52,506
I mean, sure, Chanelas are
cute and all but there's
no need to go that far.

214
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,910
Come to think of it,
Just this morning...

215
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,646
<i>Shingo was acting weird too!</i>

216
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,016
I wonder if it's related
to those Chanelas.

217
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,252
Naru, do you happen to
know exactly where they're
selling those things?

218
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:08,156
I think everyone got them
from a place called Perfume.

219
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,391
Let's check it out!

220
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,127
Sorry, I have cram
school today.

221
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,698
Aw. Okay, I guess
I'll just have to
go alone.

222
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:18,034
Are you gonna be all
right by yourself?

223
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,502
Yeah, I'll be fine.

224
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:22,572
Ugh, the things
that I do for my
numbskull brother!

225
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,363
Well, that's sisterly love!

226
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:35,719
<i>So this is where</i>
<i>they're being sold.</i>

227
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:40,091
<i>Wait a second...</i>
<i>What if I become</i>
<i>like Shingo?!</i>

228
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:40,625
Hey! Bunhead!

229
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,361
Ngh!

230
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:43,728
I know that voice...

231
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:44,929
[chuckle]

232
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:48,033
Ngh, Great. Why do
you keep showing
up wherever I go?!

233
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,669
It's annoying,
you know that!

234
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,572
And I could say the exact
same thing about you!

235
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,174
Ugh!

236
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,144
Don't tell me you've decided
to be like everybody else
and buy one of these pets?

237
00:14:58,178 --> 00:14:59,279
Why not?

238
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,281
You don't seem like
the type of girl
who likes perfume.

239
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:04,072
Augh!
Just get lost!

240
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,424
Well, I'm inside.

241
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,727
Hello!
Welcome!

242
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,062
Look around!
Take your time!

243
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:17,432
Right. Thanks.

00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:20,602
[chuckle]

245
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:24,139
I should have waited till
<i>Naru could come with me.</i>

246
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,042
<i>Wow, they really are cute!</i>

247
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,011
Usagi, don't be
fooled by that!

248
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,446
Luna?
Why, what's up?

249
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:33,149
There's something very
strange about this place.

250
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,686
Oh...
Really like what?

251
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,155
Awww!

252
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,725
Don't look in its eyes!

253
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:45,062
[dreamy]
Ahhh...
So cute...

254
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,363
Usagi!

255
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:47,264
Ahh!

256
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:49,434
I'm not surprised
even one little bit!

257
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:53,304
I knew that a beautiful
girl like you would
pick the prettiest pet!

258
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,816
Mmhm.

259
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,380
[giggle] So cute!

260
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,749
Usagi, you really ought
to take that back!

261
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,053
Don't come any closer,
or I'll give you a kick!

262
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,621
Usagi...

263
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:11,524
I can't stand you!
Dumb cat...

264
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:12,559
Hang in there.

265
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,828
Remember it's not Usagi's
fault she said that.

266
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:18,398
Beep beep! Coming through!
Out of the way!

267
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,633
Ah!

268
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:23,103
[crying]

269
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:25,206
Usagi, hold up!

271

Mhh...
Huh?!

275
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,298
Oh, Thank
goodness.

276
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:51,234
Luna, what's going on?
What happened to me?!

277
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,269
I'm sorry, Luna!
I totally screwed up!

278
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,872
Never mind that!
I'm more worried
about Shingo!

279
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:58,775
Me, too!

280
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,876
All right, Shingo!

281
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,246
Hand over that
Chanela, right now!

282
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,447
No way!

283
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,585
Come on! Give it
to me, already!

284
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,254
I told you
give it to me!

285
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,156
Mmh!

286
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,792
[gasp]
I'm... sorry!

287
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,828
I'm not handing
my Chanela over
to anyone!

288
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,531
Agh!

289
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:21,167
Usagi, there's no time to
feel sorry for yourself,

290
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,536
we have to go after your
brother right away!

291
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,740
But I don't have any idea
where he could have gone!

292
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:29,409
I'm positive that he's gone
back to that pet shop!

293
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:32,712
Now quick, change
into Sailor Moon!
And let's go!

294
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:36,250
What do I do if I
come face to face
with a Chanela again?

295
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,752
Just get a grip, Usagi!

296
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:40,688
You have a very
important mission to
fulfill, remember?!

[snarling]

311
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:29,907
Ew, gross!

312
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,909
[roar]

313
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,579
[snarling]

314
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:38,316
Ah!

315
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:38,783
[snarling]
Ya ha ha!

316
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:40,774
<i>Shingo...!</i>

317
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:51,831
Usually about now,
Tuxedo Mask shows up to
bail me out of trouble.

318
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:54,801
Yahh!

319
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,769
But I don't think
he's coming!

320
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,571
Stop depending
on other people!

321
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:01,341
[snarling]

322
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:04,311
Quickly! Use your
Moon Tiara Action!

323
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,046
But what about
Shingo?!

324
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,750
Okay, then just
shout Moon Tiara
Stardust instead!

325
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:10,721
Got it!

326
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,556
Moon Tiara Stardust!

327
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,813
Huh?

328
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:42,018
Ah! I didn't know I
could do that, too!

329
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:44,121
I'll get you!

330
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,789
Sailor Moon, this way!

331
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,591
Right!

332
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:52,063
Yahhh!

333
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,831
[frightened panting]

334
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:56,033
Huh!?

335
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,136
Ahh!

336
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,438
I can't...get out!

337
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:06,445
Don't give up!
Aim for the
base of that
monster's tail!

338
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,676
Moon Tiara Action!

339
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:14,030
Gyaahhh!

340
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:27,768
Gyaahhh!

341
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:31,606
Phew!

342
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:32,941
Sailor V, wait!

343
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:36,411
Eee! Oh no!

344
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:39,014
Sailor V! Can I have
your autograph?

345
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,982
I'm a big fan
of yours!

346
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,119
I'm actually Sailor Moon,
you know!

347
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:46,956
What? Oh, okay.
Close enough, whatever.

348
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,191
will you please give
me your autograph?

349
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,962
Ehh, Listen, there's
something that I need you
to do for me, Shingo.

350
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:55,866
Huh? No way!
How do you know my name?!

351
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,802
I'm Sailor Moon.
I know everything!

352
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:03,774
Now, Shingo, what I'm asking
you to do is be nicer to
that black cat named Luna.

353
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:07,979
And if you do that, then
I'm certain that cat is
gonna bring you happiness.

354
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,449
Sure! If that's what
Sailor Moon wants!

355
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:12,116
[chuckle]

356
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:18,023
[meow]

357
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:20,092
How are you liking
that ham, Luna?

358
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,827
[pleased meow]

359
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:24,096
Well! This is much
more pleasant!

360
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:28,134
From now on, I guess that
we're a family of five!

361
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,936
[chuckle]

362
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,148
[sigh] I'm not sure if
this is any better.

365
