that the great ruler still
remains in dire need of a
massive amount of Energy.

102
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,233
We will find the Silver
Crystal at any cost.

provide our master with

Allow me, Jadeite,
the honor of this
mission.

She will not fail.

109

a little more.

155
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,833
Hrrm. Oh, I hate you I
hate you, you stupid test!

Oh, sorry!

159
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,200

Huaaagh!

161
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,533
Looks to me like you'd
better study harder
next time, bunhead.

162
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:27,433
Hmf! Well, that's none
of your business!

163
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,333
Nyaa!

164
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,200
Stupid jerk and his
purple pleated pants!

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800

Sailor V into a video game?!

168
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,366
Hmm.

169
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:13,166
[sigh] it must be so
cool to be Sailor V!

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,833
She doesn't have any tests
to worry about, and I bet
taking down all those bad
guys feels super awesome.

171
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,333
Compared to all that,
I'm nothing.

Uh, yeah,
a little bit.

182
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:26,670
Oh, by the way, I bumped into
Umino earlier, and he said you
got your test back already.

183
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:27,637
What?!

184

Ha ha ha ha ha!

186
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,570
Good for him.

187
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:37,170
Darn you, Umino...
I'm so gonna get
you for this.

188
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,237
So? What did you get
on your test, Usagi?

189
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,370
D'ooh!

190

Oh! Well, uh...
Actually, the

Okay.

Rrrgh! Usagi!

00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,770
Yeah?

195
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,403
Stop bringing home
grades like this!

196
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,470

about what you've done!

197

Waah!

Hey, you're
in the way!

202
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,903
So what huge mistake
did Mom kick you out
for this time?

203
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:15,870
I sure wish I had a
sister who wasn't a
total loser.

204

<i>Wahh! Come on, Mom!</i>
<i>Let me in already!</i>

209

Uhn, that's strange,
I'm starting to feel
dizzy...

Everyone seems to
be getting sick
all of a sudden.

214
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,337
Should we call
an ambulance?!

215

Yes, this should be

Unhh... Thank goodness,
she finally let me in.

223
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:22,403
I'm completely exhausted
from all of that.

224
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,203
Why do moms always get
so upset over grades anyway?

225
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,837
I don't feel like
doing my homework now.

226
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,670

a quick nap.

Huh?

Yah! The cat with
the bald spot!

231
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:05,670
Uh, it's not a bald spot.
Don't be rude.

232
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:06,370
Ahh!

233
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:09,703
You can talk?! No way!
How can a cat talk?!

234
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,237
Ahem!

235
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,770
Usagi, my name is Luna.

236

how long I've been
looking for you.

Eeee...

238
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,570
First things first. I wanted to
say thank you for saving me from
those kids earlier today.

239
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:26,470
<i>Not to mention taking</i>
<i>that bandage off.</i>

240
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:29,637
<i>With it on, I can't talk, and</i>
<i>it dulls my sensory powers.</i>

241
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:32,503
I thought I was
done for when those
kids put it on.

242
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:36,437
But because of that,
it led me to you!
[chuckle]

243
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,570
Good night!

244
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:40,803
What are you doing?!

245
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,303
This isn't some kind
of dream, you know!

246

Rrrg, Come on, stop
playing around!

247
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,537
Okay, then let me prove
to you it's not a dream!

248
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:58,803
Hmm?

249
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:04,137
A little gift from me,
just for you.

Wow! For me?
It's so beautiful!

251
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:08,870
Usagi, I need you
to listen to me.

252
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,303
Awesome, thank
you so much!

310
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,570
Huh?

311
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,370
Yaah!

312
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:38,537
Ah! I'm bleeding.
This is bad!

313
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:40,870
What do you think
you're doing,
Sailor Moon!

314
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,537
You have to fight back!
You've got to attack and
defeat that monster!

315
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,503
Ah ha ha ha ha!

316
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,503
I can't.
I don't wanna fight,
I'm too scared!

317
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:53,703
How did I get
myself into this?!

318
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,470
Ahh! I wanna
go home now!

319
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,237
Time to finish you!

320
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:04,385
Ah!

321
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:10,203
Ahhhh!

322
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:13,770
Who are you?

323
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:17,370
I am known as Tuxedo Mask!

324
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:21,637
Sailor Moon, you have
to remember that crying
isn't going to solve
any of your problems!

325
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,570
Yeah, maybe not,
but I can't help it!

326
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,570
Wahhhh!

327
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,403
<i>[amplified]</i>
<i>Wahhhh!</i>

328
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,837
Now's your chance!

329
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,737
Throw your tiara at her and
yell, "Moon Tiara Action!"

330
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:44,737
But why would I want to do that?
What's going to happen?

331
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,237
<i>Just hurry up and do it!</i>

332
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,803
Moon Tiara...

333
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:06,270
Action!

334
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,503
Augghh!

335
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,203
[gasp] No way!

336
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:31,637
Morga. You failed me,
you fool.

337
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,403
Oohh...

338
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,403
[Tuxedo Mask]
Well done,
Sailor Moon.

339
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,270
I won't soon forget what
happened here tonight.

340
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:52,237
Ahh...

341
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,770
He's right.
You did really
well, Sailor Moon.

342
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,603
He's so cute!

343
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:05,837
<i>[Naru]</i>
<i>I had this incredible</i>
<i>dream last night.</i>

344
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,903
A superhero named
Sailor Moon showed
up to save me from
a hideous monster.

345
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:10,970
She was so cool!

346
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:13,503
Are you serious?
I had the exact
same dream!

347
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:14,603
Yeah, me too!

348
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,870
Wow! How weird!

349
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19,437
Hey, Usagi.
Isn't that weird?

350
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,103
Are you even
listening?

351
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:24,503
Please be quiet, you guys.
I'm so incredibly tired.

352
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,303
I just want to sleep
a little longer, okay?

353
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,603
[yawn]

354
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,103
Nighty-night!

355
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,188
Hey Luna, want me to read your
fortune?

356
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,188
Quit fooling around, Usagi!
Don't forget, you're on a
mission!

357
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,188
Don't worry! I'm doing my job as
a superhero.

358
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:20,488
Oh, really?

359
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:23,921
By the way, I heard that people
who went to that Fortune Teller

360
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,355
are acting weird. What do you
think?

361
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:27,355
Sounds suspicious. Let's go!

362
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,355
Next time on Sailor Moon,
"Punishment Awaits: The House Of
Fortune Is The Monster Mansion"

363
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:35,188
Punishment Awaits: The House Of
Fortune Is The Monster Mansion

364
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:37,488
The moonlight is a messenger of
love.
