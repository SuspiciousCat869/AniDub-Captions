DAN (VOICEOVER): [inaudible] returned to Earth

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.775
after defeating [inaudible].

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.810
A whole lot of has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing's that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:21.221
to show their battling skills to save the friendly environment.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.723
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone wants

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.526
this virtual realm to remain happy and free,

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.528
a mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
has infiltrated Bakugan inner space

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.865
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:32.766
OK, buddy.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.666
Let's do this.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:34.968
All right, Bakugan roll

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:35.935

THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.275
The odds stacked against you.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.277
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.347
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.550
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.385
The power's in your hand.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.821
Two world's collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.727
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.296
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.297
This is Bakugan.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.179
Nurzak, were you successful in finding the source

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.014
of the dimensional disturbance?

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.352
As per your orders, Emperor Barodius,

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.688
I immediately began my search.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.091
And it led me to a virtual gaming interface

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:35.628
on the planet Earth known as Bakugan Interspace.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.498
During a recent battle, the energy exerted by the two

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.300
combatants caused an explosion.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.503
The fallout from this extended all the way to our world.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.805
That was by some powerful Bakugan

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:51.511
if they created an explosion so big that it rocked our world.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.213
There's nothing funny about this, Stoica.

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.582
Perhaps you should take things seriously for once.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.383
This could affect us greatly.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.952
Oh, relax.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.921
Kazarina, what do you have to say?

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.357
As the director of the Bakugan Biology lab,

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.692
what's your opinion?

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:09.262
Well, Stoica has a point about how powerful the Bakugan

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.164
who created the explosion was.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.132
Unfortunately, none of my research

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.836
has demonstrated that such a mighty creature even exists.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.372
Well, well, well, something about the Bakugan

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.708
that the brilliant Kazarina doesn't know.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.076
Ugh.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:23.977
Yes.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.678
Well, whatever the case may be.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.413
We need to be sure, Gill.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.781
Sire.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.251
If this mighty Bakugan does exist, we cannot afford to have

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.919
him join our enemy side.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.821
Get word to our agents on Earth that we

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.024
want this Bakugan identified and brought into our stable.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:38.925
Of course.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.527
Yes, sir, as you command.

Dan.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:08.988
What?

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.257
You've been sitting here like a zombie all afternoon.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.458
Are you OK?

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.661
You do seem out of it, Dan.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.897
You daydreaming more about the warring Bakugan?

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.567
Why would you be daydreaming about that?

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.901
I wasn't.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.437
What I saw-- it was the real thing.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.806
I swear it.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.308
MARUCHO: Running Bakugan Interspace

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.709
is really wiped me out.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.444
I slept like a log last night.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.545
How will you?

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:33.546
Yep.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.985
So, um, I was thinking after breakfast,

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.119
we could have a look at the system

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.021
to make sure we fixed all the damage.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.389
I'm pretty sure we're good.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.691
But I think that--

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.859
Sure.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.962
Is everything all right with you, sir?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:49.862
Uh?

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:50.997
Yes, I'm fine.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.198
Thank you.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.734
Talk to me.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.536
Huh?

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:59.172
You and I are responsible for Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.273
We're partners.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.642
If there's something wrong, please tell me.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:03.710
I'm here for you.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.345
Are you listening, Ren?

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.546
Please excuse me.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.615
I'll leave you gentlemen to your discussion.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.191
Actually I've been thinking about the vision

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.525
that Dan has been having.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.660
I'm worried too.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.295
He keeps talking about them like they're real.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.697
I think the explosion did a number on him.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:28.601
Well, I actually do know something about his visions.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.169
But first I must confess.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.070
Go on.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.639
You were saying?

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.674
It's me.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.442
Tell me.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.811
I am not really from this planet.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.613
I am actually--

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:41.981
An alien?

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.884
Are you serious?

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.887
Dan, the man, it's not that I don't want to believe you.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.122
But I was there.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.057
You were only out a few seconds.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:53.526
What else could it have been but a dream?

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.894
That's great, Jake.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.296
You think I'm crazy too.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.196
No.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.399
It's not what I'm saying.

What's up?

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:36.569
Is everything OK?

It is.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.338
We should go to my office to talk.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.840
What did you say?

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.642
An alien?

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:44.877
I'm sorry to have to spring the news on you.

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.646
I'll understand if you're mad.

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.615
But for now we have more pressing issues.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.084
We're listening.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.919
So let's have it.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.421
I come from the planet in a distant dimension

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.790
called Gundalia.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.926
Much like you humans here on Earth,

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.763
we existed peacefully with our Bakugan.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.699
But then one day, a hostile tribe

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:12.371
called the Neathians invaded our planet using their Bakugan.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:15.208
I'm pretty sure that Dan's visions of warring Bakugan

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.009
were coming from my world.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.412
The explosion from Drago and Linehalt's battle

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.447
must have caused some kind of distortion,

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.516
which allowed Dan's mind to travel

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.953
there in its unconscious state.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.188
So the legends are true.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.791
I remember hearing the stories when I was young.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.760
But thought they were just fables.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.829
A long time ago when the core of [inaudible] split

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.565
and it became the world of the six attributes.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.503
The enormous energy created is said to have blown some Bakugan

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.306
to another dimension.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.308
Even if all this stuff is true.

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.377
It doesn't explain what you're doing on Earth.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:54.747
The Neathian Bakugan were trained as soldiers from birth,

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:58.417
whereas the Bakugan on Gundalia were raised in an atmosphere

00:06:58.518 --> 00:06:59.418
of peace and calm.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.920
Because of that we lacked the skills

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.455
to evenly match them in battle.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:05.691
Our peaceful existence has been attacked by these Neathians.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.894
And our very freedom is at stake.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.730
I, too, heard the legends but in reverse of Bakugan

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.832
existing elsewhere.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.001
I also learned of the mighty warriors known

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.202
as the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:17.136
Yeah.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.505
So now I suppose you want our help.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.574
But why should we believe you?

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.676
Perhaps you'd like to see the cities on my planet

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.111
that have been left in ruins.

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:27.880
Or maybe I could show you the Neathian moles who have already

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.349
infiltrated Bakugan Interspace,

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.084
Moles, like sleeper agents?

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.286
What do they want?

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.954
The same thing I do of course.

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:37.089
To recruit the Battle Brawlers to their side

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.559
so they can crush their enemies once and for all.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.594
BI is not for war!

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:42.495
I understand.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.363
We never asked to be attacked.

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:45.765
And we'd like the fighting to be over

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:49.468
as soon as possible, which is why I'm coming to you,

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:50.369
Brawlers.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.106
So please, will you help me?

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:57.443
I'm fed up with people using the Bakugan for evil reasons.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.412
Ja, we can't let these Neathian

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.713
creeps get away with this.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:03.082
They Infiltrating Bakugan Interspace, which

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.851
is meant for peaceful purposes.

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.519
They're going to pay for that.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.453
Yeah.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.755
We have to protect the kids inside.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:10.790
OK.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.924
It's unanimous.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:13.059
We're in.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.996
You can count on us.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:21.000
Everything's going to plan, Linehalt.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.204
Time for another round of good versus evil, Drago.

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:26.939
OK, then.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.175
Thank you for agreeing to help out.

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:31.410
Gundalia's in your debt.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.714
I've managed to identify two sleeper agents.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:37.216
They are Sid are chaos and Lena Isis.

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.588
- So what do you think of this? - Yeah.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:43.689
Yeah. I'd like turtles.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.191
Hey. You two nose wipes--

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.125
Huh?

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.961
How about taking us on in battle?

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:50.696
Just a little friendly brawl.

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:51.797
You want to?

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.032
Huh? What?

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.500
You need permission from your mothers?

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.434
Give us an answer!

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.203
[screaming]

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.106
Could you have been any more menacing?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.407
MARUCHO: Excuse me, guys.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.308
Huh?

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:03.442
Huh?

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:06.345
Any chance you two are Sid and Lena?

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.381
Depends on who's asking.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.883
We are, the Battle Brawlers.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:13.052
Uh, technically I'm just a Brawler in training.

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.253
Great.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.255
Now that we're well acquainted with each other.

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.324
How about you tell us what you want.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.793
We heard you two were looking to battle.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.396
So we're here to grant you your wish.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.398
Bakugan Interspace is for gaming, not war.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.568
I won't let you Neathians exploit it for those purposes.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:29.769
Easy now.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.570
We're just here to have fun.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.978
Since you guys like secrecy so much.

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:42.481
I got us a private arena to do battling.

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.484
We can go full on in here, no holds barred.

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.386
That's just how we like it.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.855
So which two rodents are going to take us on?

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:50.756
Huh!

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.191
That'll be me and--

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.092
Me.

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.493
So get ready to be taken down.

The Bakugan to field is open.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:08.307
I'll get this party started.

Go Pyrus Helix Dragonoid.

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.364

Looks like your attacks have a little tick to them.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.052
What? Whoa!

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.353
That one can talk.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.556
That means he's not a digital clone then.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:33.759
Remember the Neathians use real Bakugan in battle.

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:36.429
They're from the same lineage as Drago.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.197
Wow, that's pretty cool.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:42.835
Real or digital, Drago will win this battle.

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:43.736
OK.

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:47.106
It's my urn now.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.074

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:22.441
My body's going numb.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.810
You've been stung Phosphos's paralysis venom.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.380
Drago can't activate any abilities now.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.281
Man!

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:30.316
Sit tight, Dan.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.217
I've got it.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.298
He nullified her ability.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:50.369
Not only that, Drago and Aquos Phosphos power levels went up.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:51.771
Hmm, yeah, big deal.

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.772
[inaudible] combat.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:54.773
Enemy down.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.245
He brought my power level down.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.346
Don't sweat, Dan.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.480

Try getting one of your attacks through now, Drago.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.275
It's hopeless.

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.446
Here we go, Phosphos.

You ever heard saying, that seven

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.021
heads are better than one.

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:48.794
Whoa!

Whoa!

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.698
And I thought the last guy was creepy.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:57.403
Oh the venom again.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:00.906
Uh!

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:06.745

Don't worry, Drago.

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:13.419
We won't leave you out.

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:21.260
Drago!

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.162
It's too late, Drago.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.997
soon the venom will travel throughout your body.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.166

Drago!

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:37.710
Hang on.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.645
Dan better think of something fast

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:41.714
or it's lights out for Drago.

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.249
The big oaf is right.

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:45.351
How is he going to get out of this one?

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:46.819
Come on, think.

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.787

He was able to launch his battle gear.

You guys forgot one thing.

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.818
You may have frozen Drago's lower half.

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:22.321

That's how we roll.

I can't believe they beat us.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.196
But why?

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:38.764
He knew about the venom.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:41.834
Most Brawlers would vary their method of attack in battle.

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.936
She, however, stayed with one.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:45.437
It faked him out.

Spinning wall.

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.823
This is fun.

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:07.292
Keep it up, you'll laughing guy.

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:08.660
That's pretty tough talk considering

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.030
you're down a brawling partner, not to mention, on the ropes

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.164
yourself.

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.800
Lena, no more talk, OK?

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.368
All right, very well then.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:17.269
ANDROID: Ready.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.437
Deftagon.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.338
Ready.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:20.539
Terrorcrast.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.941
Ready whatever gear you want.

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:23.942
It doesn't matter.

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:25.811
You're going down, suckers.

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.279
Get ready to hurt.

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.580
ANDROID: Ready jet core.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.117
ALL: Battle gear [inaudible].

Battle gear ability activate.

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.486
Deftagon gear wait for.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.125
I can't move.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.768
[screaming]

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:29.608
Drago!

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:31.176
I'm not done yet.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.516
Battle gear ability activate.

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:38.517
Terrorcrast threat.

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.892
This is the end.

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.228
Victory is ours now.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:50.129
Really?

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.129
Are you sure?

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.931
Think again, punks.

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:54.700
Game card open.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.934
Capacity booster!

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.041
What?

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:07.513
Their power levels return to base level.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.281
Why won't he go down?

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:10.749
I don't get it.

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:13.552
Maybe it's because I've been in hundreds of battles

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:16.421
and have faced far tougher opponents than you.

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:22.327
Perhaps, you forgot that I'm Pyrus Helix Dragonoid.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.495
That's right.

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:26.098
I should explain something else to you guys.

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.634
The command card also increases the power

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.269
of Drago's battle gear.

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.169
What?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.671
That means that--

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:35.174
He's going to activate level two classibility.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.142
You're ready, Drago?

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:38.777
Absolutely.

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:41.480

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.248

ANNOUNCER: Winner of the battle, Dan and Marucho.

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:09.074
Yeah!

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.109
Oh, that's right!

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:12.044
You did it, Dan.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:13.478
Way to go!

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.914
Thank you for the exciting battle gentlemen.

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:16.815
Yeah.

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.217
It was real educational.

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:20.719
All right, come on, Rubanoid.

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.323
Time to go, friend.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:29.795
Guys!

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.700
Dan, the man, delivers a body slam.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.536
Dude, what did I tell you about the rhyming?

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:41.440
Ren, those two battlers aren't the only moles from Neathian

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.674
are they? - No.

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.443
I highly doubt it. - Huh.

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:45.377
Who cares.

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:46.945
I'll take 1,000 of them on.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:50.248
Whatever, they're no match for the Battle Brawler.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:53.552
Well, Dan Kuso, your strength, ingenuity,

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.888
and finesse in battle are all very impressive.

00:20:56.989 --> 00:21:00.225
You are indeed a most powerful brawler.

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:03.528
However, you're still not number one.

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:09.568
Oh, man, what a day.

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.169
I totally slept through my alarm, which

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.704
means that I'm going to be late for my meeting

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:13.705
with the other Brawlers.

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.207
Marucho is going to be mad.

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:16.341
But what does he expect?

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.443
Who schedules a meeting on a Saturday morning?

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:20.012
If everyone stays out of my way.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.480
I should be go-- whoa! Hey!

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.381
Who's that cutie?

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:24.483
Look out.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:25.617
Did you see that?

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.519
She trough me like I was a Bakugan Brawler.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.521
That was totally out of line.

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.924
Somebody better teach this chick some manners.

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:35.060
Bakugan roll!

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.728
Sweetness
