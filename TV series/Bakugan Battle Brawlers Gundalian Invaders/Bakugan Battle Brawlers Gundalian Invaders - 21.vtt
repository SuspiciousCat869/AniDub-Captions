NARRATOR: After the cotillions hijacked Bakugan Interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:21.187
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.555
Now Earth and Neathia were United

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.658
in the struggle to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.828
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.464
Dragonoid Colossus on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.832
Now, Drago.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:33.833
Bakugan Brawl!

NARRATOR: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:47.080
Backs against the wall, got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.283
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.618
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.130
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.465
This is Bakugan.

[suspenseful music]

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:18.111
How utterly depressing it is that

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.282
after decades of loyal service to the royal family,

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.386
all I have to show for my troubles is you.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.387
That hurts.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.591
Nice try.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.766
I think it's time we extended our olive branch.

NARRATOR: The Bakugan battle Brawlers in Divide and Conquer.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.916
We heard there's a transmission from Gundalia.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:57.951
Yes.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.420
It;s coming through a secure channel.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.489
It's a send only transmission.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.090
We can't respond to it.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.493
Attention people of Neathia.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.529
This is Nurzak of the Gundalian 12 orders.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.397
I would like to meet with a delegation

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.200
of your choosing to discuss a possible peace treaty.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.270
Sunrise tomorrow, at the Western edge of Sector K.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.238
Nurzak.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.140
Is he for real?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.376
The 12 orders are the ruling body of Gundalia.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:28.081
He could be acting as a messenger for Emperor Barodius.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.384
But I thought the Emperor wanted to steal the Sacred Orb.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:35.288
Is it possible that Barodius has changed his mind?

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.824
[gasp]

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.826
Perhaps, but it's also possible

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.162
that this is the first crack in the Gundalian's unified front.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.231
So our plan to divide and conquer is working?

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.000
Dude, that is awesome sauce!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.535
Wait, hold on a second.

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:52.071
There's also the possibility that this could be a trap.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.139
It's true.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.441
We can't trust anything those creeps say.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:59.178
Trap or no trap, we can totally thrash those dudes.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.880
What do we got to lose?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.248
How about everything?

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.450
We can't afford to be careless about this, guys.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.351
Come on.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.352
It's true.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.924
Now what?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.025
It is simple.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.160
We proceed with Nurzak's meeting.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.061
[gasp]

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.530
But how can you be sure?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.866
I am anything but certain.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.468
However, it is worth the risk.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.407
[suspenseful music]

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.742
Everything is finally in place.

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.946
Using my special hypnosis, I have seized control

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.914
of the subconscious minds of more than half

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.549
of the emperor's soldiers.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.152
When the time comes and we're ready to make our strike,

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.454
all I need to do is give the signal,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:45.124
and we'll have an army of fierce warriors under our control.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.225
[laughter]

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.897
Taking over the throne of Gundalia is merely

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.534
a finger snap away, Nurzak.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.869
So it would seem, Kazarina.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.838
It must feel good for you after all

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.007
this time to finally be rid of the leader

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:03.009
you have despised so much.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.110
You should be happy.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.182
[bells ringing]

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:12.352
We will strike tomorrow.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:16.356
When the bells at dawn ring out, we'll rise up and crush

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.891
Barodius once and for all.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.362
Yes, and a new day will begin for Gundalia.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:26.733
I'm sure it will be the most beautiful of sunrises.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.135
There is one more thing.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:33.039
You will be leading the attack forces by yourself.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.507
What do you mean?

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.477
With the command of the troops in your capable hands,

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.313
I can use the revolt as a smokescreen

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.949
while I flew to Neathia.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.551
Why would you go there?

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.587
It is crucial that I give this peace

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.123
offering to the Sacred Orb.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.324
What is it?

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.660
This contains the switch code.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.362
Anyone hoping to harness the power of the orb

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.264
must be in possession of this.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:02.068
The former emperor entrusted it to me for safekeeping.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.304
If you've had this for all of this time,

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.339
why have you kept it hidden?

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.107
You could have unleashed the power of the orb

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:12.812
and defeated Barodius ages ago, you stubborn old fool.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:17.250
Like the previous emperor, I fear the power of the orb.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.153
I do not covet it.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.121
Kazarina and Nurzak, you say.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.222
Yes.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.058
I've been suspicious of them for a while,

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.893
but I didn't want to say anything

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.862
until I had absolute proof.

It is people like you that give me hope.

as some sort of escape route.

Did you honestly think you could hide this from me Nurzak?

Absolutely.

His followers believed in him.

Of course they did, because he poisoned their minds

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.038
Emperor Barodius, I'm going to tell you one more time.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:35.107
You would be wise to heed my warning.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:39.011
And if I decline, what are you going to do, Nurzak?

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.480
Are you going to sneak off to Neathia

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.982
and use that thing in your pocket--

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:43.883
What?

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:44.951
-- to turn the orb against me?

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.152
The switch code.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.486
I know all about it.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.989
It's been handed down through my family for generations,

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.223
after all.

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:55.528
I told you that you couldn't hide anything from me.

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.495
[grunts]

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:59.865
[bells ringing]

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:00.866
It is time.

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:08.207
This is for the future of Gundalia, Sabator.

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:11.544
This is the fight of our lives, Lumagrowl.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:20.019
[suspenseful music]

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:28.761
So it is a new day and Gundalia.

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.331
You have left me no choice, Emperor.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:36.102
Kazarina, unleash the troops now.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.169
[snaps]

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:42.975
What is this?

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.814
Did you really think I'd betray the Emperor

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.116
to follow an old man?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.524
Kazarina, you're lucky I still have a use for you.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:10:59.825
[gasp]

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.461
You made no secret that you disagreed with Emperor

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.498
Barodius, so he had me do a little investigation

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.968
to see just how deep your feelings ran.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.972
You were even easier to play than I thought you would be.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.808
You conniving little witch.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:19.545
Fossils like you need to be buried.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.781
Enough of this.

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:26.252
I think it's time I disciplined the fool for his betrayal.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.386
Hah.

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.588
Do you think you're man enough to take me on?

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.125
I've been battling since you were in diapers.

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.429
This is for the future I've Gundalia.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.897
Gate card, set!

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.570

Hah!

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.581
Bakugan stand!

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:57.516
Rise, Darkus Dharak!

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.621
If you think you can beat me, you're an even

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.590
bigger fool than your master.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.259
Good luck taking me down you over-grown lapdog.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.799

Hold strong!

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.068
Is that the best you can do?

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:51.403
I'm just warming up.

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.205
OK, Dharak.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.406
Try this.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.379

Sabator!

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.740
You're gonna pay for that one.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.643
You don't see me running away, do you?

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.278
Have you had enough yet?

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:34.380
You wish.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.416
I'm about to show you what an old man can do.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.185
Let's go.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.220
Gate Card, open.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.555
Silent Stalker!

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.127
Silent stalker is a gate card that was passed

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:50.196
onto me from your father.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:53.999
It can easily shut down Dharak's power.

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:56.869
My patience is wearing thin.

00:13:56.969 --> 00:14:00.372
The gate card also activates Sabator's level three battle

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.741
gear ability, which elevates him far

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.977
higher in power than Dharak.

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:07.813
Get ready, Punk, because you're about to feel pain

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.148
like you never knew existed.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.853
Battle gear ability, activate.

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.555
Sabator, hot fury.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.226
Choke on this!

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.599
Woah!

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:34.573
What's this?

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:35.674
What's happening?

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.481
Emperor Barodius!

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.090
[growl]

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.261
Nurzak, you won't get away with this.

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.362
Silence.

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:59.265
I don't need you to fight my battles.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.700
Be honest, Nurzak, you crave power

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.402
just as much as anyone else.

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:07.106
For all of the years that you served my father and I,

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:09.842
you were really just waiting for a chance to make your move.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.010
Correct Nurzak?

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.144
Hah.

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:15.414
Do not pretend to know what motivates me, boy.

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:18.150
I have given my entire life to cleaning up the messes

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.919
that your family has made.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.888
Isn't that what servants do?

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:26.725
Clean up after their masters?

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:27.793
Bakugan, Brawl!

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.962
Bakugan stand!

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:30.963
Rush them, Dharak!

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:37.102

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:38.937
Bakugan stand!

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.806

Arrogance.

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.092
You may not fear the Sacred Orb, but I

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:02.928
will still teach you a lesson.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.563
Don't make me laugh.

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:07.299
You think you can overthrow me and get away with it?

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:09.368
It is I who will teach you a lesson.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.770
Ability activate.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.771
Thunder probe.

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:18.410
There is a reason that I ascended

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.113
the throne faster than anyone in my family's history.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:23.849
[thunder]

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.518
Dharak and I are unlike anything

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.854
Gundalia has ever seen before.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.456
What are you saying?

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:32.358
There is no limit to our power!

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.829
Time to go.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.897

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:56.148
This is out of control!

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.035
Darkest matter.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:20.572
I will take you down, even if it means sacrificing

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:24.476
Sabator and myself to do it.

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:27.846
I will devour every last ounce of darkness power.

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:36.388
Sabator really is absorbing Dharak's power,

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.724
and it's creating a gravitational force.

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.192
But is it too much?

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:45.197
[cracking]

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:47.065
Sabator!

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:50.069
It's OK, Nurzak.

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.504
I can do this.

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:55.808
Just a little longer.

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.177
You're finished, Sabator.

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.612
I guess you are not as wise as you think.

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:03.015
Dharak is more than just the darkest Bakugan.

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:05.417
Using that ability on him ultimately

00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:08.253
means curtains for you, Nurzak.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:09.288

I do not understand.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.558
We were winging, but the secret orb.

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:48.694
Did Barodius channel it's power?

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:51.029
Or are we being punished?

If you see my father, tell him you were not

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.655
man enough to beat me either.

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:29.001

Looks like they bailed.

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.390
I think you're right, Dan.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.325
I can't believe they shined us off

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.427
like we're a bunch of punks.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.063
Maybe something happened to him.

00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:59.431
Like what?

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.933
Who can say?

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:06.572
All we know is that for now, our war with Gundalia continues.

[music playing]

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:22.254
I admire the old prune's spirit, thinking

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.156
he could stage a rebellion.

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:27.125
Clearly he underestimated your loyalty,

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.194
especially you, dear Kazarina.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:35.167
There has been a lot of sneaky behavior around here lately,

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.369
wouldn't you say Gil?

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.304
I suppose.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.941
I extend my thanks to you Kazarina.

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.077
No thanks are necessary.

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:49.181
Everything I do is for the glory of you and Gundalia.

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:52.551
That pleases me.

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:55.287
Cozying up to the Emperor, are we?

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:57.789
Well, I still don't trust you, Kazarina,

00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:00.993
and I'm going to take you down, one way or another.

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.800
NARRATOR: The Gundalians still have

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.469
control of the battler's they kidnapped

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:11.870
from Bakugan Interspace.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.106
Now the thrashed Ren's team, Kazarina

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.540
is using them against us.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.376
They've got this one dude Koji fighting for them,

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.144
and his Bakugan pretty fierce.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.412
If we're not careful, the pair of them

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:21.847
could shoot us all for a loop.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.849
Lucky for us, we're all pros at Brawling,

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.951
so we won't go down without a fight.

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.319
You've got to tune in to see something

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:28.654
else you won't believe.

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:29.855
Ready, Drago?

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.823
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.558
Wicked horsepower, Drago!

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.427
That's one sweet ride you got there.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:43.869
