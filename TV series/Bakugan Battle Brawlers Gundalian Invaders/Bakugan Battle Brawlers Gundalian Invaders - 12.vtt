WEBVTT

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.140
DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.608
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.543
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.413
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.716
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.352
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.920
environment.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.189
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.259
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.261
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.096
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.664
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.133
OK, buddy, let's do this.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.034
All right!

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.602
Bakugan, brawl!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.041
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.678
Gotta give it your all.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.381
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.316
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.684
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.563
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.665
This is Bakugan.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:09.269
[suspenseful music]

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.177
Scanning quadrant omega for the Element.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.111
Negative.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.314
Anything in your sector, Glotronoid?

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:26.519
Nothing here, but we'll keep looking.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.420
Copy that.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.721
Returning to base.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.060
BARODIUS: What do you mean you don't have the Element?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.863
We successfully broke through outer shield

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.032
and took down the Neathian front line, but--

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.501
Unfortunately, your highness, in spite of our searching,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.170
the Element was nowhere to be found.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.239
Captain Elright was amongst those

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.141
whom we managed to capture.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.277
However, our interrogation of him has been fruitless.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.047
BARODIUS: Incompetent fools!

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.851
Clearly you don't understand that failure is not an option.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.087
I must possess the power that exists within the Element.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.522
Sire.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.624
It's only a matter of time.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.528
Once I possess the Element, the universe is mine!

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.464
[energetic music]

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.632
DAN (VOICEOVER): The Bakugan Battle

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.802
Brawlers in \"The Element.\"

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.171
I can't believe that Linus lost his Bakugan Neo

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.508
to the Gundalians, especially since the Element is

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.576
hidden within him.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.111
Hopefully, the Gundalians don't

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.746
realize what they have yet.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.883
Otherwise, Neathia is doomed.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:34.420
Fabia, just what is this Element, anyway, huh?

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.423
Perhaps it's the reason Gundalia attacked

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.959
Neathia in the first place.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.497
Well, the Element is the ancient life force of Neathia.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.100
What exactly do you mean by life force?

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.305
FABIA: The power that comprises the Element is like nothing

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.873
else in the known universe.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.276
It has the ability to turn the driest deserts

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.011
into fertile farmland.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.747
It can bring happiness and prosperity where once there

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.682
was only sadness and despair.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:06.619
Unfortunately, such great power is also a source of temptation,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.354
and there are those who wish to harness it,

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:11.624
then twist and distort it for their own evil purposes.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.793
The Gundalians are such a people.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:16.563
So, does that answer all of your questions, Dan?

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:19.899
Now do you understand why it's so important we get it back?

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.134
Yeah.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.603
If those dillweed Gundalians get their hands on it,

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.238
Neathia's toast.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.040
No, not just Neathia.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.242
The Gundalians won't stop until they rule--

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.109
JULIE: Everyone!

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.010
ALL: Huh?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.245
JULIE: It's Linus!

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.280
Whoa, take it easy, Linus.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.282
You need to lie down.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.584
Leave me alone.

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:38.651
I have to fix it.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.620
It's all my fault.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.921
What's going on?

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.123
Linus is f-- f-- f-- freaking out!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.025
He says he's gonna go after the Gundalians

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.927
himself and get the Element back.

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.395
Dude can barely stand up straight.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.798
Tell him to chill out before he hurts himself, will you?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.232
Are you kidding me?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.934
Julie is right, Linus.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.869
You need to rest right now.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.007
I'm sorry, Princess, but not even you can stop me.

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:02.709
Linus, please wait.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.178
To lose my partner Bakugan and the Element

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.779
right in front of my eyes.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.683
[groans] I have to get them back before I--

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.052
[groaning]

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:15.722
Don't worry, Linus.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.690
We'll get them back for you, pal.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.625
Huh?

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.160
It's not just for Neathia.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.665
The freedom of the entire universe is at stake.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:26.566
Oh.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.567
Hmm?

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.804
Hmm?

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:33.272
What is this?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:36.009
It's an ID tag worn by the Castle Knights.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.312
It's also a symbol of the brotherhood

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.280
between battler and Bakugan.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.950
Linus, you can count on us.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.852
We will get Neo back for you.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.687
I promise, buddy.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:48.855
Right, Drago?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.123
Absolutely.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:53.226
Neo Zip Zam sounds like a brave and noble Bakugan.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.894
I'm very anxious to meet him.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.496
Dan.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.431
Drago.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.632
I--

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.000
Come on, Linus.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.070
You have to put your trust in Dan and the battle brawlers.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.875
Yes, very well.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:09.876
Yeah!

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.411
Now that that's settled, let's saddle up

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:13.379
and hit Bakugan Interspace with a vengeance.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.647
Yeah! [cheering]

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:15.982
JAKE: All right, dudes!

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:16.983
Let's do this!

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.685
You better move fast.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:21.120
It's only a matter of time before Neo's secret

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.956
is uncovered.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.726
KAZARINA: A Bakugan belonging to a Castle Knight?

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:27.794
Yes.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:30.363
We took it in battle from Linus, a Castle

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.433
Knight who escaped to Earth from the Neathian front line.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:37.370
The strange thing is the Bakugan has sealed itself in ball form

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.207
and won't budge no matter what I do.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:45.778
An escaped Castle Knight and a sealed Bakugan?

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.247
That is very strange indeed.

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:51.818
If it refuses to open, then it must have something to hide.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:53.219
Yeah, such as?

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.121
My guess would be that it has something

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.323
to do with the Element.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.691
Huh?

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.027
KAZARINA: Return to Gundalia immediately with the Bakugan.

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.095
I'll examine it.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.030
I'm confident my methods will be fruitful.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.031
Of course.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.670
SID: Well, well, look at the little weasel hiding

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.004
in his hole.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:17.610
While we're out doing your dirty work recruiting soldiers,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.146
you're in here playing teacher's pet.

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:23.149
Have you no shame, Ren?

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.050
Huh?

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.919
What do you want, Sid?

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.054
Huh?

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.123
Well, maybe I'd like to try doing your job

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.724
for a little while, Ren.

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:34.026
I think I'd be awesome at it.

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.661
Get your hands off that.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.497
I'm supposed to bring it to the emperor.

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.397
Hand it over!

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:39.298
Easy.

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.134
Take it easy, tiger.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.235
Ha!

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.604
Maybe I'll take this Bakugan to the emperor

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:47.240
and score some brownie points.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.174
You wouldn't.

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:49.075
COMPUTER: Intruder alert.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.076
Intruder alert.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:51.210
Bakugan Interspace has been breached.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.111
Huh?

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.412
What now?

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.014
Blasted brawlers.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.417
Hmm, this should be interesting.

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.460
[laughs] Hey, touchdown, kiddies!

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.761
What should we do now?

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.364
Keep our eyes peeled, for a start.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:15.201
They wouldn't likely leave Neo out in the open, would they?

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.202
Dan?

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.671
Where are you running to so fast?

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.940
They must have Neo hidden somewhere.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.875
I'm gonna try the Baku room.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.510
Dan, slow down.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.845
Yeah, dude.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.281
You need to take it down a notch and form a plan of attack.

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.549
There's no time, guys.

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.250
We gotta go, pitter-patter!

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.351
Dan the Man!

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.686
- Should we follow him? - Yes, come on.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.587
Let's go.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:35.588
Right.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.760
Slow down, dude!

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.661
Huh?

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.496
[all yelling]

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.631
Ow, my spleen.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:46.766
Huh?

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:49.869
We got teleported to a battle arena, but why?

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.506
SID: It's called a trap door, you pack of numskulls.

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.875
Did you really think we'd just leave the gaping hole you put

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.777
in our security system open?

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.111
Maybe.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:02.682
I take it y'all came to get your precious Bakugan back.

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.383
Or maybe you're here because of the secret

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.285
this little guy is keeping locked up inside.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.520
That's it, isn't it?

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.788
He's got--

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.256
--Neo with him!

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.391
Sid, what are you doing?

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:13.426
Get lost.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.561
This is none of your business here, Ren.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.029

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.499
Give him back to us, now!

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.802
If you want your little friend back,

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:27.273
you guys are gonna have to face me in a battle arena.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.374

OK, Sid.

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.446
You want a fight?

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.947
You got it, pal.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.087

Come on and get him back, Dan.

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:58.738
I'm gonna trounce you by more than 500 points, pal.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.274
And then I'm gonna take Neo back from you.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.942
Hmm.

What's with the bait and switch, you weasel?

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.304
What are you talking about, brawler?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.539
I never said I was gonna battle you with Neo.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.907
DAN: What?

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.944
Rubanoid and I have a score to settle with you two first.

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:40.279
We can't move forward until we crush

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:42.381
you and Drago once and for all.

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.450
We're both Pyrus battlers, Dan.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.587
You should understand why I need to take you down.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.221
Sid.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:51.324
We're gonna have to take down Rubanoid first.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.160
Which will force him to take out Neo in the next round.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.128
Bakugan, brawl!

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:58.130

and I intend to keep it.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:54.480

No way!

It's the Element.

Huh?

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:00.826
Ah!

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.198
Ah, Drago!

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.768
[suspenseful music]

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:19.211
What is all this?

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.779
NEO: At last, we meet.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:21.814
Huh?

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:22.715
Neo?

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.950
What's happening?

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:30.589
Drago, it is our fate that we finally meet.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.191
Our fate?

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.258
Yes.

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:35.361
Until now, it has been my responsibility

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.129
to protect the Element.

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:40.899
But the time has come for me to pass it on to you.

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:42.000
What?

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.403
The people of Neathia are counting on you.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.904
Wait.

00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:48.107
My mission here is over.

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.809
Good luck, Drago.

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:54.313
[yelling]

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:00.152
Whoa!

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:06.558
What-- what just happened?

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:07.993
Huh?

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:09.995
Huh?

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:10.996
Ah!

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:20.372
Drago, you've evolved again, pal.

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:21.740
Huh?

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.877
\"Lumino Dragonoid.\"

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:27.813
Lumino Dragonoid!

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:28.714
What?

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.516
Lumino Dragonoid, huh?

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.051
But-- but how?

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:33.152
How did this happen?

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:34.486
Tell me, how?

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.622
Neo made Drago evolve.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:39.591
I guess Neo did possess the Element after all.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.460
Who cares if he's evolved?

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.928
So what?

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:45.230
I'm not through with him yet.

Check it, Drago.

Ability activate!

[growls] No way!

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:09.721
Yes, Sid.

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:11.156
They got the Element back.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:12.558
Nice play.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.461
Hey, it's not my fault.

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.397
Dude, that was so cool the way you evolved like that.

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.834
I must admit, I never expected this to happen.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.869
Me neither.

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:28.640
I feel very strange now that the Element is part of me.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.175
How so, pal?

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:35.380
I feel tapped into the entire universe.

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.715
Hold on a second.

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:37.950
Where's Neo?

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.951
Huh?

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.256
NEO: Linus?

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.257
Linus?

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:51.964
Neo!

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.999
You came back.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.000
Huh?

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:58.570
What's wrong?

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.009
You seem a lot different.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.077
Yes.

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.778
I've passed along the Element to a more

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.947
powerful and worthy Bakugan.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:11.717
It was the right thing to do for Neathia.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.352
I understand.

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:16.188
Be well, my friend.

Hey, Linus.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.604
I brought you a fruit basket.

Oh, no.

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.907
What's wrong, hun?

[crying]

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.920
You've got some nerve showing your face

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.421
here after losing the Element.

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.460
I have no use for fools in my inner circle.

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.129
But, sire.

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:59.498
Are you serious?

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.734
You can't just dismiss us like that.

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.169

How dare you!

Insolent fool.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:09.708
Our loyalty deserves respect.

Do you hear me?

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.311
Ah!

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.750
(LAUGHING) Oh.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.955
I can use this one in my experiments.

Rubanoid, no!

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:29.127
Emperor Barodius, give us another chance.

Ren?

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:33.031
Grant us a pardon this time, and I promise

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.666
we will take down the brawlers.

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:35.701
We will redeem ourselves.

Begging for your life, Ren?

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.878
How weak and pathetic you are.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:57.589
So Drago has been infused with the Element?

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.959
You had best not waste any time capturing Drago and retrieving

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.160
the Element, Ren.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.196
Don't make me regret giving you a second chance.

DAN (VOICEOVER): Now that we possess the Element,

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:11.770
we needed to get to Neathia to help fend off the Gundalians.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.539
We were planning our attack when things started getting freaky.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.009
First Zenet showed up and challenged us to a throwdown,

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.610
then I started seeing double.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.511
Am I going crazy?

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:20.679
Somebody tell me.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:21.580
Two Julies?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.881
What's going on here?

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:25.050
Oh, man, my brain hurts.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.421
It's some seriously crazy stuff you need to see to believe.

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.322
Let's go!

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:33.125
