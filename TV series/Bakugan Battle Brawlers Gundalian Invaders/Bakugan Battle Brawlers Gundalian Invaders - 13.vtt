WEBVTT

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.107
DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.742
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.577
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.446
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.750
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.352
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.920
environment.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.223
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.292
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.261
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.096
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.564
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.133
OK, buddy. Let's do this.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.034
All right.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.201
Bakugan Brawl.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.041
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.211
Got to give it your all.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.381
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.316
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.618
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.296
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.297
This is Bakugan.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.539
DAN: Things got a little crazy in that last battle.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.308
Is it true that Neo's Zip Zam is gone for good?

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.242
It's true.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.510
Ugh.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.281
It's my fault. I wasn't strong enough to win him back.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.182
It's OK.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.883
Hm?

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.252
Neo knew the risks of being a soldier.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.088
He acted nobly and showed bravery when

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.957
he passed the Element to Drago.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.226
Now, he's a part of Drago.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.127
Nice.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.228
I'm honored.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.664
Princess, based on Linus's report Neathia

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.666
has suffered a serious setback.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.302
We need to return immediately to help fight.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.504
Right.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.540
I need to ask a favor, and I'll understand if you say no.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.741
Don't worry. We're in.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.776
Huh?

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.711
We'll go with you to Neathia to fight.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.112
It could be dangerous.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:53.980
Are you sure?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.448
Yup.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:59.719
The Gundalians are an enormous threat to the entire universe.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.055
Even though we've made some good counterattacks,

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.657
they're still taking children from Bakugan Interspace

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.159
to battle on their side.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.995
Maybe now we can shut these Gundalian creeps down for good,

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:09.896
huh?

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.231
You got that right.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.701
We're going to take the fight to their front door.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.136
Let's go then.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.136
ALL: Yeah.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.277
DAN (VOICEOVER): Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Twin Evil.\"

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:31.117
[grumbles]

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.254
You and Sid really made life tough for the rest of us

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:39.092
when you messed up and lost the Element like that.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.095
I have no use for fools in my inner circle.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.796
But, sire.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:45.598
Are you serious?

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.234
You can't just dismiss us like that.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.770
[growls]

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.138
Rubanoid.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.640
[growls]

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:02.782
[laughs] I can use this one in my experiments.

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:03.850
Rubanoid, no!

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.051
Ugh.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.121
Emperor Barodius, give us another chance.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.322
Huh?

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:10.390
Ren?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.392
Grant us a pardon this time, and I promise

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.027
we will take down the Brawlers.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:15.061
We will redeem ourselves.

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.062
BARODIUS: Silence!

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.901
Begging for your life, Ren?

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.937
How weak and pathetic you are.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:24.938
Ha.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.511
[groans]

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:35.381
Well, Ren, got anything to say for yourself, huh?

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.483
If we get the Element back, all will

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.285
be forgiven by the Emperor.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.486
Huh?

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.755
You would need to be beat Drago to get it back.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.792
You actually think you're that strong, Ren?

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.660
If we can't beat him through might,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.764
Zenet, then we'll have to use trickery to get it back.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.132
Any ideas?

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.301
Try on someone else's skin.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.736
Hm?

00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:00.306
Well, I could do that.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.374
Have you got a plan?

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.408
Yes.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.444
And it starts with us heading to Earth.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:05.345
Hold on.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.447
[grunts]

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.954
[gulls cawing]

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:17.790
I don't know.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.759
All this outer space and interdimensional travel

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.561
sounds dangerous.

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.163
Please just tell me you're being careful, Daniel sweetheart.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:25.431
Yes, mom.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.367
And you too, Drago.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.268
You need to watch each other's backs.

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.436
Don't worry.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:31.404
I promise.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.572
I got to head out now, Mom.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.573
See you.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.784
[manhole cover rattles]

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.453
You could couldn't be more precise with your coordinates

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:48.888
than a sewer, huh?

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.326
He's not slowing down.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:54.327
Whoa.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.732
Gotcha.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.574
We got to say goodbye to Julie before we head out.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.846
Why is this place so packed?

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.481
Hey, Julie.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.416
Hey there, Dan.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.850
Hold on a sec, doll.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.785
I'll be right with you.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.153
CUSTOMER: Excuse me, miss. - Huh?

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.121
CUSTOMER: Could we get another cheeseburger special please?

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.489
Yeah.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.391
I'll have one of those too please.

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.095
JULIE: You got it!

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.063
Thanks very much.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.665
Please come again.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:33.700
Oh.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.667
Is that the right time?

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:36.202
I'm late for cheerleading practice.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.403
Bye.

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.073
Julie, wait a second.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:40.973
Wait!

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:41.874
Sorry.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:43.309
Got to borrow your bike, babe.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.277
See ya.

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:45.244
But I--

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:46.679
I'll bring it back later.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.580
All right.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.681
Just be careful, OK?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.516
You betcha, hun.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.552
You're totally the best ever.

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.920
Mwah.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.722
Catch you later.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:56.889
Oh, dude.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.291
She never slows down.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.926
You totally forgot.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.027
Forgot?

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:03.830
To tell Julie that we're leaving.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.964
Snap.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:07.500
We can't leave without saying goodbye to her.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.269
Julie!

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.271
Ha.

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:15.007
Looks like girly girl has a fan.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.110
I think I found my in.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.010
See ya.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.312
Mwah.

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.147
Or should I say my new skin.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.390
Huh?

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.291
Yes.

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.359
Fits like a glove.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.128
He'll never know the difference.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.395
Well, Zenet?

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.296
Hey!

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:38.397
Call me Julie.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.099
We have to keep up the illusion if we're

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.467
going to trick Dan and Drago.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:49.275
[panting]

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.944
We made it, but I don't see Julie.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.546
If she's at cheerleading practice,

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.014
wouldn't she be on the field?

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:56.682
Good point.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.151
ZENET/JULIE: Hey, Dan.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.552
Julie.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:02.789
ZENET/JULIE (VOICEOVER): I spy with my little guy the Element.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.124
Now, I just need to grab him.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.127
What, uh, happened to cheerleading practice?

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:09.529
Aren't you late for it?

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.696
I thought I'd blow it off.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:11.831
Huh?

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.466
Who needs to be jumping around and shouting when

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.468
I could spend time hanging with my favorite person

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.869
in the world?

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.105
Well, uh-- there is something I wanted to talk to you about.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.173
- Awesome. - Whoa.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.073
Let's go chat.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.875
Easy on the arm, OK?

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.411
Slow down, will you?

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.712
- Oh, you're so silly, Dan. - Ow.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:27.513
Ow. Ow.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:31.884
You're really crack me up.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.352
Here you go.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.222
Just a little something to say thank you for lending me

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.590
your bike earlier.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.791
Hey, thanks.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.493
- Dan. - Huh?

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.460
Oh, right.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.395
Hmph.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.964
Whoops!

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:45.865
Huh?

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:46.933
Oh, no. Ah.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:47.834
Oh.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:49.202
Oh, sorry.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.503
Let me dry you off, Drago.

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:51.637
It's OK.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.940
I can do it myself.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.509
[grumbles] No, no.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.578
The mighty Drago doesn't need any help.

00:07:58.678 --> 00:07:59.679
Huh?

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.248
Because Pyrus Bakugan are the best, right?

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.050
And Drago's the best of the best.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.185
What's going on with you, Julie?

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.820
You're acting strangely.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.822
Oh, sorry, you guys.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:12.625
Sometimes I get overexcited when I talk about Bakugan.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:13.860
JULIE: Hey, everybody.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.128
What?

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.029
Oh, no.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.664
It's the real thing.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:19.866
Hey, Dan.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.734
How about we go grab a bite?

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:22.835
- Huh? - Come on.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:23.736
Whoa.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.539
I know a great place.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.707
DAN: Julie, slow down.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.608
Hm?

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.643
Julie, take it easy, will you?

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:31.544
Ow.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:36.616
Is that Dan there?

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:41.754
[panting] Hey, Julie.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:44.257
I thought we were going to eat.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.224
Snap.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.859
I wonder if she saw us.

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.561
I guess I'd better hurry it up.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.096
What's she mumbling about?

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.431
Dan, you need to tell her, so we can go.

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:53.332
Yeah.

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.367
OK, pal. - So--

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.268
Julie--

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.202
Hm?

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.370
We're heading to Neathia today.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.271
Huh?

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.472
But why?

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.475
We need to stop the Gundalians once and for all.

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:05.478
If he gets to Neathia with the Element, we're all in trouble.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.414
Those creeps are a threat to the entire universe

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:10.116
as long as they're out there.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.017
Well, uh--

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.718
Hey, don't worry.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.186
We faced tough guys before.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:17.023
We'll be back before you know it.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.991
Anyhow, so long, Julie.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.026
Hey, wait. Wait a second.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.160
Huh?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.763
Do you think I could see Drago for a second?

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:24.797
Huh?

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.132
What for?

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.568
I just wanted to say a proper goodbye.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:29.569
May I?

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:37.543
All right.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:38.811
Come on.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.346
Oh no.

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.580
Did I blow it?

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:45.418
Maybe I was too pushy trying to get my hands on it.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.485
OK.

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:48.721
No sweat.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.222
Well, that was easy.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.692
I can't believe how simple it was to punk this dude.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.560
Ren's going to freak.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.494
Come on.

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:56.696
Hand it over.

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:57.863
That's it.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:58.764
Hey, Dan.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.000
BOTH: Huh?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.202
What the--

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:04.270
Two Julies.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.171
But how?

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.072
What's going on?

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:09.241
Dan, she's an imposter.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.142
Are you serious?

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.444
She's posing as me.

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.546
She's obviously trying to trick you.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:14.780
Don't listen to her, Dan.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.982
She's the imposter.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:19.051
I'm telling you she's a total freak.

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.153
What the heck?

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.154
She's lying.

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:23.889
BOTH: I'm the real Julie.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.091
Trust me.

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.059
Just hang on.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.462
Dan, calm down.

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:33.399
Maybe I should just lean over and grab that thing from him.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:35.968
I'll prove to you I'm the real Julie, Dan.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:38.771
I was going to ask you not to go to Neathia and--

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.674
and stay here with me.

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:42.575
[gasps]

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:43.476
What?

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.478
You were going to go Neathia?

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:46.379
Uh.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.380
That's right.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.519
Awesome.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.621
Are you going to help fight the Gundalians?

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:56.689
You bet.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.690
What?

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.725
Now, I know this is the real Julie.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.193
But why, Dan?

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:03.229
I was the one who was worried about you.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.698
Yeah, but the real Julie knows it's important for me

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:06.599
to go and fight.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:07.833
That's right.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.935
I would never ask Dan to turn his back on anyone who

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.704
needed help from the Brawlers.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:12.738
Hm?

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:13.639
Ugh.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.074
Enough of this already.

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.709
You guys are too goody-goody.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:17.810
It's sickening.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.082
So you're really a Gundalian?

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.052
That's right, and I've come to take your Bakugan.

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:33.726
ZENET (VOICEOVER): Time to bring home the Element, Contestir.

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.728
DAN (VOICEOVER): Let's send her packing, Drago.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:41.901
[beeping]

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.205
[gull cawing]

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:50.109
Gate Card, set.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.545
Bakugan Brawl.

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.013
Bakugan, stand.

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:55.815
Come on, Haos Contestir.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:56.715
Here we go.

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.751
Bakugan Brawl.

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.920
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.256
Bring it, Pyrus Lumino Dragonoid.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.401
[roars]

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:16.368
Whoa.

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.137
I knew Ren said Drago had evolved,

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.705
but he is one mean looking dude.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:20.606
Huh.

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.074
We'll see about that.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:22.975
That's right.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.077
Ability, activate.

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.745
Crossfire.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:28.781
[grunts]

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:30.149
Ugh.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.150
That one hurt.

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.355
Whoa.

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:37.857
You gonna let him smack you down like that right

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:38.891
out of the gate?

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.326
Toughen up.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.261
Ability, activate.

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.796
Vanguard Lola.

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:44.797
Ugh.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:49.535
Next.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:50.736
Try this.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.505
Ability, activate.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.873
Bolting Glow.

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:56.675
[grunts]

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.310
No big deal.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.713
Ability, activate.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.649
Particle Wave.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.651
[shouts]

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:08.420
Oof.

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:09.889
Seriously?

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.123
Oh yeah.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:14.860
[groans] We're never going to get it back this way.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.329
Step it up, Contestir.

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.498
Ready.

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:22.635
Gate Card, open.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:26.071
Misty Solitude.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.039
Huh?

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.240
What's this?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.309
Dan, where did you go?

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:31.277
Huh?

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:32.745
Drago, what's happening?

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.380
Can you hear me?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.281
Drago?

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:36.248
All right.

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:38.684
And now, for part two.

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:41.120
Ability, activate.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.188
Evil Copy.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.365
Contestir just changed into Coredem?

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.601
Are you OK, Drago?

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:58.637
Coredem, what are you doing here?

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.539
Where did Contestir go?

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.507
I don't know.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.376
I haven't seen him.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:05.844
[shouts]

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:08.380
Coredem, what are you doing?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.750
[laughs] He fell for the switch.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.352
Moron.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.021
Drago, that's not Coredem, pal.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.289
Save your breath.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.592
He can't hear you inside there, Dan.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:20.893
This is bad.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.929
So let's see how you enjoy this next little trick

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.965
of mine, Mr. Battle Brawler.

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:28.400
Ability, activate.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.835
Phantom Blow.

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:30.836
Ugh.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.371
[groans]

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:39.578
[groaning] Coredem, what's wrong with you?

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:41.981
Ability, activate.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.382
Scale Arrow.

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:44.717
Drago!

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:45.684
What?

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:46.652
Ugh.

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:49.188
[groans]

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:53.626
Wow.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.495
That boy is crazy.

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:58.497
Drago, you got to wake up.

00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.698
Do you hear me?

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:00.633
[grunting]

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.468
Hilarious.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.371
I'm still too far away from him to hear.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.739
OK then.

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:07.640
Whoa.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.141
Is he nuts?

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.542
[grunting]

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.443
Oh yeah.

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.612
He's definitely nuts.

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:16.849
Drago, wake up!

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:19.785
Please, you have to.

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:20.753
Drago!

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:21.654
Drago!

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.355
Wake up!

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.257
Dan?

00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:26.225
Dan!

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:27.660
Ah, no way.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.528
Drago, that's not Coredem.

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.731
It's Contestir in disguise.

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:33.666
What?

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.168
He can't actually be hearing him.

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.503
DAN: Do you hear me?

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.004
It's Contestir.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.073
That must be it.

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.108
That would explain it.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:47.146
[intense music]

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.620
I hear you, Dan.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.355
Wha-- I don't believe it.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.557
Talk about a defective ability.

00:15:58.657 --> 00:15:59.658
Dan?

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:01.894
Yeah, pal.

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:03.262
Payback time, pal.

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:04.863

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:25.184
That's right.

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:26.819
Thanks for bringing me back.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.455
[grumbles] Those two are really tough,

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.690
but I'm not going back to Neathia

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.292
without the Element in my hand.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.293
Got it?

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.161
You're not going to fool us again.

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:39.598
Gate Card, set.

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:40.499
Let's go.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.735
Bakugan Brawl.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.536
Bakugan, stand.

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:47.039
Go Pyrus Lumino Dragonoid.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.308
Bakugan Brawl.

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.176
Bakugan, stand.

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.511
Rise, Haos Contestir.

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:55.280

Ability, activate.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.551
Evil Copy.

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:00.919
That's right.

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:07.192
Nice play, Zenet.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:09.461
Go, Evil Twin Drago.

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.196
Quit it with your charades.

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:13.065

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.101

Cross Fire.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.775
What the--

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.778
ZENET: [laughing] Evil Twin Drago

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:26.979
can use the same abilities as Drago,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.081
but they're even more powerful.

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.649
[grunts]

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.119

Blah, blah, blah.

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:50.035
Ability, activate.

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.012
Ugh.

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:07.319
[laughs] I got you good.

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:09.488
This is getting annoying.

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.390
Try copying this one.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.524

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:22.868
CONTESTIR: Zenet.

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:23.869
What now?

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.073
It's no good.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:31.110
We can't copy Battle Gear.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.211
Seriously?

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.579
Let's go, Drago.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.280

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.301
What?

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.803
Come on, Contestir.

Battle Gear Ability, activate.

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:16.555

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.727

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:25.931

Ah, man.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.852
I can't believe we lost.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:47.819
Need an instant replay?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.820
No thanks.

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:54.626
[gull caws]

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:59.231
[gasps] Oh, Dan, you beat them.

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.132
Yeah!

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.800
Are you really surprised?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.768
Whoa.

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.938
Oh, Dan, you really are the best.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.806
Take it easy.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:09.508
[panting]

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.811
Zenet, did you get Drago?

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:13.679
Sorry.

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:15.080
No dice.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.115
What's up with those guys anyway?

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.751
I mean, all this yackety yak about friendship

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.186
and doing the right thing.

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:22.654
It's exhausting.

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.022
Can you explain it to me?

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.158
It's the strength that unites them.

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.059
What?

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.227
Uh, just never mind.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.128
Oh, oh.

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:31.396
There's something else.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:34.399
It sounds like the Brawlers are coming to Neathia.

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.468
Why didn't you tell me before?

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.074
Huh?

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.709
JULIE: Go get them, Brawlers.

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:44.643
Thanks, Julie.

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.645
You're the best cheerleader ever.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.547
You got me totally pumped.

00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:53.685
Yeah.

I'll see you soon, Dan.

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:08.934
FABIA (VOICEOVER): I finally returned home to Neathia

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.169
and revealed the Sacred Orb to the Brawlers.

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.838
Its Neathia's core strength and is

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:16.008
the reason why Emperor Barodius is trying to defeat us.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.410
He wants the power it contains all for himself.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.046
He even sent his Elite Force, known as the Twelve Orders,

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:22.347
to battle us.

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.049
I guess he didn't realize that with Dan and the Battle

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.485
Brawlers now backing us up, we were a mighty force

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.753
to be reckoned with.

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.688
Check out the action.

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.224
Bakugan Brawl.

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:33.292
Ugh.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:36.695
Let's do this Castle Knight style, guys.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:40.132
