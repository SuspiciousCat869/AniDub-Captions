DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.649
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.051
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.920
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.156
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.692
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.928
Lucky for us, we have Colossus Dragon on our side.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.430
Barodius and the the Twelve Orders,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.165
you're destined for defeat.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.933
Now Drago, Bakugan brawl!

The odds are stacked against you.

Backed against the wall, gotta to give it your all.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:45.678
Ah, ah.

Ah, ah.

Ah, ah.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.648
This is the final stand. Ah, ah.

Ah, ah.

The power's in your hands.

Two worlds collide on the inside.

You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.564
This is Bakugan.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:08.968
What's the matter, Dan?

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.336

What?

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.063
Where's Drago?

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.731
Isn't it obvious?

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.501
You imbecile, they switched Bakugan.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.336

Let's go, Drago.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.422
We have to get the shield up.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.957
Lead the way, Shun.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.692
I'm ready when you are.

LENA: Mistress Kazarina, we've received

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.312
word that the Bakugan possessing the element is headed this way.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.882
Stoica and Airzel have failed.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.984
Now, it's all on you, Lena.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.118
Me?

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.120
The entire reason we don't have the element

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.456
in the first place is because Ren and your crew

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:39.058
blew it when you took over Bakugan Interspace.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.928
Think of this as a chance to redeem yourself.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.429
I-- I understand.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.672
Fabia didn't say anything about this.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.075
The generator building is surrounded by Gundalian guards.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.545
There are too many of them for us to face head on.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.513
You've been battling with Dan too long.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:01.915
I don't see any other way.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:02.916
Hey!

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.889
How about you warn me next time you do something like that?

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.425
Speed and stealth is the way of the ninja.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.459
Get used to it.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.665
And here I thought Dan was a difficult brawler

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.733
to be partnered with.

This looks like the control room.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.621
Maybe we weren't so stealthy after all.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.389
Got any ideas now?

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.892
Well, I think we're about to find out what

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.527
it's like to battle together.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.662

Ah!

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.947

Phosphos, quick, go after him!

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:28.027
What the heck is that thing?

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.128
[explosion]

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.437
Come on.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.605
Drago's power is indeed impressive,

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.541
but even with the element, he shouldn't

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.209
be impossible to beat.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.412
That may be true, but it looks like Phosphos

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.413
could use some help.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.282
As you wish, Kazarina.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.383
I can do this.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.785
I'm telling you I don't need help.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:56.389
Mistress Kazarina, please let me escort you away from here.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.623
Are you insane?

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:01.728
How dare you treat me like a junior battler!

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.730
Bakugan brawl!

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.732

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.402
[growls]

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.205
That's one angry mutt.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:17.677
Ability activate, Lumino Barnum.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:18.678

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:23.716
Ah!

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:29.155
Phosphos.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.459
Who's next?

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.894
I'd say Lumagrowl.

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.395
We just need to find him.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.101
Where did he get to?

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.469
Huh?

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.438
[growling]

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:48.274
I don't get it.

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:50.042
It's like our last attack didn't affect him at all.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.882
That would be because I used the ability card

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.850
Flashing Peaker as a counter.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.287
All Lumagrowl needed to do was make contact with Drago

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.522
in order to activate it.

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.690
Get off of me!

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.893
Not until I finish using my ability

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:10.096
to siphon off your energy and turn it into my own.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.264
Be patient.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.332
I'm almost done.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.333
Drago!

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.448
With all the trouble our troops

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:32.018
have had with you in the past, I wasn't expecting Drago

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.387
to be such a mediocre opponent.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:38.057
Our battlers were weak.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.458
Are you OK, Drago?

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.194
Don't worry, I'm fine.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.864
Let's get back to it.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.532
I really don't understand why you're

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.234
so loyal to the Neathian side.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.369
What have they ever done for you?

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:52.572
Give us the element.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.240
This isn't your fight.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.008
You're wrong!

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.243
Gate card set!

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.547
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.416
Bakugan stand!

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.551
This is absolutely our fight.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.354
You started it when you began kidnapping and hypnotizing

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:09.388
Earth's children.

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:10.756
Ha!

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:13.659
We were only going to borrow the brats for a little while.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.462
Mistress Kazarina, I can do this.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.897
Fine.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.199
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:21.567
Bakugan stand!

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.438
You're going down this time, Drago, I promise it.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:28.507
You're going to regret having ever stepped foot in Neathia,

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.943
especially once I've ripped the element

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.979
from the guts of that lizard.

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.948
Ability activate, Hunter Rip.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.720
You are finished!

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:48.861
Ability activate, Crossfire.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.463

[explosion]

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:58.804
There's plenty more where that came from.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.774
Ability activate, Stealth Claw.

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:07.513
Where did he go?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.051
Watch out, Drago!

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.791
Gate card open, Evil Clear!

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:25.932
Huh?

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.200
What's happening?

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.736
I just nullified your ability.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:35.107
Ability activate, Crossfire.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:36.042
[ringing]

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.476
[whooshing] - Ah!

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.544
[explosion]

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:46.185
I knew you weren't up to the task.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.954
You've wasted too much of my time,

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:50.456
but I'll deal with you later.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.124
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.526
Bakugan stand!

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.860
Destroy them, Lumagrowl!

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.762
[growling]

00:09:56.862 --> 00:10:00.199

[groaning]

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.349
Drago, fall back!

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.118
I can't move!

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:22.188
Ha, so much for the mighty Drago.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.590
You're just as easy to control as those kids

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.093
we stole from Earth.

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:30.796
Now, be a good boy and hand over the element.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:33.899
You're out of your mind if you think I'd ever give it to you.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.068
Then I suppose I'll just have to take it.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.742
[laser fire]

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:44.577
What?

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.981
Drago!

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:49.882
Dan!

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.817
Kuso!

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:55.755
Now, Hawktor, ability activate,

Ninja Defense Spiral Twister!

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.191
Hyah!

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.327
Who let this ugly thing off its leash?

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.001
Thanks, Hawktor.

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:09.902
I owe you one.

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.003
No problem.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:15.174
Always happy to thrash some Gundalian scum.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.709
Shun!

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.310
Are you OK, buddy?

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.211
Just fine.

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.147
Are you ready to fight?

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:24.150
Ability activate, Cross Barnum.

[exertion sounds]

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.606
[electricity crackling]

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:49.008
Ah!

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:05.257
Now this feels a little better.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:06.659
Yup.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.562
Hey, what do you say we cause a little damage together, huh,

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:10.496
Drago?

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.431
Sounds great.

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:14.600
Shun, why don't you guys see if you can

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.635
get to the shield generator.

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.204
Sure, we're on it.

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:24.877
Guards, seize him right now.

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:29.515
OK, pal, let's rock this.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:32.184
DAN (VOICEOVER): Together again and ready to do some damage,

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:34.420
Drago.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.921
SHUN (VOICEOVER): Stay focused, Hawktor.

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.690
They won't go down without a fight.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.131
The element is mine, Dan Kuso.

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:48.100
Gate card set.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.169
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.570
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.944
That's what I like to hear.

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.212
[groaning]

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:20.166
I'm assuming this is what we are looking for.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.267
Yes, it is.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:24.069
But I still need to hack its access code.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.506
Ability activate, Cross Barnum!

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:36.849
Ability activate, Garm Shield!

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.217
Dan!

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:41.353
Being predictable won't win you the fight, foolish brawler.

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:46.926
Ability activate, Skoll Fang!

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:48.494

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:53.899
Drago!

00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.605
You're so adorable.

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:03.375
Gate card open, Silent Hanger!

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:15.287
I can't wait to get you on my table to conduct one

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:17.923
of my biological experiments.

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:20.426
Yeah, that's never gonna happen.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.429
Ability activate, Arcadia Sword!

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.636
I'm going to slice and dice you.

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:31.637
No chance!

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:36.942
Ability activate, Lumino Reflector.

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.010

[whooshing]

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:54.927
All done.

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:57.029
All right, let's fire this up, then.

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:00.499
Huh?

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:06.472
Dan, everything is ready inside!

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:17.883
Oh no, the shield generator.

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:18.984
Nice one.

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.688
Let's finish this thing off.

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:26.292
Ready, Cross Buster.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.727
Battle gear boost!

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:31.263
[whooshing]

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.673
That's right.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:45.444
Battle Gear, Ability Activate, Cross Buster Neo!

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:53.952
Ability activate, Deadly Fantasma!

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.454
[crackling]

[exertion sounds]

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.991
[thudding]

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:02.428
Ah!

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:07.833
Ah!

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:08.834
Ah!

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:17.076
Oh!

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:18.944
Oh!

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:20.479
Ah, yeah!

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.581
[groaning]

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.053
The shield generator device.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.988
All right, it's charging up.

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.590
From the element.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.660
The shield started restoring the second they won the battle.

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:51.543
If we don't leave now, we'll be trapped inside the shield.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:53.245
Prepare to retreat.

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:56.014
Ready.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.784
Hey, where are you running so fast, huh?

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:13.198
Oh no, it looks like the brawlers have

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.401
reactivated the second shield.

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:17.536
Kazarina's in big trouble.

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:26.345
We can't be cut off from our forces.

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:27.713
Fall back now.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.700
They did it.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.569
The second shield is restored.

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.470
Oh, yeah.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.105
Dan the man does it again.

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:56.875
I told you they wouldn't let us down.

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:58.444
Nice job, Dan.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.611
You too.

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:02.381
This is a major failure, Kazarina.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.982
I know.

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.751
As a member of the Twelve Orders,

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.653
you are held to a higher standard.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:11.123
The emperor will be greatly disappointed, I'm sure.

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:14.460
Someone will have to answer for these incompetent actions

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.527
today.

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:17.729
Trust me, I'm well aware of that, Gill.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:41.019
You summoned me, Mistress Kazarina.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.121
I don't have to tell you what an embarrassment

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.289
today's events have been.

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:46.291
You were given a chance to redeem yourself,

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:48.360
and you failed miserably.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.598
You were warned what would happen if you didn't succeed.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:56.401
So do you have anything to say for yourself, Lena?

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.171
I like you, Lena.

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:01.073
You are clever, but you don't suffer

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:03.108
from arrogance like the others.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.711
So I'll give you this piece of advice.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:06.879
I'm listening, sir.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.882
I hear you're going on a mission with Kazarina.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.083
Yes.

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.385
It would be wise to watch your back around her.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.320
She is loyal to no one but herself

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.322
and would think nothing of sacrificing

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:19.591
one of her subordinates to save her own skin.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.098
Yes, sir, I understand.

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:38.810
You've got some nerve, Lena.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.817
Trying to take me out to cover your own blunder, how

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:49.755
bold of you, but also very, very foolish.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.758
[electricity crackling]

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:06.338
Unfortunately, due to the gross incompetence displayed today

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:08.941
by Lena on the battlefield, the Neathians

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.110
were able to regenerate their second security shield.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.247
I deeply regret my error in trusting her.

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:17.749
Please know that she has paid the ultimate price

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.051
for her failure.

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:22.387
Very well, but don't disappoint me again, Kazarina.

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:24.356
Sire, I understand.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:31.296
Why the long face, Kazarina?

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:34.066
You've still got someone to take the fall for you.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:37.369
Yes, but not before she tried to ambush me and take me out

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:38.704
with her Bakugan.

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:43.442
It was almost like she knew what I had planned for her,

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:46.778
as though someone had tipped her off.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:50.549
Luckily, you had your wits about you.

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:54.119
Next time you may not be so fortunate.

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:57.422
In these troubled times, you never know who you can trust.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.761
Lena, I'm sorry.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.268
REN (VOICEOVER): After suffering so many losses to the brawlers,

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:12.804
Emperor Barodius has been coming down hard on us.

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:15.340
Jesse got scared that he would be the next one to disappear,

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.908
so he fled in the middle of the night.

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.511
Luckily, I found him and offered him a better solution.

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.114
If we sprung our own surprise attack on the brawlers

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:23.782
and won a couple of trophy Bakugan,
