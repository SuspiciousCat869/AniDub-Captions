DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now, Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.128
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan,

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.464
Dragonoid Colossus on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.867
Now Drago.

(SINGING) What are you going to do?

The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.783
This is the final stand.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.085
The power's in your hand.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.821
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.797
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.865

They're too powerful.

Ha, it seems that you don't need

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.886
to fight this battle, Dharak.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.429
So they've come back have they?

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:37.330
Dan.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.199
You're just in time.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.234
A couple minutes earlier would have been helpful.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.106
Barodius, it's the end for you.

Where are Kazarina and Gill?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.384
Kazarina stayed behind to battle Princess Fabia,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.020
and Gill's ship got damaged in the earlier attack

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.421
by the brawlers.

These guys aren't going to go down easily, Jake.

They're under the same hypnotic spell Kazerina hit us with.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:59.839
I guess we have to wake them up.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.407

They were not needed.

I can win this on my own.

OK, fine.

Kazarina's own Bakugan has turned against her.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.764
We should try and use this to our advantage.

Back to our affairs.

Are you really so blind, Kararina, that you can't see

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:58.130
emperor Barodius is merely using you just as he

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.366
has used all of the others?

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.735
Barodius only cares about taking the power

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.939
of the sacred orb for himself.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.442
And he is fully prepared to step on anyone

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.978
he needs to in order to get it.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:15.247
Be quiet you old man.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:18.150
You really think you can play head games with me

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.618
you traitorous old fool?

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.587
I'm not weak-minded like the others.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.456
Emperor Barodius is a great man.

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.362
What he's saying must be lies.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.598
The emperor would never betray me like that.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.934
I will be victorious for the emperor.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.136
And then he will make me his queen.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:53.919
Where is she going?

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.706
What are you doing here?

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:14.707
Well, Gill?

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:24.884

It's a blur.

You've definitely got some batteling skills, Aerogan.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:56.182
But, no matter.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:58.150

Maybe it's time you lay down-- for good!

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:28.414

Do me a favor and pipe down.

Why didn't you go to Neathia with the others Gill?

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.314
I'll be on my way shortly.

But first, there's something that you

and I need to sort out.

Oh really?

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:10.756
The faster you learn to keep quiet and do as you're told,

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:12.725
the better off we'll all be.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:15.761
Or, is that too hard for you to understand, you imbecile?

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.771

Do you think--

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:16.088
My head is so foggy.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.124
The last thing I remember is being in that witches lab.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.493
Kazarina did something to us.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:22.428
Jesse.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.064
Hey, that sounds like Ren.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:27.399
It's good to have you back my friend.

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:31.103
It looks to me like Kazarina's spell has been broken.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.105
Yeah, tell me about it, dude.

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:35.608
I think it's time we rally the troops again.

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.576
Good idea.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:38.577
Let's go.

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.882
Well, that's quite a surprise, huh?

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:47.786
Looks like Kazarina's Kung Fu isn't so strong after all.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:51.490
Perhaps she lost her battle against Princess Fabia.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:58.264
Hey, you don't have to keep lying you know.

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:01.100
I was on the way to my ship just before we headed here.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.103
Something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.938
It was you and Gill talking.

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.740
I couldn't quite make out everything you said,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.509
but I definitely heard Kazarina's name mentioned

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.745
just before Gill scuttled off.

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:16.348
His ship was damaged with the brawlers attacked.

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:19.718
It's being repaired, but he said to go ahead and he'll catch up.

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.253
I knew there was something fishy

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.789
going on when you told me that.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:27.693
Especially after what I saw.

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:31.864
My guess is that it wasn't Fabia who took Kasarina down.

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.332
Come on Airzel.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:34.366
You know I'm onto you.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.101
So, you may as well level with me.

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.670
Fine, you're right.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.706
Master Gill stayed behind to take care of Kazarina.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:43.909
He had enough of her.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.079
After all of her ridicule and treachery

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:50.883
she deserves everything that is about to come to her.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:57.022
Kazarina, there is no use in hiding.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.657
Come out and face me.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.434
What have we here?

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:18.143
What's happening here?

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:20.479
he's activated level three battle gear.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.514
Barias gear, delta lion.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.861
What?

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:36.729
Oh no.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.330
End of the line for you.

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.438
What?

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:48.674
Battle tresser extreme.

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.943
Omni directional automatic defense system!

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.010
Let's go.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:05.958
Nice one, Aranaut.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:07.359
You won.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.293
Hold up a sec, Mason.

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:09.595
Look over there.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.097
What happened to Kazarina?

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.906
Mistress Kazarina.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:22.541
I found her like this.

00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:25.611
Unfortunately it was too late to help her.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:28.180
But, who would do this?

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.715
I don't know for sure.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.184
But, I do have my suspicions.

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:33.919
It doesn't matter who it was.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:36.422
Mistress Kazarina is gone, and there's nothing

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.157
I can do to bring her back.

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:39.658
It was her fate.

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:43.328
Just as it was my fate the loose to you Aranaut.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:44.463
Thank you.

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.932
That is very noble of you to say Lumagrowl.

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.401
But, I can't help but wonder if I deserve the victory.

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:52.204
Had you not been distracted by seeing Nurzak carrying

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:54.373
Kazarina, I might not have had time

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.074
to engage my defense system.

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:58.076
That too was part of my fate.

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:11.623
Another Bakugan loses his partner.

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:17.896
There's no time to mourn.

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.665
We must hurry back to Neathia.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.401
Dan and the others are going to need our help against Barodius.

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.310
Ren has filled us in on everything.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.379
Though we fought valiantly in the service of the emperor,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.981
he turned his back on us.

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.517
He's saying we'll help you take down that weasel Barodius.

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:51.964
So, what do you say, Elright?

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.499
Will you accept their offer?

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.235
Let's be honest, we could use their help.

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.070
Well then, OK.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.304
Awesome!

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:00.205
Let's do this.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:03.442
OK, guys?

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:06.011
[suspenseful music]

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.856
Bakugan draw.

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:20.692
Bakugan stand.

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:21.627
Let's finish this.

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:23.128
Blitz Dragonoid!

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.536
I'm right behind you Drago.

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:34.473
I've been waiting a long time for this.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:35.774
Don't forget about me.

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.109
Aw yeah.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:41.179
I'll give them a taste of my darkest ray.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.150
I still owe that pay back for hypnotizing me and Jake.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.553
Rise Chaos Raptorix.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:48.554
This one is for him.

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.825
This one is for all of us.

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.330
Someone's going to get hurt real bad.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.799
We are going to triple the fun.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.101
As the protector of the Sacred Orb,

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:06.238
they will also have to deal with I, Dragonoid Colossus.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:09.608
[group] And we, the Castle Knights will also make

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:10.576
them pay.

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.477
You hear that Barodius?

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.680
There's no way you can win this.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.316
You're totally outnumbered dude.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.118
It seems like Kuso is a little confused.

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:22.554
Wouldn't you say so Dharak?

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:25.023
Maybe just a bit.

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:27.859
Perhaps you should correct him then.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.495
Absolutely.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:34.299
Ability activate, photon gladiator.

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:40.339
Seriously?

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.207
How did he do that?

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:43.609
With only one shot.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:46.345
He took out all of the Castle Knights.

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:50.082
This is the level of power the evolved Phantom Dharak has now.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:58.190
Are you ready to meet your maker Drago?

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.827
Let's go Dharak.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:04.396
[suspenseful music]

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.001
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): Now that the brawlers and all

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.969
of Ren's teammates were back on Neathia,

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.038
we were gearing up for the battle of all battles

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:14.239
with Barodius.

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.041
We knew we'd have some major action on our hands.

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.343
But, we had no idea exactly how powerful

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.379
Phantom Dharak really was.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.281
We took a wicked thrashing right off the top,

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.682
and no matter what move we pulled out,

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.550
Dharak still had one better.

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:28.320
Luckily, we came up with a plan, but I won't spoil the secret.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.455
Tune in yourself to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.291
It's one crazy showdown after another,

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.426
and you won't believe who's left standing in the end.

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.928
I'm telling you, it will blow your mind.

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:39.765
