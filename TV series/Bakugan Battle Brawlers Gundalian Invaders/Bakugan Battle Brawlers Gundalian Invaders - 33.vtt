We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095

Guys, I have some terrible news for you.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.818
Your old teammates have been brainwashed by Kazarina.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.120
They attacked us during our last battle.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.190
That must be why we couldn't find them in the lab.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.193
Sounds like Kazarina has been awfully busy.

This is gonna be harder than we thought, Ren.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.365

I won't lie, Princess.

It's a risky one, but it's our only chance.

Why have you summoned me, Kazarina?

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:18.064
I've discovered something you'll find interesting.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:21.501
I've been examining the DNA code of Pyrus Blitz Dragonoid

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.037
and comparing it against Dharak's code.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.305

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.974
KAZARINA: As you can see, they're nearly identical.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.842
Who would have guessed it?

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.845
Yes, indeed.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:37.984
If our DNA is so similar, then tell me why I lost.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:43.890
What gave Drago the upper hand that allowed him to beat me?

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.326
I assume it has something to do with this.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.266
It seems Drago has evolved a number of times

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.535
in order to gain his current power.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.203
Evolved, huh.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.939
Well, that is something that I've never done before.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.341
I had an idea.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.110
If we replicated Drago's DNA, perhaps

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.678
we could transfer it to Dharak.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.747
Are you saying that I could evolve?

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:11.050
If that's the case, then what are you waiting for?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.821

What's this?

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.383
An observation deck of some sort.

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.186
Whoa!

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:46.893
Huh?

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.097
Huh, Dan!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:51.998
Drago!

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:52.932
Huh?

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.700
[growls]

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.668
Huh?

00:08:55.768 --> 00:09:00.406
[growls] Who's that I smell up here?

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.144
[crash]

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:10.917
[groans]

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:11.918
Find them.

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:19.258
[powerful music]

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.536
Oh, man.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.341
What are they watching?

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:39.712
It's a presentation about our Bakugan partners and us.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.750
Hey, listen up, guys.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.651
Whoa.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.686
Is that Jake?

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.325
It is!

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:57.797
[battle music]

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.131
MARUCHO (VOICEOVER): We've got to save

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:01.934
Jake this time, Akwimos.

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:02.935
[battle music]

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.070
SHUN (VOICEOVER): We've gotta move

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.171
or they'll catch us, Hawktor.

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.976
We found him.

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.111
You might think that you're hardcore with your tough

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.846
looking uniforms, but the truth is

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:15.881
your battling skills are weak.

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.216
Huh?

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.185
But don't sweat it because I'm gonna

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.321
tell you what you need to know to take down the Brawlers.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:24.890
What's he doing?

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.526
Sounds like he's still hypnotized.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.728
Oh!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.596
Marucho, where do you think you're going?

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.966
You can't confront him in front of 10,000 Gundalian soldiers!

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:37.837
I just need to get a little bit closer.

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:40.306
If Jake's memories are intact like Dan said,

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.476
maybe I can say something that will tweak his subconscious.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:46.545
Then maybe he'll snap out of this hypnotized state

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.749
that Kazarina has put him in, Akwimos.

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:51.951
I don't know, Marucho.

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.919
Let's talk about Marucho.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.987
Oh no!

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:56.689
JAKE: This little dude uses a combination

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.424
play with his Bakugan Akwimos.

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:00.493
The key is to split that up.

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.394
Oh, dude.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.962
This is really bad, Marucho.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:05.831
He's giving away all our battle strategies.

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:09.068
If you aren't able to do that, then fake an injury.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.570
Marucho will feel so bad he'll be distracted.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.573
That's when you take advantage of his sympathy and wallop him.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.976
If I had a nickel for every time I saw that guy cry,

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.211
I'd have a lot of nickels.

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.147
Ha, listen to the trash he's talking.

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.882
Jake, no.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.817
With Shun and Hawktor the secret

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.118
is disrupting their rhythm.

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:29.088
Stay on them and don't give them any time to think.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.223
Grr.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:35.428
And then, there's Dan and Drago.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.298
These guys are the toughest Brawlers

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.266
you'll ever face in battle.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.967
So be ready for some gnarly action.

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:49.341
Be prepared to sacrifice a lot of your Bakugan in the process.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:52.411
Not all of you will survive the battle against these two,

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.648
but together we can destroy them!

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.650
[cheering]

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.285
JAKE: Glory to Gundalia!

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:03.022
I can't believe he sold us out like that.

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:04.123
They're gonna pay.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.458
Hey, not so loud.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.994
Jake, had one of the biggest hearts of anyone I know.

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:15.034
[crying] But somehow they stole that from him.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.068
I know, buddy.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.470
I know.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.371
MARUCHO (VOICEOVER): Jake loved everything that was about being

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.873
a Brawler, and it showed.

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:24.310
He put 110% into every minute of his training,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.412
never giving up and never slowing down

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.180
until he finally made the team.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.317
I just can't imagine the terrible things they

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.653
must have done to poison him.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:38.624
But what can we do about it?

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:40.159
We don't give up the fight until we

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.294
get him back on our side.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.562
I'm with you, buddy.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.331
Attention security forces.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.632
Huh?

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:50.002
We have been infiltrated by a swarm of Neathian rats.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:50.903
Find them.

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:51.804
Ha!

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.405
KAZARINA: Destroy them. - Hey!

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.306
What do we do?

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.307
They're onto us!

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.211
How did they find out?

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:00.112
Who knows?

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.580
Maybe they got Dan or Shun.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.984
We should keep moving and quick before they find us.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:09.255
Uh, I think it might be too late.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.356
Hey, it's Jake.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.160
What are you doing here?

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.832
[clears throat] Yes, well, uh, you see, the thing is--

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:20.766
Hmm.

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:23.702
I'm listening.

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.071
Grr.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:26.972
Yes, you are listening.

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:27.940
Uh, you see--

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.243
[growls]

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:35.080

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:37.917
Don't you recognize me, Jake?

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.221
You're Marucho.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.590
Sure.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.394
Jake, you have to snap out of it and come back.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.363
[laughs] I gotta admit, for a little

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:54.500
guy you've got a lot of guts coming in here like this.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.501
[laughs]

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:58.003
Jake, I'm not gonna give up on you.

00:13:58.103 --> 00:13:59.238
Marucho, wait!

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.472

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.575
You OK?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.310
Huh?

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.545
You're the one who needs to snap out of it.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:07.947
We're not friends anymore.

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:10.416
Got it, Maruch?

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.350
No way.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.251
OK.

I guess your tougher than I thought.

He doesn't know when to quit.

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.520
Don't hold back, Coredem.

Where are we?

In a secret lair.

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:03.462
Seriously?

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.398
Whose is it?

Nurzak's, of course.

Yeah, I'm OK.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.472
Glad to hear it.

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:16.008
So, what do you want to do next, Marucho?

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.210
He's gonna be a tough one.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.179

Ha!

Don't count on it!

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.361

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:52.511
You're going down.

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:53.779
Ahh!

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.247
Hey, buddy.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.348
Not the face!

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.616
Watch out!

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.051
Now!

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.753
Crush him! - Enough, Jake.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:01.787
Please stop this!

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:07.359
Since you put it that way--

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.260
Huh?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.261
Yes, Jake?

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.133
--I'll stop.

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.802
[laughs] Nice Coredem.

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.908
Thanks, Jake.

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:26.145
Yeah, I'll stop, as soon as you

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.614
and Akwimos are totally destroyed!

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.783
[maniacal laugh]

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.951
Oh, no!

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.386
Ah!

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:35.854
[grunts]

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:38.257
Akwimos!

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.626
Oh, no.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.729
[moans] No sweat.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:46.432
I meant to do that, that face plant.

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.734
Uh.

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:52.638
I thought we had him, then he pumped us real good.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.006
Let's try to wear them down, Marucho!

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:59.144
[evil laugh]

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.848
I'll work on Coredem while you keep

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:05.551
working on Jake, all right?

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.786
OK then.

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:11.423
[growls]

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:13.659
I think we need to change tactics.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.094
Since words don't seem to be working,

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:21.567
maybe it's time we shake them out of their fog, huh Akwimos?

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:23.535
[electronic beeps]

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.971
COMPUTER: Ready Gigarth.

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:27.539
Battle Gear Boost!

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:28.574
Ha!

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.309
You finally decided to bring it, huh?

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.877
Well, too late.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:33.545
[electronic beeps]

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:34.713
COMPUTER: Ready Rock Hammer.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.718
Battle Gear Boost!

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:42.254
[transformer sounds]

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:49.995
[growls]

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:56.502
[transformer sounds]

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:58.837
[growls]

00:18:58.937 --> 00:18:59.738
Here we go.

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:02.241
Battle Gear ability activate.

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.475
Gigarth Pointer!

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:04.710
[growls]

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.278
My turn now.

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:10.549
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:14.253
Rock Hammer Beo-Blasters.

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:19.258
[explosions]

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.393
[grunting]

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:22.528
Hang on, pal!

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:26.632
[laughs] Looks like I got this one in the bag.

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:29.034
Don't be so sure.

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.035
Ahh!

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.373
[explosion]

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.374
Whoa!

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.341
Ah!

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:37.442
[grunts] Ah!

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:51.089
[moaning]

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.625
[moans] This is crazy.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:56.395
We're supposed to be friends.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:59.331
Deep down you have to remember that.

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:00.232
You hear that?

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:01.667
[cracking sound]

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:06.405
[grunts]

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.906
Whoa.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:10.609
The explosion must have cracked the foundation.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.579
[rumbling]

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:15.047
Oh, snap.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.048
Ahh!

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:17.015
Jump, Jake!

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.083
Whoa!

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.084
Ahh!

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.257
Ahh!

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:26.391
[screaming] - Marucho!

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.492
Ah!

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:28.393
Ahh!

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:29.461
Jake, help!

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.400
Ahh!

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.401
Marucho!

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:43.709
Ahh!

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:45.711
[grunting]

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:46.979
What happened?

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.782
We found Jake, but we fought and, uh--

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:53.518
I couldn't save Dan either.

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.120
What happened?

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.021
Hold on.

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:57.756
Let's find the others first.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.524
Then I'll fill you in, Marucho.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.525
Ready to fly?

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.526
Yeah.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:07.366
[battle music]

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.667
FABIA (VOICEOVER): Since we first infiltrated

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:09.968
Gundalia Castle things haven't been

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:11.837
going so well for the Brawlers.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:15.240
Forced to split up, we've nearly been wiped out by our enemies.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.109
What's worse, is that, while we've been fighting

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.277
our individual battles, Kazarina has been

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.246
trying to replicate Drago's DNA in order

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.781
to fuse it with Dharak's.

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.616
If this happens Dharak will not only

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.985
be strong enough to defeat Drago, but also

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.287
destroy the third shield protecting Neathia.

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.156
We simply can't let that happen.

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:32.658
You wouldn't believe me if I told you

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.159
what we have to do to stop her.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.795
Tune in to see for yourself.
