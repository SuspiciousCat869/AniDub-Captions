00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.720
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.123
Now, Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.062
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.464
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.999
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.734
Bakugan brawl!

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:35.435
[THEME - DANIEL LEBLANC AND CREIGHTON DOANE,

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.503
\"TWO WORLDS COLLIDE\"]

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME: (SINGING) What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.778
Backed against the wall, you gotta give it your all.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.146
Ah, ah. Ah, ah.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.113
Ah, ah.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.248
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.416
Ah, ah. Ah, ah.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.316
Ah, ah.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.751
The power's in your hands.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:02.996
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.230
This is Bakugan.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:10.570
SERENA: Fabia, this is very important.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.306
Are you absolutely sure that is what Nurzak said?

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.541
I am.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.775
Master Nurzak.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.144
Trust me, Ren, we do not want to anger

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.413
the sacred orb any further.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.982
Right after he said it, they both stopped babbling

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.085
and walked away.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.288
How interesting that the emperor's closest advisor

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.089
fears what his master covets.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.324
Yes, I suppose.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.493
This information is quite helpful.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.394
What?

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.962
How do you figure that?

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.398
Well, if you know what your enemy fears, then

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.633
you can use it as a weapon against them.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.869
That's a good point, Shun, but we

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.004
have to figure out the best way to use it so we

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.906
don't waste our advantage.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.576
Perhaps we should shift our focus from Barodius

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.312
to all of those around him.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:56.282
Divide and conquer, I like that plan, dude.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.183
Huh?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.384
Divide how?

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.087
If we figure out who's afraid of the sacred orb,

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:04.724
well, then maybe we can turn them against Barodius.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.025
What do you think?

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.628
I think that sounds like a solid strategy, my friend.

DAN (VOICEOVER): Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:18.471
in \"Partners 'Til the End.\"

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.372
Enter.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.008
Yes, sire.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:25.011
Relax, Ren.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.513
Are you nervous?

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.914
No, sire.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.315
Good, you shouldn't be.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.285
Only my most trusted subjects have the privilege of entering

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.953
my private sanctuary.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.622
I am truly honored, sire.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.258
Don't lower your eyes, Ren.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.727
It's a sign of weakness, and I have

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.795
zero tolerance for weakness.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.698
Despite your team's many losses, I still

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.301
see a lot of promise in you.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.003
Thank you, sire.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.071
Tell me what happened with Nurzak.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.147
What are you so angry about Ren?

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.816
This just shows that the emperor trusts you.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.120
He just wants me to spy on the others for him.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.055
The whole reason I took this assignment

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.823
was to be free from the underworld

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.191
where we were forced to live.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.294
If I refuse the emperor's orders,

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.329
we'll be banished back there with no hope

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.830
of ever leaving again.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.800
But Nurzak is right to fear the orb.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.469
It's a death trap to follow Barodius.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.372
It's a no-win situation.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.308
Hey, Ren, I gotta talk to you.

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.843
I heard Barodius summoned you for a private meeting.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:31.744
Was it about me?

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.779
Zenet?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.213
Does he want me bumped off too?

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.148
He must.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.717
I'm the only one left besides you.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.319
What kind of deal did you make, huh?

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.154
Can you put in a word for me too?

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.055
Come on, Ren.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.856
I've always been a loyal soldier.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.091
Help a sister out.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.460
I'm seriously scared.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.729
Oh please, Ren.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.600
I just don't know what to do.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.501
You're overreacting.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:58.571
That's all I can say right now, OK?

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:01.708
Wait, please don't go!

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.710
[sobbing]

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.515
Maybe Ren was telling the truth.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.384
Doesn't matter.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.852
Don't you know by now?

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:15.955
Shifting blame is the number one game around here.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.457
Right.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.126
And we are next in line to get it.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.527
What do we do?

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.564
If only I could convince them that my morphing abilities were

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.499
a crucial asset to the team.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.268
Maybe they would keep us around.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.970
But maybe there's no point.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.339
You don't think it's worth fighting?

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.441
I feel so trapped.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.344
We need to wow the emperor to save our skins.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.680
But as long as we have these targets on our backs,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.081
it's gonna be hard to do.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.149
But not impossible.

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:48.488
Well, pretty close to impossible.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.123
We've just received orders that we'll

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:53.559
be accompanying masters Gill and Ren to Neathia.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.894
Right behind you.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:58.431
Well, maybe our chance was much closer than we thought.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.738
Are you ready to depart, Ren?

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.073
Yes, Master Gill.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.841
This time we're going to permanently

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.277
destroy the second shield so the Neathians can

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:12.612
never resurrect it.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.348
Your goal will be to distract the Brawlers while I take

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.749
out the generator building.

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:17.784
Sounds wicked!

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.286
Uh, I mean, that's a great plan, sir.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.622
GILL: You seem a little bit off today, Ren.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.290
You better not let me down.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.458
REN: No way, dude.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:26.659
I mean, sir.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.829
I won't disappoint you.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.064
What's going on?

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:41.474
Did you hear me, Ren?

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.376
Are you paying attention?

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:44.577
You betcha.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.814
I mean, yes, sir.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.082
Huh?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.083
Krakix?

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.391
What is the meaning of this, Zenet?

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.626
Forgive me, Master Gill, it's just

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.196
that I wanted another shot at those cheese-head Brawlers,

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.430
you know?

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.500
Because I'm jonesing to give them a real thrashing.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.469
Sorry I had to be a bit sneaky.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.672
But, like, it's hard to do a good job for the emperor

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.441
when Ren keeps getting all the sweet assignments.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:19.145
It is annoying that he is such a teacher's pet.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.781
OK, Zenet, I will give you a chance.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.282
But you better not mess it up.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.418
Aw, thank you.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:28.454
Just keep it together, Zenet.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.890
You can do this, no problem, just relax.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.796
You hear that?

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.864
Yeah, what is it?

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.106
[yelling]

Ability activate, Gaia Exclamation.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:57.016
Did you see that?

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:57.917
Incredible.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.752
It rattled my teeth.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.388
We need a scan of the shield so we can destroy it

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:03.456
on a molecular level.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.624
Understood.

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.533
Who is that guy down there?

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.434
We better go in for a closer look.

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:16.436
Hold on.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:24.911
Battle gear boost!

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:39.525
They're tampering with the shield.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.029
Well then, time to earn your stripes.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.465
OK, let's go, Contestir.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:46.999
I'm ready.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.901
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.270
Bakugan stand!

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.107
Rise, Haos Contestir!

00:07:55.208 --> 00:08:00.413
Battle gear ability activate, Swayther Gekkou.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:01.314
Oh, man!

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.515
What is this stuff?

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.083
Focus on our objective.

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:06.719
Let the girl worry about the counterattack.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:15.094
Time to add some pressure, Hawktor.

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:18.164
[laser fire]

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.133
That's it.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.069
Keep your head down and carry on, Zenet.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.570
Keep them off us.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.005
Yes, sir.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.307
All right, let's do this!

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.995
Come on, man.

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.397
Sorry, caught me by surprise there.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.032
I won't let it happen again.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.800
Oh, you better not.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.069
Gate card set!

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.971
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.339
Bakugan stand!

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:02.642
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.477
Bakugan stand!

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:07.246
Let's do it again, Hawktor, just like last time.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.516
Time to inflict some heavy damage.

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.018
Come on, lightweight.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:12.919
Bring it on!

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.388
Take him down, Contestir.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.857
[exertion sounds]

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:21.294
Ability activate, Bolting Blow!

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.795
Cheer up, buttercup.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.263
Here comes the good part.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.032
Battle gear boost.

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:32.805
Oh, yeah!

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.040
Battle gear boost!

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.454
You're not gonna shake a tail feather and run from me.

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:49.355
Don't worry.

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.490
I've got him in my sights.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.960
I'm getting really bored of this, man.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.895
Let's roast this flying chicken!

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:59.231
You want him original recipe or extra crispy?

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.566
ZENET (VOICEOVER): Let's show them Ren's

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.435
not the only one who can fight.

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.539
SHUN (VOICEOVER): We have to keep the shield intact,

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.374
Hawktor.

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:12.878
Gate card open, Anger Sign!

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:13.779
Whoa!

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.382
I'm losing altitude.

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.884
What was that?

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.654
Zenet, quit fooling around and finish them.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:24.090
I'm trying, you pompous nimrod.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.725
Give me a second.

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:31.464
Ah, battle gear ability activate, Spartablaster Rigel!

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.699
Let's get out of here, Hawktor.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.201
You read my mind.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.637
Over there, by the shield, that's who we need to hit.

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:39.905
You got it.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:45.611
Battle gear ability activate, Swayther Gekkou.

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.546
Aw, man, not again.

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.482
I can't see anything in here.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.383
Calm down.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.283
I'll get us out of here.

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.753
Hurry up, then.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:56.222
Ah, they're right below us!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.857
Go get 'em!

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.393
I really hate it when you get bossy.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.362
[laser fire]

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.434
Cease fire, it's me, you fool.

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:11.270
The data has been corrupted and the encoding transfer

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.705
has failed.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.340
You imbecile, what are you doing?

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.241
Ah!

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.442
He tricked me.

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.144
I'm sorry.

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:22.114
Heads up, he's coming around again.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.016
Eat this!

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.885
Ah!

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:26.786
That hurt.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:27.787
[groans]

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.391

[groans]

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.710
Once more.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.046
Gate card set!

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:56.782
ALL: Bakugan brawl!

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.484

Ability activate, Samurai Shield.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:24.343
Seriously?

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.277
Not even a scratch?

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:26.479
Uh-oh.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.583
I better get back in there before I lose my spot.

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:33.686
It is time you feel the full might of Krakix.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.221
Battle gear boost!

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.766
Master Gill, I can do this, promise.

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:50.002
Ready when you are, Zenet.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:53.506
Ability activate, Advance Rapier!

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:02.281
OK, gate card open, Change Link Force!

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.019
Are you kidding me?

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.120
[explosion]

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:12.525
I can't believe he boomeranged my attack like that.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.026
You are useless.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:18.597
Battle gear, ability activate, Vicer Orochi!

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:19.798
Whoa, easy.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.866
[crashing]

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.603
Ah!

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.639
[groaning]

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:29.008
Ah!

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.976
Ah!

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.411
Hawktor, no!

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:33.379
Ah!

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:40.186
Blaze Barnum!

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.287
[explosion]

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:44.590
Dan Kuso!

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.395
Thanks, Drago.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.396
No problem.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.597
I hope you're OK.

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.965
You're a little late.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:56.969
Sorry, dude, traffic was a killer.

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.103
Ready Cross Buster.

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.608
Battle gear boost!

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.883
SHUN: Battle gear boost!

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:25.197
Battle gear ability activate, Swayther Gekkou.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.599
Here I come.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:27.600
[exertion sounds]

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.168
[laser fire]

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:38.577
Battle gear ability activate, Cross Buster Neo!

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:39.645
[explosion]

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.850
Zenet, I'm sorry.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.885
[laser fire]

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:52.691
Don't feel bad.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:53.759
You never had a chance.

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:54.660
[laughs]

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.228
- I don't believe it. - Oh!

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.296
We lost.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.370
You failed me, Zenet.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.371
Let's go.

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.917
That's it, it's over.

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.152
I'm done for.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:23.222
Oh, man.

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.223
Zenet.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:25.557
Yeah?

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:27.459
Maybe there's a way we can talk ourselves out of this.

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.394
Huh?

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.930
I'm sure we can reason with Gill.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.264
I doubt it.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.333
There has to be something we can offer him.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.403
All I had to offer were my babbling skills

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.637
and they weren't good enough.

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:39.772
He won't help me.

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:42.007
But you fought so bravely for him today.

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:44.109
You're forgetting we're Gundalian.

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.779
We're not down with this whole loyalty thing.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.080
I suppose not.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.850
Yeah, that's what makes us different from the humans,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.686
things like partnership and loyalty

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.422
mean something to the humans, Contestir.

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.557
The only time we work together is when we want to mess someone

00:15:58.657 --> 00:15:59.558
up.

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:06.532
Sir, we were only able to transfer 76% of the data

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:07.599
successfully.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.101
That's it?

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:11.103
This is all your fault.

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:13.138
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:16.275
I'll do anything, if you just give me another chance

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:17.409
to make it right.

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.680
You are all out of chances, foolish girl.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.582
Master Gill, I have a suggestion.

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:24.917
Nobody asked you.

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.119
Please, sir, if you just listen,

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:28.721
I promise you'll be interested.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.989
It's no secret that others in the Twelve Orders

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.658
are jealous now that you're second in command

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:33.726
to the emperor.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.028
You could use someone loyal only to you

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.097
to watch your back and report on the activities

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:38.997
of these members.

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:41.266
And who would this someone be?

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.001
Why, Zenet, of course.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.203
Right.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:47.406
I, uh-- I would be honored to serve under you.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.941
And I'll serve alongside her.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.709
Very well, you two.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.878
This sounds like an interesting arrangement,

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:56.014
so I'm willing to try it out, for now anyway.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.417
Oh, thank you, Master Gill.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:01.220
Now, I want you to disguise yourself as Nurzak

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.788
and spy on Kazarina.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.334
Hey, what are you looking at?

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.069
Am I wearing something of yours or something?

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.003
Huh?

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:20.539
Relax, no one suspects a thing.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:24.410
Excuse me, Mistress Kazarina, Master Nurzak to see you.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.878
Really?

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:27.813
KAZARINA (VOICEOVER): He's being very foolish to come

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.883
here in full view of others.

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.452
Please forgive the intrusion, Kazarina,

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:35.421
but we need to speak immediately.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.157
You've got 60 seconds.

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:41.226
I'm just wondering if--

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.828
if you've thought about it?

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:44.863
About what?

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:48.634
You know, that thing we talked about.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.835
ZENET (VOICEOVER): Just stay cool

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:51.470
and keep it together Zenet.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.239
The grumpy old bag will never know.

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:56.375
And why do you ask?

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:58.577
I said my mind was made up.

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:01.713
Right, I was just, you know, checking.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:04.783
Come on, keep the conversation going.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:06.218
ZENET (VOICEOVER): You think this is easy?

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:07.553
Why don't you try it then?

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:09.121
Just back off dude.

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.557
So what's the matter, old man?

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:13.125
Are you having second thoughts now

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.660
and maybe losing your nerve?

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.561
What?

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:16.595
Of course not.

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:19.231
Well, that's good to hear.

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:23.502
So our plan to overthrow Barodius is on schedule?

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:24.636
Mm-hmm.

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.004
ZENET (VOICEOVER): Overthrow Barodius?

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:32.878
Well, I'll catch you later, Kazarina.

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:33.879
Take it easy.

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:38.417
ZENET: Holy cow!

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.757
We got a secret.

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.926
And boy oh boy is Master Gill gonna

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:50.662
be happy when he hears it.

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.130
Nice work, Zenet.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.600
I think I'm a natural at this spy business.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:58.504
Seriously?

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:01.240
Those two are planning on overthrowing the emperor?

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.041
I know, right?

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:04.109
Can you believe it?

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:05.978
Those two are so sneaky.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.387
Krakix, what are you doing here?

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:18.657
Krakix?

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:25.330
You have done very well, Zenet.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.465
Thank you.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:30.602
I'm totally ready for my next assignment, sir.

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:33.071
Master Gill?

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:33.972
Answer me!

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:35.374
[exertion sounds]

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.775
Ah!

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:38.610
You tricked us!

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.891
ZENET: I-- I don't understand.

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:54.393
You said I did well.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:55.961
Why are you punishing me?

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:10.943
Zenet.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.010
Contestir.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.648
They betrayed us.

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:21.019
I told you that-- that Gundalians don't do loyalty,

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.588
remember?

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:25.624
That's not always true, Zenet.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.559
You and I were loyal to each other.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:28.760
We were real partners.

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:38.870
Wow, man, you're totally right, we really were partners.

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:40.305
Contestir?

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.308
Yes, Zenet, what is it?

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:46.078
I'm sorry that it took so long to realize that.

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:50.816
It's OK.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.084
Better late than never.

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.994
Good night and sweet dreams, partner.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:08.767
DAN (VOICEOVER): Now that we know

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.235
certain members of the Twelve Orders

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.904
are scared of the sacred orb, we need to use that knowledge

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:13.905
to our advantage.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.574
If we can cause a division in those

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:18.110
who are loyal to Barodius, we can seriously

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.978
weaken the Gundalian forces.

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:22.614
If we can get Nurzak to bail, the rest should be easy.

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:24.316
But he'll be a hard nut to crack.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.318
We definitely got our work cut out for us.

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:29.321
But we can't let Queen Serena and the rest of Neathia down.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.590
You should tune in to watch us divide and conquer.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.258
You won't believe who shows up.

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:36.061
I've gotta tell you, Nurzak is one serious battler.

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.129
Don't miss it!

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.065
