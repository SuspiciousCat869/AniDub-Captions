DAN: Since our return to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.543
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.413
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.716
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.352
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.223
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.292
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.261
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.096
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.698
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.133
OK buddy, let's do this!

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.034

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.932

Yep, sure am.

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:26.946

Dan Kuso.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:36.355
Ren, can I ask you something?

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.658
Sure, of course.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:42.328
So how have you been tracking down these Neathian agents?

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:45.865
Actually Shun, it was quite easy.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.100
The agents from Neathia have devised a way

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.803
to travel between their world and Bakugan Interspace

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.839
using the power of their Bakugan.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.508
They don't need to rely on access points like we do.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.977
Wow, that's awful convenient.

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:00.446
Basically, that means we'd have records of their battles,

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.082
but no records of their arrival or departure through the access

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.217
points.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.952
I just had to cross-reference those two lists.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.020
But the number of people on those lists

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.755
would easily be in the millions.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.891
Cross-referencing all of that data

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.693
should have taken at least a week.

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:15.161
Guess I got lucky.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.264
I found all three in just one day.

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:19.398
Sorry!

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:21.434
I had to help this old lady cross the street.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:22.902
Sure you did.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:24.370
Get this you guys.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.506
On my way here, some chick grabbed me,

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.007
tossed me like a rag doll.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.108
All: Huh?

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.209

Why?

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.578
What did you do to her?

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.546
Nothing.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.915
He was just running fast and kapow!

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.217
She has to be some kind of Kung Fu master

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:39.485
to have that kind of power.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.720
You'd never know it though.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.290
She's just this tiny brunette with big green eyes.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.361
Dan, did this girl say anything else to you at all?

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.695
Yeah.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.931
She asked me who the best battler in Bakugan Interspace

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.032
was.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.002
It was if she'd never heard of me before.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.871
Maybe she was some kind of crazed fan in disguise.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.840
If she was a fan, why would she throw

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.643
him to the ground like that?

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:06.279
Hey Ren, what's wrong?

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.748
I'm thinking that this girl might

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.616
be another Neathian agent.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:11.784
ALL: Huh?

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.220
But what makes you think that?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.322
Neathians are known for their stealthy

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:18.524
hand-to-hand combat skills.

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:21.327
And if she's been asking for the strongest battler, then

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.930
maybe she was sent here to kidnap you and force

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.131
you to fight for their side.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.165
[alarm blares]

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:27.767
There has been an access breach.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.268
Trespasser on the premises.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.277
What?

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.912
Not you again!

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.447
She followed you.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.715
I'm sorry.

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:45.251
I know I'm trespassing, but it's an emergency.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.687
So I hacked into your system to gain entry.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.455
It was a risk.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:53.793
So Dan, did you receive my message then?

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.294
What message?

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.663
Who are you and what do you want?

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.031
Ah.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.000
Well, I'm uh-

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.935
You're from Neathia, aren't you?

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:03.869
[gasp]

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.638
So you did receive it!

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:06.572
Give it up.

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.375
We're not falling for your tricks.

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.744
Hey, I'm Ren from Gundalia.

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.947
I don't believe that we've met before.

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:18.050
FABIA (VOICEOVER): Oh no, I'm too late.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.052
The Gundalians got here first!

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:27.159
We never got any message from you, so you can give it up.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.061
FABIA (VOICEOVER): I found the one, but who

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.131
knows what lies he's been told.

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:33.366
[gasp]

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.936
If you are helping Gundalia, then you are my enemy!

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:38.004
Well, then.

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:40.673
If we're enemies, I can't let you leave!

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:44.443
Time for us to battle!

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:47.046
Time to take this Neathian down, Drago!

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.550
I will destroy anyone who sides with Gundalia Dan Kuso!

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:59.592
I just realized I never got your name.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.961
That's because I didn't give it.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.164
The battle between Dan Kuso and Fabia Sheen

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.899
will now commence!

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.568
I had hoped we'd be fighting alongside one another

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.404
not against each other.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.572
You might have gotten the drop on me this morning

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.208
but I don't think that's going to happen again!

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.244
Bakugan field open!

Whoa, dude.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.827
Do you see the size of that thing?

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:37.496
Yes, he's huge all right.

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.765
We fought tougher and won!

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:41.300
Let's go Drago!

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.435
I'm ready!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.437

Go Pyrus Helix Dragonoid!

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.946
FABIA (VOICEOVER): A power level of 900?

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.849
This has to be the one I've been looking for.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:58.050
No question.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.620
I can't believe I'm facing him as an opponent.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.922
Oh.

Goliath Snow!

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.229
Two can play that game.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.331
She just nullified his ability too!

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.232
Hah!

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:47.700
You think that's gonna stop me?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.835

What incredible power.

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.186
Ready to give up?

he'll come over to our side.

He deflected it?

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:34.940
As long as the cube is rotating, none of your attacks

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.075
will work.

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.010
So what, are you just going to let it spin?

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.246
We got to end this battle eventually.

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:43.115
Any Bakugan with that our attribute has their power level

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:44.950
dropped to zero.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.851
What?

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:47.620
You have a one in six chance.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.389
When the die stops turning your fate will be decided.

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.159
It's Pyrus.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.229

Why don't you just face it?

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.972
It's game over for you.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.341
It's too late for you to counter with an ability.

[groaning]

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.218
Ring Zero is a Command Card that

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:23.689
freezes all of your opponent's activated abilities.

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.157

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.825
FABIA (VOICEOVER): He knew to set a Gate

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:32.164
He has a tremendous natural instinct for battling.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.334

never seen a battler like you.

Huh?

00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:57.589
Haos Aranaut.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.764
He's identical to the first digital clone we came across.

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:13.038
Aranaut it is now my turn to ask you for your help.

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.774
Aranaut, I need you defeat the Bakugan

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:18.177
known as Pyrus Helix Drago!

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.579
We can't let the Gundalians have him!

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.047
Of course!

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.450
As you wish Princess.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.784
He speaks too?

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:27.886
The Neathians would have real Bakugan

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:30.289
just like the Gundalians do.

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:31.790
Am I right Ren?

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.825
Yes.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.560
That's correct Shun.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.363
So then that's the original Aranaut from which

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:39.965
our digital Aranaut was cloned, which means

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:42.000
that the other digital clones--

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.001
[gasp]

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:51.276
--like Akwimos, Coredem, and Hawktor

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.012
are all Bakugan from Neathia!

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:57.015
You mean, our enemies?

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.317
Ah, yes.

00:16:58.417 --> 00:16:59.985
I'm afraid that they are.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.390
What is it Shun?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.760
Is there something wrong my friend?

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.529
Well Ren, I'm not quite sure yet.

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:11.930
Maybe.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.332
Come on, let's go Aranaut!

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:17.069
What?

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.071
[groan]

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.172
He's so fast!

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.173
Drago!

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:28.280
[laughs]

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.314
Pathetic.

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.215
Hah!

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:32.785
You can't even land a punch.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.119
Hang in there, Drago!

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:35.387
MARUCHO: What?

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.856
Where'd he come from?

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.324
Huh?

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:42.361
[groaning]

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.435
You thought you could beat me with blunt force?

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.003
Embarrassing.

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.471
Drago, come on buddy!

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:53.505
Get up!

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.608
[roar]

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:57.743
Running away?

00:17:57.843 --> 00:17:59.578
Princess, Battle Gear!

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:00.813
OK then.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:01.713
Ready.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:02.714
Battle Crusher.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.020
Battle Gear boost!

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.457
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.025
Combat Crusher mode!

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.801
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.070
Battle Crusher mode!

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.539
Locked on target.

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:28.941
Engage!

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:30.042
Not so fast!

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.543
Ability activate!

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:32.678
Hyper Helix Shield!

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:36.982
Hah, that won't last.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.686
[groaning]

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.654
Time for us to break out the Battle Gear too.

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:43.555
Ready.

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:44.556
JetKor.

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:49.495
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:50.562
JetKor Delta!

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.643
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.211
JetKor Delta!

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.949
[grunting]

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.651
Locked on target.

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:13.819
Oh no!

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.820
Engage!

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.190
[roar]

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.332
I can't believe I lost even though I

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:28.934
was battling with Aranaut.

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:29.868
Battle over!

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:30.769
The winner--

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:31.670
Yeah!

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.971
--Dan Kuso!

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.706
Dan the man does it again!

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.912
FABIA (VOICEOVER): Dan Kuso and his Bakugan,

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:42.214
Drago, they're more powerful than I

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.582
could have ever imagined.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:46.185
I can't believe they're fighting on the side of Gundalia.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.321
Hah!

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.622
Let that be a lesson.

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:53.058
Bakugan Interspace is for friendly battling.

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:55.561
Hostile forces, like you, aren't welcome.

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:58.697
Stop using the Bakugan as weapons of war!

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.067
[screaming]

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:02.968
Oh.

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:03.969
Not again!

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.373
You don't know anything Dan.

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:11.944
Huh?

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:12.945
Dan!

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:14.880
Ow.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.881
Ow.

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.549
You OK Dan?

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:20.285
I think she broke my butt.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.219
Huh?

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.888
Where did Shun go?

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.223
Uh.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.490
But he was just here.

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:26.391
REN (VOICEOVER): With us.

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:29.895
[suspenseful music]

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:33.899
The battler we've spent all this time looking for?

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:39.271
Turns out, he's already working for the Gundalians.

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.073
What shall we do Princess?

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:43.275
Perhaps we should return home.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.476
No!

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:48.180
We can't go back now, not if we're empty handed.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.216
I know what we have to do now.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:53.785
We must get Dan to switch to our side to help

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.153
us fight the battle Aranaut.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.288
So tell me.

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:58.824
What the--

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.492
So it's you.

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:03.562
I'd like to hear your side of the story.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.001
I couldn't believe it when Dan the man

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.670
and the others asked me to join the brawlers.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.905
But I'm so new at battling I wonder if it's even

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.841
fair to call myself a brawler.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.175
It's really crazy.

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:18.877
I still just have so much to learn.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:21.780
Luckily, Julie has offered to give me some advice.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.049
She's a veteran Subterra battler and has

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.817
a whole lot to teach me.

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:28.887
You should totally tune in and check out all the new moves

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.756
Julie's taught me.

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:32.557
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:35.761
This is going to be so awesome!

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:39.197
