DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.383
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home,

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.884
so we can help with the fight.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now, Earth and Neathia you were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.195
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.431
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.568

THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.483
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.651
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.888
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You gotta fight for what's right,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.129
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.398
This is Bakugan.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.301

I'm here!

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.172

LUMAGROWL: What's happening?

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.578
How did he break free of the hypnosis?

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:19.479
Ha!

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.380
Wouldn't you--

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.548
--love to know?

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:26.319
I kept calling for you, but you wouldn't answer.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.722
Is your head in the clouds again?

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:34.928
I'm real sorry about that, buddy, but I'm here now, OK?

We must return to Neathia, immediately.

Not so fast, Brawlers.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.864

We're coming, buddy!

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.109

of the citizens safely secured inside the underground bunkers.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.700

Citizens of Neathia.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.902
The Gundalians have managed to destroy the third shield

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.738
that was protecting us.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:35.341
The Castle Knights are fighting to keep them at bay.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:39.012
So we need to be brave, and not give in to panic and fear.

He covets its power.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.126
The people believe that it protects us,

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:58.097
but if we can't protect it, the Neathia is doomed.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.767
What has happened to Fabia and the others?

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.468
We need you, Brawlers, now!

Come on, Drago.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:10.710
We got to squash this, then boot it back to Neathia, pronto.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.645

Kazarina cloned your DNA and then fused it

with Dharak's and it mutated.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:27.013
That's what allowed it to pass through the shield.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.514
Then Dharak and I--

He took us all out.

Now I get how he was able to defeat Dharak with that power.

Have you already forgotten that Dharak is now

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.216

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:25.865
Quickly, climb on before they attack me again!

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.199
Come on.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.674
[screeching]

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:37.209
Is someone going to introduce me to the dragon?

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.811
No time, Jake.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.686
Hold on tight, everyone.

We have to get home. Let's go.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.011
Right.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.230
Fabia!

Come on, let's go!

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.501
DRAGO: I can't hold the portal open, very long.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.736
We have to go, now!

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.738
Not without Fabia.

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:40.439
You have to go.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:41.641
Hurry, Dan!

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:44.243
You've got to save Neathia.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:46.045
OK.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.179
We're on it.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.414
Here we go.

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:51.717

Stay strong, fight hard!

00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:00.559
[growls] Airzel, Stoica, the emperor

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.694
is going to need our help.

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.396
Ready when you are.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.597
Yeah.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:07.033
Who wants to stick around and watch a girl fight?

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.034
[growls]

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.371
OK, then.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.807
It's just you and me, now.

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:18.110
Time to finish this.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.748
FABIA (VOICEOVER): Aranaut, let's win this for Neathia.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:25.451
KAZARINA (VOICEOVER): Time to punish the princess, Lumagrowl.

[dramatic orchestral music]

Hold on.

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:46.472
If Gill was so hot to get to Neathia, where did he go?

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:50.076
His ship was damaged when the Brawlers attacked.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.311
It's being repaired, but he said to go ahead,

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.212
and he'll catch up.

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:56.649
Interesting.

Contestia, I want you to move on this punk.

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:10.529

Are you OK, Rubanoid?

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.545
What happened to Ren?

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.547
No offense, Linus, but I thought he

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:04.116
and I were supposed to battle together.

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.951
No offense taken.

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:08.187
The truth is, my old bakugan sacrificed

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.656
his life, so that Drago could get the element.

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:13.759
I'm very sorry to hear about your loss.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:17.163
Ren and I had a talk before he left for Gundalia.

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:23.702
It seems that you and I have both lost comrades

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.539
in this terribly awful war.

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:34.780
I think Rubanoid would be better suited to a Pyrus battler,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.781
like you.

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:38.884
I'm not trying to replace Sid.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.086
Just as I'm not trying to take the place

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.721
of your former Bakugan.

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:46.392
Either way, we both have partners we need to avenge.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:50.362
And I'm ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish that.

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:52.131
So am I.

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.032

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:53.933
Huh?

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.068
What do you say, partner?

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.236
Are you ready to fight?

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.638
Yes.

We've got company!

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.595
Have I ever told you how much I despise Gundalians?

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:26.298
Let's bust out the Battle Gear, and stomp those roaches!

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:27.866
Absolutely not!

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.803
Battling inside a dimension tunnel is far too dangerous.

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.472
Let's hope those morons know that, too.

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.140
Yeah.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:36.909
Better step on it, just in case.

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.010
Good idea.

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.550
KAZARINA: Gate card set.

I don't need Gill hogging all the glory.

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:59.331
No problem at all.

Well, Lumagrowl.

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:48.914
Impressive skill for mangy mutt, but nowhere

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:51.283

Aranaut!

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.584
Come on, Lumagrowl.

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:27.152
What is taking you so long?

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.354
What?

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.356
Do you think I'm just sitting on my tail, here?

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.925
Back off, and let me doing my thing!

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.461
Is that all you got, mutt?

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.831
Now, just tear him apart, Lumagrowl!

If you were smart, you'd walk away right now, mutt.

Aranaut, it's time we show these vermin all the pain

and suffering they've shown our people.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.877

What's going on, here?

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.599
KAZARINA: You're taking far too long to wrap this up,

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.534
so I've called in some reinforcements

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:25.070
to take care of things, instead.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.238
Wait a sec.

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:27.206
That's cheating!

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.908
Why can't you fight me one-on-one?

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:31.510
Cheating?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.811
This isn't a game.

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:36.482
[chuckles] We're fighting a war, here, remember?

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.350
That means the rulebook has gone out the window,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.852
and all bets are off.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:42.888
What happened to honor in battle?

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:44.790
Honor is overrated.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.093
If you want to win, you do whatever it takes.

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:51.430
Without honor, victory is worthless.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.066

You're just wasting your breath on these two Gundalian creeps.

I guess.

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.276

I'm sorry, Princess!

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.366
AVIOR: Long Aercules!

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:34.139
[boom]

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:35.641
What's happening?

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.609
Could it really be?

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:40.612
[roaring]

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:43.115
[laughing]

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:44.082
Mason!

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.584
Nurzak!

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.952
Hey.

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.654
Did you miss me, Princess?

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:49.788
Quit flirting.

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:53.025
We're here to settle the score.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:56.895
[laser blasts]

00:19:56.995 --> 00:20:00.299
Battle gear ability activate!

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.701
[inaudible]

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:06.104
[laser blasts]

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.308
Battle gear ability activate!

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.677
Sonic gear Nirvana!

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:12.644
[roaring]

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:14.112
[whoosh]

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.048
[boom]

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:19.418
Battle gear ability activate!

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.353
[inaudible]

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:24.256
[laser blasts]

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:29.094
[roaring]

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.696
They're too powerful!

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.200
Ha.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.704
It seems that you don't need to fight this battle, Dharak.

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:48.013
So they've come back, have they?

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.414
Dan!

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:50.649
You're just in time!

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:53.285
A couple of minutes earlier would've been helpful.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:07.232
Barodius, it's the end for you!

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:08.500
FABIA (VOICEOVER): Just when I thought

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.669
our battle against Kazarina and Lumagrowl

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.772
couldn't get any more fierce, Mason and Nurzak showed up.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:16.008
Kazarina has double-crossed so many people,

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.810
I don't know which one of us wanted to take her down more!

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.747
Then things got really strange when I saw Gill lurking about.

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.181
I thought he had gone to Neathia,

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.883
so what's he still doing here?

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:28.020
Is it possible he has a score to settle with Kazarina, as well?

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.822
Tune in to find out the truth behind the mystery.

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:33.392
I guarantee, you'll never guess what happened.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:36.795
It even took me by surprise.

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:41.566
