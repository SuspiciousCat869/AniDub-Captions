Interspace and forced us out, things

took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

I agree with you.

But he's not ready yet.

Now I'm good to go.

Why do you guys have Gundalia up on the screen?

Are you expecting them to attack again soon?

Yeah, but it won't hold forever.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.592
Why not?

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:42.528
We just need to make some adjustments to the settings.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.163
What do you mean, Jake?

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.933
I know a way we can add another level of security

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.801
to the third shield that will guarantee

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.736
the Gundalians never get in.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.738
The third shield is fine, Jake.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.740
[electronic chime]

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.543
As long as we have the DNA barrier,

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.346
then there's absolutely no way the Gundalians can get to us.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.247
Yeah.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.248
OK, dude.

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.383
But if you change your mind.

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.886
I always thought Jake was just the muscle of the group.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.856
Who knew he also had mad technical skills.

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:13.025
DAN (VOICEOVER): Yeah, who knew is right.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.027
Something's weird here.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.696
JAKE: What's wrong?

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.165
[ominous music]

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.772
Hold up!

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.374
I need to talk to you.

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:30.343
Huh?

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.912
[tense music playing]

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.219
[knocking sound] - Huh?

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:41.320
Who's there?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:47.493
[grunts]

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:49.529
KAZARINA: [evil laugh] Jake should

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.131
be in position any second now.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.066
Unless, of course, the Brawlers

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.904
have figured out by now that he's been brainwashed by us.

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:01.007
There's a reason I left most of his memories intact.

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:04.410
Subconsciously, he's still the same old Jake who would hold up

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.745
to the closest scrutiny.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:06.812
You're sure?

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:07.947
Trust me.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.016
Even if the Brawlers do manage to figure it out,

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.617
Jake will have already programmed

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.287
the virus into the third shield security system.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.821
They'll be helpless to stop us.

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:17.790
[mechanical door]

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.231
Hello, Mr. Shield Control.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.433
KAZARINA (VOICEOVER): The third shield and its DNA barrier

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.368
are the only things standing in the way

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.970
of our conquest of Neathia.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.305
You must destroy them.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.411
[evil laugh] Time to blow the little house down.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.312

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:43.382
What the?

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.618
[battle music]

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:48.454

[battle music]

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:53.092
JAKE (VOICEOVER): I can't fail Mistress Kazarina.

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.594
[intense music]

00:09:58.497 --> 00:09:59.365
Huh?

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:00.466
Where am I?

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.173
DRAGO: Who am I is the question.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.313
Huh, Jake.

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:17.083
I never thought you'd betray us.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.951
What did those guys do that made you turn?

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.289
What are you talking about, Dan?

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.391
I was just taking a walk in the castle

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.761
and somehow I wound up in this place.

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.863
We both know that's not true, pal.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:31.764
What?

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:32.898
Huh?

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.234
We know you were trying to destroy the shield.

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:37.670
You walked straight into the trap we set.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.171
[gasp]

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.040
DAN (VOICEOVER): I asked Commander Elright

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.809
to secretly rig a dimension transporter portal

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:45.611
in the shield control room.

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.780
I knew that there was something up with you

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.483
when you started talking tech about the shield.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.918
What's your problem, Dan the man?

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.286
I could be smart too.

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.789
Just because I have an idea of how to protect ourselves,

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.591
suddenly I'm one of the bad guys?

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:03.396
The fact that you're here proves you are, pal.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.765
Uh?

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:07.800
You're not the Jake I know.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.236
Since you got back you haven't shown one bit of concern

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.171
about your injured partner, Coredem.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:14.440
So you can just quit pretending, OK!

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:21.380
[giggles] Well Dan, you're way smarter than Mistress

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.051
Kazarina gave you credit for.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.686
Even so, I can't believe that I used to look up to you

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.321
like some kind of big brother.

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.090
What a joke.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.759
You keep talking like that, and I'm going to school you

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.261
like a big brother would.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.296
You don't scare me, Dan.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.231
I'm not your stupid sidekick.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.934
You're about to learn the hard way.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.335
Right Coredem?

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.137
He's awake?

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:48.974
What's wrong with him?

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:51.744
Mistress Kazarina transformed him too.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.546
Now he's the ultimate fighting machine

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.281
he was always meant to be.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.749
So watch out.

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.517
[growling]

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.219
He's like an animal.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:04.023
She's poisoned both of them.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.959
No one does that to our friends, no one!

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.695

Mistress Kazarina taught me during all of our time

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:02.695
together.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:08.100
KAZARINA (VOICEOVER): Advanced fusion ability.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.536
It's a dream ability card that doubles,

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:14.340
and in some case triples, the power of all your ability.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.443
You should be aware, however, that it puts your Bakugan

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.812
into a waking nightmare state and pushes

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.447
their body close to its limits.

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.248
Sounds like a blast.

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:24.149
Let's go.

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:27.019
Ability activate!

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:28.754
Phantom Blow!

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:31.090
[grunting]

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.891
[grunts] Ahh!

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:33.759
Check this!

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.994
Ability activate!

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.363
Crush Arrow!

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.797
[laser]

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:41.033
Ability activate!

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.901
Blaze Reflector!

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.269
Uh-uh.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.472
Power attacks pack way too big of a bunch

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:47.606
for you to nullify them.

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:51.910
[groaning] Ahh!

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.780
[moaning]

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.850
Oh yeah, and it's only gonna get worse, baby.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.786
Get ready to feel the hurt, cause it's coming your way.

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:03.689
[exhausted moaning]

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:06.191
[electrical sounds]

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:07.726
Drago!

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:08.660
Coredem!

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.796
This just isn't right.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.399
Game card open!

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.534
Power Flatter!

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.170
[grunting]

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.240
Hey, you brought both their power levels down

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.775
so they're even again.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:27.146
Not bad buddy, but still not good enough to win.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.948
Ability activate!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.750
Counter Exia!

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.652
Haa!

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:35.587
He's too powerful!

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.556
We're not done yet.

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.324
Keep going, Coredem!

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:42.728
Hit them with everything you've got.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.196
[fire blast]

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.265
[grunts] Ahh!

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.701
Ahh!

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:52.938
[grunts]

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:55.274
DAN: Drago!

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:58.577
[growls]

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:01.513
[moans] Ah!

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:03.315
Adios, Drago.

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:04.316
Bakugan brawl.

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:05.217
Ha!

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:06.218
Bakugan scan.

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:11.356
Shun!

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:12.891
Hawktor!

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:13.926
[fire blast]

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.295
Ability activate!

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:19.798
Ninja defence, Wild Wind Dance!

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:22.234
[wind swirling]

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:23.669
[explosion]

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.704
Hold on, Drago!

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:26.939
Hawktor.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:27.940
It's too late.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.842
No one can help you.

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.243
[grunts]

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:32.744
Hey, buddy.

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:34.580
Sorry I doubted you before.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.081
No time for apologies.

00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:37.916
If we can't nullify his ability, we'll

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.819
have to find something more powerful to take Coredem down.

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.287
[growls]

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:45.257
[grunting]

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:47.726
Grr.

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:50.229
Umm.

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.764
Hang on.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.099
COMPUTER: Ready Swayther.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:55.667
Ready Explosix.

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.669
Battle gear boost!

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.738
[transformer sounds]

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:07.946
Big deal.

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.581
I'll still take both of you down!

00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:14.520
[laser sounds]

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.023
[grunting]

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:22.561
[grunting] Where is he getting all of this energy from?

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.495
Whoa!

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:26.331
Battle gear ability activate.

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.834
Swayther Gekkou.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.869
Open wide!

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:31.803
Dan!

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.940
Battle gear ability activate!

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.009
Explosix Steel!

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:44.216
[growls]

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:45.517
Wake up, Jake!

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.585
Wake up, Coredem!

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.088
[explosion]

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.089
Ahh!

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.431
Ahh!

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:01.900
[grunts]

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.902
Jake!

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:04.903
Are you OK?

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:05.904
Oh!

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:17.216
Why did you stop fighting, big guy?

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:18.483
Cause we're friends?

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.919
When you show that kind of weakness, you lose!

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:21.920
Are you serious?

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.791
Check it out!

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.060
Kazarina's ship.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.629
What a disappointing loss.

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:34.099
However, Jake will prove to be a useful soldier

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:35.133
to have in the stable.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.703
[transporter beam]

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:40.606
Ah!

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:41.673
Wait!

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:42.574
Ah!

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:43.475
Jake!

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:46.078
[grunting]

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:47.946
Next time we see each other, remember

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:50.382
what I said about showing weakness because I

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:52.351
won't be showing you any.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.357
[ship blasts]

00:20:58.457 --> 00:20:59.791
Ah, Jake.

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.860
[moans] You gotta come back to us.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.861
Jake!

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.899
[action music]

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.302
I can't believe we lost Jake again to the Gundalians.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.170
We gotta go to Gundalia to get them back.

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.905
I know the others will try to talk us out of it,

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.941
so Drago and I are just going to go on our own.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.210
I think I've figured out a way to do it using my BakuMeter.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.111
Hold on a sec.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.178
Where the heck are we?

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:21.146
What is this place?

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.414
Isn't that Dragonoid Colossus?

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:23.649
What's he doing here?

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.250
Oh man, looks like we're gonna have to fight

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.718
him to make it to Gundalia.

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:28.153
This must be some kind of test.

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.822
I think you should tune in to see if I pass.

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:33.792
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:34.960
We can do this, buddy.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.995
Let's rock!

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:39.865
[theme music]
