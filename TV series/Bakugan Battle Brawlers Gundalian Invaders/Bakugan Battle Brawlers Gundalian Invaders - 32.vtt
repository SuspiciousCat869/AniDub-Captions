00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the castle knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia you were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.428
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.464
Dragonoid Colossus on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.565
Now, Drago.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.135
Bakugan, brawl.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.008
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:47.080
Back against the wall, got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.283
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.918
The power's in your hands.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.554
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.229
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.230
This is Bakugan.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.443
[evil laughter]

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.879
Who would want to rescue these vermin, hm?

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.151
This Bakugan Biological Research Center

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.620
sounds like a really terrifying place to me.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.088
I'd rather not be going there.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.089
Hm?

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.864
Oh, look, it appears we have a welcoming party.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.866
Tell me, Nurzak, are you bringing

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:43.436
Princess Fabia as a peace offering to the emperor?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.673
I think maybe Nurzak is looking for payback.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.174
So these two are in cahoots.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.175
Huh?

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.780
Clever you, Stoica.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.715
No more talking then.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.351
Let the battle begin.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.387
[laughter]

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:11.197
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Redemption.\"

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.765
Jake, it's me.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.803
We came to get you and bring you home with us.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.071
What do you mean?

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.706
You are wrong.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.076
Gundalia is my home.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.477
What are you talking about?

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.412
This isn't your home, buddy.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.348
Sorry, Dan, you're mistaken.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.255
Jake, what are you doing?

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.733
Perhaps, Fabia, I should take this.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.634
No way.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.870
We're in this together.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.440
Nurzak, you had your chance to go quietly before.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.144
But this time, I'll put you down for good.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.779
If the emperor failed to do so,

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.848
what makes you think you can?

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.717
May I have this dance, Princess?

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.052
Mind if I lead?

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.593
Not in my house.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.395
Bakugan, brawl.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.696
Bakugan, stand.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.367
[growl]

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.703
I guess I'll cut in.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.204
Bakugan, brawl.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.873
Bakugan, stand.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.408
On behalf of the castle knights

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.512
and all of the citizens of Neathia, I will take you down.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.013
Our turn, Sabator.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.382
Bakugan, brawl.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.784
Bakugan, stand.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.491
Let's go, Lythirus.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.261
Bakugan, brawl.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.531
Bakugan, stand.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.566
I will crush you.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.807
Sounds like they're in trouble.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.042
Maybe we should take advantage of the distraction

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.477
and hit the lab quickly.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.280
What do you say, Mason?

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.349
I say, yeah, this may be our only chance.

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.853
Hold on, guys, we're coming.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.160
I think it's time we show these fools what a grave error

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.762
they've made in coming here.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.665
I couldn't agree more, mistress.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.033
Ability, activate.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.068
Fang Dome.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.604
I'm about to teach you a very painful lesson.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.108
Stand still!

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:40.880
Aranaut!

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.248
Allow me.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.183
Ability activate.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.852
Tough Rock.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.820
I'm going to crush you.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:55.528
You think those puny claws will actually work on me?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.330
Thank you, Sabator.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.766
Don't flatter yourself, Aranaut.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.501
That wasn't about protecting you.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.037
It was about settling a score with the mitt.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.172
Bring it, rawhide.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.374
Ability activate.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.375
Brutecam Wilder.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.326
What?

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.763
Too slow, musclehead.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:31.831
Ability activate.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.467
Garm Talon.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.369
I'm going to tear you apart.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.474
Don't you listen, mitt?

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:44.677
I told you those things were useless on me.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.850
That looked like it really hurt.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.985
Maybe we underestimated the old man.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:55.855
Whoa.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.561
Come on, what are you doing, buddy?

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:02.962
You got to let us out.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:07.400
Sorry, but I don't think I can do that, pal.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.401
Leave it to me.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.270
I'll smash this place to rubble.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.272
I'm with you all the way, pal.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:16.275
Bakugan, brawl.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.312
Bakugan, stand.

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.480
What?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.848
What's happening?

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:24.484
Sorry, I didn't tell you?

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:27.253
There's a security shield around this cell that

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:30.289
keeps you in ball form, Drago.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.891
Sit tight, fellas.

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.359
You're going to be here a while.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.232
What now?

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.804
OK, my turn now.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.106
Ability activate.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.107
Eel Weakness.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:54.280
Let's go, you cockroach.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.149
Ha!

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.785
Oh, look, the mad cow strikes against.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:05.958
Huh?

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.426
Try this one.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.594
Ability activate.

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.399
KAZARINA: That won't work.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.102
He shut down Sabator's abilities.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.270
It's OK.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.405
I'm distracting them with old moves.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.574
Now, we pull the switch.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.609
What you need to do is when nobody's looking--

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:24.644
[whispers]

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.713
I understand.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.149
Consecutive ability activate.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.517
Mirage Fist.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:32.652
Yes.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.719
Mirage Up.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:39.792
Smile, cockroach.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.064
What the?

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.200
How does she know how to defeat me Eel Weakness ability?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.202
You mean, how did I know that Eel

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.903
Weakness limits your attack abilities

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.439
to one Bakugan at a time?

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.509
And that you should have thought about that before focusing

00:07:56.609 --> 00:08:00.179
your attack on Sabator?

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.482
Nurzak must have schooled her.

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.517
Ability activate.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:06.419
Death Fantasma.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:09.222
Just because you have an old man whispering battling

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.691
secrets into your ear doesn't mean you're

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.860
any kind of match for me.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.095
We'll see about that.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.496
Ability activate.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:20.233
Magnetic Mirage.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.400
Brilliant idea.

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:30.743
Turnabout is fair play, I suppose.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.120
He keeps finding Lythirus' blind spots.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.089
Doesn't he know that with his compound eyes

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.424
and lack of peripheral vision, Lythirus

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.526
is one giant blind spot?

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:50.363
Don't rely too much on the fossil for strategy.

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.564
Why shouldn't she?

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.833
He hasn't failed you yet, you craggy-faced witch.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.603
[whimper]

00:08:58.504 --> 00:08:59.872
Lumagrowl.

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:01.974
You're going to pay for that one.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.945
Battle gear boost.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.720
I want some action, too.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.459
Battle gear boost.

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.442
Battle gear ability activate.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:40.346
Barias Gear Lightning.

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:43.749
Battle gear ability activate.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:45.151
Razoid Charybdis.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.690
This stinks.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.691
I know.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.932
[yelling]

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:00.933
Princess!

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.310
Well, that's the end of that.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.214
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Stoica.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:18.718
Nurzak seems to have nine lives.

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.987
We must protect the princess, Sabator.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.524
Don't back down, Aranaut.

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:26.659
We can win this.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.132
Kazarina's house of horrors is on the other side

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.134
of these doors.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:36.035
You ready?

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.036
Here we go.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.141
Um, don't you mean where did they go?

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.042
Whoa.

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.977
This is really bad.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:55.388
That was a close call, but it's important

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.023
that we don't lose focus on running

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.724
interference for our teammates.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:10:59.725
OK.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.327
But Kazarina and Stoica must think

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.661
we're dead after that fall.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.130
Yeah, I guess so.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.665
Shouldn't we use that to our advantage?

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.337
What do you think?

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:15.374
You need to understand something.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:18.611
Leading the charge isn't always the most important role.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.514
Sometimes working battle strategy behind the scenes

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.582
is better.

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.719
I knew a man once who thrived in the heat of battle

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.622
always wanting to be on the front line.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.323
Then one day, his hunger for action

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.959
caused him to lead a battalion of soldiers,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.195
including his own daughter, into a fight

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.330
they weren't prepared for.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:43.803
His daughter lost her life, and he learned a hard lesson.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:47.139
What are you trying to tell me, Nurzak?

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.942
Without a sound strategy, the battle

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.011
is lost before it even begins.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.613
I only say this to you because you remind me of her.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.586
I speak of my friend's daughter, that is.

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:02.354
Well, look who it is.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.260
Looks like Kazarina was right after all.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.830
You really do have nine lives.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.832
Tell me, Nurzak, are your creaky

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:16.168
old bones up for another battle, or do you want to quit?

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:18.471
If you think that I would ever concede,

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.841
then you're were even more delusional than I thought.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.809
As you wish then.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:24.810
Game card set.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.149
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.885
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.888
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:36.889
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:43.496
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.898
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:48.300
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.171
Give me your best shot, cockroach.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.106
Pay close attention, Kazarina.

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:56.742
I will show you how a real battle is fought.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.811
Don't make me laugh, old man.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:05.417
Ability activate.

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:07.386
Spiral Blade.

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.455
Ability activate.

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:10.790
Brutecam Wilder.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.632
You've got to be faster than that if you want to catch me.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.100
We'll see about that.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.336
I think it's time we shut this oz up, Lumagrowl.

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.772
Ability activate.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.008
Arcadia Sword.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.309
Ability activate.

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:31.310
Force Chaser.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:41.687
It's time that Sabator takes control of Lumagrowl's swords.

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:43.455
What's happening?

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.091
I'm hijacking your ability, mutt.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.932
Ability activate.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:56.135
Megalo Thereia.

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.937
Time to jump in.

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.505
Ability activate.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.307
Aurora Impact.

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:03.976
You're about to feel the sting of a Castle knight's attack.

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:12.618
Uh-oh.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.357
Lythirus!

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.192
Shall we spring out our little surprise?

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.099
Are those?

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.702
Yes, Fabia, Ren's old teammates.

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.816
Anything to report?

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:44.817
No, sir.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:45.718
Very well.

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:47.119
Carry on with your patrol then.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:48.120
Yes, sir.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.530
Uh-oh.

00:14:58.631 --> 00:14:59.431
Aw, snap.

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.567
Hey, slow down.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:02.668
Slow down?

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:03.936
How about you speed up?

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.237
You're the one with legs.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.072
I'm rocking this thing with a pro

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.375
and you're lollygagging behind.

00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:10.542
Quit it.

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.645
Hey, get back here and hook up again.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:13.545
Where are you?

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:14.613
I can't see in this thing.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.514
Slow down.

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.582
I'm over here.

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.883
Ah, I hear you.

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:18.784
Easy.

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:19.918
I've only got one head.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:20.853
Cool is the rule.

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.821
Don't get ahead of me this time.

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.890
Let's go.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.258
This way, guys.

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:27.526
OK, we're coming.

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:29.662
Hey, Akwimos, something feels weird here.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:30.829
What are you talking about?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.631
What's so weird about doing the moonwalk.

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.899
Hey.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.067
Bakugan, brawl.

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.905
Bakugan, stand.

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:42.875
Rise, Ventus Plitheon.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.610
Bakugan, brawl.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.079
Bakugan, stand.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.081
Rise Haos Contestir.

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:51.550
Bakugan, brawl.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.352
Bakugan, stand.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.021
Rise, Aquos Phosphos.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.757
Ability activate.

00:15:58.857 --> 00:15:59.792
Gorgon Viper.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:07.099
Can't breathe.

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.101
Why don't you try this one on?

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.639
Ability activate.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.740
Bolting Blow.

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:20.212
Ability activate.

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.213
Fly Slasher.

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.354
Kazarina must have them hypnotized.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.789
It seems as though we are not the only ones who have

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.057
placed importance on strategy.

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.328
Still think we're morons?

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.530
You played right into our little trap.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.233
Now who's the moron, huh, Nurzak?

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.203
Well, you're the one who's about to get schooled, old man.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.704
Ability activate.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:46.905
Death End Merman.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.080
Oh, Stoica.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.718
Oh, no.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.420
Those fools.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.521
Are you crazy?

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:04.456
You'll drown Lumagrowl as well.

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:06.492
Since when can't dogs swim?

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.060
Retreat, Lumagrowl.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.332
You're on your own now.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.000
Everyone, come with me.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.002
Yes, Mistress Kazarina.

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:20.706
Do whatever you want.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:23.242
Who needs you anyway?

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:26.178
Finally, I'm rid of that nagging old cow.

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:27.179
Princess.

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.848
Nurzak, be careful.

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:31.183
Awesome.

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:33.152
Let's see which one of you can hold their breath longer.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:42.661
And I bet you thought Kazarina would be the tougher opponent.

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:43.662
Well, you were wrong.

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.431
It's me.

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:48.267
Go, Lythirus.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.736
Can you hear the clock ticking down to the end

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.571
of your miserable life?

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:55.908
On 3, 2, 1.

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:56.909
Kaboom.

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.422
Princess!

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:24.169
Nurzak!

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.945
Floria, my darling, is that you I hear?

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.048
Please forgive me for not protecting you.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:39.985
At least this time I was able to save her.

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:43.188
I'll see you soon, my sweet daughter.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.131
Are you OK, Princess?

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:56.502
Yes, but poor Nurzak.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:58.003
Don't worry.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:18:59.638
I will go find him.

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:10.549
So I'm guessing that you didn't find Nurzak or Sabator?

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:11.750
I am sorry.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.521
I could not find any trace of them.

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:20.158
I was thinking about that story Nurzak told me earlier.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:24.062
Do you think the friend he talked about was really him?

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:27.065
Probably, but sometimes when you're trying to teach someone

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.501
a lesson using a painful memory, it's

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:33.472
easier to pretend the story is about someone else.

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:34.473
I suppose.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.510
Fabia?

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.411
Huh?

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.346
Hey.

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:42.381
Hey, guys.

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.652
How did you ever find me?

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:49.121
It was kind of an accident, to be honest.

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:51.290
We got lost coming out of Kazarina's lab

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.524
when we stumbled across you.

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.092
Lucky for me.

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:56.061
I'm glad you're safe, Aranaut.

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:58.897
It's a shame about the old man and Sabator.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.632
A tragedy.

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:01.633
Oh.

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:04.570
They were both truly noble warriors.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.871
Oh, man.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.606
Poor guys.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.242
Hey, let us out of here!

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:13.211
Do you hear me?

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.047
Careful, Dan, they've got this thing

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.649
wired to turn you into a French fry if you try to escape.

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:19.051
I know. [giggling]

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.052
Ah.

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.454
Getting a little restless, are we?

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:25.557
What do you want, Kazarina?

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.292
Let us our or you'll be sorry.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:29.127
Is that right?

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.395
Believe it.

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:33.665
Why don't you look me in the eye and say that, Dan?

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:35.200
No problem.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.568
Dan, look away.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.009
Oh.

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.010
Oh.

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.081
Dan!

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.716
You'll pay for that.

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:54.219
I doubt it.

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.220
Ah!

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.629
[evil laughter]

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.235
Despite a couple of wardrobe malfunctions,

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:13.872
Shun and I managed to infiltrate Gundalia Castle by disguising

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:15.774
ourselves as a pair of guards.

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:17.409
It wasn't long before we found Jake,

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:19.578
but we were horrified to discover

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.079
that he was teaching the Gundalians

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:23.248
how to defeat the Brawlers.

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.750
You've got to tune in to see what

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.451
we did to try and stop them.

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:29.321
I just can't believe Jake would betray us like this.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.023
As horrible as it sounds, maybe we'd

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.759
be better off to leave him with the Gundalians.

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:37.162
I wish Dan were here to help me figure this out.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:41.500
