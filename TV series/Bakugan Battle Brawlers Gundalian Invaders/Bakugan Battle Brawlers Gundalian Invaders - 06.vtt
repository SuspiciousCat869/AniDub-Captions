WEBVTT

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.842
Since our return to Earth after defeating Zenoheld

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.187
environment.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.490
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.559
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
is infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.931
and is trying to take over.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.566
OK, buddy, let's do this.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.468
All right, Bakugan, brawl.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.872
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.242
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:47.347
Back against the wall, got to give it your all.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.550
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.018
The power's in your hand.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.021
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.627
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.229
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.330
This is Bakugan.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.231
Nice throw.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.533
Your skills are definitely impressive, Princess Fabia.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.840
You know, you still haven't told me if you believe me yet.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.076
I wouldn't have addressed you as Princess if I didn't.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.046
I'm afraid the Brawlers have made a big mistake, Fabia.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.486
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Exposed.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.560
Hey, Marucho, we need to talk about my next battle.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.563
I want to use that new arena you just built.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.932
Maruch isn't here right now.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.535
He's gone off with Ren to work on something.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.436
Really?

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.537
Again?

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:22.809
Oh, man, it's like Marucho's never around.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.379
Has the data from E 24 finished compiling yet?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.148
Yes, it's done.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.384
How about the 3D spatial variation figures?

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.120
I had to run a defrag program on that server first.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.358
When it's done, I'll get started on those numbers.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.326
DAN: Hey, Marucho, you there, man?

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.895
Yes, Dan.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:42.829
So, listen--

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.265
Sorry, can't talk.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.000
Huh?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.337
I don't understand why we can't extract the data.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.574
Malfunction incidence rate of the transportation cycles

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.409
appear normal.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.979
What if we tried using the Master Alive program.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:07.353
Wow, I never thought of that, but that's a great idea, Ren.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.521
Now, then--

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.656
On my mark.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.257
1, 2, 3.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.263
It worked.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.999
The expansion for the new battle arena is done.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.534
You did it, Marucho.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.505
You mean, we did it, Ren.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.440
DAN: Wow, looks like Ren and Marucho

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.942
finished the new battle arena.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.977
Cool.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.580
That should really help shorten the mega long waiting

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.015
lists for battlers looking to get their brawl on.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.216
Know what I mean?

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.420
I must admit, Marucho and Ren make a good team.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.889
Yeah, those two dudes do some pretty good work.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.825
I have to be honest with myself, sometimes

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.261
they're technobabble gives me a headache.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.629
I know what you mean.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.499
It's always data this and program that.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.270
It's kind of like how you two always talk about brawling.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.538
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.273
That's right.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.174
Huh?

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.241
Say what?

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.077
Oh, look at that, time for my nap.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.164
Here you go.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.599
Let's take a break, Ren.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.500
Sure.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.501
Thanks, Marucho.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.772
I should be thanking you.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:33.706
Why?

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.541
Well, without your help, I would

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.577
have never been able to develop Bakugan

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.213
Interspace this far by myself.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:44.050
Every battler in the system owes a debt of thanks to you.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.853
Well, I hope you realize that, and I

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.921
want you to never forget it.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.557
I do, and I just want you to know

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.294
how much I appreciate you letting

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:58.164
me be a part of all of this.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:00.933
You know, I had an amazing dream last night.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:01.834
Tell me.

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.403
It took place in the future.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.104
I saw children here on Earth battling

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:06.939
inside Bakugan Interspace with kids

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.342
from your homeland of Gundalia.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.678
Wouldn't that be so incredibly awesome, Ren?

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:12.745
Wouldn't it?

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.214
I just get so excited thinking about it.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.753
It should be a goal that we strive for.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.021
Yes.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.791
It sounds wonderful.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.659
It really does.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.628
We can't forget the war.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:33.099
Until we put an end to that, the dream will never come true.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.168
We have to stop the Neathian's campaign

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:40.406
of terror and return peace to Gundalia as soon as possible.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.674
You're right.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:45.511
Once we accomplish that, peace will definitely follow.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.181
[alarm]

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.082
Is that?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.917
Another Neathian agent, yes.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.727
There's no one here, dude.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:04.931
Maybe all the alarms scared them off.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.233
This is where the signal came from, isn't it?

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.301
Yes.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.369
Marucho, you testing the alarm system?

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.371
No, there's been a breach.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:15.374
Then the intruders must be hiding somewhere.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.710
Try looking under your nose.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.612
Hey, who are you?

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.748
An ancient Neathian proverb says,

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:26.119
foolish is the soldier who knows not the face of his enemy.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.721
For all of his weapons will prove useless under the weight

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.424
of his ignorance.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.227
We've been waiting for you, children.

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.529
Your agents from Neathia, aren't you?

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.870
My name is Jesse Glenn.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.671
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:49.408
And this is my partner Plitheon.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.879
I believe that's my cue.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:53.780
What?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.981
Are you kidding me?

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.784
Save the formalities, pal, we're not interested.

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:00.319
You want to battle, then come on.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.220
Yeah.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.589
Hey, Dan, hold on a second.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.858
You don't know anything about this guy.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.194
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:11.063
Oh, Dan the Man won't even break a sweat, dude.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.632
Yeah, count on it.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.500
Can you feel it?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.171
The winds of war are blowing.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.641
Enough with the jibber-jabber, get--

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.142
Wait!

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.277
It's you.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.779
Fabia?

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.780
What the?

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.785
He's lying to you.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:34.287
He isn't from Neathia.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:38.758
He's an imposter, and now he must pay for his crimes.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:39.659
What?

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.827
What?

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.095
Both of us will be fighting you this battle.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:47.366
Prepare for the Princess's wrath.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:48.467
Very well.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.536
This reminds me of a poem I read.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:54.207
It was called Requiem for the Fallen Warrior.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.008
And it doesn't have a happy ending.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:56.909
Hold on a sec.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.110
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.112
This is my battle to fight, not yours.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.480
Stand back, Dan.

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.583
This is Fabia's battle to fight.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.351
She is the true Neathian.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:06.452
But, Shun.

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.222
Dude, what are you talking about?

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.723
Where the heck have you been?

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:18.364
Let's do this, Aranaut.

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:21.300
Bakugan brawl.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.303
Battle is like music to my ears, Plitheon.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:30.576
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan battle between Fabia Sheen and Jesse

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.613
Glenn will now commence.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:34.680
I don't understand.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.883
If he's an imposter, the where's he from?

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:38.818
And why should we believe her anyway?

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:41.254
Oh, dude, I'm totally confused.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.090
Shun, what in the world is going on?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.960
Maybe you should ask your friend over there.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.329
What do you mean?

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.964
How should I know?

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:55.001
I have no idea either, guys.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:56.435
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan field, open.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.540
Gate card set.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.578
Here we go.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.880
Bakugan, brawl.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.814
Bakugan, stand.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.650
Go, Haos Aranaut.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.388
I will battle till the end for you, Princess.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:18.057
For whom will the bell toll when this is over, Madam?

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.159
I predict it will be you.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.327
Bakugan, brawl.

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:27.266
Bakugan, stand.

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:28.267
Come, Ventus Plitheon.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.910
I was ready to stomp some brawlers,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.645
but you two will do just fine.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.152
Here we go.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.658
Those guys are wicked fast.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:53.559
No kidding.

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:57.163
I can barely keep up.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.566
Ability activate, light eater.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.535
Great, my favorite.

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:12.712
And just to keep it interesting, how about a bit of this?

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.747
Come on, get up Aranaut.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.383
Ability activate.

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:19.785
Vector fist.

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.787
Good choice, Princess.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.255
Thank you.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.358
Let's see how you like this.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.404
Oh, yeah.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.740
Hard core.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.874
Now stay down.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:44.477
We're not ready to drop the final curtain,

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:46.746
not when there's so much wonderful drama

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:49.548
left to play out.

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.117
Ready for Vilantor Gear.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.423
Battle gear, boot.

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:12.838
Now then, battle gear ability activate.

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:15.408
Vilantor Gear Cyclotron.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.417
That was just a small taste.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.791
Aranaut, Gate card open.

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:32.691
Up.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:33.726
Haos saber.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:37.763
What the?

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.269
It's no use.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.938
With the Vilantor Gear Cyclotron activated

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.007
your Gate card is destroyed.

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.879
Combat's a delicate ballet, wouldn't you say?

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.990
Fabia lifeforce, 10%.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.460
Aranaut, no.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.228
Combat can also be brutal.

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.699
She just got royally stomped.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.634
He really turned it around.

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.236
Why do you even care?

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:18.437
They're both our enemies.

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:20.372
Let them destroy each other.

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:23.542
Ah, I guess you're right.

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.611
And here we are at the final act.

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:29.682
Gate card, set.

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:36.288
I believe this calls for a grand crescendo, don't you?

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:37.289
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:42.328
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.130
Rise again, Ventus Plitheon.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:52.404
Your fancy clothes and flowery vocabulary

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.907
can't disguise the fact that you're a monster.

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.375
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.877
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.979
Stay strong, Haos Aranaut.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.448
I will avenge my previous defeat.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:03.482
I swear it.

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:06.519
I'm ready whenever you are, weakling.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:10.222
Oh, you think you can beat me that easily?

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:11.991
Ability activate.

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.292
Mirage Up.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.460
Just what I was thinking.

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:22.067
I must admit there is a beauty in the way

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:26.372
she carries herself on the field of battle that I admire.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.040
Can we get on with this, please?

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.711
I suppose you're right, Plitheon.

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:36.015
Even beauty will wilt in the face of true power.

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:38.717
Ability activate.

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:41.654
Metal Verde.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.721
Take a good look.

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.857
I'm the one who's going to tear you apart.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.996
I don't think Aranaut's strong enough to do this.

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.331
Check it out.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.366
Plitheon has turned part of his body into a metal shell

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.368
and increased his defensive ability.

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.070
Then she needs to use--

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.839
Battle gear.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.274
Here we go.

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.709
Ready, Battle Crusher.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.249
Come on, Aranaut, win this.

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:11.850
Battle gear boost.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.229
Battle gear ability activate.

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.830
Battle Crusher Duke.

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.402
OK, target is locked.

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:31.403
Engage.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:42.081
Whoa, that's got to hurt.

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:43.249
Is he down?

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.850
Not sure.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.785
No, not even close.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.420
That attacked barely phased him.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.822
I don't understand it.

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.156
Now I'm really angry.

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.761
Battle gear, boost.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.573
Battle gear ability activate.

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:10.042
Vilantor Cyclotron.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:11.911
Time for you to disappear.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.616
Stop fighting and accept your defeat.

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:22.454
Hold on, Aranaut.

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:25.925
Battle Crusher Duke weakens all the opponent's attacks by half.

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.631
Whoa, talk about turning the tables.

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:35.601
Come on, Aranaut, you can still win this.

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:38.170
But I thought we agreed we weren't supposed to be cheering

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.672
for either one of these guys?

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.480
Ready for the final attack, Aranaut.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.481
Yeah.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:56.655
Game over, Jesse.

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.190
Are you sure?

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.158
What?

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.859
Listen carefully, Fabia.

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:04.697
It's the sound of your own defeat sneaking up on you.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.698
[high pitched humming]

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:06.765
[gasp]

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.769
What is happening?

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:12.171
Watch your step.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:13.072
What the?

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:15.074
What is wrong with Aranaut?

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:16.742
It looks like there's a bug in the software

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.711
that's caused the arena's virtual environment

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:19.678
to become unstable.

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:20.579
A bug?

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.715
But, how?

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.783
I just don't know, Marucho.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:29.555
I'll have to run a diagnostic after the battle.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.723
Aranaut!

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:31.623
Princess.

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:33.325
Gate card, open.

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.860
Gear Barricade.

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.637
What is happening?

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:46.905
I'm sorry, Aranaut.

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:49.208
I don't know.

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:51.777
The command card Gear Barricade

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:54.446
shuts down the opponents battle gear.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:58.550
And then, it connects with Plitheon's Vilantor Gear

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.388
and it activates the level two battle gear ability.

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:04.957
I feel incredible.

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:08.494
This is Vilantor Gear Nirvana.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.033
Open yourself to the power, Plitheon.

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:18.804
Let it flow through you, and when you're ready, release.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:19.972
Goodbye, Aranaut.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.546
Aranaut, no!

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:34.987
Princess, I'm sorry.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.989
Oh, Aranaut.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.491
ANNOUNCER: Battle over, winner Jesse Glenn.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:50.269
[crying]

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:51.370
You creep.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.405
Think you're tough, battle me next.

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:56.208
Easy, Dan, maybe we should quit for today.

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:57.209
Why should I?

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:59.211
Yes, Ren, why should he?

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.080
Is he disrupting your plans?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.081
What do you mean plans?

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.450
Think about it.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.319
That tear in the environment that Aranaut stepped into, what

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:09.221
are the odds of something like that happening randomly,

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:10.122
Marucho?

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.423
Huh?

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.493
It's not very likely.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.761
But--

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.197
So then, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that it

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:21.667
was an act of sabotage committed by someone who originally

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.803
wanted Dan and Drago to lose.

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:27.206
Wha-- a trap set for us?

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.741
But who would do that?

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:31.477
The person responsible would have

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:35.080
to be extremely knowledgeable with the Bakugan Interspace,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.782
someone like the administrator.

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.690
That's just crazy.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.024
Why would I do that?

00:18:46.124 --> 00:18:48.827
Because you're a lying, conniving Gundalian.

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.363
Shun has told me everything that Ren

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.999
has said to you about the war between our planets,

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:56.535
and it's all a pack of lies.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:57.736
What?

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.739
I know he told you that Neathia invaded Gundalia,

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:05.744
but the real truth is Gundalia is the one who invaded.

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:07.880
Ren is really the enemy.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.082
Are you serious?

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.450
Total bummer.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.351
What?

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.285
Huh?

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:14.920
What are you talking about, Shun?

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.223
Tell him it isn't true, OK, Ren?

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.791
Of course, it isn't true.

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.260
She's the one who's lying.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.640
My, my, my, there's more drama on this stage

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.542
than even I can handle.

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.244
Don't try and talk your way out of this, Neathian.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:40.779
We will deal with you yet.

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:44.716
Nice try, but he's a Gundalian just like you, Ren.

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.051
Isn't he now?

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.953
A spy you planted.

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:50.222
I don't believe this.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:52.357
I believe that's my cue.

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:57.396
I bid you all a fond farewell.

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.463
Is he?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.569
Don't you walk away from me.

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.437
Come back and fight, Neathian.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:09.975
I do apologize, but there will be no encore performance today.

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.711
Coward.

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:16.114
Time to give it up, Ren.

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.917
I don't have to take this.

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:19.818
Ren!

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:22.120
Wait.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.089
See, he ran away.

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.491
What further proof do you need that he's guilty of all

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.193
that Fabia says he is?

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:31.530
I don't believe you.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.731
But Ren's my--

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.900
Marucho?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.835
Ren is my friend, OK, you guys?

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:39.838
He would never do anything to hurt us or Bakugan Interspace.

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:40.739
You got it?

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.541
So knock it off.

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:43.742
Marucho.

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.644
You don't know what you're talking about, Shun.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.679
Ren is a good guy, OK?

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:51.316
I don't want to hear another bad word about him from any one.

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.985
Wait, Maruch.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:53.986
Oh, Marucho.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.235
After being confronted by Shun and Fabia,

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.904
Ren took off running before he could explain himself.

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.540
I searched high and low, but couldn't find him anywhere.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.609
I know Shun is convinced that the Gundalian's are evil,

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.578
but I just can't believe that my new best

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:22.147
friend could be capable of such horrible things.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:23.148
Where is he hiding?

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:25.584
If only he'd come out and face me.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:28.253
What if Shun is right and I have it all wrong?

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:31.790
You'll have to tune in to find out the real truth.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.625
Bakugan, brawl.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.295
You won't believe it.

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:41.633
