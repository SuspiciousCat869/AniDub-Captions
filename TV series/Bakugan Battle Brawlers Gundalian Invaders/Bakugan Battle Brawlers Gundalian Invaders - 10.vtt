00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.908
DAN: Since our return to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.221
environment.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.490
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.559
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.931
and is trying to take over.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.400
OK buddy, let's do this!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.300
All right!

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.835
Bakugan brawl!

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.872
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.275
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.277
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.347
Gotta to give it your all.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.150
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.985
The power's in your hand!

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.054
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.627
You've got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.530
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.531
This is Bakugan!

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.136
Sorry guys, bad news.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.939
Bakugan Interspace is temporarily closed.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.774
Hey, let's not get nasty guys!

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.176
[crowd grumbling]

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.411
[sigh]

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.079
I'm sorry Master Marucho.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.782
I've tried the various methods you described to override

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:23.917
the system from here.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.886
But unfortunately, it appears the Gundalians

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.056
have complete control of Bakugan Interspace at the moment.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.124
All right then.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.560
Thanks a lot Kato.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.895
I suspect that Ren has transferred the system

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.197
controls to the back room.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.165
It was built with a standalone server.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.100
So it would make more sense.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.170
I bet it was his idea to build it that way too.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.840
So if we can't access it through the main ethernet

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.208
network that means--

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.210
We have to physically get inside the back room,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.345
and then manually override and reset

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.981
the system to regain control.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.283
How are we going to pull that off?

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.520
It's kind of ironic that the security system Marucho just

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.289
enhanced will be the very thing that tips Ren and the others

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.059
off if we breach Interspace without diving

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.261
in through an access point.

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.195
Leave that to me.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.663
I have one or two ideas about how

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.499
we can get around that hassle.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.368
Building Bakugan Interspace was a dream come true for me.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.736
Finally, we'd have a place for kids

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.705
from all over the world who could come and interact

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.039
in a peaceful environment.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.909
But now that's being threatened by the Gundalian invaders.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.877
We're with you.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.778
Yeah, all the way!

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.815
It's time for us to take back Bakugan Interspace.

DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Escape From Darkness.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.861
[creepy music]

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.829
Ren

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.963
Yes.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.332
I'm afraid we're going to need you to explain.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.868
How is it that you managed to infiltrate the Brawlers

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:52.272
yet somehow failed to bring them over to our side?

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.240
Well sir.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.441
There's a rumor that you've come

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.776
to sympathize with our enemies.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:57.677
Tell us.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.345
Is that true?

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.381
Who told you those lies?

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.149
It doesn't matter who told us.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.952
You've given me no reason to doubt your word Ren.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:07.720
But if you're playing me for a fool

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.057
and I find out you betrayed me, a punishment you will suffer

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.059
will be certainly legendary.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.495
Yes, your highness.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:16.496
Very well.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.431
But that still doesn't address the fact

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.601
that the Brawlers appear to have sided with the Neathians.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.505
What do you have to say about that Ren?

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.507
The only thing I can offer you is

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:32.145
to renew my pledge of undying loyalty to Emperor Barodius

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.414
and to promise that if the Brawlers get in our way

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:39.819
again then I will destroy them without hesitation.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.220
Huh.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.221
Very well.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.224
You may leave now Ren.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.931
You're just letting him go?

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.132
I am.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.535
With respect, I think you're too lenient on him

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.669
your highness.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.707
I could be accused of being the same with you.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.343
I'm certainly we have nothing to fear from the other Bakugan,

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.078
except for the one they call Drago.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.247
He could prove difficult for Linehalt to defeat.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.581
Hah!

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.050
Then I suppose we should have you waiting in the wings.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:19.292
Ren, you can tell me the truth.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.827
What do you mean?

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.062
It seems to me that you really don't

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.230
want to battle the Brawlers.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.636
Do I need to remind you, Linehalt, of the darkness

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.170
we escaped?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.605
Of course not Ren.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.608
You must know that after so many years of being trapped there,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.578
I'm very thankful for every day of freedom I've been granted.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.646
Then tell me.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.848
Tell me the awful truth again, so we're

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.350
both reminded of why we took on this mission

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.052
in the first place.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:48.755
LINEHALT (VOICEOVER): There once existed a tribe of dark Bakugan

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.823
from ancient times who were rumored

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.759
to possess forbidden powers.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.128
Because of this, they were feared by all

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.564
and forced by the emperor's family to live underground.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.700
Over time, our numbers diminished

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.002
until I was the only one left.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.014
From today forward, you will be caring for the dark Bakugan

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:15.915
who lives here.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:16.916
[scream]

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.252
I- I don't want to do it.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.187
This is your destiny boy.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:24.090
As a descendant of the protectors of the dark Bakugan,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.658
this is what you must do.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.727
(ECHOING) But I don't want to!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.932
This child is who they send to care for me?

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:33.866
Hmm.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.102
As the last of the dark Bakugans,

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.271
it appears as though I am not valued.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.009
[screaming]

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.781
Huh?

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.149
Are you all right?

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.918
[gasping]

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.953
No need to be afraid.

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:56.556
What's your name little one?

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:57.457
Ren.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.392
Ren Krawler.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:03.262
I am Darkus Linehalt. It's nice to meet you.

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:04.263
Uh-huh.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.369
LINEHALT (VOICEOVER): I don't know how I would have survived

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.403
without your protection.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.904
REN (VOICEOVER): Enough with your teasing.

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:15.641
Bakugan brawl!

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.478
LINEHALT (VOICEOVER): The strange thing

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.480
is that no one, including myself,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.883
even knows what these forbidden powers are.

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:26.419
REN (VOICEOVER): Yet the fear and superstition around them

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.521
led us to be forced to live underground

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.691
in darkness for years.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.359
Do you think we'll ever see sunlight

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.727
in our lifetime Linehalt?

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:35.962
I don't know Ren.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.430
But I never give up hope.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.405
Ren Krawler, we are aware that you are

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.407
an exceptional Darkus battler.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.209
So we have selected you to be the leader of the advance

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.044
troops heading to Earth.

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.012
Huh?

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.347
Depending on your performance, I

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:58.217
may let you take my seat as a member of the Twelve Orders

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:00.186
if you're up for the task.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:02.255
I won't let you down Emperor.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.523
You can count on me.

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:05.091
I will bring Gundalia victory.

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:11.731
And that is why we chose to serve under Emperor Barodius.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.433
I would like to know what these forbidden powers are

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:17.637
that the dark Bakugan are supposed to possess.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.673
I wonder too what my true duty is

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:24.177
as the latest generation in the long line of protectors

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.445
of the dark Bakugan.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:29.348
And to find that out, I'm willing to use

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.851
any means necessary.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:32.852
OK.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.854
Well, thanks for understanding and not

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.656
throwing your lunches at me!

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.557
Oh, man.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.458
That almost got ugly.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:40.426
[sigh]

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.327
Huh?

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:42.361
[crowd grumbling]

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:45.665
You can't be serious.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:46.799
- Yes. - Hmm.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.700
Totally

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.868
100%.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:49.802
Good.

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:52.271
Then everyone's down with my plan.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.739
We're down. Are you sure.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.640
It's going to work?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.908
It'll work Jake.

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:58.411
You just need to relax and let Marucho do his thing.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.746
If you're ready then Fabia, let's do it.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.248
I'm ready to go.

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.550
No pressure, but we're counting on you.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.152
Yeah, no pressure at all.

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.921
Hey, we're not nervous at all guys.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.122
Cool's the rule, baby.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.123
Ready Aranaut?

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.658
As you command Princess.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.267
Whoa!

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:22.735
Where'd she come from?

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.537
There is danger here!

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.472
You all need to dive out immediately,

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.540
and go back to your home!

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.441
Huh?

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.575
But why?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.044
Don't ask questions, just go now, OK?

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:33.713
Princess over there.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.949
They're on to us.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.118
All according to plan.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.921
FABIA (VOICEOVER): I hope this works Marucho.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.457
You guys really stink at sneak attacks.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.792
I hate to tell you losers.

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:49.362
The security system picked up two intruders.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.630
Where is the other one Zenet?

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.432
[suspenseful music]

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.001
Hey that's what's his name! Uh.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:55.902
Masushi?

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.136
Masushu?

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.604
My name is Marucho.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.072
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:00.973
Marucho.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.375
[laughs]

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:05.211
I knew I recognized ya.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.113
We've gone through a lot today to come

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.149
here and take your Bakugan from you in battle.

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:12.051
OK, very well then.

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.354
Show us what you got Princess.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:17.323
Everyone is counting on us Aranaut!

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.225
Victory will be ours, Princess.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.862
Akwimos, let's not blow this!

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:25.064
Cool is the rule dude.

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.999
Attention everyone and welcome!

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.736
The battle between Fabia and Marucho versus Lena and Zenet

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.305
will now begin.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.340
Bakugan field open!

Bakugan brawl!

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.132
Look at you.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.133
Such a tough guy.

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.034
Let's have it.

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.002
My turn now.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:03.869

What a whiner.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.019

This extremely potent poison will devour him

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.254
from the ground up, much like we've been

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.989
doing to your beloved Neathia.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.158
And he'll be helpless to stop it,

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:34.960
just like you and your people have been helpless to stop us.

Nice one.

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:43.569
The royal princess gets a royal fail.

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:47.139
LENA (VOICEOVER): Why hasn't he joined the battle yet?

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.341
Marucho, I need you.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.644
I understand Fabia.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.412

Go Haos Aranaut!

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:59.685
What the, another Aranaut?

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:00.953
I don't get it.

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:02.688
Zenet, do you know what's going on?

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:03.656
I don't know.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.858
Maybe they're twins or something?

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.460
LENA (VOICEOVER): This makes no sense.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.894
I've researched Marucho.

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:11.797
I seem to remember him being an Aquos battler like me.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.733
But if that's true, why did he throw a Haos Bakugan?

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.368
This place gives me the creeps.

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:17.903
You make any progress yet?

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:18.804
Yes.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.606
At least, I think so.

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.508
Hopefully, they still think my avatar is

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.944
actually the real me Akwimos.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.445
I'm sure if our cover was blown,

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:27.613
we'd have heard it by now.

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:29.715
But still, you need to work faster!

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:31.317
Right.

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.785
OK, Fabia.

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:35.020
Just buy me enough time to finish this thing.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.355

I've got it!

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.575
The second Aranaut is a digital clone.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.211
A digital clone?

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:00.479
Huh, interesting.

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.481
Well now that they've figured that out,

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.450
we may as well fight together.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.351
Right!

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.987

Now I'm getting really annoyed.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:34.280
Playtime is over children.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.748

You're next clone!

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:31.270
Prepare to lose!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.678
When will you Neathians learn that you're

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.513
no match for us in battle?

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:45.951
It's almost over.

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:47.519
FABIA (VOICEOVER): You better hurry up Marucho.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.456
[tense music]

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:56.262
And what do you think you're doing?

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:57.162
Huh?

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.163
Ren.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.608
Ah, tricky tricky.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:13.178
You used an avatar to double for you while you snuck in here.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.413
How deceitful.

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:16.849
Well you'd know best about deception, wouldn't you?

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:18.050
But never mind that.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.619
I've come to take Bakugan Interspace space back!

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.121
Oh really?

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:28.794
Well, heh, I seem to remember building this place together.

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:33.198
So as I see it, I have just as big a claim on this place

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.333
as you do.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.869
So why should I give it up just because we have

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:40.572
differing views on its uses?

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:44.209
That hardly seems fair doesn't it friend?

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.110
What the!

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.313
There are two Maruchos too?

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.682
How is that even possible, huh?

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.717
We've been battling a clone all along,

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:52.685
just like the second Aranaut.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:53.585
What!

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.054
Are you kidding me?

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.459
Looks like they've figured it out Princess.

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:02.227
Yes, it does.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.343
Time to end this.

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:18.344
[roar]

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.950
Marucho life force zero.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.352
Bye cutie.

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:27.619
[gasp]

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.688
Gate Card open!

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.890
Healing Up!

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.227
Even if I have to do this alone, I am not going to give up.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:36.762
Yes, me neither Princess.

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.598
Let's go!

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.166
Ready Battle Crusher.

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:47.039
OK, get ready Aranaut!

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.607
Battle Gear boost!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.986
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.488
Battle Crusher Duke!

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:05.624
Ability activate!

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.860
Poison Rip!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.294
Light's out for you!

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:12.731
[roaring]

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:14.967
Eat this.

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:22.674
Nice one!

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:24.443
You got him!

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:25.444
What just?

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.250
Phosphos's poison is fast acting

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.753
and can invade the entire body even from the tiniest scratch.

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.722
Looks like that's game over for you.

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:40.359
FABIA: Aranaut!

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:42.227
I have failed.

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.695
We may have built this together,

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:47.599
but it was based on my original vision, one of peace not war.

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:51.637
Like I said before, this is as much mine as it is yours.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.206
And I'm not vacating just because you asked me nicely.

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.207
All right Ren.

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.341
Have it your way.

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.177
If all you understand is battle, then that's

00:17:58.277 --> 00:17:59.945
what we'll do to settle this.

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:03.248
The loser leaves Bakugan Interspace forever.

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:05.384
Yeah, that works for me.

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:08.087
But are you really going to leave Fabia to struggle

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:09.788
by herself like that?

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.256
Aranaut!

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.224
[groaning]

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:13.692
[laughter]

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:17.129
LENA: Looks like the poison is taking its hold on Aranaut.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.397
Battle Gear boost!

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:28.140
[roar]

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.110
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.144
Terrorcrest Stigma!

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:37.783
Run Aranaut, right now!

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:40.619
I'm sorry.

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:42.688
[phosphos laughs]

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:47.359
Oh no Fabia!

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:48.360
Life force zero.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.499
Hey Lena, I got a really good idea!

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.900
I'm listening.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.036
What if we took princess fancy pants back to Gundalia with us?

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.938
That is a pretty good idea.

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:00.906
With her as a hostage--

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:01.974
[gasp]

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.909
--it would give us quite a bit of leverage

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.978
against the Neathians.

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.480
Aranaut we have to get out of here.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.483
I'm sorry Princess, but the last round

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.151
depleted all of my energy.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.587
I don't have enough left to transport us home.

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.256
Oh no!

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.725
You and I will finish this another time Ren.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.033
Give it up sister.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.636
You're coming with us, one way or another.

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:34.206
So why make this difficult?

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:37.943
[screaming]

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:38.911
Fabia!

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.379
Marucho.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.380
Let's go Akwimos.

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:45.918
LENA: Are you OK?

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.921
ZENET: No, she totally kung-fu'ed my butt.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.490
You knew this would happen, so you made sure Marucho

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.926
saw that battle, didn't you?

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.895
Hmm, now why should I do that Linehalt?

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.263
We both know why.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.832
[crowd screaming]

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:04.469
Hey guys, free cocoa and donuts while you wait.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.405
Easy now, one at a time.

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.839
There's plenty to go around.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.043
So you weren't able to get back control of Interspace?

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:14.413
No but I was able to install a backdoor for us to use instead.

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:15.314
Huh?

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.282
What do you mean by back door?

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.650
I don't get it.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.419
He installed a computer virus that

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.387
will allow us to jump in and out of Interspace

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.455
without being detected.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.057
Nice one Marucho!

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.658
Yeah dude!

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:29.828
If I've learned anything, it's that you always need a Plan B.

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.530
And now we've got one.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.232
[all laughing]

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.435
[sinister music]

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.838
Emperor with a huge influx of battlers from Earth,

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:43.575
our troops have been very successful in the field.

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.410
We believe it is just a matter of time

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.080
before we break through the first shield.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.147
Hmm.

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:51.450
If Neathia does possess the ultimate power

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.253
to rule the universe, it is of no use to them

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:56.021
as they are like mere children.

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:59.791
Only Gundalia deserves such power and wealth.

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:03.228
But to ensure that happens, we will need the element!

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.229
Yes sire!

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:10.502
SHUN: In an effort to stop the Gundalians from kidnapping

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.337
recruits for their war against Neathia,

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.940
we managed to infiltrate Bakugan Interspace.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.643
We worked as hard as we could to get as many battlers as

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.277
possible safely back to Earth.

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.246
But then a strange gentleman from Neathia

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.949
named Linus showed up and wanted to see Fabia.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:26.351
We weren't sure what to make of him at first, especially

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:28.020
since so many people we've met lately

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.922
seem harboring deep secrets.

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.257
Here we go again Hawktor.

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:35.460
Get ready to brawl.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.362
Hawktor, let's brawl!

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:42.134
