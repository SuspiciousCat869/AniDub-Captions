DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the Battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.464
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.568
Bakugan, brawl!

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.645
Gotta give it your all.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.281
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.016
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.651
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.554
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.196
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.865
This is Bakugan.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.369
[dramatic music]

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:16.109
So are you sure Gundalia Castle is where

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.711
they've got Jake locked up?

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.612
Yeah.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.414
It only makes sense.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.216
OK, then, dude.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.419
We'll find out soon enough.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.122
Uh, is something wrong, Ren?

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.990
[grumbles]

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.829
Jake isn't the only one who needs our help.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.497
Huh?

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:41.367
My old teammates were also betrayed.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.971
I'd like to save them from Barodius.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.573
No way.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.008
They're being held captive in Kazarina's lab

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.045
and forced to endure unspeakable things.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.581
That sounds terrible.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.582
OK!

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.650
I say we bust everyone out.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.587
We'll split up so we can cover more ground faster.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.957
Ren, you should hit Kazarina's lab since you know the way.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:04.924
Hah.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.060
Sounds good to me.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.195
Let's do it, then.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.930
Thanks, Dan.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.898
DRAGONOID COLOSSUS: Everyone!

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:12.799
ALL: Huh?

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.235
Gundalia is just up ahead.

Be careful.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.605
Catch you guys later.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.575
REN: We'll meet you back here soon.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.877
Fabia?

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:01.147
Where the heck are you going?

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.949
Did you actually think I was gonna

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.984
let these guys out of my sight?

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.420
I-- uh--

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.422
OK, just be careful.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.991
I will.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.059
You coming?

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.601
Time to shake things up, guys.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.149
Interesting.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.918
It seems we have unannounced visitors.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:42.922
I'm guessing they've come to rescue their old friend.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:46.392
[laughs] How foolish.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.861
Make sure they get a proper welcome.

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.196
Yes, sire.

They're coming at us hard.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.960
Now, Marucho.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.329

Hold on really, really tight, Marucho.

Whoo!

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:16.382
OK, our turn to smash stuff, Drago.

Let's do it.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.285
Ready, Dragonoid Colossus?

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.353
I am.

Ha!

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:49.282
I'm looking forward to our first battle as a team, Drago.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.349
Me too.

Thank you.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.241
No problem.

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.014
This is totally crazy.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.216
Huh?

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.917
I must be out of my mind trying

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.619
to rescue the very people who fought

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:31.324
so hard to destroy my home.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.426
Why should I care what fate befalls

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.095
them, no matter how awful?

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:40.533
Listen here, sister, no one asked you to tag along.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.768
Huh.

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:44.804
Sounds like the princess doesn't trust us after all.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:45.972
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.641
But I guess I'm giving you guys the benefit

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.644
of the doubt because of something Dan

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.780
said to me not too long ago.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.586
It's what made me give Ren a chance.

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.822
I know the Gundalians are total slime for all

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.924
the bad stuff they've done, but you gotta believe me when

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.793
I tell you Ren is different.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:11.798
Seriously, Fabia, he is.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.133
I know that you honestly believe that, Dan,

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.302
but I'm just not convinced.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.204
At least not as of yet.

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.139
Not yet?

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.609
I eventually learned to extend my trust to Ren.

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.813
And so far, he hasn't let me down.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:30.850
I'm willing to help you guys, so don't you dare do anything

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.985
to make me regret my decision.

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:35.621
Understand?

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.324
Ready to go?

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.026
I am.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.427
We need to hurry.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.562
Nurzak's right.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:45.832
Gundalians are bound to be closing in on us.

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.067
Come on, it's just ahead.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.635
We could have been there by now

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:52.305

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.906

Yep.

DAN: You bet.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.767
If you were a big, goofy redhead,

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.335
where would you be hiding?

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.903
MARUCHO: My guess is near the cafeteria--

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.338

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:20.946
Ha!

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.249
Just like rats in a maze.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.884
Indeed.

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:29.121
Dan is the one in possession of the guardian of the sacred orb.

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.891
We need to separate him from the others.

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:34.427
Can you two handle that?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.528
BOTH: Yes, sire.

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:46.472
Your friends are nothing if not persistent, Jake.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.778
Jake!

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.448
We all came to get you, buddy!

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.284
Where are you?

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.987
[laughs maniacally] Don't they know

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.291
they're on a fool's errand?

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.526
And then there's the matter of these traitors.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:13.666
You are going to help me destroy them all, Jake,

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.935
and then the Neathians will be helpless to stop me

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.504
from seizing the power of the sacred orb.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:23.809
Do you understand what I'm telling you, Jake?

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:28.280
Yes, Emperor Barodius.

Oh, no, Shun.

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.067
It just swallowed him up!

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.368
Hmm.

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:50.336
Huh?

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.237
Oh, no!

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:52.505
We're trapped!

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.441
Is this a bad time to tell you I'm claustrophobic?

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:56.809
We're not done yet.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.647
Whoa!

Why, yes, brawlers.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.995

We're too busy defending ourselves.

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.971
[suspenseful music]

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:49.414
Ah.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.522
We meet again, Kuso.

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:58.523
Barodius!

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.734
DAN (VOICEOVER): After getting crazy lost

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.302
in the depths of Gundalia Castle,

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.771
I somehow wound up face-to-face with that creep Barodius.

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.140
Naturally, the first thing on our minds was battling,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.808
so we got right to it.

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:19.311
His Bakugan Dharak is a pretty mean customer,

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.179
but I don't think he was prepared for the power

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:23.348
that Pyrus Blitz Dragonoid was packing.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.150
Talk about clash with a heavyweight.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.919
This battle action was nothing short of titanic.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.121
Don't take my word for it.

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.790
Tune in yourself to see some mega action go down.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.526
That Barodius has one wicked temper.

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.828
You might even call it explosive.

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:40.265
