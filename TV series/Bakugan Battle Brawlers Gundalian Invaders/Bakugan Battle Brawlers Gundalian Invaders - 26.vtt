WEBVTT

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.743
DAN: After the Gundaliens hijacked Bakugan interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.383
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.884
so we can help with the fight.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Erroneous from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.431
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.568
Bakugan fall.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.571
(SINGING) What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.283
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.118
The power's your hand.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.788
Worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.329
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.365
This is Bakugan.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.701
[music playing]

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.806
That is the forbidden power.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.541
DAN: Is that's what I think it is?

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.044
MARUCHO: Yes, the orb's last defense, Dragonoid Colossus.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.481
[music playing]

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.095
How weird.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.097
I was kind of getting used to your other look.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:46.973
[laughing]

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:51.911
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Forgiveness.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.813
MARUCHO: That's some pretty heavy destruction,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.349
but at least it made the Gundaliens retreat.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.917
For now, maybe.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.321
But you can bet it won't be long before they all come back.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.491
Then we better hustle and kick start the second shield again.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.426
Shouldn't be a problem now that Drago's

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.061
all supercharged, right?

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.363
I'm afraid I have bad news, everyone.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.333
That last explosion back there completely destroyed

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.602
the second shield generator base.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.403
We only have the third shield left.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:18.404
Sorry.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.742
It is what it is, guys.

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.712
We need to focus on keeping the third shield secure.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.247
Dan's right.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.048
Let's head back to the Royal Palace

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.618
and run a full diagnostic report.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.820
DAN: You think you can give us a hand with that, Ren?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.021
Really?

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.356
You sure?

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.757
You're with us.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.193
Everything else is water under the bridge, dude.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:43.062
While, you guys are doing that, Linehalt can recuperate.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.665
After expending such a massive amount of energy,

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.033
he should take it easy.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:47.967
It's OK.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:48.902
I'll be fine.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.802
OK then.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.837
Let's do it.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:52.372
Are you ready, Fabia?

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.374
I guess so.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:57.877
OK, Elright, prepare to transport us immediately.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.846
Princess, are you sure?

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.682
Just do it right now.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:03.683
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:09.522
This way.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.058
Ren, I'll show you the-- huh?

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.326
Hey, where did he go?

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.695
But-- he's gone.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.730
But he was right here.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.499
Linehalt's gone, too.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.670
But that means that they weren't transported with us.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.104
You left them behind on purpose.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.873
What gives, dude?

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.207
I'm sorry.

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.208
We couldn't.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.910
It was impossible.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.713
There was absolutely nothing we could do to change it.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:34.881
Why not?

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.816
Yeah, why not, huh?

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.318
Answer me right now.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.452
Very well then.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.422
It's because they're Gundaliens.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.491
DAN: The shield has a biofilter, doesn't it?

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:46.826
FABIA: That's right.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.695
Since it's the final line of defense protecting the Royal

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.430
Palace and the rest of the city, it's

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.332
been equipped to scan the DNA of anyone

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.600
who transports through it.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.368
When the war broke out, you programmed

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:58.605
it to block the passage of anyone with Gundalien DNA.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.241
MARUCHO: Why didn't you tell us that in the first place?

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.275
We couldn't, Marucho.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.710
We didn't want to reveal our security

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.311
measures in front of the enemy.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.281
We do not need him reporting back to his superiors.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.950
But Ren's on our side now.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.585
Why don't we just deactivate the shield

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.687
so we can let them in, then fire it

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.723
up again after they're inside?

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:17.890
No way, Dan.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.158
But why not?

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:22.862
Because I still don't trust Ren as far as

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.664
I could throw him.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.565
Wait up.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.300
Come back here.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.536
CAPTAIN ELRIGHT: Brawlers, report to my quarters

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:31.537
immediately.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.410
They left us behind.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.311
Yes.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:50.256
It's OK, Linehalt.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.324
[sighs]

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.334
Princess, do you think you were a bit harsh with them

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:02.735
back there?

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:07.540
Aranaut, he wanted us to allow Gundaliens behind the shield.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.643
Ren and Linehalt turned their backs on Barodius.

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:14.881
Perhaps we can trust them, like Dan said.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.416
I'm sorry.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.518
I just can't.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.520
I understand.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.622
CAPTAIN ELRIGHT: Dan, it may seem irrational that Fabia

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.123
refuses to forgive, Ren.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:27.460
But remember, the Gundaliens declared war on us.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.597
And this war has cost Fabia more dearly than you know.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.133
[shooting]

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.874
Aranaut used to be partnered with Jin,

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:43.676
the previous commander of the Castle Knights.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:44.677
Attack!

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:52.018
Battle gear ability activate.

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:55.988
Various gear lightning.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.091
[screaming]

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.529
[grunting]

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:09.769
It seems commander Jin left me with a parting gift.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.643
[music playing]

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.732
Curse you.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.135
You will pay for what you did to Jin.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.903
And I'll rip you to shreds.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.282
I can't wait to see what the inside of a Castle

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:59.886
Knight's Bakugan looks like.

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.355
Ah!

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.923
[yelling]

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.830
FABIA: Hiyah!

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.170
Well, well, you really are a glutton for punishment,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.171
aren't you?

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.075
[laughing]

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.719
What's happening?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.987
Who's there?

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.202
I see you.

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.408
[laughing]

00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:00.746
Well, If it is the mousy little princess from Neathia.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.382
It takes a lot of nerve to come here alone.

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:07.220
Too bad you won't live long enough to tell anyone about it.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.925
I may have come here alone, but we are leaving together.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:16.128
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.697
Bakugan, stand.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.232
Let's go, Aranaut.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.738
CAPTAIN ELRIGHT: Without a moment's hesitation,

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.274
Fabia stormed Gundalia by herself

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.643
and successfully rescued Aranaut.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:33.479
DAN: Why the heck would she do something so crazy dangerous?

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:37.016
She obviously felt a strong connection to Aranaut, but why?

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:40.186
Fabia risked her life to rescue Aranaut not

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.421
because of her connection to him,

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.590
but rather her connection to Jin.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.559
You see, he was her fiancee.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.294
They were going to get married?

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.296
That's what fiancees do.

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:51.998
Wait a minute.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.700
You never did tell us what happened to Jin.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.836
Was he--

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:00.673
Sadly, Jin was lost in battle.

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:03.943
So Aranaut is Fabia's last link to him.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:07.847
That is, like, the saddest thing I've ever heard.

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.549
Aranaut never told us.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:11.350
He doesn't remember.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.487
The experiments wiped out large parts of his memory.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:18.624
So as far as he knows, he has always been Fabia's partner.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.360
It's probably better for him that he doesn't remember.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.330
No one needs those kind of bad memories.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.666
So now you know why Fabia doesn't have

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.534
it in her heart to forgive Ren.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.140
FABIA: The Gundaliens need to pay for what they've done,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.141
Aranaut.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.513
REN: This time, we're on our own, Linehalt.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:43.516
[music playing]

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.218
MARUCHO: Ren!

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.720
Where is he?

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.355
How far could he get?

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:59.131
Ren, Linehalt. Ah!

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.199
Oh, snap.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.200
That thing is ugly.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.575
Who is it?

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.344
DAN: It's me, Dan.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.345
[gasp]

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.017
Hey.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.285
I have to ask you something.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.619
What's up?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.357
I was wondering if you--

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.325
Relax, Dan, and just ask me.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:29.261
Well, I just wondered if you trusted me.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.429
Of course I do.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.898
I trust all of the Brawlers completely.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:33.799
Really?

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:34.700
Cool.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.801
[laughing]

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.670
Maybe you should get to that point, Dan.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.038
Fabia's tired.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.272
Oh, yeah, right.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:43.275
Well, I know the Gundaliens are total slime for all

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:45.444
the bad stuff they've dine, but you got to believe me when

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:47.313
I tell you Ren is different.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.482
Seriously, Fabia.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:52.385
He is.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.787
I know that you honestly believe that, Dan,

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:56.889
but I'm just not convinced.

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.724
At least not as of yet.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.393
Not yet?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.495
But you could be open to the idea.

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:06.399
Tell us, what would it take to convince you it was true?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.234
Let us prove it to you.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.472
MARUCHO: I thought you might be hungry,

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.107
so I packed a bunch of food.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.110
There's a little bit of everything in here.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.047
Marucho, why are you so kind to me

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:24.417
after I betrayed you the way I did?

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.719
It's like Dan told you earlier, let's leave

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.821
all the bad stuff in the past.

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.322
What's important is that you've come

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.857
back to our side of the battle.

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:34.093
Marucho.

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.428
MARUCHO: Drink this.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.265
I am unworthy of your forgiveness.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.934
Wow, Ren, quit being so hard on yourself.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.981
Let's have a toast to new beginnings, OK?

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:58.918
[music playing]

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.386
FABIA: Not so fast.

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.254
It's not that easy.

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:04.323
MARUCHO: Fabia?

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:06.959
All right, here's the deal, Ren.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.661
If you're sincere and forgiveness

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:11.030
is what you really want, then you've got to earn it,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.032
you understand me?

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:16.569
You have to battle me for your redemption.

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:18.704
I see.

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.573
If that's what it takes, then fine.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.613
FABIA: If you win, I'll accept you

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:29.181
back as a member of the team.

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:35.121
But if you lose, you leave Neathia and never return.

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:38.090
Card set.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.559
Bakugan brawl.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:41.727
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:43.762
In the name of the Castle Knights

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:47.199
and all the people of Neathia, we will triumph and banish you

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.100
for good.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.503
Bakugan brawl.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.705
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:58.611
I will lead us to victory, Linehalt.

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:01.781
Dan and the others think you're still worth saving.

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:04.450
Well, were they right then?

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.720
Because right now, my heart tells me otherwise.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.124
Fabia, I completely understand your hatred toward me.

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:15.060
I didn't think I was worthy of forgiveness myself,

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:21.033
but then Dan showed me everyone deserves a second chance.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.868
Ability activate.

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.737

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:31.644
Come on.

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:32.645
Open wide.

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:42.121
Give up yet?

00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.323
Not even close.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:45.324
You call that a kick?

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.062
Help me, Ren.

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.697
I want to understand what Dan and the others

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:54.900
see in you that makes your betrayal worth forgiving.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.303
So make me a believer then.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.939
Let's takes this to the next level.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.807

He deactivated my ability.

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:23.929
We fought our way out of the darkness, Ren.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.198
Let's show Fabia that we're worthy of living

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.199
amongst her people.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.869

Dark javelin.

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.692
Linehalt's kicking the tar out of Aranaut.

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.861
So why is he wheezing like my grandpa?

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.130
He still hasn't recovered from his last battle.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.565
You're right.

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.901
Don't forget the energy he exerted almost

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.570
toward the planet in half.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.071
That's got to take it out of you.

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:09.408
Gate card open.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:10.576

What the falafel, dude?

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.082
His trident disappeared.

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:19.652
Yes, that's because she deactivated his ability.

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:25.591
What are you doing, Ren?

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:27.226
Why are you slowing down?

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:32.264
Ready remix.

LINEHALT: I'm sorry, Ren.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.818
It's OK, Linehalt. I know you did your best.

00:16:28.787 --> 00:16:33.158
Rubanoid, can I count on you to step in?

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:37.496
Sid entrusted me to you, so it would be my honor.

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:40.032
The honor is mine.

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.867

Bakugan stand.

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.807
Go, pyrus Rubanoid.

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.943
He's a pyrus.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:55.047
Why is a darkus battler like Ren fighting with a pyrus Bakugan?

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:59.017
Hey, didn't he belong to that mean looking dude, Sid?

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:00.152
Right, yeah.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:02.588
I wonder how Ren got a hold of him.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.822
Let's go.

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:06.158

You'll have to do better than that.

Don't stop.

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:06.385
I won't let your sacrifice be in vain, Sid.

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:10.289
Understand that I have no loyalty to Barodius.

Aw, man.

Hey, watch out!

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:47.426

Oh, no,

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:09.515
ARANAUT: I think we showed them, princess.

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:11.583
I can't believe it.

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:14.219
After all that, I still failed.

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:23.328
What, Fabia?

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:25.497
Have you come to gloat now?

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.233
Don't worry, we'll be on our way.

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.468
It's OK.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:32.704
I finally saw another side of you at the end there.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:36.475
I believe you now when you say that you are with us.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.210
So then--

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.444
Welcome to Neathia.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.317
Thank you, Fabia.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.291
All right, now we're an even stronger team than ever.

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:56.094
Captain Elright, bring us all home now, please.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:59.598
Yes, copy that.

We're ready now.

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:27.059
Ren Krawler, by joining us, you are agreeing to fight

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.094
against your former homeland.

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.430
Are you prepared to do so?

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.067
Barodius never showed me loyalty like you have.

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:38.370
I am fully committed to destroying him.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.138
Very well then.

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:42.841
You are now officially a Castle Knight.

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:45.644
It's my great honor.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.145
Way to go, buddy.

00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:48.714
Congratulations.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.382
That's what I'm talking about.

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:52.351
We're fighting with even numbers now, dude.

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.820
Congratulations, Ren Krawler.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.355
Thank you, Fabia.

00:20:56.455 --> 00:21:00.926
Awesome, now we've got a darkus battler on our team.

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:03.762
Yeah, totally awesome.

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.301
Now that we've got rent on team brawler,

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.902
we're fighting with all six elements.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.371
There's no way those Gundo weasels

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.006
will be able to take us down.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.340
This is going to be sick.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.776
But wait, who's this little dude, and why is he crying?

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:19.511
Dan the man and I will help you out.

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.246
There's nothing I hate more than bullies.

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.148
And I thought Dan felt the same way,

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:24.650
so why is he holding me back?

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.851
Doesn't matter.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.020
No one pushes little kids around while I'm here.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.621
Why don't you tune in and watch?

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.290
Get ready [inaudible].

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.226
We're about to teach some tough lessons to a mean bunch

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.160
if dudes.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.162
Yeah, baby.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:40.599
