WEBVTT

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.374
DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.842
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.221
environment.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.490
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.559
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.865
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.400
OK, buddy. Let's do this.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.300
All right.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.468
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.872
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.275
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.277
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.045
Got to give it your all.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.681
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, This is the final stand.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.216
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.551
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:55.054
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.627
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.530
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.531
This is Bakugan.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:08.735
OK.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:09.736
This should do it.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.175
What the--

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.076
Whoa.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.677
[screams]

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.580
[whimpers]

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.754
What the--

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:28.888
Uh.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.257
We just got forced out of Bakugan Interspace.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.326
But how?

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.395
What is going on, dude?

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.663
I have no idea.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.831
REN (ON COMM): Then let me explain.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.265
[gasps]

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.935
As of this moment, Bakugan Interspace

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.771
is now under my sole control.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.607
[music playing]

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.443
DAN (VOICEOVER): Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Twin Attack.\"

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.747
Say what?

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.850
Are you serious, Marucho?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.084
Yes.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.119
It looks like the Battle Brawlers were the only ones

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.021
that Ren and the Gundalians forced

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.390
out of Bakugan Interspace.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.494
The rest of the kids in there have no idea that it's been

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.596
taken over by hostile forces.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.130
Whoa, Shun.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.465
Oh.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.234
Kids are still diving in like normal because they don't

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.436
know that anything is wrong.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.037
Fabia is with you too?

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:21.174
Why did you guys all get ejected to the same place?

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.308
Huh?

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.443
What's that sound?

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.845
[whirring]

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:26.813
Huh?

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.916
What the-- what's going on?

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:34.320
[gasps] Oh my!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.989
Hey, what's all the commotion?

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.257
Whoa.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:41.127
We thought it would be easier for us to come to you.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:45.732
So this is where Dan lives now, huh?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.200
I dig it.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.602
Must be sweet living so close to the ocean.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.939
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friends, guys?

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.007
Of course.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.142
Everyone, this is Dan's mother, Miyoko.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.277
Greetings.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.045
I'm Ventus Hawktor.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.313
Nice to meet you.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.748
Hey there, Mama Kuso.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.682
What's happening?

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.450
My name's Akwimos.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.719
I'm Haos Aranaut.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.656
It's a pleasure to meet you, my lady.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.558
Well, aren't you the perfect gentleman?

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:12.792
[giggles]

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.327
Why, hello there, ma'am.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:18.498
My name is Fabia Sheen, and I'm visiting from Neathia.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.600
Oh, Neathia.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.935
Uh, right.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.971
I think that's where my cousin went on her honeymoon.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.906
I don't mean to be rude, but we're

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.474
kinda on a tight schedule.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.209
I hope you understand.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.711
Ready to go?

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.281
[propellers whirring]

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.256
REN: Welcome to Bakugan Interspace,

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:47.327
the world's first and only 100% virtual amusement

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.362
park created just for you.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:52.131
Experience thrilling battle with other--

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.032
Ugh.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.935
Lying traitor.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.770
[beeping]

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.038
COMPUTER: Access denied.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.175
This user ID is no longer valid.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.210
[groans] No go.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.712
Dan the Man.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.814
It's blocked over there too.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.350
Dan, we have to do something and quickly.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.684
Otherwise, all these kids are going

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.621
to wind up becoming soldiers for the Gundalian Forces.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:15.722
I know.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:16.623
Hang on.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:17.824
Dan!

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:18.791
Hey, you guys.

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.026
[gasping]

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.728
Listen up, everyone.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:22.895
Hey, isn't that Dan?

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.130
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.098
From the Brawlers.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.133
Bakugan Interspace has been taken

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.402
over by some very bad dudes.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.571
Anyone who enters it is in serious danger,

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.640
so I want you to all head home instead.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.540
OK?

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.275
Is he serious?

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.176
Uh.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.112
I'm pretty sure that he is.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:39.979
SEIN: [grunts]

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.714
Huh?

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.982
Forget that dude.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.183
Yeah, forget that.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.451
Look at that, buddy.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.520
Tell me exactly where you see the danger.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.588
LEWIN: Yeah.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.657
Looks like everyone's having fun to me.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.292
[grumbles]

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.660
They're right.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.894
They all look fine in there. - Yeah.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:55.795
Yeah.

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:56.729
I agree.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.431
I'm going in anyway.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.899
[gasps]

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.100
Hey, Dan.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.269
We can't be sure that's a live feed we're seeing.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.570
Huh.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.206
Guys, I'm telling you, it's all a trick.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:08.174
Ha.

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.709
What are you really afraid of Dan?

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.944
Is the presence of being number one getting to you?

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.113
Worried one of us might beat you, big man?

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.014
Yeah.

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.249
I bet that's it.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.551
[groans]

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.154
Who knew the great Dan Kuso was a chicken?

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.755
Hey, wait a sec.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:23.656
Don't do it.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:24.791
[shouts]

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.161
Come back.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.429
[banging]

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.596
Let's go.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.631
[clamoring]

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:32.532
Huh?

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.034
What the-- are you guys nuts?

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.335
It's a trap.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.072
Dan the Man, leave this to me, buddy.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.707
[shouting]

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.443
[grunting]

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.112
[clamoring]

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.313
There.

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.782
Now, you can go ahead shut it down, little Maruch.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:50.850
Uh.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.719
That's easier said than done.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.288
Ren has seized complete control of the system.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.989
REN: Welcome back, you guys.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.725
So it's absolutely impossible for me

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.493
to shut it down from here.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:03.496
Well, I may not know as much about computers as you do,

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.964
but let's try. - Yeah.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:05.965
Uh, Jake.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.335
Applying some pressure like this!

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.871
REN: --with other kids from around the globe.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.372
We hope you enjoy your stay.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.907
[voice distorts]

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.049
Not too shabby, huh, guys?

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.984
[laughs]

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.956
Hey, Marucho, how come you never told us about this room

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.090
before?

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.893
It looks like a remote command center.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.361
MARUCHO: That's exactly what it is.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.431
We built one of those above every access point

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:42.401
but haven't found the need to use them, until now that is.

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:43.536
Awesome, dude.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.339
So this could be like our own private oasis.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.875
I think a base of operations would be more practical.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:52.612
Your actions back there were a bit overly extreme, Jake.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:53.579
Maybe.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.081
But at least now there's no more kids

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.983
going into Bakugan Interspace.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.117
That's true.

00:06:58.217 --> 00:06:59.886
But it also means the ones who are currently

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.320
in there can't come out either.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.122
Wha--

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.891
That's not entirely true.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.426
We know for sure that Ren had figured out a way

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:09.028
to get the kids out using something

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.130
other than the access points.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.200
Thanks to Jake, at least, we've minimized the number of kids

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.169
he can take back to Gundalia.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.771
Then, our focus needs to be on getting all the kids

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:21.574
currently in Interspace out.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:24.677
Aranaut, don't you know of a way to body shift yourselves

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:27.113
directly into Interspace?

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.080
Yes.

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.182
Indeed, we do.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.149
Perfect.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.951
So why are we still standing around?

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:34.587
Let's jump right in and take these turkeys by surprise.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:35.955
Dan, wait.

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:37.757
I know you're anxious to get in there,

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.992
but we really need to think this through first.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:40.893
Shun's right.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.628
We need to be cautious.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:45.731
What if one of us snuck in to do some surveillance first,

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.500
then reported back to us?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.401
Great.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.902
Leave it to me, guys.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.704
Let's go, Drago.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.105
Hold up a second, Dan.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.006
Huh?

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.542
Aw, what is it now, Drago?

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.444
I don't have the ability to body

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:01.247
shift myself into Interspace like the others do.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.315
Huh?

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.717
Dan the Man, just let me go and do it.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:05.952
OK?

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.854
It's my fault we can't bring those kids

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.389
back the much easier way.

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.659
Coredem, you can jump right in, right?

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.862
Yes, absolutely.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:16.762
Cool.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:19.398
Let's all go together then.

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.568
Hold on to me tight, Jake.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.737
Dan, you hold on to Drago now.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.240
And then grab Jake's hand.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.407
JAKE: I got you, bro.

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:29.976
And I got you, pal.

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.445
COREDEM: Whatever you do, don't let go.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.219
They just disappeared.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.289
I guess it worked, and they're on their way.

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.791
Yes.

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.360
JAKE: It's rescue time, Coredem.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.361
Yeah!

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.164
DAN: Hang on, everyone.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.466
We're coming to get you.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.410
JAKE: Looks like we totally made it.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.311
Sweet.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:06.979
It worked, dude.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:07.980
Hm?

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:16.889
What the heck happened here?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.861
Hm.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.130
Looks like our guests have finally arrived.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:30.436
Dan and Jake.

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.071
How ironic this is.

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:34.307
They get caught on the same security cameras

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.608
they installed to catch us.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:36.509
I love it.

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:37.777
[laughs]

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.178
DAN: Huh.

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:42.248
I don't see Ren or any of the other Gundalians.

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.884
Yes, it's just kids.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.786
It's very strange.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.589
Something doesn't feel right.

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.023
Maybe it's a trap.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.592
GIRL: Excuse me.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.860
Did you guys want to battle us?

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.028
Yeah, sure.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:58.064
[gasps] OK.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.665
Well, come with us then.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.467
We'll take you somewhere really cool.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:02.468
Hm.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.280
What was that?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.281
Whoa.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.716
Check it.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:21.420
It's happening again and again.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.023
Did you see the eyes on those kids asking to do battle?

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.558
Totally creepy.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:26.926
I saw that too.

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.461
DRAGO: It's just like the team you battled

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.962
who'd been brainwashed by Ren.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.831
They're hypnotizing kids to recruit

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:33.332
other battlers for them.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:37.603
We're going to put a stop to this right now.

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:40.439
Ren, come out and show your face.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.109
I know you can hear me, creep.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.611
Quit hiding and come out and fight me.

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.747
Aren't you going to answer?

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:48.748
Ren!

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.486
You lousy coward!

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:54.387
Huh?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.855
Ah.

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:56.789
You two.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.257
So we meet again.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:11:02.595
Maybe we should introduce ourselves this time, brother.

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.629
My name's Sein Pam.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:04.530
Yeah.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.431
Yeah.

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:06.832
And I'm his younger twin, Lewin.

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:08.968
You can save all the screaming and shouting.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.970
Master Ren won't be coming.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.772
Master Ren, huh?

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:13.973
Why not?

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:16.475
Because we'll be the ones battling you instead.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.077
Look at their eyes, Dan.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.412
It's obvious.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.148
Ren has gotten to them as well.

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:23.616
How could you give up a leading

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:25.851
role to those two understudies?

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.687
I don't get you sometimes, Ren.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.156
Don't you want to crack at the Brawlers

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.425
after all the smack they've been talking about you?

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.828
Once again, Sid, you are completely missing

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:38.097
the point of the exercise.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:41.200
We're here to find powerful battlers to turn into soldiers,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.636
not to battle Dan and the others.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:45.404
Then why don't we just grab the Brawlers

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.006
and brainwash them too?

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.175
So what do you say then, huh, smart guy?

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:52.411
How many times must I explain this to you, Sid?

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:54.013
A battler fighting under hypnosis

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:56.248
only performs at 75% capacity.

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:59.852
We needed 100%, which meant I had to recruit them

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:02.188
of their own free will, and it was all going fine

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:04.690
until Princess Fabia showed up.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.259
This will be a good opportunity to see the fighting

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.161
potential of the Pam twins.

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:11.630
And if they do manage to defeat the Brawlers,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.500
I'm sure the emperor will be happy with the new addition

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.401
to his army.

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:16.469
Hmph.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.636
You always have an answer for everything.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.771
Don't you, Ren?

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:21.340
[chuckles] Act one is about to begin.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.647
Dan the Man, these two should totally snap out

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.416
of it if we beat them, right?

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:32.585
Well, that's what happened last time.

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.420
COMPUTER: Taylor lifeforce, zero.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.321
Ow.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.189
[groans]

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:42.928
So fingers crossed, we can make it happen again.

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.697
ANNOUNCER: The Bakugan battle featuring

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:50.402
Dan and Jake versus Sein and Lewin will now begin.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.938
Bakugan field open.

00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:55.441
I'll go first, brother.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.811
Gate Card, set.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.147
Bakugan Brawl.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.015
Bakugan, stand.

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:06.719
Go Darkus Volt Elezoid.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.053
Holy snap, dude.

00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:09.989
That thing's a Bakugan.

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:13.359
Better be ready for him to be just as tough as he is ugly.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.393
I know.

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:15.394
I know.

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:17.229
Let's do this, Coredem.

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:20.065
Bakugan Brawl.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.234
Bakugan, stand.

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:26.572
Say hi to Subterra Coredem.

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.474
Let's take him, Elezoid.

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.509
Ability activate.

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:33.646
Sheraseinian Bind.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.214
[grunts]

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.485
Coredem.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:41.353
Knock it off.

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.355
Bakugan Brawl.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:45.424
Bakugan, stand.

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:47.626
Kick it, Pyrus Helix Dragonoid.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.666
[roars]

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.668
Not so fast.

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.169
Bakugan Brawl.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.805
Bakugan, stand.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.307
Go Ventus Longfly.

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.711
Ability, activate.

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:09.148
Sonic Missile.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:10.082
Ugh.

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:12.251
Ah!

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.385
Ha!

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.721
We're perfectly prepared for a Pyrus offensive.

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.890
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.458
Sit back and watch.

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:21.093
Gate Card, open.

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.863
Pyrus Spotting Out.

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:26.699
[groaning]

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.100
Oh no.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.535
He used the command card that drops

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.371
the power levels of Bakugan with the Pyrus attribute.

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.774
[grunts] My power!

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:36.809
DAN: Drago, get up.

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:37.910
OK.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.412
Now, Longfly, take out Drago, while we've

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:42.181
still got him paralyzed.

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.083
Come on, Drago.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.117
[grunts]

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:48.320
Ugh.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.389
I got this.

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:52.491

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.308
Eat this.

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.278
Battle Gear Ability, activate.

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.480

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.195
What the--

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.298
He got us.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.066
Thanks for the help, Coredem.

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.434
That was close.

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:38.137
No problem, brother.

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:41.140
Brother?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.541
Hey, Dan.

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:45.244
Let's finish this and wake those dudes up from their nightmare.

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.412
You bet.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:50.449
Gate Card, set.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.551
Bakugan Brawl.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.820
Bakugan, stand.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.256
Let's go, Subterra Coredem.

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:58.557
Let's do it, Drago.

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:00.125
Bakugan Brawl.

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:01.560
Bakugan, stand.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.430
[roaring]

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.531
Ha!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.866
Your Bakugan may call each other brother.

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.868
But we'll show you how a true brotherhood works.

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:11.370
Sit back and watch.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.106
Bakugan Brawl.

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:15.941
Bakugan stand.

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:19.044
Rise, Ventus Zip Zam.

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.879
[roars]

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.147
Curses.

[screeches]

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.819
Bakugan Brawl.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.588
Bakugan, stand.

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:31.023
Meet Darkus Ramdol.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.624
[growls]

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:35.594
[wheels screech]

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.231
What?

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.467
They pulled out another new Bakugan.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:43.802
You ain't seen nothing yet, buddy.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:46.038
Get ready to have your mind blown.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:48.073
BOTH: Ability, activate.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.508
Dual Battle.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.214
Ability, activate.

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.281
Chain Whip.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.621
[shouts]

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.760
Ability, activate.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.628
Extreme Illumination.

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:13.198
[groaning]

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.573
Jake, we got to stop this thing right now.

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:22.474
Yep.

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:25.110
Gate card, open.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.012
Subterra Battle Audience.

[wheel grinding]

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:31.884
Whoa.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.085
What's this?

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.287
This command card changes the battle environment

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.456
into whichever attribute I choose

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:40.893
and camouflages the Bakugan on my side to the same attribute.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:41.894
Ho ho.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.399
Hey, where'd they go?

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.635
Just watch out, Ramdol.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.003
It's too late.

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:55.207
We're already here!

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.775
[screeches]

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:03.482
Nice.

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.751
Coredem really knows how to throw down.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.652
Yes.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.220
Now, it's my turn.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.222
Ability, activate.

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:11.323

[whirring]

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.571
Whoa.

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:28.440
Talk about scorched earth.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.209
And I'm not done yet.

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.210
COMPUTER: Ready JetKor.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.647

DRAGO: Objective lock on.

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.106
Engage.

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:05.611
[explosion]

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:08.614
BOTH: [screaming]

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.821
Hmph.

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.556
ANNOUNCER: Battle over.

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.992
Winner, Dan and Jake.

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.126
Oh yeah.

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.427
Grrr.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.328
Hey.

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:25.197
You guys OK?

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:29.001
Man, my head feels totally weird and fuzzy.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:29.868
Mine too.

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.069
What happened?

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:34.106
I don't remember anything after we both jumped in.

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:37.276
Jake, we got them back.

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:40.379
Well, that was a disappointing climax.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.482
No curtain call tonight.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:47.286
REN: I guess I chose poorly.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:50.822
The twins were mightier with words than action.

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.325
I guess you're destined to face the Brawlers

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.227
in battle after all.

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:56.495
I look forward to that one.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.197
[laughs]

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:05.737
Dan and Jake sure have been gone a long time.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.340
I wonder if Ren and the others found them.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.274
Huh?

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:11.777
[digital fizzling]

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:13.111
Dan!

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:14.546
Jake!

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:15.747
So are those--

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:17.749
The boys who ignored your warnings about going

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.418
into Bakugan Interspace?

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:20.752
Yep.

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:23.155
They're brainwashed by Ren like the last guys we fought.

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:25.757
Luckily, we won, so we were able to snap them out of it.

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.593
Now, do you believe us?

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:30.429
That place is super dangerous, OK?

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:31.797
Says who, pal?

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.065
We don't remember a thing.

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.266
OK?

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.701
Are you kidding me?

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:38.270
You goofs still think we're lying to you?

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.705
Easy there, Jake.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:41.173
But Dan--

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:43.775
They've been through enough today already.

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:47.379
We'll make sure one day you'll be able to safely battle again

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:50.182
inside Interspace, but until then promise

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:51.483
me you won't dive in again.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.385
OK?

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.753
OK.

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:55.754
We won't.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.194
There were so many others like them inside.

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.295
We're going back.

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.334
REN (VOICEOVER): Perhaps, if the Battle Brawlers knew

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.637
about the darkness of where I came from, they

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:13.171
wouldn't be so quick to judge.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:16.541
Linehalt and I used to spend our days dreaming of escape.

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:19.711
And now, it finally looks like that might be a possibility.

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:22.481
I don't care who I have to go up against, friend or foe.

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.349
I won't let them stand in my way.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.051
Now, that Marucho has infiltrated

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:27.452
Bakugan Interspace again.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.955
Perhaps, it's time that I share the truth with him.

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:32.291
Why don't you tune in and see what I decide?

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.726
Bakugan Brawl.

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:36.895
Out of the Darkness.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:40.932
