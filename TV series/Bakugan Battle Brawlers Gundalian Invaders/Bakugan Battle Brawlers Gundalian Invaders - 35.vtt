DAN: After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan Interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.928
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.464
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.032
Now Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.134

The odds stacked against you.

Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.916
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.718
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.554
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You've got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.096
before it's gone, gone, gone.

Take care, OK, Marucho?

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.850
Don't you worry Fabia.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.352
I'll be there to meet all of you at the rendezvous point.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.587
I promise.

This place is starting to remind me of everyone

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.509
we've lost in battle.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.545
I know you feel guilty, but losing him really

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:57.417
wasn't your fault. Ah?

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.752
You're thinking about Nurzak, aren't you?

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:00.887
Oh, Yes.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:01.788
Right.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:02.789

FABIA (VOICEOVER): I guess Aranaut

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.630
doesn't remember his former master Jin after all.

Mistress Kazarina, wait.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.389
The energy level isn't 100%.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.659
Something must have been damaged by the explosion outside.

Kuso's luck seems endless.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.930

What's happening?

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:40.179
How did he break free of the hypnosis?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.080

Coredem too?

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.720
The bond between Bakugan and battler

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.489
transcends the hypnosis.

Keep your mouth shut!

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.225
Oh, that's right.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:03.296
Aranaut has no memory of his previous visit here does he?

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.332
Then allow me to refresh his memory.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.901
Don't listen to them Aranaut!

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.471
You weren't always Princess Fabia's Bakugan.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.406
At one time, you actually belonged to the commander

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.674
of the Castle Knights!

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.476
What was his name again?

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:17.643
Be quiet!

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:18.845
LUMAGROWL: Ah right!

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:19.746
Jin!

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.248
That was it!

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.383
Tell me Aranaut, how is it that you've forgotten

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:25.952
your original brawler's name?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.021
Is it the intense shame of failing to protect him?

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.557
As a knight, you should expect to suffer

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:34.160
the consequences of your disgraceful performance!

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.130
Do the honorable thing and sacrifice yourself to me now

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.030
Aranaut.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.434
The Warrior's Code demands it!

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.103
Are you finished yakking mutt?

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.071
What?

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.606
I haven't forgotten a thing.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.008
I remember Master Jin very well.

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:50.109
What?

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.279
I also remember being taken to the Bakugan

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.782
Biology Research Center and having horrible things

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:56.883
done to me there!

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.623
And of course, I'll never forget that it was

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.092
Fabia who came and rescued me.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:07.093
Aranaut.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.431
I'm sorry Princess Fabia that I have

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.902
been lying to you for so long.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:19.505
I am honored to be battling with you Aranaut.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:22.975
The honor is all mine Princess.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.777
ARANAUT (VOICEOVER): In the beginning, when you didn't

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:27.046
mention Jin's name, I thought it was because it

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:29.115
was too painful for you to say.

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:32.485
So I pretended to have no recollection of him.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.354
It wasn't until much later that I realized you

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.156
were doing it to protect me.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:41.861
But by then, it was too late for me to reveal the truth.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.463
It was clear that the loss of Master Jin

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.799
had caused tremendous pain.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.868
And I didn't want to add to it.

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:56.008
So I continued on with the lie, in hopes that I was

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.710
somehow sparing your feelings.

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:06.118
I realize now that it was the wrong thing to do.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.821
And I only hope that you can forgive me.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.890
Protecting my feelings is a burden

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.426
you shouldn't have had to bear.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.327
I'm sorry.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.762
I had no idea.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:17.830
You're right.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.066
I did fail to protect my master's life.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.269
But I'll make up for that right now by stomping your mongrel

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.171
hide into the ground!

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.607
What makes you think you can beat me this time?

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:29.976
Hah!

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.311
From this day forward Princess,

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:37.617
I promise I will never hide anything from you again.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:41.821
Together, you and I will avenge the loss of Master Jin!

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:48.494
That's right.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:54.901
I've had enough of this weepy nonsense from you two.

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:56.736
Destroy them Lumagrowl!

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.304

Let's go, Lumagrowl!

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.104
This one is for Jin Aranaut!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.376
This time Aranaut won't get away Lumagrowl!

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.882
Commander Elright.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.017
Yes your highness.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.920
Have we heard anything back from Fabia and the others

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.156
since they were deployed to Gundalia?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.490
Unfortunately not.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.825
I understand your concern.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.394
But if I may point out, the Gundalian attacks on Neathia

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.196
have ceased for the time being.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.365
I think we should take that as a good sign.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.200
It would suggest that Fabia and the Brawlers

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.603
are keeping the enemy busy.

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.038
The earthlings have an old saying

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.673
that goes something like this.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:10.443
No news is good news.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.144
I hope that you're right.

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:15.982
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:16.882
Hah!

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.018
This should be fun!

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.920
Barias Gear Lightning!

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.255
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.157
Battle Crusher Duke!

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.459
Come on Dan the man.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.960
You got to snap out of it.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.861
Please dude!

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.296
Wake up!

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:31.230
It's me Jake!

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.498
I'm back pal.

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:50.016
DAN: (WEAKLY) Jake.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:54.487
I kept calling for you but you wouldn't answer.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:58.290
Is your head in the clouds again?

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:02.561
I'm real sorry about that buddy, but I'm here now.

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.629
OK?

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:06.599
[grunting]

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:07.600
Lumagrowl!

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.601
That hurt.

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.603
Now I'm really mad!

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:11.537
Hey!

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:13.539
Shouldn't you be on a leash doggy?

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.107
How about a game of fetch?

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.442
Dan!

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:19.045
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.579
JAKE: Bakugan stand!

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.982
Go Subterra Coredem!

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.184
DAN: Bakugan stand!

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:29.088
Let's do this Pyrus Blitz Dragonoid!

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.123
[roaring]

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:32.158
You OK Drago?

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.927
Don't worry about me Dan.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.095
I'm 100%.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.463
DRAGONOID COLOSSUS: Sorry gents.

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:40.299
But it seems that Kazarina's hypnosis got the better of me

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.200
too.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.268
How embarrassing.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.271
[growling]

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.306
COREDEM: You wretched lot are going to suffer

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:48.741
for what you did to us!

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.376
Do you understand?

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.710
DRAGO: That's putting it lightly.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.611
Haha.

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.114
Payback's a bummer dude!

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.716
This little reunion will have to wait until later.

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:03.122
Now Lumagrowl!

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.023
Retreat!

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.491
We'll be back!

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.928
[howling]

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:17.737
Get back cowards!

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.306
We're gonna finish this now!

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.021
[growling]

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:36.922
Huh?

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:37.990
It's Dan!

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.991
Hey Jake!

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:39.959
Huh?

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:44.630
Faster Drago!

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.999
We can't let them get away!

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.502
I'm going to mess them up something fierce!

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.438
Looks like they're back to normal.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.673
And ready to settle the score too.

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:57.309
Where's Kazarina running to so fast?

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.778
If we don't need to run interference anymore,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.046
let's join the action.

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:10.156
After them Krakix!

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.958
[roaring]

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:22.067
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.936
Barias Gear Thunder Bolt!

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:27.506
Ah!

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:28.507
That's harsh!

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.249
[groaning]

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.990
Huh?

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.991
Where did they go?

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:46.892
Ugh.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.027
They got away!

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:49.061
SHUN: Dan!

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.830
MARUCHO: Jake!

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:52.898
Hey guys!

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.466
Miss us?

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.468
We didn't know you were gone.

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:58.504
He's just teasing.

00:13:58.604 --> 00:13:59.972
We were so worried.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.140
Sorry guys.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.808
Yeah, we're sorry too.

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:04.944
But thanks for saving us.

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.545
Fabia deserves the credit.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.013
No, it was a group effort.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:10.983
Besides, Jake was already helping Dan when I got there.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:14.320
It was Dan shouting that snapped me out of it.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.123
Whatever happened it's good to have both of you back.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.826
Are you sure you're fighting fit Coredem?

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:24.129
Don't worry about me Linehalt. I'm fine.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.432
Now that all six members of the Battle Brawlers

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:31.103
are back together, we should be unstoppable.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.371
STOICA: How touching!

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.540
I think I might cry.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.542
So what happens next, huh?

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.544
A group hug?

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:40.179
What are we waiting for?

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.615
Now that we've got them all together in one spot,

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:43.882
why don't we crush them?

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:46.051
[kazarina laughs]

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:50.289
I guess that we're not the only ones who have reunited.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:56.629
Well, we still outnumber them, six to four.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.264
Wait a second!

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.499
Where's Barodius?

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.501
Yes, that is strange.

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.638
I would have expected Dharak to be here trying to fight me.

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.974
[bakumeter chimes]

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.109
Huh?

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.511
DRAGONOID COLOSSUS: I am sensing a disturbance.

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:15.981
The Sacred Orb is agitated.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:18.951
There's trouble on Neathia!

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:21.720
You were so easy to fool!

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.822
[chuckling]

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:24.823
It's pathetic.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.141
[screaming]

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.548
NEATHIAN KNIGHT: Commander Elright,

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.183
the Darkus Gundalian attack ship is

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.985
hovering over the capital city!

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:53.986
What should we do?

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:54.887
Knights!

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.122
Man your battle stations!

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:58.891
Is Gundalia attacking again?

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:04.763
Well, I'm sorry we're not exactly sure Queen Serena.

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:06.832
If it is an invasion, why have they

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:09.768
only dispatched a single ship from the battalion?

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:12.504
And why is it Emperor Barodius himself

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.074
that has come all this way?

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:18.010
Regardless, we're still protected by the third shield.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.114
Anyone with Gundalian DNA won't be able to pass through.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.216
ELRIGHT (VOICEOVER): What is Barodius is up to?

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:25.517
And what happened to the Brawlers?

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.244
Are you ready to Dharak?

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:53.679
Leave it to me Emperor.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:00.252
Bakugan brawl!

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:01.820
Hah!

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.988
Bakugan stand!

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.793
Rise Phantom Dharak!

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.067
Hah!

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.903
He's about to bounce off that shield like a fly

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.438
off a windshield.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.611
What!

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.612
But How?

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:30.282
Commander Elright what is happening?

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:33.819
[roaring]

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.090
Dharak!

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.258
He's evolved somehow!

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:45.030
The DNA scan is negative!

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.131
What's that?

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:49.401
Dharak's DNA is not reading as Gundalian!

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:54.239
It seems he's also mutated!

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.874
Thunder Gladiator!

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:06.518
Oh no!

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:09.221
The third shield is-is disintegrating!

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:11.490
I have been reborn!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.426
And all shall bow down to me!

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:16.228
Excellent work Dharak.

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:19.231
You crumpled that third shield like tissue paper!

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:23.669
It's time to show these insects your true powers!

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.638
Move all citizens into the shelters under the palace!

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:27.673
Yes!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.575
All Castle Knights you heard the Queen!

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:32.010
Take the civilians of Neathia to the bunkers.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.445
All forces attack!

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:36.348
[upbeat music]

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.444
Neathia is going to be reduced to rubble.

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:36.775
What the heck!

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:38.710
Dharak got through the third shield!

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.279
How is that possible?

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:42.014
His DNA should have kept him out.

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.682
Don't you remember Drago?

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:45.417
You're the one who gave him the key.

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.452
[snickering]

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.787
Aranaut!

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:52.124
Without the third shield our home will be laid to waste.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.826
Oh no!

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:55.761
DAN: Hey!

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.828
What's going on?

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:02.067
DRAGONOID COLOSSUS: Get ready everyone!

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:04.870
[gasps]

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.340
[roaring]

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:29.928
We must return to Neathia immediately!

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:31.530
Not so fast Brawlers!

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.832
Bakugan brawl!

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:35.167
Bakugan stand!

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:41.907
[chittering]

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:45.811
[screeching]

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:49.081
[roaring]

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.850
[growling]

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.751
Whoa!

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:56.021
[suspenseful music]

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:10.535
DAN: Those rotten Gundalians punked us again with a decoy

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:13.005
while Emperor Barodius snuck off to attack Neathia.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.107
Somehow they managed to destroyed the third shield.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.808
And now the citizens are helpless!

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.310
We've got to get off this stinking rock,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.711
so we can get back there and help!

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.813
But first, we're going to have to take out these weasels,

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.215
starting with Kazarina.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.850
Somehow she did something to Drago

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.685
that led to the destruction of the shield.

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:29.554
You should tune in to see if you discover her evil secret.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.790
That old witch is a tough nut to crack!

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.358
If we can't break her, maybe we'll have

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.860
to get someone to betray her!

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.094
Someone like Gill!

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:40.699
