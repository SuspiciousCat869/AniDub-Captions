00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.014
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.920
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.692
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.928
Lucky for us, we have Colossus Dragon on our side.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:32.165
Barodius and the 12 orders, you're destined for defeat.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.900
Now, Drago, Bakugan brawl!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.368
[THEME - DANIEL LEBLANC AND CREIGHTON DOANE,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.269
\"TWO WORLDS COLLIDE\"]

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.571
(SINGING) What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.041
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.778
Backed against the wall, gotta give it your all.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.146
Ah, ah. Ah, ah.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah, ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.248
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.416
Ah, ah. Ah, ah.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.316
Ah, ah.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.751
The power's in your hands.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.229
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.230
This is Bakugan.

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.538
Now that the Neathian's second shield is down,

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.540
victory is near.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.077
Do not let this slip from our grasp.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.312
We should take down the third shield now,

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.714
strike while the iron is hot.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.950
I completely agree, but unfortunately there

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.652
are a couple of Gundalian ships that are

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.387
taking their time charging up.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.223
I believe Pyrus was one of them, wasn't it Gill?

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.991
Just relax, OK?

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.561
As soon as it's charged, I'll go ahead and--

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.130
Master Gill has greater challenges to deal with.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.632
I will proceed with the attack and take

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:40.867
down the shield myself.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:51.544
Wow, Airzel, I've never seen you so aggressive before.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:55.281
I learned a few of their tricks after our last battle.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.351
They'll come in handy this time.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.520
Yes, real handy.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.555
Prepare to attack, Mason.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.959
You're getting a rare chance to redeem yourself after failing

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.427
so badly on Earth.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.428
Yes.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.499
We understand and we're ready to hit

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.300
them with everything we've got.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.768
They're going down.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.905
Well, then, Avior, let's get the orb.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.843
DAN (VOICEOVER): The Bakugan Battle

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.480
Brawlers in \"Decoy Unit.\"

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.249
DAN: The 12 Orders?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.051
Yes, they're the highest level of the Gundalian

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.988
ruling class, headed, of course, by Emperor Barodius.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.490
Let me introduce them to you.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.492
This Pyrus Battler Gill.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:40.994
He's a cold blooded warrior who's

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.630
displayed fearsome obedience to Emperor Barodius.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.299
His Bakugan is Pyrus Krakix.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.035
Aquos Battler Stoica, he's a mad man

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.504
whose personality flips from joker to ruthless

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:52.906
savage in the blink of an eye.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.008
You never want to turn your backs on this one.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.710
His Bakugan is Aquos Lythirus.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.281
Ventus Battler Airzel, captain of the Gundalian Forces,

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.716
he's a student and protege of Gill's.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.619
He's also the scum who captured and interrogated me.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.255
His Bakugan is Ventus Strikeflier.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.991
Subterra Battler Nurzak, he's a Gundalian

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.627
elder who served since the reign of the previous emperor.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.896
He's also the wisest person in Gundalia.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:20.166
His Bakugan is some Subterra Sabator.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.703
Haos Battler Kazarina, she's in charge of the Bakugan

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.238
Biological Research Center.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.807
Rumors persist that she's conducting cruel experiments

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.108
on living Bakugan.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.278
Her own Bakugan is Haos Lumagrowl.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:35.882
Finally, Darkus Battler and Gundalian Emperor Barodius.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.650
He may say very little, but trust me,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.119
he's insanely smart and equally devious.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.854
Barodius is pure evil.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:44.390
His Bakugan is Darkus Dharak.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.492
Hey, those are the dudes we just fought.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.294
The ones that disappeared.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:53.299
Those six battlers and their Bakugan comprise the 12 Orders.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.736
They're leading the attack on Neathia.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.605
Their forces have already breached

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.306
the second defense shield.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.542
That means that the only remaining line of defense

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.943
is the third security shield.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.578
If that falls, then we're finished.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.388
Don't worry, Queen Serena.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:17.390
We're not gonna let that happen.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.526
We gotta get the second shield back up right now.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.528
But how do we do that, guys?

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.664
Shouldn't we concentrate on the third shield?

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.603
If we can make it through to sector D

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.572
and can find a second shield generator,

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.906
maybe we can jump start it.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.377
But we'll need a powerful source of energy to do that.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:42.415
Something powerful like the element that's inside of me?

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.817
Yes, that would definitely do the trick.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.419
But unfortunately, to get there, we'd have

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.621
to pass through the front line.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.657
We'd be at a horrible disadvantage.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.058
I just don't know.

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.259
Come on, dude.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.794
I thought you were the head of the Neathian army.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.063
You've gotta have some kind of a plan in your back pocket,

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.231
right?

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.832
Otherwise, the Gundalians are gonna cream us.

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.868
Chill out, Jake.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.836
[alarm blaring]

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:04.904
Huh?

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.206
Captain Elright, sensors are picking up

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:11.911
the signals from three Gundalian ships on the move in sector D.

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.980
I told you guys they were coming.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.581
Sir, we have a visual.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:23.589
Those ships belong to Stoica, Kazarina, and Airzel.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.191
Let them come.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.527
Yeah, we're ready for 'em.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:31.664
We won't let them crack the third shield.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.599
Hey, I have an idea, guys.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.600
Huh?

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.135
While the lead ships advance, we

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.371
sneak around behind them, fire up the second shields,

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.872
and cut off their reinforcements.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:40.840
Huh?

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.275
What are you talking about, Maruch?

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.512
The main unit of the Castle Knights

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:49.549
will attack the three Gundalian ships, giving the appearance

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.551
that it's our main offensive, so all of their focus

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.719
will be on us.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.454
Meanwhile, a breakaway unit will get

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.155
to the second shield generator.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.524
Then we'll jump start it, guys.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:01.928
So then we're talking about using a decoy.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.229
Yep.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:04.497
Their dimensional sensors might

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.065
pick us up during the transport, so we

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.734
can't risk teleporting there.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.202
The safest way for us to get there

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:11.971
will be to walk through the jungle.

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.506
Guys, I should go.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.275
I know that jungle like the back of my hand.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.210
Awesome.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.545
Then you and Drago need to go too,

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.248
since we'll need the element to kick start the generator.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.216
Got it?

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.350
Yeah!

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.686
We're totally ready for a rumble in the jungle!

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:27.754
Bring it on!

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:28.888
Let's do it.

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.189
We'll go too.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.525
Yeah, you can use the backup.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.594
Sounds like a good plan.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.863
It's a brilliant plan, Marucho.

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:39.966
Already you have proven what a gift you are to Neathia.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.069
Aw, gee, it was nothing.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.840
OK, now that we know who's doing what, pitter-patter.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.841
Yeah.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.456
OK, then, Captain Marucho, I think it's

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.858
time we all follow your lead on this one, sir.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.393
Uh, what?

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.499
Come on, Little Maruch, you're a natural.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.368
We'll all be right behind you, dude.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.736
I guess.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.205
OK, Castle Knights, let's go!

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:20.840
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.041
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.343
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.078
Bakugan stand!

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.114
[screeching]

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.050
Bakugan stand!

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.859
Here come the Castle Knights.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.395
It looks like they still haven't learned their lesson, if that's

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.463
all they're coming at us with.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:45.731
Who cares?

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.533
We'll make short work of them, and then

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.602
annihilate the third shield.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.237
Get ready, Mason.

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:52.238
Yes.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.578
[whooshing]

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.183
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.118
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.020
Bakugan stand!

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.590
[screeching]

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:14.927
Oh, man.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:17.463
Hey, isn't that your buddy Airzel.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.799
Yes, and the one beside him is Mason Brown.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.700
Huh?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.668
Isn't he on Ren's team?

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:23.803
It's all the same.

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.171
Dude.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:28.875
He is all kinds of ugly underneath his disguise.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:32.478
OK, everyone, you all know what's at stake here,

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:36.282
so let's give it all we've got!

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.551
Hard core!

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.854
Oh, fail.

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.122
That's odd.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.458
Why haven't they sent Dan and Drago, their strongest

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:46.859
soldiers, to the front line.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.732
Shun is missing, too.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:53.833
Let's brawl.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.668
I know that you want payback from Airzel,

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.803
but you can't let with that cloud your judgment,

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.539
Captain Elright.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.540
It won't.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:08.247
DAN (VOICEOVER): Let's rock this second shield, Drago.

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:10.516
SHUN (VOICEOVER): Keep your eyes peeled for convenient soldiers,

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:11.617
Hawktor.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:15.021
Gate card, set!

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.858
OK, Bakugan brawl!

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.793
Bakugan stand!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.762
Go, Aquos Akwimos!

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:26.032
Cool is the rule.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.601
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.070
Bakugan stand!

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.174
Rise, Subterra Avior.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:36.943
Now, Coredem!

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:39.011
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:42.348
Bakugan stand!

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.817
I hope you freaks are ready for a thrashing!

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:53.326
Ability activate, Long Aerchule.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.667
[roaring]

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.007
Marucho!

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:13.779
Let's see how you like this!

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:17.750
Ability activate, Loop Defense!

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.753
Catch the waves, suckas!

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:21.921
[beeping]

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:23.723
[whoosh]

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.192
[static crackling]

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.661
I'm gonna tear your little playhouse down.

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:29.562
Ah!

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.530
[whooshing]

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.598
[groans]

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.970
We need to win this for us and Master Gill.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.907
Relax, their puny bubble is going to burst any second now.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.278
Hold tight, little Maruch.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:50.449
Ability activate, Hammer Blow!

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:51.450
[groans]

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:53.986
[explosion]

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:54.987
Why, you!

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:00.960
Perhaps Mason was a poor choice of partners.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.928
He'll pull it out, otherwise he'll

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.064
face the same fate as Sid.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.833
And he's probably well aware of it, too.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:12.938
Now Avior, ability activate, Bolting Chain!

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.013
Ha!

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:24.850
Time to show Airzel I'm hardcore too.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.951
[yells]

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.590
Battle gear, boost!

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:47.540
Time for you two cupcakes to get iced, Gundalian style.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.278
Battle gear ability activate, Lashor Heavy Striker.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:53.813
[whooshing]

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.182
[explosions]

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:57.083
Ah!

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:59.585
[groans] Dude is chafing me.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:04.990
Gate card open, Power Ditch!

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.559
Surf's up!

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:14.800
And rip the curl.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.168
I'm the king of H20.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.870
Anyone who faces me is all wet.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.972
That's what I'm talking about, Akwimos.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.842
Jake, be careful, watch out for the blow back.

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.710
Huh?

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.011
Rip this!

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:27.513
[whooshing]

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:28.614
[screams]

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:30.583
[exertion sounds]

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.452
[screeching]

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:36.555
[water rushing]

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:40.993
[laughs]

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:43.996
What the?

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:46.432
Mason never saw that water attack coming.

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:48.300
You want to revise your opinion on him?

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.835
Let's pick this up a notch.

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.741
Ready, Gigarth.

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.209
[yells]

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.811
Battle gear boost!

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:11.590
Ah, yeah!

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.294
So then, we're using battle gear, are we?

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:18.164
Let's do it.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:20.132
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.034
Bakugan stand!

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:24.303
Rise, Ventus Strikeflier.

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:34.914
We've gotta keep this going for Dan.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:36.015
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.383
Let's hit them again.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.384
Yes.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.888
Ready, rock hammer.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.993
Battle gear boost!

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.235
[yells]

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:02.708
You guys are really starting to annoy me.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:05.411
OK, Mason, let's finish this for good.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:12.017
This time when I hit you, you better stay down.

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:15.254
Because it's really gonna hurt.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:19.992
Battle gear ability activate, Rock Hammer Beo-Blaster.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:28.500
I can't believe they got me with a direct hit.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.702
Avior!

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:33.172
Mason life force, 40%.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.140
Huh?

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:37.743
Let's try this again under water.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.813
Yo, dude, did you not hear what I said earlier?

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:44.149
No one beats me in the water, you got it?

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.386
It's time to put your money where your mouth is.

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:50.222
Be careful Akwimos, he's dangerous.

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.958
Aw, yeah, don't sweat it.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:56.462
Ability activate, Skill Capture.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.001
What was that?

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:05.537
That was me taking on Coredem's Hammer Blow ability.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:06.939
But how?

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:10.376
Strikeflier has the ability to absorb his opponents' abilities

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:11.610
and then mirror them.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.212
Too bad for you.

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:22.221
OK, big shot, let's see what you got.

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:23.656
Oh, I'll show you what I got.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.623
Step right up.

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:25.724
Come on! Let's go!

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:26.625
Let's go!

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:27.826
You want some of this?

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:31.363
Battle gear ability activate, Gigarth Hydrizer.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:32.698
Yeah, that's it.

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:35.067
This ability takes us to level two.

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.403
All right, get ready to brawl.

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:52.584
You're nothing more than a bunch of amateurs!

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.421
Ability activate, Burst Dive!

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.495
[sizzling]

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.531
[bubbling]

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:07.399
Yow!

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:08.467
Hey, that's hot! Hot!

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.468
Ow!

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.709
Akwimos!

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:20.145
You're about to get flushed like a toilet!

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:23.148
[exertion sounds]

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.253
Battle gear boost!

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.628
Ah!

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:37.629
Yeah!

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.601
Still nothing from the second shield team!

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:43.569
Keep going!

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:56.815
Battle gear ability activate, Battle Turbine Drain.

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:58.384
This is tedious.

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:00.018
Your defeat is imminent.

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:04.256
Give up and let us get on with taking down the third security

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.792
shield once and for all.

00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:08.794
[laser fire]

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.396
[whooshing]

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.365
[explosions]

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:19.204
Ah!

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.774
Jake and Marucho life force, 40%.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:26.245
I'm not going down like Sid did, got it?

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:28.781
I hear you, so let's finish this now

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.350
and take the emperor a victory.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.651
Gate card set.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.623
Bakugan brawl.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:38.924
Bakugan stand!

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.763
Let's send these losers packing!

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:48.167
Coredem, Bakugan brawl!

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:50.502
Bakugan, stand!

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:53.639
Oh, yeah!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.974
Come on, Dan, what's happening?

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:58.811
Bakugan brawl!

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.345
Bakugan stand!

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.286
Why haven't I seen Dan Kuso yet?

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.388
Something seems off here.

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:11.056
Bakugan brawl!

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.157
Bakugan stand!

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.766
Gate card open.

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:21.733
Enemy down.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:24.169
[screaming]

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:30.876
Akwimos, you've got to hang on just a little bit longer.

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:32.110
You too, Coredem!

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.651
Please tell me we're getting close.

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:42.988
Ability activate, Diamond Trick!

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:55.200
Ability activate, Heal Blue!

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.635
You can't hurt me.

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.036
Cool is the rule, babe!

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:07.012
Why won't they just go down?

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.180
Try this.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.851
Ability activate, Stun Out!

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:13.852
Ah!

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.993
Oh no, that's bad.

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:24.730
Ability activate, Sling Exia!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.797
[thud]

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.142
That kid is annoyingly good.

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:39.178
I'm getting really sick of this.

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:44.483
Ability activate, Long Aercules.

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:45.450
[laser fire]

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:47.819
Ah!

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.089
I don't know if we can keep this up much longer.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.525
I hope Dan is almost done.

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:56.161
Akwimos, this is the last one.

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:57.496
Sweet!

00:19:57.596 --> 00:20:01.300
Ability activate, Elemental Blue!

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.402
We're calling it a day, kids, and declaring

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:04.970
this battle a draw.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.206
AIRZEL: What?

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:08.941
What's happening?

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.343
Strikeflier, where are you!

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:17.916
Come on, Jake.

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:19.985
We should split while they're still distracted.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:20.986
You bet.

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.226
I'm frozen!

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.996
Can't move.

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:35.367
No one turns me into a Popsicle.

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:37.269
Avior!

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.171
Way to put 'em on ice, Maruch.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.239
You think Dan will be in the clear now?

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.475
I don't know, but I sure hope so.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.844
We gotta keep our fingers crossed.

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.913
Dan hasn't let us down yet.

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:52.751
Come on, you guys.

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:55.254
The generator is just up ahead.

00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:56.321
All right, great.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.400
FABIA (VOICEOVER): While Marucho and Jake were busy distracting

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.135
the Gundalians at the front line,

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.070
Dan, Shun, and I raced through the jungle

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.939
to get to the second shield generator.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.741
The plan was to kick start it and cut off

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.442
the Gundalian reinforcements.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.177
Unfortunately, before we got there,

00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:21.513
Stoica and Jesse got the drop on us.

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.582
So of course, we had no choice but to battle.

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:26.151
Luckily, I had the two strongest brawlers with me when

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.819
it came time to throw down.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:30.656
You should check it out yourself to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.724
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:35.560
We make a great team!

00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:38.497
