DAN KUSO: After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.416
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.884
so we could help with the fight.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.720
Once we got there, we were made Members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.329
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.564
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.066
Now Drago!

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.568
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all!

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.316
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.618
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside!

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.527
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.263
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.365
This is Bakugan!

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.334

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.407
SID ARKALE: Take care of him, will ya?

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.676
Don't worry about the rest of us, Ren.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.312
Just do what you have to do, OK?

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.547
[grunting]

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.783
REN KRAWLER: Sid!

[music playing]

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.527
I feel--

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.397
Tell me.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.567
I feel really confused now.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.570
But Barodius put you there in the first place.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.904
Join us, Ren.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:45.805
Please.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:49.175
[music playing]

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.012
I need answers.

Careful, Hawktor!

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.638
Don't worry, I see them.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.841
Hold on tight.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.444

This is gonna be a nasty one, buddy.

[music playing]

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.328
Aquos squadron, you take the left flank.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.165
Ventus squadron, maintain position.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:49.769
How much longer do we have to wait for Exokor to be ready?

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:53.806
Hey, mad scientist, how about a little help here, huh?

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:54.707
Don't call me that!

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.142
I'm doing important work here!

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.243
Stop interrupting me!

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.479
Ho ho, touchy.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.014
I'll be done soon.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.682
Prepare to be amazed!

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:06.219
[beastial screams of pain]

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.763
Are you ready, Dharak?

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.498
Just say the word!

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:22.068
[music playing]

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.539
[chair gliding backwards]

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.844
What can I do for you?

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:35.181
[music playing]

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.085
Forgive my intrusion, sire, but there's

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.354
something that I need to ask.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.958
Why were Sid, Jesse, Lena, and Zenet

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:49.629
punished for their failures, while I was spared, sire?

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.597
I don't get it.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.465
[growling]

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.834
I was the one in charge of them, yet none of the blame

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.035
fell on me.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.937
Instead, I received special treatment and access

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:58.838
to your private quarters.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.307
[music playing]

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.842
What is your point?

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.778
Well, your highness, each of my teammates

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.982
pledged their loyalty to you and Gundalia just as I did.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.117
So why am I the only one left standing?

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.553
[music playing]

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.722
I can only assume that it has something

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:19.058
to do with the forbidden power that Linehalt

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.195
is supposed to possess.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.964
I've been entrusted with guarding Linehalt since I was

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:27.300
a child, and still I don't know the first thing

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.002
about these powers.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.804
Even though I've spent this last little while above ground,

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:33.239
it still feels like I'm stumbling

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:34.707
around in the dark, Emperor.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.243
EMPEROR BARODIUS: Pay attention, Ren.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:40.446
Look at the desolate wasteland Gundalia has become.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.449
This place is just as hopeless and depressing as the

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.284
underworld in which you live.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.655
[music playing]

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.061
But you have the power to change that, Ren.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:58.731
Not only for yourself, but also for the rest of Gundalia.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.001
Don't cloud your mind with silly questions.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.469
But sire--

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.937
I mean it, Ren.

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.472
No more questions.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.775
It is crucial to the success of your mission

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.144
that you listen to and obey my orders.

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.013
[music playing]

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:18.351
Do this, and I promise you your life will be better

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.454
than you ever dreamed, Ren.

DHARAK: I can't wait to try it out.

Emperor Barodius, you'll be pleased to know I've

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.784
completed Exokor's upgrades.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.321
Well done, Kazarina.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.891
Time to go, Ren.

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.926

Something bad!

Emperor Barodius will be here soon.

Looks like we got a battle royal sitch.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:37.990
Stay sharp, everyone.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.891
Huh?

I don't know what else I can say to you, Ren!

You want to hang with creeps, I guess that's your choice, so

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.358
no more talking!

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.360

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:21.334
Why don't you sit this one out and watch?

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.970
Perhaps you might learn something.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.204
Right, Dharak?

No sweat.

We can do this.

Are you ready, guys?

Ready.

I totally got this.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.999
I will destroy you.

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.801
That's what I want to hear.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.902

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.123
Drago, wake up.

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.024
Huh?

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:22.561
[music playing]

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:25.464
They broke through it!

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.332
[evil laughing]

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:28.734
When will you learn?

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.769
My power is absolute.

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:33.171
Resistance is futile.

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:36.475
Ren, you've pledged your loyalty to me.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.610
Now put your words into action.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.148
Crush these insects, and I will reveal the secrets

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.083
of Linehalt's forbidden power.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.086
[grunting]

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:49.721
Drago.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.623
You've got to wake up, pal.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.559
Are you sure, Ren?

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:56.028
I don't have a choice, Linehalt.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:56.929
LINEHALT: OK then.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.031
[music playing]

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.300
Please, buddy, say something.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.367
Huh?

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.268
Ren.

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:06.772
[wind blowing]

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.643
[music playing]

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.380
Ah!

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.281
Hm.

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.316
This should be entertaining.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.352
[music playing]

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.054
Ah, Ren.

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:25.524
[music playing]

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.992
Why?

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:30.228
Just get it over with.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:33.832
I have finally chosen a side!

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:40.138
[explosion]

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.177
What are you doing Ren?

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.078
Ah!

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.847
[music playing]

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.683
What I should have done from the start.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:54.686
I am fighting alongside my true friends.

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:57.189
[music playing]

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:00.392
Well, this is an interesting development.

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.328
It appears Ren will be punished after all.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:04.830
[music playing]

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.967
REN KRAWLER: Ever since I was a child,

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.870
my people were forced to live underground in the darkness.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.639
Then one day, I was offered a chance

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:16.041
by the Emperor to finally know what life in the sunlight

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:17.275
was like.

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:19.578
I thought he was being kind to me, but I was wrong.

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:22.014
He was only doing it for his own selfish motives.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.549
Then Dan reminded me it was the Emperor who banished

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.051
my people in the first place.

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:28.487
How could I be so foolish to fall for his lies?

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:29.855
We're fighting back now.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:33.025
Tune in to see Linehalt and I turn the tables on Barodius.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.960
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.229
Time for payback, Linehalt!

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:40.699
