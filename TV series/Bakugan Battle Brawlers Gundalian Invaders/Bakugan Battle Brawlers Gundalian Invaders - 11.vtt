a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.545
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.948
finally went online globally.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.783
Allowing kids from all over the world to show their

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:20.653
battling skills in a safe and friendly environment.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.022

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.059
virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.727
DAN: A mysterious evil force from another world has

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:31.431
infiltrated Bakugan Interspace and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.267

\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:47.914
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.783
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.151
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Two worlds collide

\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.093
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.896
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.000
Hypnotizing them into battling with us has proven useful.

AIRZEL: This is no game fools.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.763

Princess Fabia , immediately!

LINUS: The Princess, sir?

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.532
ELRIGHT: Perhaps the Battlers that she was seeking can help us

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.000
can help in this fight.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.201

DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: The Secret Package.

COMPUTER VOICE: These five individuals are considered

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.716
extremely dangerous.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.051
If you see them do not approach.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.453
Report your sighting immediately to the system administrator.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.554

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.062
the kids afraid of us.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.129
JAKE: Yeah.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.099
Convincing them to leave will be pretty hard now.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.567
COREDEM: Maybe they've figured out that we've hacked their

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.469
security system.

Slow down, dude.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.641
No point in running until we know we're being chased.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:02.875
MARUCHO: Yes.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.377
I have to agree with Akwimos.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.746
If they knew that we had compromised their security

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.449
system we'd be surrounded by now.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.084
COREDEM: I suppose you're right.

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.652
MARUCHO: They may not realize it but it won't stay

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.420
a secret forever.

Remember: cool is the rule.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.195
If we stay focused everything will be fine.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.963
COREDEM: I wonder how Dan, and the others are doing.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.298
I mean.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.966
There's no way anyone is going to believe this nonsense, right?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.503
DAN: Aw...all that stuff is a pack of lies.

SHUN: Why do you want to see Fabia?

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:47.834
LINUS: I have something for her, but it's very important that

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.735
I give it to her in person.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:54.106
The fate of Neathia is at stake.

REN: Tell me.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.382
Was it Marucho who found a way in?

And I presume you're from Neathia.

what do we do with them?

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.197

It is not in our nature to run from battle.

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.206
We must stand our ground.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.908

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.910
NEO: We are here because fate brought us.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:34.380
We must fight this out to the bitter end, for better or worse.

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.983
JESSE: Ahhh...Fate...! At times it is powerful

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.818
and at times so fragile.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:42.889
Like the wind, it is fleeting and so beautiful.

LINUS: I never got your...name.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.360
SHUN: My name is Shun.

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:50.563
And any ally of Fabia's is an ally of mine.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.965

it deflects it back at them...I hope you're enjoying this taste

HAWKTOR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.739
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Ren, Life-force, zero.

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.107
REN: Huh? !

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.776
JESSE: What an exquisite...ballet of pain

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.211
and destruction.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.979
Now it's our turn to join in.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.347
PLITHEON: A ballet?

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:03.549
Seriously?

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:04.983
JESSE: Ability activate!

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.452
JESSE: Hyper Verde!

PLITHEON: Oh yeah!

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.154
HAWKTOR: What the...?!

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.989
HAWKTOR: Arrrrrrggggghhhh!

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:12.658

My energy!

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:32.945
JESSE: Well played sir...

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:36.682
but I have a little surprise left.

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:38.484
You could call it a twist ending.

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:41.787
JESSE: Gate card, open!

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.021
JESSE: Uh oh!

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.756
That command card is linked to his Battle Gear.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.158

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:50.496

The Element!

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:15.087
JESSE: It is time for you to exit stage left.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.023
There is no encore for you because...

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.092
PLITHEON: This is the end!

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.160

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.283

Winner Jesse and Ren.

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:05.137
REN: Nice work, Jesse.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.905
JESSE: A Bakugan from Neathia...

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:10.242
JESSE: What a wonderful trophy to win.

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:17.749
LINUS: Now that they have it Neathia's doomed.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:18.750
SHUN: Linus!

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:19.751
Stay with me!

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:20.852
Linus!

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:26.725
FABIA: Linus!

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:29.795
LINUS: Princess...Fabia ?

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:32.798
FABIA: Linus, thank goodness you're awake now.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.366
Oh Linus.

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.867
LINUS: Where am I?

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.670
FABIA: Don't worry, you're safe with us now but

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.138
what are you doing here?

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:42.074
LINUS: I'm so sorry.

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:46.912
I was supposed to protect it and give it to you but I lost it.

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.680
FABIA: You lost what?

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:51.316
LINUS: It was The Element.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.585
And now our enemies have it.

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:54.886
SHUN: Whah...?!

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.388
HAWKTOR: Why did you say Neathia was doomed when they took Neo

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.589
earlier?

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:58.590
JAKE: Wait a minute.

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.025
Who's Neo?

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:02.261
MARUCHO: Doomed?

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.895
DAN: Element?

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.335
DAN: I'm still not totally sure about what this Element is

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:12.537
that's so important to Neathia, all I know is, it's super

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.039
powerful and now it's in the hands of the Gundalians.

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:18.076
Luckily though, they still don't realize

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.711
it's in their possession.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.513
DAN: Just as we were trying to figure out a way to get it back,

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.782
Sid showed up and challenged me to a battle.

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.217
Of course I accepted it.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.753
Maybe if I took him down he'd lead us back to the Element.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.221
DAN: The action gets crazy intense.

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.089
You need to see it with your own eyes to believe it!

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.190
I'm telling you!

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:34.293
DAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.327
DAN: Oh yeah!
