DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.608
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.543
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.446
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.750
went online global, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.352
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.920
environment.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.223
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.292
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.261
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.096
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.664
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.299
OK, buddy, let's do this.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.201
All right, Bakugan Brawl!

THEME SONG: What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.978
Backed against the wall, you gotta give it your all.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.146
Ah, ah. Ah, ah.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah, ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.648
This is the final stand. Ah, ah.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:49.549
Ah, ah.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.450
Ah, ah.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.551
The power's in your hands.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.587
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:02.929
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.230
This is Bakugan.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.810
The whole point of your mission

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.245
was to convince the Battle Brawlers to join us.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.848
What part of that was confusing to you?

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.617
Instead, they've now joined the Neathians.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.519
You guys blew it.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.555
Pathetic.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.457
With the Brawlers on their side,

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.960
we no longer have the advantage we once did over the Neathians.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.996
Your highness, I suggest a preemptive strike.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.632
You took the words right out of my mouth, Gill.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.536
Twelve Orders, all battalions, prepare to attack.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.347
Whoa.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.015
Welcome to Neathia.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.117
This is my home, you guys.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.418
Isn't it beautiful?

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.556
DAN: Fabia, it's incredible.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.693
- Wow. - Wow.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:41.594
Unbelievable.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.463
It's even more amazing inside.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:47.634
JAKE: This is like, totally sick, dude.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.770
Please let the queen know that we are here to see her.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.771
Of course.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.352
Whoa, she's really beautiful.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.654
What did you expect?

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.455
She is my sister, after all.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.494
Welcome, brothers.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.529
I am Queen Serena.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.565
I would like to thank you for joining

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.669
the fight to save our homeland.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.606
My little sister speaks very highly of you all.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:32.278
You're obviously very brave to come here without hesitation.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:37.350
All Neathians are indebted to you, brave Battle Brawlers.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.285
You don't owe us anything.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.155
The Gundalians are a threat to the entire universe.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.490
We've got as much at stake as you do.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.994
We need to take back control of Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.797
We also need to free all of the children

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.832
that they've kidnapped from Earth.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:57.103
And we need to stop them from using Bakugan as weapons.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:01.207
That is an ironic statement, coming from you.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.442
What do you mean?

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.478
Well, Dan, you'll be engaging in battle, which

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.081
means you too will be using your Bakugan as weapons,

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.816
like our enemies.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.552
So how does that make you different from them?

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.454
They're not weapons to us.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:17.557
The Bakugan are our partners in battle.

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.392
They're also our best friends.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.693
It's true.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:23.229
I am very happy to hear you say that.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.733
We feel just the same as you do.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.602
Fabia, take them to the sacred shrine.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.204
They can be trusted.

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.605
Of course.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.374
The sacred shrine?

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:37.577
What does that have to do with fighting the Gundalians, huh?

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.112
Just follow me.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.780
I'll explain soon enough, OK?

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.656
[groans]

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:53.793
What's the matter?

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.094
Why are you stopping?

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.064
What is that, some kind of dragon?

00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:59.732
Whatever it is, it's creepy.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.401
I don't think we should go in there.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.836
What's going on, Fabia?

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:06.839
Relax, it's just a gargoyle we use to scare people off

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.174
so they won't snoop.

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.976
We don't want to draw attention to the shrine's location.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.448
Whoa, careful, guys.

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.116
I almost got a total soaker there.

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.185
It's OK, Dan.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.121
What, Fabia, how are you walking on water?

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.957
Anyone who is pure of heart can walk on the surface

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:27.026
of this spring without sinking.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.227
Interesting.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.595
You mean crazy.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.531
That totally defies physics.

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.466
It's another safeguard for the shrine.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.635
Yeah, but it's still freaky.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.537
Not feeling so pure of heart?

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.505
What are you talking about?

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.040
I'm as pure as they get.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.775
Watch this.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.679
I'll just do a little soft shoe here, and that should, uh--

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.514
Ha, yeah.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:49.549
[laughs]

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.884
Ha ha!

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.720
Oh, you see I told you I could do it.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.887
Woo-hoo!

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.389
Yes, and quite humble, too.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.623
DAN: (SINGING) I am pure of heart.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:58.591
I am pure of heart.

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.861
I am pure of--

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:05.498
Um, Fabia, what's that disco ball thingy up there?

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.735
It's the sacred orb, a revered object here on Neathia

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.070
and the origin of all Bakugan.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.808
Inside, it contains the original DNA codes for each Bakugan.

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:18.111
Wow, the origin of all--

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.612
What, Akwimos?

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.014
Dude, this thing is the source.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.721
Every part of me feels like it's tingling.

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.956
I know.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.658
It's like there's this energy filling me up inside.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.128
It's like I'm gonna burst but I've never felt so good.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.262
I feel it too.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.464
But behind it, there's a strange foreboding.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.968
It's like I'm connected to the orb and it can sense danger.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.871
I've never felt anything like this before.

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.407
FABIA: Barodius, the emperor of Gundalia

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.309
wants to get his hands on this so he can twist its powers

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.645
and use them for his own evil purposes.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:53.913
I don't understand.

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:56.315
I thought you told us earlier that the Gundalians

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.950
were after the element.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.952
The element is just a portion of the power

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.821
that is present inside the orb.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.023
Barodius did want to possess it, but only

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.159
for the temporary advantage it would have provided

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.660
him in his battle against us.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.363
But now that it has been absorbed by Drago,

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.732
there's no doubt he will set his sights on the orb.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.534
I'm convinced that the orb has been

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:16.402
his original target all along.

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:18.304
If he manages to get his hands on it,

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.640
then he will not only possess its power,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.844
but also the ability to control every Bakugan in existence,

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.481
since their DNA codes are contained within.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.283
Don't worry, Fabia.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.451
We're here now to help you fight.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.154
So there's no way that's ever gonna happen, you hear me?

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.856
Yeah, not a chance.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.558
You can count on us, princess.

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.037
OFFICER 1: The dimensional radar has

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.372
locked on to an unauthorized transport.

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.775
There's no response to any of our communications.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.444
OFFICER 2: The analysis is complete.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:07:59.879
It's a Gundalian.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.914
OFFICER 3: There are six ships in total, sir.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:02.982
OFFICER 1: Six ships?

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:04.817
OFFICER 2: Yes, and they're closing in.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.353
[whooshing]

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.731
What would you like us to do with the Neathian prisoner,

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:19.632
sir?

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:20.900
Prisoner?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.936
Ah, yes, Elright, he's useless.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:24.971
Get rid of him.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.038
COMMANDER: Yes, sir.

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:28.407
All ships, prepare for dimensional leap.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.980
All battalions attack.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.448
Show them no mercy.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.121

I don't know, but he's a mean looking sucker.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:55.261
Hey, kid, I like your battle gear.

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:58.597

Somebody is getting fired.

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.158
We are ready and willing to protect

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.294
the sacred orb with our lives.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.863
This dude is huge.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.931
Well, his suit of armor is.

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.667

Hey, are you Barodius?

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:39.838
You dare address your emperor that way?

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:41.840
But you're not my emperor, pal.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.044
And you never will be, got it?

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:52.051
You'll pay for your hubris, boy, you both will.

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.652

This one is quite impressive.

He doesn't look like much to me.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:31.290

Very well then, ability activate, Multicam Effect.

Don't worry.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.900
I'll find him.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.069
Be careful, Hawktor.

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:44.970
Huh?

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:45.871

Stay strong, Coredem!

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:55.013

You think you're fast, do you?

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.507
Yeah, faster than you, doggy, and tougher.

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:28.046

I am fine.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.910
So you're the one they call Drago?

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.344
That's right.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.680
And who are you?

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.615
You're not worthy to hear my name.

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:04.917
What?

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:08.487
Once I take you down, you'll know exactly who I am,

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:09.822
you worthless lizard.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:10.722
Ha!

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.124
Big words.

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:17.763
Come on, Drago, let's show him exactly how worthless we are.

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:18.864
I'm ready.

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:20.199

What was that you said about taking me down?

00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:40.452
What the!

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.661
Get ready to hurt, badly.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.829

Huh?

00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.873
What's happening?

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.742
The sacred orb is calling out.

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:05.177
This is weird, dude.

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:09.248
[suspenseful music]

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:22.895
What?

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.630
He just disappeared.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.465
Did they disappear into the light?

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.471
What just happened?

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.840
Somebody tell me.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.943
We are not exactly sure, sire, but it appears

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:40.579
that we were forcibly transported out of Neathia

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.514
by a very powerful energy.

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:46.351
But what would harness such a power?

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:50.088
Perhaps it was the element.

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.823
What do you think, Dharak?

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.125
Is it possible?

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.294
I'm not sure.

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:58.130
But it is interesting that the light appeared when Drago

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.833
and I got close to each other.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.369
[fireworks popping]

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:18.417
Atten-hut!

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.719
I hereby appoint the Battle Brawlers

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.254
to the Order of Castle Knights.

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:28.327
Princess Fabia, are you sure about this?

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:29.461
Of course.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.797
I am a Battle Brawler too now.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.502
Hey.

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:39.805
I'm grateful for your help on the battlefield.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.441
Thank you, Dan and Drago.

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.243
No need to thank us, Captain.

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.845
You're a good man, Dan Kuso.

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:49.114
I look forward to battling alongside you again.

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:50.015
Me too.

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:52.351
We both do.

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.652
Right, Drago?

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:55.053
Absolutely.

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:08.867
MARUCHO (VOICEOVER): When we got to Neathia,

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.570
we found out the Gundalians had destroyed the second shield.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.039
But I had a plan to trick them into rebuilding.

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:16.108
Unfortunately, before I could get to it,

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.944
Ren's cronies showed up and started causing trouble again.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.879
Luckily, we had the Castle Knights to back us

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:22.281
up and fight off their attack.

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:24.316
Jake ran some interference for me while I

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:25.951
tried to put the plan in place.

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.486
Things got pretty hectic.

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:30.489
You should check out all the action.

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:33.659
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.894
Let's go, Akwimos, we can do this.

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:37.129
Yeah, dude!

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.065
