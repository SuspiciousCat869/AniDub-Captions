00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.374
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.409
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.680
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.983
went online globally allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.586
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.954
environment.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.923
It was a long road, but under Marucho's expert leadership,

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.859
the technical team at the Marukura Group

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.360
conducted a number of experiments

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.162
before finally succeeding.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.831
But lastly, we're able to scan people's atomic structures

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.601
and then convert them into data so they can be transported

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.102
into the virtual world.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.205
Now all kids need to do is drop into the nearest access point

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.007
and be teleported to the Interspace

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.610
where they can battle to their heart's content.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.779
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.882
wants Bakugan Interspace to remain happy and free.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.817
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.685
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.220
and is trying to take over.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.289
But, we brawlers aren't just going to sit by and let

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.690
these creeps push us around.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.359
We've never run from a fight, and we're

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.527
not going to start now.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.896
We'll show them who runs Bakugan Interspace.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.664
Hey, ready to get brawling?

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:05.932
Huh, Drago?

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.867
Ready when you are, Dan.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:08.768
OK then.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:09.803
Let's do this pal.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.504
Gate card, open.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.841
[singing] What are you going to do?

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.211
The odds are stacked against you.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.246
Back against the wall.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.316
Got to give it your all.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.486
This is the final stand.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.655
The power's in your hands.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.990
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.596
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.499
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.501
This is Bakugan.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.103
[music playing]

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.271
Right.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.973
Running, running.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.308
We're running, we're running-

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.076
Oh wait, you changed.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.346
DAN KUSO: Mom, I'm home.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.849
No shoes in the house.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.151
Where are you at buddy?

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.652
Hiding from your mom.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.088
Last time she tried to make me work out with her.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.224
Maybe we should both split.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.291
Good idea.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.562
And now we're--

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.831
I said no shoes in the house.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.166
That's it, take my breath away.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.167
Come on--

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.605
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): I have to admit,

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.740
when dad got transferred to Bayview for work,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.408
I wasn't that excited about coming.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.377
But now that I'm here, I really dig it.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.819

JULIE: Hello handsome.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.171
Julie.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.541
So, what can I get for you today?

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.642
Um, just water.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.844
I'm waiting for Jake.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:01.014
Big surprise, cheapskate.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.882
Hello Julie.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.217
Hey Drago.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.985
I still can't believe that you and Dan

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.387
ended up neighbors again.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.622
But this time halfway around the world.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.391
It's crazy, I know.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.093
But, it's nice having an old friend nearby.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.895
Where the heck is Jake anyway?

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.130
Always late.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.033
Dan the man with the big brown van.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:20.934
Hey.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.135
JAKE: Hi Julie.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.938
Dude, you got to quit it with that greeting.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.140
I don't have a van, or even a license.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.875
It's pretty lame.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:29.809
Yeah, I know.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.810
But it rhymes.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.378
Dan, man, van.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:33.646
Hilarious.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:37.584
Hey Julie, do you have one of those real Bakugan too?

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.285
What's a real Bakugan?

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.654
Jake here only knows the virtual kind.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:45.024
When I showed him Drago, he totally flipped out.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.293
I thought Bakugan only existed as data.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:51.831
So, when Dan introduced me to Drago, it totally blew my mind.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.200
There are thousands just like me on my homeworld

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.201
of New Vestroia.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.970
Seriously?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.404
So cool.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.607
Dan the man, can we go, please?

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.709
Again with the Dan the man.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.776
I can't help it.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:04.677
You're a legend, dude.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:05.578
Huh?

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:06.846
You need a nickname like that.

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:09.649
Well, when you put it that way, I guess it's OK.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.884
Dan the man with a plan.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.555
OK dude, we got to talk about this rhyming thing.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.057

MARUCHO: Good afternoon, and welcome to Bakugan Interspace.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.167
The world's first and only 100% virtual

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.902
battle park created just for you.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.639
Come experience thrilling brawls with kids

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.007
from around the globe.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.676
Marucho's become quite the pitch man.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.678
You have to admit, the idea is brilliant.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.346
He's bringing brawling to the masses.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.055
Welcome, Dan Kuso.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.094
Are you just going to stand there all day?

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.129
Chop chop.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.130
Oh, right.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.941
Just breathe, OK?

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.277
Primary circulation, standing by.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:18.017
Synchro translation 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:33.032
Welcome to Bakugan Interspace.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:36.569
Please enjoy your stay, and remember, play nice.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.172
It's so real.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:40.206
Nope.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.909
But, it is the next best thing, buddy.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.546
So, you ready?

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.613
Whoa!

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:05.998
I love it.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.633
DAN KUSO: This area's called The Commons.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.169
It's where players from wherever can just come and hang out.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.041
It's massive.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.809
MARUCHO: This is also a place where you can exchange

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.612
helpful hints and strategies while searching for opponents

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.913
to battle against.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.115
Hey, Marucho.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.015
Hey Dan.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.117
How's things?

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.952
Pretty good.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.554
This is my friend Jake.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:29.889
Hey, it's nice to meet you Jake.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:30.790
I'm Marucho.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.991
How's it going?

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.060
I'm Dan's old friend from back home.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.696
Little dude, I know all about you.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:39.398
Dan's told me stories about the old days.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.634
I bet he has. (LAUGHS)

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.002
Jake's a newbie.

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.405
This is going to be his first battle today.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.906
Oh, congratulations.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.441
As a token of our new friendship,

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.543
let me offer you your very own Bakugan.

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.425
Whoa.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.693
Go ahead, come on and pick one Jake.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.295
JAKE: Really? Are you serious?

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.396
Yeah, of course I am.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.464
Please.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.866
OK, let's see.

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:14.767
This one.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.803
MARUCHO: Ah, Subterra Coredem.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.137
Nice choice.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:21.073
OK then Jake, that means that from today's day forward,

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.408
Coredem is your partner.

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:26.145
Good to meet you little buddy.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:29.382
So, how come he doesn't talk to me?

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:30.349
He's a digital clone.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.450
A synthetic.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.486
Subterra Coredem isn't programmed to speak

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.922
like a living Bakugan would.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:39.992
So then, he's not a real Bakugan?

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.093
Huh?

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.465
Quit staring at me like that.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.800
It's creepy.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.603
Um, hey now that you've got your Bakugan, how about

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.638
we try a little battle, huh?

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:53.806
That sounds really great. But.

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:54.707
What.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.008
Uh--

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.777
Bakugan brawl.

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.412
Bakugan stand.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.747
Go Darkus Glotranoid.

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.082
Gate card on this.

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.083
Vicious reactor.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:10.890
Ability activate, tuxedo.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.658
MARUCHO: Unfortunately, all the battle

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.228
arenas are full at the moment.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.128
DAN KUSO: What?

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.997
You've got a full house?

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.365
That's awesome dude.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:22.335
I just can't believe how popular you made this

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.270
in such a short period of time.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.404
Thanks.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:29.609
But, a lot of the credit for this lies with Ren.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.611
Excuse me.

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.080
Would you be the Bakugan Battle Brawlers?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.848
Yeah, we are the Brawlers.

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.216
So, who are you then?

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:40.953
My name's Ren, Ren Krawler.

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:43.623
That's great, but how did you get in here?

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.691
This area isn't open to the public.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.959
It's under construction, and we're

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.161
using proprietary technology.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.731
Forgive me master Marucho.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:54.534
Mr. Krawler said he had a matter of the utmost urgency

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:55.568
to discuss with you.

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.637
So, I let him through.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:01.274
I had heard a few rumors about the Bakugan Interspace.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.609
So, I did some research and tracked all of you

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.777
Brawlers down.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:05.678
Rumors?

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:06.979
But I don't understand.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.815
This project is top secret.

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:14.420
Sounds like you've got a leak inside your research team.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.056
So, what exactly did you hear?

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.858
Nothing specific.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.927
But, I did hear stuff about you guys.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.128
What?

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.330
REN: What few details I did learn about Interspace

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.199
made me realize that you've got a huge problem though.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.535
There aren't enough Bakugan available for all

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.304
of your potential battler's.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.105
Is that really true?

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.608
Actually, now that I think of it, yes.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:38.678
Perhaps the answer lies in cloning existing Bakugan.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:39.912
But, which ones?

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:42.815
The digital versions in the system, or live ones

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:43.816
from New Vestroia?

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:44.917
I don't know.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:47.920
Both of those options seem like bad ideas.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.756
REN: Actually, I think I could be of some help in that area

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.858
if you'll allow me.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.261
Listen pal, we just met.

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:59.231
Yes, but I also received the unknown data.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:01.300
MARUCHO: The version of the data that Ren received

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.703
was quite different from what we received in that there

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:07.139
was so much more of it.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.774
If Ren hadn't come to us that day,

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.209
I don't think there's any way that Bakugan

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.678
Interspace would have made it past the prototype stage.

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:13.579
Whoa.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.747
Huh?

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.682
Well, well speak of the devil.

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.020
How's it going there Dan?

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:27.994
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): Let's show Jake how it's done Drago.

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:31.263
REN (VOICEOVER): Time for some battle action, Linehalt.

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:33.232
Oh, hey there, Ren.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:34.600
This is my buddy--

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.568
Jake Valory.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:36.602
What?

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:38.537
I understand this is your first battle

00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:41.941
and that Subterra Coredem is your partner Bakugan.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.110
Uh, yeah?

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.980
Relax, I just reviewed his registration data, that's all.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.083
In case you couldn't tell, Ren is in charge of data management

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.785
for Bakugan Interspace.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:57.656
He's a freak for research, facts, and figures.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.225
Thanks a lot guys.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.061
Since I'm such a freak, I guess that's how I know that Shun

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.196
is battling now in arena F12.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.398
Want to check it out, Dan?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.298
MARUCHO: Really?

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.466
Shun?

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:08.367
Awesome.

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:09.268
I'm in.

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:14.273
Arena F12, let's go.

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:16.776
Uh.

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:21.113
(SCREAMS) Wait up dudes.

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:23.215
[cheering]

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.551
Hey, there's our boy.

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.719
Looks like a good battle.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.288
Ability activate.

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:30.289
Poison laser.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:34.193
See that?

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:36.262
No one can beat me now that I've perfected

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.031
my strategy with Subterra darkness and chaos.

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.934
Yeah well, your strategy is good.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.836
But, it's your execution that needs work.

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:44.737
What?

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.005
What do you mean?

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:50.876
Ability activate ninja protection wild wind defence.

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:54.747
Ability activate flip pointer.

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:58.484
Ability activate fly fang hyperstorm.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.595
Lifeforce zero.

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.430
Battle over.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.933
And the victory goes to Shun Kazami.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.209
Nice one Shun.

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:25.945
But, you still got a ways to go to catch up to me.

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:29.815
JAKE: If Marucho's in third, and Shun's in second, then wow,

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.983
Dan look.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.384
You're number one!

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.220
SHUN: Hm, won't take me long to catch up.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.355
You're up next Jake my friend.

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:37.289
Huh?

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:39.258
What are you talking about Ren?

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.927
Well, I shifted around the battle orders a bit

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:42.828
to move him up.

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.096
Ren.

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:46.265
That's not fair for the others whose turn it really is.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.200
Since Jake is our friend, I thought

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.635
we could make an exception.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:53.839
On tap for the next battle is the number one rate, Dan Kuso.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.175
[cheering]

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.643
You're up Jake.

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.812
Thank your lucky stars, not many people

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.649
get to go against the top rated brawler in their first battle.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:06.051
I really don't know if I can do this in front

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:07.620
of all of these people.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.855
No way, I can't do it.

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.190
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.292
Come on dude, take it easy.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.127
[interposing voices] is a first time participant,

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.295
Ren Krawler.

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:17.763
Huh?

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:20.032
Huh?

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:21.400
What? Oops

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.434
Oops, whoopsie.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.003
Looks like I messed up the order.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.672
Probably best that you watch two pros go at it first.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:27.740
Come on Ren.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.475
What is going on here, man?

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.911
I bet he planned it this way.

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:34.747
You did this to embarrass me.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:35.881
Come on, Dan.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.816
Can't keep the fans waiting.

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:38.884
You sure about this?

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.152
Drago's pretty strong.

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:43.255
Well, my Linehalt's no pushover.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.591
Bakugan, beam open.

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:46.959
Let's see what you got.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.295
Gate card, open.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.430
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.499
Bakugan stand.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.367
Go Pyrus Helix Dragonoid.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.543
I just realized I've never seen Ren battle before.

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:06.545
He's going up against Dan.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.814
It could be over before he knows it.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:11.217
Bakugan brawl.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.218
Bakugan stand.

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.057
Rise Darkus Linehalt.

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:19.925
Never seen that Bakugan before.

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:31.237
Ability activate, dragon hummer.

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.610
Stay on him.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.382
Ability activate, bolting vibra.

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:45.284
Snap, he nullified my ability.

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.185
Lucky shot.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.319
Let's go Dan.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.154
Gate card, open.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.389
High risk reactor.

00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:00.566
Ability activate, galactic dragon.

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:07.039
Ability activate, dispel closer.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.712
Hang on Drago.

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.815
Ability activate, burning tornado.

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.060
Ren lifeforce, 20%.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.961
Oh yeah.

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.663
Dan totally schooled him.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.465
Yeah, but he's got some pretty good shots in on Drago.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:35.534
Ren's definitely no punk.

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.336
Check it out guys.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.838
Look, they started round two already.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:47.346
Ability activate, bolting vibra.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:48.247
Really?

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.515
Playing that one again?

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:53.052
Ability activate, burning reflector.

00:15:57.489 --> 00:15:58.824
Well played.

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:03.862
Ability activate, darkness blizzard.

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:04.863
What the?

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.499
Gate card open.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:08.500
Freeze enemy.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.939
What's happening?

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.474
Drago, what's wrong?

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.676
Can't move my body.

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:22.681
Command card, freeze enemy is a trap card that freezes

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:24.483
the movements of your opponent.

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.919
Prevents them from activating abilities.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:27.986
Drago!

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:35.260
Dan Lifeforce, 60%.

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.595
Oh no.

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.897
Hey, don't you think that was a bit harsh?

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.367
Come on, why should I pull any punches?

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.868
You're number one, right?

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:43.769
That's right.

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:44.770
And don't you forget it.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.609
Bakugan brawl.

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.211
Bakugan stand.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.050
Bakugan brawl.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.051
Bakugan stand.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.293
Ability activate, dragon hummer.

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:11.096
Ability activate, dark saber.

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:17.336
Fusion ability activate.

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.239
Power blazer.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.641
This should end it.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:27.012
Ability activate, galactic dragon.

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:33.252
Fusion ability activate, twist bow!

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:37.256
You think that's going to take down Drago?

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:40.559
Ability activate, sharp breaker.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.934
Drago's as tough as his reputation says.

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:54.239
I was hoping to save this for later.

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.507
Ready Boomix.

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.779
He's got battle gear.

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:02.414
Battle gear boost.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.829
We can play that game too.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:17.996
Ready jet core.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.167
Battle gear boost.

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:45.657
So awesome.

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:48.393
Their power levels are completely even now.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:52.865
Battle gear ability activate, mega blaster lock.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.066
Back it up.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:57.603
Battle gear ability activate, jet core delta.

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.581
Oh no.

00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:11.850
I need an emergency shut down of the system.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.619
Terminate this battle immediately.

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:24.596
Huh?

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:25.531
Where am I?

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:26.532
Where am I?

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:32.371
Huh?

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.372
Whoa!

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.917
Destroy the enemy Bakugan.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:45.918
All forces advance.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.461
What is this place?

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.912
Are you OK there Dan?

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:14.980
What the--

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.551
Who won the battle?

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:22.521
There was an accident and Marucho had to pull the plug.

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.855
Are you OK?

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:26.091
An accident?

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:28.060
What are you talking about?

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.629
MARUCHO: There was a huge explosion in the middle of it.

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:33.265
That's what knocked you out.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.335
Are you serious?

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.337
You don't remember any of it?

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:39.805
Remember?

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.240
I saw some things.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.444
Maybe it was all just a dream.

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:46.712
Calm down.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.780
Just tell me what you saw.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.881
Bakugan.

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:53.885
But, they were all at war with each other.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.587
How could that happen?

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:57.189
It makes no sense.

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:00.058
Why would the Bakugan be at war with each other?

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.326
You must have been hallucinating.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.729
[music playing]

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.134
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): All of my friends

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:11.136
think the visions I had after the explosion were

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:12.037
hallucinations.

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:13.672
But, I know what I saw was real.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:14.940
It was all so vivid.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.009
I just can't explain where they came from.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.877
Then Ren made a confession to us.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.145
Turns out he's been keeping a really

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.747
big secret from the brawlers that has

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.248
to do with the unknown data.

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:25.450
Could it be that he knows about the warring Bakugan

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.785
that I saw in my vision?

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.788
One thing's for sure, Ren's got some explaining to do.

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:32.991
You should tune in and join us as we search for the truth.

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:34.660
Bakugan brawl.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.062
Wicked dude.

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:39.898
