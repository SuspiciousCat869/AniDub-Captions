00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now, Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.431
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.568
Bakugan Brawl.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.178
Gotta give it your all.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.281
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.849
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.785
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:57.056
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.759
You got to fight for what's right

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.396
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.597
This is Bakugan.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.479
JAKE: Hey, buddy.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.547
Hey, Jake.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.148
Dude, I've been looking all over for you.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.316
Where you been?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.552
Let's go grab some lunch.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.188
I'm making Neathian cheeseburgers.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.323
Uh, sure.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.324
Hm.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.896
I still can't believe I'm actually here.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:37.797
Neathia's pretty sweet.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:38.965
Isn't it, bro?

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.600
Yeah.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.237
I can't believe I almost helped destroy it.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:47.540
I can't wait to take Barodius down with you guys.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.409
Yeah, buddy.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.376
[explosion]

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.811
Huh?

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:52.812
What is that?

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:53.813
Some kind of explosion.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:54.714
MARUCHO: Ren!

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.149
Jake!

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.150
It's the Gundalians.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.319
They're attacking the third shield.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.587
Oh, no!

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.656
[energetic music]

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:08.061
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Into the Storm.\"

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.063
[explosion]

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.031
[roars]

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.602
[blasting]

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.073
[roars]

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.042
[growls]

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.013
[explosions]

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.021
That's it, Krakix.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.823
Destroy the third shield.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:39.125
Tear it down to the ground now!

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.661
[roars]

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.799
What?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.077
[rippling]

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.914
That's what I'm talking about.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:01.915
Oh yeah.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.716
Looks like they're all running away.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.219
Maybe we shouldn't have been so worried.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.353
I don't know.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.689
It's not like Barodius to give up so easily.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.258
They're just regrouping to plan a better strategy.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.393
Definitely.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.595
Are you guys forgetting about our secret weapon?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.496
Yeah.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:17.730
Dan's right.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.066
The shield has the DNA code that prevents Gundalians

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.301
from passing through.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.802
Let's hope they don't figure it out.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:23.703
Could they?

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:24.837
No way.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:25.872
Not in a million.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.645
BARODIUS: A DNA barrier?

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.013
Yes.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.382
Our analysis of the shield just discovered it.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.718
The Neathians have programmed in another level

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.220
of security that prevents anyone bearing

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.790
Gundalian DNA from entering.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.093
So that's why your precious Krakix couldn't make so much

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.995
as a dent in the third shield.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:52.966
[grumbles] I didn't see you leading the charge, did I?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.169
And miss the chance to let you make a fool of yourself.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.304
Enough bickering you two.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.741
The solution is obvious if Gundalians can't

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.110
pass through the barrier, then it's pointless for us

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.411
to keep trying.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:09.182
Instead, I think we should send an envoy in our place.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.083
Like who?

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:10.984
Of course.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.853
What a brilliant idea, sire.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.155
[thunder]

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.357
Oh no.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.192
This is not good, guys.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.593
What's wrong?

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.428
It's a geomagnetic storm.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.230
They often drift in this time of year.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.032
Usually it's not a big deal, but--

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.101
The storms will disrupt our radar,

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.203
which means that we'll be completely

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.404
blind to any attacks.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.305
No.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.573
We'll go old school.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.775
DAN: We'll send out the Castle Knights on extra patrols

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.610
to keep an eye out.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.413
The Brawlers will help too.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:44.183
And if anyone sees anything, we'll sound

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.052
the alarm using our BakuMeters.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.420
[thunder]

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.222
Whoa.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.790
This lightning is intense.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.358
No kidding.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.559
Gnarly.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.296
Think they'll let me keep these things?

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.196
Whoa.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:58.431
What is it, Jake?

00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.599
I'm not sure.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.770
It's a kid.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.271
What?

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.673
JAKE: He's walking this way.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:07.707
DAN: Are you sure?

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.676
COREDEM: Where would he be coming from?

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.144
JAKE: I don't know, dude.

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.414
But it must be far, because he looks beat.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.450
[panting]

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:21.754
Dude.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:22.822
He's from Earth.

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.557
I recognize him from Bakugan Interspace.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.992
Can you guys help me?

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.727
I-- I want to go home.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.695
It's OK.

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.064
You're safe now, pal.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.666
They-- they took us to Gundalia.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.768
[sobs]

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.337
How did you get here?

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:38.337
Did you escape?

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.505
Yes.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.407
Nice one, little buddy.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.177
What's your name, little kid?

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.111
Robin.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.245
Hey, Robin.

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.182
I'm Jake, and this is my good buddy Dan Kuso.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.350
Jake, we've got to get him out of this storm.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.251
Right.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.253
Let's go.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.354
Come on, dude.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:56.355
[thunder]

00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.025
ROBIN: Wait.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.059
Huh?

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.728
My little sister's still back there.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:02.628
I can't just leave her.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.696
She's only a kid.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.665
She'll never survive without me.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.033
We have to go back and get her.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.369
Please, you guys.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.970
Don't just stand there.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.538
You guys are the Brawlers, right?

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:13.706
You're supposed to help people.

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:16.109
So why don't you guys help me?

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.977
Robin.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.112
Do you know what? Forget it.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.012
I'll go myself.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:20.913
Oh.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.014
Hey, wait a sec.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.317
I'll be back as soon as I get my sister.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:25.551
Wait for us.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:26.452
Robin!

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:27.720
Hold on a sec, Jake.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.688
Why'd you stop me?

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.389
We're going to lose him.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.325
We can't just go charging off into the storm.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.627
We're supposed to be on patrol watching for Gundalian ships

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:35.561
that might attack.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.263
How can you worry about that when

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:38.631
Robin's out there by himself?

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:39.732
Sorry.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.535
But if the Gundalians get the jump on us,

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:44.270
we'll lose more than just Robin.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.505
That doesn't sound like you.

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.572
What's up?

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:47.907
The storm got you spooked or something?

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.109
[groans] That's not it, dude.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.177
Oh yeah?

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.479
Then why don't you explain it to me then?

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.413
I told you.

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.581
We got to look at the big picture.

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.482
OK?

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:57.750
Blah, blah, whatever.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.751
I'm serious.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.454
So am I. Robin totally needs our help.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:02.722
- And he'll get it. - Yeah?

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:03.589
When?

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.524
Real soon.

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:06.159
Right.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.226
Enough, you two.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.829
Yeah, calm down.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.730
BOTH: Hmph.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.831
Go on.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.732
Fine.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:13.900
Maybe I will.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.001
I'm not scared.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.702
Leave then, tough guy.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:17.637
[groans]

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:18.638
Jake, wait up.

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:22.909
Not cool, Dan.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:23.810
Whateves.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.077
I'm not his babysitter.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:33.486
[lightning crackling]

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.761
Excellent job, Robin.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:42.895
Yes, mistress.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.301
[laughs]

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.069
LUMAGROWL: Mistress Kazarina, I think

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.439
you should have a look at this.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.174
Robin!

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:59.912
[chuckles] Well, that was quicker than I had thought.

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:05.718
It's time to meet the fly who's wandered into our web.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.153
Hello!

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.054
Robin!

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.355
You there?

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:10.723
Uh.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.059
I can't believe Dan the Man let him run back out into this.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.327
Can you, Coredem?

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.228
Don't worry.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.030
You and I will find him.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.165
Partners till the end.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.166
Right, dude?

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:23.636
Robin!

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:24.871
It's Jake.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:25.805
Where are you, dude?

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:26.806
Robin!

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.444
Hello?

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.346
Hello?

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.313
Huh?

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:35.715
[gasps]

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:36.716
Oh.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.657
Ha ha.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:46.559
Thanks for taking the bait, Jake.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.860
Kazarina.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.729
I'm surprised you had the guts to come

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.831
without your master, Dan Kuso.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:52.732
Whatever.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.267
I've come to get the kids back.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.167
Got it?

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:56.469
Is that right?

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.570
You and what army?

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.471
No army.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.472
Just me.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.844
We can't let Robin down, Coredem.

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:06.646
Woo!

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:09.315
KAZARINA: Our plan is working perfectly, Lumagrowl.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.154
He what?

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.956
He just ran off by himself?

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.492
Straight into that geomagnetic storm?

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.460
That sounds really bad.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.363
And you just stood by and let him go?

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.932
Why didn't you stop him?

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:29.468
I tried, but he wouldn't listen.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.804
He's a big boy.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.272
I'm really worried.

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:35.241
What if something happens to him?

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.776
Something like what?

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.945
Well, it could be a trap.

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:41.514
Huh?

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.082
I never thought of that.

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.985
Whatever the case, we have to find him immediately.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.486
Hurry up. - Yes.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.621
Right now.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.523
Dan, are you coming with us?

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:55.027
Uh, well, I guess.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:58.464

Bakugan, stand.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.973
Let's thrash these weasels and get the kids back, Coredem.

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:10.309
[laughs] Silly little boys.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:13.045

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.348

[roars]

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:21.687
Rip them to pieces.

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.756
[roars]

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:28.094
Oh, man.

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.695
That's really bright.

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:35.101
[grunts]

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:40.406
[snarling]

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.407
Whoa.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:47.980
Coredem!

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.152
[growls]

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:58.724
We're going to send you to the pound, you lousy mutt.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.994
We'll see about that, big boy.

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:02.895
Ha.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:05.965

[grunting]

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:14.540
He's too fast.

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:17.777
OK.

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:22.615
Ability, activate Armored Exia.

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:23.616
That's better.

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:32.191
What?

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.660
[growls]

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.232
My swords.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.902
[laughs] Hilarious.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:45.638
They're about as useless as two wet noodles.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:48.207
Don't get cocky with me, boy.

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:50.076
Relax, Lumagrowl.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.211
We'll take these fools down yet.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.513

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.248

Whoa.

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.151
This is going to hurt.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.620

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:22.808
I just rendered useless with my Arcadia Sword.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.344

I'm OK.

We can do this, Coredem.

Yeah!

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.321
Here we go.

What?

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.095
I can't move.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.963
What's happening?

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:21.500
That's the feeling of you losing, you mangy mutt.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.169
[chuckles] Nice one.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.037
We're not finished yet.

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:26.672
Not even close.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:27.706
Neither are we.

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.210

I'm going to enjoy this.

Jake!

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.596
I think Dan is really starting to feel

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.765
guilty about letting Jake go out into the storm on his own.

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.500
And so he should.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.768
No kidding.

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:30.903
Jake!

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.838
Where are you ?

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.773
Come back!

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:36.508
Uh, what the heck just happened?

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.743
Ha!

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:42.181

Why so surprised, Jake?

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:05.504
Did you really think you could take us down?

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.006
[blast]

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.042

Destroy them, Lumagrowl.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:12.738
That's it.

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:15.140
Roll over like a good little doggy and stay put.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.509
You've got nerve, thinking you can order me around.

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:18.877
Ability, activate.

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:20.279
Blade Fantasma.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.180
Ooh.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.514
It tingles.

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:25.250
That's nice.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.387
You're not going to fool us with that lame trick again.

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.055
Ability, activate.

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:31.056
Dimension Vortex.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.060
What?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.729
JAKE: You like that?

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:37.963
Try this.

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:40.199
Ability, activate.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.801
Cross Arrow.

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.370
[groans]

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.807
[yelps]

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.682
Enough playing around.

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.650
Kazarina, let's end this.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:16:59.551
Ha.

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:00.719
Battle Gear Boost.

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.027
[roars]

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:11.397
Battle Gear Boost.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.139
That's the business.

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.842
Battle Gear Ability, activate.

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:27.112
Rock Hammer Beo-Blaster.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:29.014
Last chance to say uncle.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:30.549
Never, punk.

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:31.617
Gate Card, open.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.618
Zeno Weakness.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.521
Huh?

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.989
Wha-- what's happening?

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.059
[groaning]

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.962
Coredem!

00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:47.032
[cackles]

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.438
Ugh.

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:53.405
Buddy.

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:54.606
Ha ha.

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:57.309
And just like that I've decreased his power level

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.311
and nullified your ability.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.446
Ah, snap.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.814
That's right.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:06.585
Barias Gear Thunderbolt, activate.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:09.288
[groaning]

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.657
[barking]

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:12.558
Ugh.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:16.528
Can't keep it up much longer.

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:19.098
[groans]

00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:26.839
[grunts]

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.307
Yes.

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:30.175
Show them no mercy, Lumagrowl.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.643
[growls]

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:35.681
Oh, I really hate these things.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.648
Ugh. Ugh.

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:37.549
Ugh.

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:38.450
Ah.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.485
Ooh.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:40.953
Hold on, Coredem.

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.921
We can't lose this one.

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:44.523
Stay strong.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.226
I can't let the kid down!

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.263
Nice one!

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.264
Huh?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.103
[growls] You done?

00:18:58.203 --> 00:18:59.004
Face it.

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:01.006
You are outmatched.

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:02.841
You nasty witch.

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:05.010
Who do you think you are, taking innocent kids

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.579
and forcing them to fight your battles for you?

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:08.480
Hm.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.615
Relax, Jake.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.183
They're all back on Earth.

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.251
What?

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:14.119
KAZARINA: Safe and sound.

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:16.455
[laughs]

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:21.193
[moans] Hey, what just happened?

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.294
Anyone remember?

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:23.629
No.

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.731
KAZARINA: The younger ones have outgrown their usefulness

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.667
as battlers, so I'll use them to draw in the bigger,

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.536
stronger fish, like you.

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:31.937
Ha.

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.706
You mean this whole thing was a trap, and Robin was in on it

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:35.607
too?

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.075
Don't feel too betrayed, Jake.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.478
[chuckles] Robin had no more say in his role

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.647
than a worm who's placed on a fisherman's hook.

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.782
[cackles] No more talking.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.651
Finish them, Lumagrowl.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:48.353
You're going to regret calling me a mutt.

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:50.355
I promise you.

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:51.490
Speak up, mutt.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.058
I can't hear you.

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:54.526
[growls]

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:55.627
Ugh. Ugh.

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:56.528
Oh.

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.598
[groans]

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.101
Oh.

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:04.102
Oh.

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.445
We-- we lost.

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:17.349
[groans] Sorry, buddy.

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:21.253
[laughs]

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.655
[laughs]

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:25.724
[sobs]

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.060
Hey, Jake.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.828
Are you OK?

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:30.729
Sorry.

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.130
For what?

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.601
I should have listened to you.

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:36.501
Sorry.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:37.402
Jake.

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.304
Wake up.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.307
[chuckles] Time for us to leave now.

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.442
Bye, bye, Jake.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:47.446
Jake!

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:48.347
Don't touch him.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:51.583
You'll be pulled along with him.

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:53.051
ALL: Huh?

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:56.622
KAZARINA: [cackling]

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:00.959
Jake!

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:03.028
No!

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:03.996
No!

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:08.967
DAN (VOICEOVER): After I let Jake wander off on his own,

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.870
he got ambushed by Kazarina and dragged to Gundalia.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.573
It was all my fault, so it was up to me to get him back.

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:17.209
I didn't care about the risk, but just as I was about to go,

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:19.077
Jake showed up again on Neathia.

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:20.979
I guess he managed to escape somehow.

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.414
But now that he was back, he seemed more

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:23.815
anxious to battle than ever.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.117
Luckily, we talked him into getting

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:27.019
some much needed rest first.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.620
It may sound strange, but something seemed

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.988
a little different about Jake.

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:31.957
You should tune in to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:33.492
There, that's what I'm talking about.

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:34.459
Take a look at him.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.995
Tell me he's not acting weird, right?

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:42.801
