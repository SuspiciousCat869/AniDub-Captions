00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.920
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.555
Now, Earth and Neathia were United

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.658
in the struggle to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.464
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.201
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.571
[theme music playing] What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.041
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:47.080
Back against the wall, got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.684
This is the final stand, the power's in your hands.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.396
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.597
This is Bakugan.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.015
My head's killing me.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.789
What happened to me?

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.472
DAN KUSO (VOICEOVER): The Bakugan

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.874
Battle Brawlers in Sid Returns.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.483
What's wrong, Ren?

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.225
What I'm saying is that I don't believe

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.593
you're being honest with me.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.864
You say that, but I still can't believe that you mean it.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.734
People like you give me hope that the future of Gundalia

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:18.438
will be better than we ever dreamed.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:24.511
Why is it everyone questions my motivations

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.012
for working for the emperor?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.998
Poor Sid, Jesse, Lena, Zenet.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:48.701
Too many have fallen for me not to see

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.203
this all the way through.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.276
Our attack on the revived second shield

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.677
will commence at dawn.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.647
Time is of the essence, so we will need to rally the troops

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:01.781
immediately, understood?

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.082
Yes, sir.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.722
Stop fighting.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:13.760
Kazarina, our attack is only hours away.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.962
We'll need you to hypnotize another batch of kids from--

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:16.863
Sorry.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.598
What?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:22.569
Right now, I need to focus on completing Exokor's upgrades,

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.770
Gill.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.807
Your petty distractions aren't my problem, got it?

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.643
You'll have to make do with the Gundalian soldiers.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.644
I see.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:42.422
[evil laughter]

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.031
Attention, all personnel.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.232
Attention, all personnel.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.101
Report to transport ships immediately.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.104
Repeat, report to transport ships immediately.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:10.850
Ren.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:24.731
[snoring]

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.833
Everything is so quiet out there.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.034
It's almost too quiet.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:28.935
Spooky.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.337
Guys, keep your wits about you.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.406
The Gundalian's won't stay idle for long.

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:34.774
No kidding.

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:38.478
Then why wait around, Dan, let's take the fight to them.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:40.079
Slow down, Jake.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.882
Don't you remember what Queen Serena said?

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.951
I appreciate the skills you bring

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.886
to the fight against our enemies,

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:50.790
but you must remember, my people are not the experienced

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.259
warriors that your people are.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.363
Therefore, I must ask you to act with caution.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:01.100
We gotta take it low and slow.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.937
OK, you got it, low and slow.

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:07.373
Hey, guys, over there.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.759
Let's rock!

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:37.937
Linehalt, are you ready?

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.005
Yes.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.208
Just remember all the reasons we fight.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:47.413
So that we may learn what the forbidden power is.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:52.051
And so that we will never have to live in darkness again.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.319
REN AND LINEHALT: Let's go.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.631
Come on!

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.967
Ability activate!

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.068
Strike blaster!

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:32.258
Just like knocking down bowling pins, pal.

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.994
Except that bowling pins don't fire back.

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.806
Another perfect strike.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.415
Where did that come from?

00:06:56.516 --> 00:07:01.187
A high powered cannon, just like--

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:04.123
Battle gear ability, activate.

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:07.293
Mega blaster boost.

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.361
Whoa!

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.200
I'm going wide.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:23.776
Follow them now, Linehalt.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.751
There they are.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.752
Huh?

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.691
Drago, let's duck inside there.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.892
You got it.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:51.971
That was easy.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.507
Yes, way too easy.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.242
Looking for us, guys?

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:57.710
How did he get behind us?

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.711
Think fast.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.684
Now, Drago!

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.320
Ability activate!

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.255
Crossfire!

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.324
You'll never win!

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:14.093
Ability activate!

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:17.430
Razen Breaker!

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.034
[screaming]

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.042
We've got them on the run now, Drago!

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:36.482
I won't go back to the darkness, Linehalt!

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:39.685
Ability activate!

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:40.853
Blitz hammer!

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.055
Is that all you've got?

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:45.525
Ability activate!

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.526
Dark javelin!

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.203
Ability activate!

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.539
Particle wave!

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:02.241
Ability activate!

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.077
Darkness blizzard!

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:07.013
Try this one, pal.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.149
Ability activate!

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:11.617
Blaze Fernum!

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.419
Ability activate!

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.420
Razen Breaker!

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:22.929
That's it, Linehalt. Hold steady, now.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.463
We've almost got him.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.204
Linehalt, no!

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:36.042
That didn't hurt.

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:39.178
I lost my concentration, there.

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.518
Ren, why are you even doing this, dude?

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.553
What are you talking about?

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:51.657
Why are you fighting for a creep like Barodius?

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:55.995
Like I need to explain myself to you.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.731
But if you must know, I fight for the emperor

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.499
because he's giving me my freedom,

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.535
and I owe him everything for that.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.704
Well for someone who's supposed to be free,

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.940
you sure look miserable.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.643
This might sound crazy, but when I think about how

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.712
you and Marucho acted together when you were working

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:16.182
on Bakugan interspace, you looked truly happy,

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.450
even though it was supposed to be

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.920
a trick you were playing on us.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.755
Enough, OK?

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:24.790
You don't understand anything.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.860
Then explain it to me.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.362
I know what I saw, Ren.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.664
You can't fake that kind of happiness.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:34.166
So maybe we weren't the only ones being fooled by you.

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:37.269
Maybe you were lying to yourself, too.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.538
It's time you were honest for once

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:44.010
and admit you'd rather be fighting with us.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.579
I've had enough of you!

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.080
You who don't know me!

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.750
I'm a Gundalian, born and bred.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.685
You got that?

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.553
A Gundalian!

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:56.455
And a brawler.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.857
Brawler?

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.627
Or did you forget that we all welcomed you as one of our own?

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:05.264
Well, answer me now, Ren!

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:08.501
Your level of dedication toward my people

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:09.502
is what I mean.

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:10.636
Humm?

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.805
You're fighting just as hard to defend Gundalia

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.273
as you would your own planet.

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:16.442
You're one of us now, Ren.

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.711
The Battle Brawlers aren't just a team.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.347
We're family, which means that if anybody threatens a member,

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.416
we band together to fight.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:27.853
From today forward, you will be caring for the dark Bakugan

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:28.921
who lives here.

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.592
I don't want to do it.

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:35.561
This is your destiny, boy.

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:38.264
As a descendant of the protectors of the dark Bakugan,

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.067
this is what you must do.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:45.271
This child is who they sent to care for me?

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.440
As the last of the Dark Bakugans,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.676
it appears as though I am not valued.

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:54.914
[screaming]

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.015
Ren!

00:11:56.115 --> 00:12:00.219
I won't go back to living in the darkness!

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:03.489
But Barodius put you there in the first place!

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.558
Join us, Ren, please!

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.865
I-I can't forget the fallen.

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.810
I must honor their memories.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.919
Let's leave the darkness for good, Linehalt!

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:34.820
Yes.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.756
What?

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:38.958
Ah, snap.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.292
You are done.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:48.434
Drago!

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:52.171
I'm OK, but we need to take these guys down.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:55.875
I know, pal, and I think I've got just the right tool.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:56.876

Rubanoid?

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.540
But how?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.043
No time for chit chat, buddy.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:05.744
We're in the middle of a battle.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:06.645
Huh?

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:08.080

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.235

Agreed, let's do it.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.667

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.139

Just keep still, now.

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.723
He's fast.

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:40.793

Take them out, Rubanoid!

With pleasure!

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:11.190
Seriously?

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.191
Oh no!

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:20.766

Oh man, not again!

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.192
Yeah!

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:30.969
Sid, I thought you were--

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.771
No way, dude.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.172
The other's are still around, too,

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:36.475
but they're all bottled up right now.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.644
They're still alive?

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:39.645
Yeah.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:40.646
Huh, that's great.

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:45.751
Look out!

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.787
What was that?

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:49.688
Is that?

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:50.789
Dharak!

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:55.294
Insolent fool, how dare he try to escape?

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:57.930
Yeah, I've got you, Sid.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.432
I always thought you were weak, Ren.

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:04.703
But I guess you finally proved me wrong.

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:06.238
Take care of him, will you?

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:08.073
Sid, what do you mean?

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.642
Don't worry about the rest of us, Ren.

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.644
Just do what you have to do, OK?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.381
Sid!

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:23.021
Time to go, Ren.

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.356
Don't do it!

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.161
Dan--

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:35.601
Ren!

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.503
Wait!

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.340
You're wasting your breath.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.774
You jerk!

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.811
Save your petty insults for the battlefield.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.557
Where'd he go?

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:01.059
Don't worry, he'll be back.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.867
REN (VOICEOVER): For so long, now,

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.036
Emperor Barodious has been promising Linehalt

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.404
and I a life in the sun.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.172
But with each battle, it seems to slip

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.741
farther and farther away.

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.776
Is he just making empty promises?

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:20.979
Or is it possible that with Exokor's upgrades now complete,

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:23.715
he will finally make our dreams come true?

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:27.185
All I need to do is defeat the brawlers to find out.

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.855
Tune in to watch me take them down.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:34.126
Wait a minute, is that Dharak and the emperor?

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:37.229
You won't steal my dream!

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:41.566
