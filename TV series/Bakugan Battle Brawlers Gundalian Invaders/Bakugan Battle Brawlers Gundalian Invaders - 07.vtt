WEBVTT

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.842
Since our return to Earth after defeating Zenoheld

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.187
environment.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.490
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.559
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
is infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.931
and is trying to take over.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.566
OK, buddy, let's do this.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.468
All right, Bakugan, brawl.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.872
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.275
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:47.380
Back against the wall, got to give it your all.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.383
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.252
The power's in your hands.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.054
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.627
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.863
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:04.931
This is Bakugan.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.703
That's just crazy.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.071
Why would I do that?

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.674
Because you're a lying, conniving Gundalian.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.142
What?

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.212
I know he told you that Neathia invaded Gundalia,

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:24.551
but the real truth is Gundalia is the one who invaded.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.553
Ren is really the enemy.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.521
Are you serious?

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.422
What?

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.356
Huh?

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.292
What are you talking about, Shun?

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.094
Tell them it isn't true.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.295
OK, Ren?

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.863
Of course, it isn't true.

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.265
She's the one who's lying.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.468
I believe that's my cue.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:46.106
At the final act, I bid you all a fond farewell.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.607
Huh?

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.642
Is he--

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.411
Don't you walk away from me.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.446
Come back and fight, Neathian.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:58.284
I do apologize, but there will be no encore performance today.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.920
Coward!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.524
Time to give it up, Ren.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.793
I don't have to take this.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:07.694
Ren.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.695
Wait!

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.499
See, he ran away.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.901
What further proof do you need that he's guilty of all

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.603
that Fabia says he is?

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.906
I don't believe you.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.007
But Ren's my--

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.343
Marucho.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.278
Ren is my friend, OK, you guys?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:28.248
He would never do anything to hurt us or Bakugan Interspace.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.148
You got it?

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.950
So knock it off.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.152
Marucho.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.087
You don't know what you're talking about, Shun.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.122
Ren is a good guy, OK?

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.592
I don't want to hear another bad word about him from anyone.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.127
Wait, Maruch.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.195
Ah, Marucho.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.269
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in True Colours.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.954
GAME SYSTEM: You have now exited Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.055
Please come again.

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.490
Are you in here, Ren?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.033
Ren?

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.468
Master Ren has run off, you say?

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.405
Yeah, I was hoping that maybe he'd come back here.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:28.274
Well, I'm afraid I haven't seen him either, sir.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.810
I wonder where he is?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.315
I've been everywhere, and I still can't find him.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.151
Gundalia is the one who invaded.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.186
I believe that's my cue.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.056
I bid you all farewell.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.524
See, he ran away.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:48.428
He's guilty of all that Fabia says he is.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.196
I don't care what Shun says.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.998
I don't believe that Ren is our enemy.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.499
If I can just find him, I know he'll

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.369
be able to explain himself.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.272
GAME SYSTEM: Confirmed, Master Marucho was here 15 minutes

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.707
47 seconds ago.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:01.608
Just missed him.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.742
Bummer.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.011
Why did you have to get so harsh with him, Shun?

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.647
It was the truth.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.883
He needed to hear it.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:15.321
We all need to hear it from the beginning.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:20.860
OK, then, I'll tell you all the real story.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.263
On my home planet of Neathia, humans and Bakugan

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.033
had lived together in peace for generations.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:30.169
But one day, hostile forces from the neighboring

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.339
planet of Gundalia invaded our cities using their Bakugan.

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:40.613
So Ren lied when he said the Neathians were the invaders?

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:41.814
Yes.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.050
I bet he was lying about everything else, too.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.752
Hm-hmm.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.254
Go on.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.890
Sadly, the Neathian army had no choice

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.192
but to use their Bakugan for defense.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.835
Destroy the enemy, Bakugan.

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:03.836
All forces advance.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.442
Unfortunately, because we had never battled before,

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.311
we were no match for the Gundalians.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.579
It didn't take long for them to gain the upper hand

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.682
and force us to our knees.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.316
So in one final desperate attempt

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.185
to save our people from enslavement,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.587
my sister, Queen Serena of Neathia,

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.857
ordered me to send out an urgent SOS message to all the world's

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:28.261
across every dimension.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.797
Oh, you're the Queen's little sis?

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:33.566
That's why she goes by the title Princess, Jake.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.069
Wow, a princess for real?

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.638
Focus on the story, Dan.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.240
Both strands are practically identical.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.542
What is that?

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.391
If you recall the unknown data we received along with Spectra

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.759
and Professor Clay.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.128
It contained a mysterious melody as well.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.496
I remember it.

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.732
None of us could figure out what it had to do with the rest

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.500
of the data at the time.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.871
Well, it was actually Princess Fabia's distress signal.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:14.607
We sent it in hopes of finding powerful bakugan

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.276
and their battlers to help us in our fight.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:25.017
I will not be beaten.

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.391
Once you defeated our digital clone,

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.293
a message with crucial battle data

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:36.162
was relayed back to us on Neathia.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.171
Princess, he received a message.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.840
It originates from a virtual environment on Earth

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.976
known as Bakugan Interspace.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.712
According to the readings, there is a bakugan there who

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.547
is powerful enough to help us.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:57.316
Your Highness, I will go and investigate.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.584
Thank you, Fabia.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:01.687
These people are Neathia's last and only hope.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:02.622
I understand.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.958
I won't let you down.

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.760
That's when I came to Earth looking for the source

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.761
of those readings.

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:16.135
So this is where the humans come to battle, Bakugan Interspace.

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:21.307
I wonder if anyone here received the message that I sent?

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:25.845
Unfortunately, for us, Ren arrived way before she did.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.713
Excuse me?

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:31.050
Would you be the Bakugan Battle Brawlers?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.353
Before we knew any better, he had us believing his lies,

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:36.189
and we ended up taking Gundalia's

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.191
side in the conflict.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.727
If you are helping Gundalia, then you are my enemy.

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:45.431
Well, then, if we're enemies, I can't let you leave.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.301
Time for us to battle.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.071
Dude, I can't believe Ren had us all fooled so badly.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.207
He made total chumps out of us.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.575
Yes.

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.343
He was a very convincing liar.

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:58.578
Even I believed him.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:02.982
That weasel.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.751
He might have fooled us, but he used Marucho and took

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.520
advantage of their friendship.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.388
Oh, that's it.

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:11.190
No one punks my friends like that.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:26.038
Well, if it isn't Mr. Big Shot.

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:28.541
I can't believe after all that work to infiltrate

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.276
the brawler's inner circle you failed

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:32.144
to bring them over to our side.

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:33.746
Useless.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:34.981
You should have just snatched them

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:39.185
up like we did with the other kids, way less hassle.

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.987
A battle of fighting under hypnosis only

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.022
performs at 75% capacity.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:46.626
We needed 100%, which meant I had to recruit them

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:49.028
of their own free will, and it was all going fine

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.930
until Princess Fabia showed up.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.500
Not that Jesse was much help in maintaining my cover.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.471
You just sat there and let her rip my credibility to shreds.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.505
Don't point fingers.

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:05.111
What's wrong, Ren?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.179
Don't tell me you started liking your little brawler

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.281
buddies for real.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:12.218
He fit in so well, he forgot who he was.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.620
Ah, how adorable.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.089
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.191
Do I need to remind you that I'm in charge

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.227
and that you work for me now?

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.029
If any of you have a problem with that,

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.830
you can take it up with Emperor Barodius.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:32.138
You might be the emperor's favorite now,

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.942
but that could quickly change, you know?

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.945
Time to get back in the game, Linehalt. Bakugan Brawl.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.950
Come on, Akwimos, we have to find Ren.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.021
What now, Ren?

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.756
A change of plans.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:53.225
We've lost our chance with the brawlers,

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.161
so we'll have to find some new recruits

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.997
to help us in our fight.

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.231
GAME SYSTEM: Attention, please.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.299
Attention, please.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.668
This is a page for Mr. Brown.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:05.604
Mr. Brown, you left your ID card in arena G18.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.385
So you remember that paging Mr.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.220
Brown was our secret codes when we

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.756
needed to meet in an emergency.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:27.360
I knew you wouldn't forget and that you'd come.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.462
I couldn't ignore an emergency call.

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.198
I think we have some unfinished business.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.167
Yeah, I know we do.

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.169
Bakugan field, open.

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:38.738
Gate card, set.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.076
Bakugan, brawl.

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:45.578
Bakugan, stand.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:48.047
Go, Aquos Akwimos.

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:50.950
Bakugan, brawl.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.586
Bakugan, stand.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:11:03.429
Rise, Darkus Linehalt. Ability activate, Razen Breaker.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.365
Ability activate.

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:07.433
Heal Blue.

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:14.907
I thought that you and I were supposed

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:16.909
to be really good friends, Ren.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.277
Yeah, we were.

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.613
Ability activate.

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.148
Full take [inaudible].

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:30.122
If that's true, then how could you

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.190
possibly deceive me like that?

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.525
Tell me.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.761
It wasn't supposed to happen.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.696
Ability activate.

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:38.798
Spiral Pressure.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.138
Not a bad shot, but my power level

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:48.140
is still much higher than yours.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.608
Oh, try this.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.510
Gate card open.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.978
Battle release.

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:56.282
Command card battle release halts all battles.

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:57.750
Not so fast.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.985
Ability activate.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:00.986
Ice Crasher.

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:15.901
No, Akwimos.

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.939
GAME SYSTEM: Marucho life force, 40%.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.908
I just realized we've never battled each other

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.077
before, have we, friend?

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:27.546
I must admit I always thought we might

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:30.649
face each other in battle, but not

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:34.153
under circumstances like these.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.622
Sorry to disappoint you.

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:37.857
Gate card set.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:40.159

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.160
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.834
Huh?

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.069
What's wrong, Marucho?

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.338
Let's fight.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.841
Come on, Akwimos, let's win this.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:56.809
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:57.877

Shadow Pincer.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:27.573
Not too bad.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.508
Gate card open.

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:30.509
Element merge.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:36.448
Oh, no.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:41.320
Akwimos' power level is being absorbed.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.589
I wonder when Marucho's going to come back?

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:45.357
He's probably looking for Ren.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.059
Maybe we should go after him?

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:47.993
Good idea.

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.895
I think you should come too, Shun.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.530
Wait a minute.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.666
Huh?

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:54.767
Take a look at this.

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.305
What?

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:01.807
Ren and Marucho are battling each other.

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.542
Well, this could get interesting.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:04.610
Yep.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.047
Ability activate.

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:10.516
Water?

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:14.587
Yep, Akwimos is second to no one in the water.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:41.013
Get out of there, Linehalt. Battle gear time.

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:45.751
GAME SYSTEM: Ready Boomix.

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.923

GAME SYSTEM: Ready Gigarth.

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:13.946
Let's do this.

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.514

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.109
You brought your power level back?

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:46.111
I told you that Akwimos couldn't be beaten

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:48.347
when it came to water combat.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.984
OK, battle gear ability activate.

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:52.985
Gigarth Pointer.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.491

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:10.002
GAME SYSTEM: Ren life force 40%.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.003
Marucho.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:19.278
Whoa, they're tied.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.680
This next round will decide it for sure.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.584
Gate card set.

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:28.053

Bakugan, stand.

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:34.293
Bakugan, brawl.

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.294
Bakugan, stand.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.134
This is it, Marucho.

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:44.870
Come on, bring it on, friend.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.072

Akwimos.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.085
Ren's battling really hard.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.820
That lying creep.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.321
That dude has no heart.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.090
Not only did he betray little Maruch.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.959
But now he's rubbing his face in it.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.194
I have to do this.

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:43.929
My people are counting on me.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.201

Power [inaudible].

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.281
I suppose you think you're clever using a command

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:38.884
card that sucks up 500 points from the opponent's

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:42.421
power level, but I have to tell you, I am not impressed.

Battle gear ability activate, Boomix lock.

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:51.129
I can't believe you, Ren.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.299
I treated you like a brother, and you stabbed me in the back.

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:55.968
I'll never make that mistake again.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.770
It wasn't supposed to be personal.

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:03.709
There are things at stake here you wouldn't understand.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.312
I trusted you, Ren.

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:09.448
Brawlers welcomed you in to our family.

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:14.820

[cheering]

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:56.161
I knew you were good, Marucho, but I

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:59.665
had no idea you were that good.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:02.234
We're coming for you next time, Drago.

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.237
Whoa, man, did he just speak?

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.940
So you've been lying about your true identity

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.375
as well, Linehalt?

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.811
Marucho, we can still be friends.

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.880
Leave the brawlers and come with us.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.950
Get lost.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.820
You must take me for a fool it you think I'd ever go with you.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.790
I would never leave my family for a dishonest poser like you,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.791
you got me?

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:36.201
Marucho, very well.

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:41.340
As of now, our friendship is completely over, Marucho.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.308
Ah.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:44.309
What the?

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.277
Whoa.

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.783
So this is how you really look?

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.922
The next time we meet, we'll be enemies.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.327
Ren.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.935
Now that we knew the truth about Ren's identity,

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:12.471
Fabia thought it would be safe to replace our digital clone

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.306
bakugan with the original ones.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.908
Everyone was excited to be battling with real bakugan

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.011
partners once again, although it was going to take

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.178
a little getting used to.

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:22.047
Meanwhile, the battlers that were kidnapped

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:23.949
by the Gundalian's were ordered by Ren

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:25.417
to challenge us to a brawl.

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.152
They came at us pretty fast and hard,

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:28.420
but we were ready for them.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.856
Tune in to see how we take care of these zombie kids.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.391
Let's go, Hawktor.

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.159
Bakugan, brawl.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:37.029
Let's see how the real you battle.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:40.766
