DAN KUSO: After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan Interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.555
Now Earth and Neathia were united

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.658
in the struggle to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred .

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.431
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.667
Bakugan, brawl!

(SINGING) What are you going to do?

The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.183
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.818
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.554
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.430
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.865

I admit, I'm impressed by your moxie

in coming here to face me.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.033
Too bad your arrogance will be your downfall.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.469
Dharak is the only one worthy of holding

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.172
the powers of Dragonoid Colossus,

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.875
so it's time that you hand them over.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.109
Fat chance.

We only came to this stink hole for one reason.

Where's Jake?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.182
We want him back.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.817
And here I thought you would come

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.819
to fight for the big prize.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.554
What do you mean?

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:38.124
It is pathetic how you place your loyalty to your teammates

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.827
before your own personal glory.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.930
You've got some messed up priorities, dude.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.901
Nothing in this world is worth betraying your teammates for.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.836
You foolish child.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:54.307
You don't even understand the scope of the incredible powers

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.341
you possess.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.709
Really?

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.810
You want to bet?

Evolved or not, he's no match for me.

Then why are you still standing there?

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.489
Ugh, you're the one who's afraid.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.959

What are you talking about?

MAN: I mean that Drago and Dharak are equally matched,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.935
and this fight can go either way.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:18.704
Need I remind you how critical it is that you

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.473
and Drago win this battle?

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.308
He is the only one who can protect

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.910
the power of the Sacred Orb.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.112
If it falls into the hands of Barodius,

then the universe is doomed.

Your power levels may have increased--

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:46.766
But you still don't have what it takes to defeat Dharak.

What's that?

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.869
You do not possess the killer instinct that

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.904
is required to be number one.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.973
I still don't think they understand.

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:56.475

Get up.

You like that?

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.765
Why do you continue to waste my time

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.301
with these puny counterattacks?

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:56.569
Incredible.

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:59.005
I hate to say it, but we can be in trouble, buddy.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.406
I don't understand.

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:03.809
Even with my increased powers, I barely made a scratch on him.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.679
As I said before, just because you possess

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.648
the power of the Orb doesn't mean you have

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:12.018
the guts to harness it properly, which is why I plan to take it.

It's Drago.

Dan!

00:09:57.663 --> 00:10:02.001
We can't lose the power of the Sacred Orb, Drago.

The power of the Sacred Orb will finally be ours, Dharak.

We can't forget our part of the mission.

We have to rescue the others from the lab.

Let's go.

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.413
Wait a second.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.349
I think it's important that our group splits up again.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:24.483
But why?

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:26.485
Yeah, why?

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:30.156
We no longer have the element of surprise on our side.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:31.390
We are undermanned.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.193
But if Kazarina is expecting us, then our best bet

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:38.297
is to hit her from two sides, and hopefully the distraction

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:40.566
will give us a fighting chance.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.903
I understand your logic, but it still sounds risky.

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:46.272
That may be so, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.473
How do we--

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:50.309
Princess Fabia and I will pair up and go one way,

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.545
and you two will go the other way.

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.780
Perfect.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.451
I'm taking you down!

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:03.856
[dramatic music]

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.359
Dharak.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:13.866
OK, I admit, that one had some bite to it, but not enough.

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:14.967
Thunder Probe!

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.808
He just won't stay down.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.510
Then we hit him harder.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.612
Let's see how you like this one.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.881
Evil Blast!

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:29.949
I got you.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:33.285
Shooting Flamer!

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.186
Oh yeah!

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.122
That's the way, Drago.

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:39.258
Dharak, focus on the mobile assault vehicle

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:40.593
and take it out first.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:41.761
No problem.

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.329

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.939
Oh snap, he took out the Jakalier.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.377
Now I'm really mad.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:12:59.278
Me too.

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:02.715
But we can still take this.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:06.051
COMPUTER: Ready, Axator.

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:10.022
Battle gear boost!

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:15.094
[dramatic music]

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.767
Let's finish this.

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:24.336
Battle gear ability activate!

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:25.905
Axator.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:27.072
Engage!

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.441
Another shiny new toy?

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.477
It makes no difference, Dharak.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.912
Finish him off or good.

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:36.849
This one's going to hurt.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:41.854
[dramatic music]

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:47.826
Do you hear bells too?

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:50.563
Yeah, dude.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:53.799
Now do you finally understand that I am far

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:56.402
more powerful than you, Drago?

00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:01.040
Evolved or not, you will never be mighty enough to defeat me.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.543
I think I have more than demonstrated that to you today.

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:06.212
I don't understand this.

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.380
If the power's entrusted to me, and we're

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.183
supposed to be strong enough to protect the Sacred Orb,

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:13.552
then why can't they help me take Dharak down?

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:16.355
MAN: The powers I gave you are just a starting point.

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.890
You may have changed in appearance

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.693
and gained some power, but your true evolution

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.595
has yet to happen.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:26.232
But I already feel so different.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.933
Tell us what we have to do so that Drago

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.201
can be fully evolved.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:32.304
We'll do whatever it takes.

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:35.674
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.476
Your time is up, Drago.

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:41.847
Bring it.

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:44.049
I know you fancy yourself a shining beacon

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.584
for all that is good in the universe,

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:47.620
but there is something you must realize,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.823
darkness will always swallow light.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:53.659
Maybe I haven't evolved because I'm not worthy enough

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:54.927
to protect the Sacred Orb.

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:55.995
Hold on!

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:57.730
You can't give up yet, buddy.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.799
We can still win this thing, I promise.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.534
We have to win this thing.

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:05.604
The fate of the entire universe depends on us, dude.

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:06.872
Dan.

00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:09.541
We've won before without these new powers of yours.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:13.045
All we need to do to believe in each other and no one

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.313
can beat us.

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.949
Maybe he's right.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.717
Finish him now.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:22.788
Take a look around, Drago, because the world is you

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:25.524
know it is about to disappear.

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:28.661
Drago, let's teach these clowns a lesson

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.530
and show them what working as a team can do.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.831
I believe in you, buddy.

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.100
But even more than that, I believe in us.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.269
Do you understand?

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:38.337
Yes.

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.339
I think I do.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.841
Believe in our combined strength.

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.176
I do.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:47.279
I believe.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.480
Believe that you're doomed.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:56.955
I believe in the power we have together.

Huh?

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:07.132
What's this?

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:14.873
It's a brand new ability card.

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:18.544
MAN: This is a sign that Drago's latest evolution is complete.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.445
Evolution?

How do you mean?

MAN: A bakugan cannot fully evolve

unless they connect on a soulful level with their battler.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.252
The belief you and Drago have in each other

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.254
has allowed him to achieve this.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.490
My true evolution.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.092
Awesome sauce.

If you're finished with all this nonsense about feelings,

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:48.907
then let's fight.

Glad we're in agreement.

00:16:57.249 --> 00:17:00.386
Your true evolution is truly pathetic.

MAN\" The key to bakugan evolution at this stage

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:18.437
isn't the amount of power one possesses,

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.906
but how they use that power to connect with others.

What?

Seriously?

Dharak.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.932
Why so surprised, Drago?

I am the most powerful bakugan.

Silence!

You did it, Drago!

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:08.747
No, Dan, we did it together.

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:10.549
That was incredible.

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.417
I've never seen Dharak lose before.

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.323
We beat you.

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:20.125
Yes you did, brawler.

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.593
So what is it that you want?

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.829
Tell me.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:24.730
Simple.

We want our pal Jake back.

OK.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.468
Why not.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.770
Go ahead and take him.

Jake!

I should warn you, he may be a little hard to handle.

Jake, it's me.

We came to get you and bring you home with us.

You're wrong.

Gundalia is my home.

What are you talking about?

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.793
This isn't your home, buddy.

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:55.694
Sorry, Dan.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:56.695
You're mistaken.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.070
Jake, what are you doing?

This Bakugan Biological Research Center

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:30.228
sounds like a really terrifying place to me.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:31.730
I'd rather not be going there.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.305
Oh look, it appears we have a welcoming party.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.240
Tell me, Nurzak, are you bringing

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:46.278
Princess Fabia as a peace offering to the emperor?

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:49.414
I think maybe Nurzak is looking for payback,

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:51.016
so these two are in kahoots.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.488
Clever you, Stoica.

No more talking then.

Let the battle begin.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.332
[dramatic music]

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.434
The sneak attack Nurzak and I were planning on Kazarina's lab

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:10.569
didn't go so well.

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.304
She and Stoica ambushed us and we

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.873
found ourselves in a heated battle behind enemy lines.

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:17.109
It was weird to fight alongside Nurzak after having

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.577
him as my foe for so long.

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.679
But somehow, we managed to make it work.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.581
Maybe it has something to do with the sad story

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.583
he told me about how we both lost loved

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:26.184
ones to this horrible war.

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:27.552
Tune in and see for yourself.

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:29.454
It's pretty intense stuff.

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.790
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:36.028
Who knew that mortal enemies could have so much in common.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:40.365
