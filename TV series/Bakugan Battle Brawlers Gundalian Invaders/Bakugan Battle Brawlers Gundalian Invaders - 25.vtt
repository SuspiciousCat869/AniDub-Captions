to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

Oh man, they're getting pummelled!

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.085
Stay strong Linehalt.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:47.987
Ability activate!

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:50.189
Gigarth Ray!

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.190
Hah!

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.097
I find it very curious that Linehalt hasn't shown

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.432
us his forbidden power yet.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.934
We've certainly given him enough opportunity.

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:03.936
Perhaps we need to push a little harder?

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:07.974
Or perhaps, he never possessed the power in the first place.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:11.177
My father may have been a superstitious old fool,

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.545
but he was no coward.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.715
If Linehalt and his kind didn't possess the forbidden power,

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:17.950
then he wouldn't have gone to such great lengths

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.819
to keep them away hidden in the darkness.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:20.820
Huh?

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:26.158
We need to capture Linehalt and give him to Kazarina.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.527
I'm sure her methods will reveal

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:30.229
what's really inside of him.

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:31.263
Thunder Probe!

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.167
[roar]

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.103
REN: Linehalt!

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.010
[groaning]

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.211
Ren!

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.513
Are you OK?

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:49.715
It's time for us to step in Dan.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.584
I'm with you Drago buddy.

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:54.387
I know Ren went bad there for a little while but--

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.554
Say no more.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.723
He's our friend and we need to help him.

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:58.758
Stay out of this!

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:00.126
Huh?

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.127
Linehalt?

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.196
Please, if you really want to help,

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.866
let us finish this ourselves.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.401
But you guys are really banged up and--

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.402
Huh?

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:12.972
(WEAKLY) Dan.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.107
Linehalt is right.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.008
P-please.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.009
But Ren.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.950
Fine, I get you pal.

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:26.185
This is your score.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:28.387
And you need to settle it.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.122
Thanks for understanding.

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.023
Let's go.

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:33.225
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.960
Bakugan stand!

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.162
We can do this Linehalt!

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:37.163
Hah!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.071
Our future is finally in our hands Linehalt!

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.376
We got to watch their backs, Drago buddy.

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:53.412
[tense music]

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:06.392
Oh Sacred Orb, I humbly ask you to protect those

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:08.160
who are fighting to protect us.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:15.501
Where have those rodents scurried away to?

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:16.469
That's it.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.470
Hold still.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.012
Why don't you just show yourselves, you cowards?

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:29.014
Ability activate!

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.282
Exodus Waver.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.055
Hold tight Ren.

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:38.491
Blast them out of the sky Dharak.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.360
Gladly Let's try my new favorite toy.

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.544

[screaming]

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.939
Ren, no!

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:27.940
Dude.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.277
(WEAKLY) We're OK.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.212
Yeah, don't worry.

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:34.280
[ground shakes]

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.081
It is clear that a Bakugan as powerful

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.984
as Linehalt is wasted on a battler like Ren.

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:41.720
Even after all these years, he still hasn't

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.789
learned to use the switch code.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.325
What's he talking about?

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.294
I thought you had promise Ren.

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:52.331
That's why I gave you so many chances.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:55.834
Obviously, that was an error in judgment on my part.

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:58.837
There is nothing special about you at all.

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.209
No matter.

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:07.146
Your pathetic dream of living in the sunshine is over Ren.

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.815
You have nothing but darkness in your future.

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.016
LINEHALT: Don't listen to him!

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.017
Huh?

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.020
Linehalt?

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.823
Even as a young boy, you believed it was possible.

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:21.227
You could see what even I was blind to.

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.863
Well, if a creature of light can live down here,

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:28.067
then does that mean we can live up there above ground?

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.668
Don't get your hopes up Ren.

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:32.004
They want us to stay here.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.372
I know they do.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:37.509
But maybe one day, it will be possible.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.311
It was your vision that helped us get

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.813
through those horrible times.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.716
We can't give up on our dream Ren!

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.985
Not now.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.019
Not ever!

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.221
What!

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:53.125
That is the forbidden power!

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.194
[roaring]

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.597
No, Linehalt!

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.699
[screaming]

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.672
[screaming]

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:11.310
What the- What's happening?

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.878
Hold steady!

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.480
[screaming]

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.217
I've never seen such power.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.825
DRAGO: Whatever this is, it's going to rip the planet in two!

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:28.193
I know!

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.361
Linehalt, stop it.

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:31.363
Stop it!

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:32.931
[roaring]

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:43.208
The energy wave is gaining in strength sir.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.111
At this rate, the third shield won't hold much longer.

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.181
Commander Elright, something is happening with the Sacred Orb.

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.250
And Queen Serena hasn't returned from the shrine.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.151
Come on!

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.152
Let's go!

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.893
Sacred Orb, what's wrong?

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.195
Queen Serena, we have to leave.

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:14.440
[explosion]

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.976
Is that what I think it is?

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.078
Yes.

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.814
The Orb's last defense, Dragonoid Colossus.

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:38.597
[roaring]

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.000
Did you see that?

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.202
I think so.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:48.607
[crash]

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:50.709
[screaming]

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.681
[groaning]

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:08.060
(WEAKLY) Linehalt

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.429
Are you OK Dharak?

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:13.699
Yes.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.467
But that one really hurt.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.568
What was that thing?

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.373
Give me a status report Gill.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:24.743
GILL: Well sire, we've sustained significant damage.

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:33.252
[keening]

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:37.356
Interesting.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.304
[groan]

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:53.772
Are your ears still ringing too?

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:54.773
Yep.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.711
Prepare to transport us.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:00.779
GILL: Right away, sire.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.951
Dan!

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:06.985
Are you OK?

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:07.986
Dude!

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.457
ALL: Whoa!

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.093
[gasp]

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.429
The Gundalians are retreating.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.534
Linehalt's forbidden power is even greater

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:23.836
than I had imagined.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.171
But what's more impressive is that winged creature that

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.107
came in and snuffed it out.

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:31.110
It reminds me of a bedtime story that my father used

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.111
to tell me about a guardian spirit

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.948
that protected the Sacred Orb.

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:36.949
[keening]

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:39.017
The Sacred Orb must not be violated.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.620
To any who ignore this, suffering will follow.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.890
Those are the words that your father spoke.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.292
BARODIUS (VOICEOVER): Either I've opened Pandora's box

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:49.561
or stumbled onto the greatest treasure ever.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:55.634
Ren, are you OK?

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:56.869
Never been better.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.071
I finally figured it out.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.105
What are you talking about?

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.106
Figured what out?

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:06.411
The truth about my duties as a dark protector.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:08.947
I'm supposed to keep Linehalt from unleashing

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:11.650
his forbidden power in a destructive manner.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.219
What forbidden power?

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:19.291
It's something I've been cursed with as a dark Bakugan.

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:23.095
It's not your fault Linehalt. It's mine for not understanding

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.163
what my duties were.

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.666
I promise it won't happen again.

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:30.536
How could we know better if no one ever told us?

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.538
It doesn't matter.

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:37.543
It was my responsibility, and I failed everyone.

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:40.245
He was right to hide us away.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:44.850
We must live in seclusion for the sake of everyone's safety.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.585
Yes Ren.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.121
Goodbye my friends.

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.022
Hey Ren!

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.089
Hold up.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.058
You guys are not going anywhere.

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:54.560
Huh?

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.896
Well a power like that can also do a lot of good

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:00.299
when it's used against the forces of evil.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:01.667
He's right.

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:04.970
You can be a great partner in the fight against Barodius.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.939
You just need to learn to control

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.640
your newfound power Ren.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.675
Yeah dude.

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:11.810
And I'll help you just like these guys

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.612
helped me, back when I was learning

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.781
to become a Battle Brawler.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.449
We'll all help you.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.918
That's what real friends are for Ren.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.788
But it's more than I deserve from you guys.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:23.855
Don't be silly.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.557
That stuff is all water under the bridge.

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:26.558
[laugh]

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:31.697
How weird.

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:33.799
I was kind of getting used to your other look.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:40.138
[all laugh]

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:47.946
Ren, look.

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:48.947
Huh?

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:09.568
Dan and the others may have welcomed Ren back to the team,

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.570
but I can't bring myself to do it.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.139
I won't forgive him for his part in what the Gundalians

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.807
have put my people through.

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:18.910
And to be honest, I'm not even sure he can be trusted anyway.

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.446
So I'm going to challenge him to a battle.

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.815
We'll see if he really is a changed person

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.151
or if he's just continuing his charade.

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.819
Tune in yourself to see what I find

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.821
out in the heat of the battle.

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.290
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.658
Come on Aranaut!

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.960
It's time to get even for everything Ren and

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.695
the Gundalians inflicted on us!

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:41.466
