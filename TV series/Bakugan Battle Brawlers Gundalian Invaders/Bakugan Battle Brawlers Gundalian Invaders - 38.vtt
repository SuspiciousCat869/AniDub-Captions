DAN: After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan Interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.383
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home,

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.884
so we could help with the fight.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.839
If we hit them with a coordinated attack,

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.974
there's no way we can lose.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:45.311
The outcome of this battle is irrelevant.

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.482
Keep the brawlers occupied while I go and get what we came for.

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.355
Enjoy your play time.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:57.390
I'll be back soon.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.732
Barodius!

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.234
Out of my way fool!

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:12.304
You're the fool if you think we're going to let you by.

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:13.305
Now Aranaut!

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:19.745
Don't trifle with me!

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.780
Barrow Laia!

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.680
Huh?

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.450
Thunder Gladiator!

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.018
[screaming]

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:32.324
Princess!

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:39.532
(WEAKLY) Aranaut, we can't let him get past us.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.533
Keep fighting!

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:45.671
Fabia!

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.973
It looks like Barodius is headed

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.842
for the Neathian royal palace!

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.511
He must be going after the Sacred Orb!

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:54.180
We have to stop him.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.982
Dan, leave Dharak to me and the others.

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.752
You and Dragonoid Colossus should go after Barodius.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.120
Sounds good.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.322
Just watch your back, he fights dirty.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:04.690
[roaring]

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:08.761
Don't worry Dan.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.362
SHUN: We've got Drago's back.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.263
Thanks!

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:12.898
I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.339
I don't know if Dan and Drago should separate.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.041
Don't sweat it Dude.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.709
Whether they're together or apart,

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.278
those two always fight as a solid unit.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:30.349
[roar]

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:34.120
Still on your foolish quest?

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.289
I thought I had gotten rid of you old man.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:40.726
I warned you, time and time again, that pursuing the Sacred

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.229
Orb would end badly for you.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.531
Didn't I Barodius?

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:48.834
I'm losing my patience.

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.803
That's not all you'll lose.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.071
Now Sabator!

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.172
[roar]

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:58.043
Acid Bubble!

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:58.944
[crazed laughter]

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.679
Nice one Lythirus.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.615
Couldn't have played that better myself.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:05.885
Sabator!

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:09.822
You will pay!

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:18.831
Will you never learn fool?

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.267
Face it dude.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.468
You're toast.

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:25.371
There's no way you can take on all of us and win!

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.273
This is the end Dharak!

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.440
SHUN: Get ready everyone.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.075
DRAGO: Don't hold anything back.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.646
ALL: Ability activate!

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.647
Crush Arrow!

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.351
Bolting Fang Combat Shot!

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.655
Spiral Pressure!

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.689
Razen Breaker!

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:46.425
Dual Fernum!

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:51.864
Tempest Shield.

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:56.802
[gasp]

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:01.540
Now what?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.909
Let me think.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.910
Hmm.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.513
Let me know what you come up with.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:08.781
Barrow Laia!

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:10.950
Where'd he go?

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.622
Don't let him get away buddy!

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:17.623
Not a chance!

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:20.059
Chaos Magnalia!

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.395
Huh?

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:24.730
End of the line!

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.699
Hold on tight Dan!

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.300
[screaming]

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:47.486
Let's get in on the Kuso blasting action, Lythirus.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:48.554
Acid Bubble!

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.359
Come on hang in there buddy!

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:54.693
My eyes!

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.061
They burn!

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.663
Well done Lythirus.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:58.764
Don't let go.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.668
Dan, you'll need to go ahead on your own.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.037
What?

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.038
Are you crazy?

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:09.808
Whoa!

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.510
Hey, you're cutting a little close!

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.146
[screaming]

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.815
How could you betray us?

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:19.785
Protect the Sacred Orb at all costs Dan!

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.254
[screaming]

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.882
[screaming]

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.150
Hey, you halt!

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.158
Where did Dharak get to?

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:01.160
Ah man!

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.061
Spiral Pressure!

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:03.495
Too late fish boy!

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:04.496
Lavolta!

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.570
Why'd you call me fish boy?

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:16.742
Marucho!

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.711
I'll get you for that Dharak.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.112
Darkness Shaker!

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:39.932
[screaming]

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:46.939
[explosion] - Huh?

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:47.940
Barodius!

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.245
What--

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.381
Which way to the Queen's private quarters?

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.817
Let's go Hawktor!

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.018
You got it.

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.220
I'm ready to rock!

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.521
Just say the word.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.461
Photon Gladiator!

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.208
Whoa!

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:24.410
What happened?

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.445
(WEAKLY) Please help the queen.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.813
What?

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:28.781
You have to hurry!

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.249
He's headed for the throne room.

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:38.891
Why don't you show me some of that forbidden power

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:40.259
you possess?

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:44.563
You know the only chance you have to beat me is to use it.

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:47.699
The cost of using the forbidden power is too high.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.802
I swore I would never use it again!

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.104
Then I guess we have nothing left to discuss.

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.238
Linehalt!

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.206
Get back!

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.207
Evil Bind!

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.118
No.

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.119
Linehalt.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.993
Halt now!

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:16.028
You heard what he said!

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:17.029
Intruder!

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:47.526
So we meet at last.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.561
I am your new emperor.

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:50.696
Barodius.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.597
Finally!

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.565
We get some alone time Drago.

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:03.175
Only one of us will be standing when this is over,

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:04.710
and it won't be you!

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.111
We'll see about that.

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.446
I guarantee it!

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.951
How would you like to proceed?

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.854
Would you prefer to surrender before or after

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.656
I take the Sacred Orb?

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:21.260
You're insane if you think that's going to happen.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.162
It most certainly will.

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:26.532
The only question is whether or not you are

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:29.134
smart enough to stop resisting.

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:32.104
This isn't a request my lady.

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.739
It's an order!

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.476
Listen to me.

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:39.478
If you want to take the Sacred Orb,

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:44.216
you're going to have to go through me first, Barodius.

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:45.884
OK.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.419
That can easily be arranged.

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:57.663
Leave her alone!

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:58.664
Barodius!

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.577
[intense music]

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:14.580
What?

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.030
Where am I?

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.835
Are you OK Dan?

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.737
Drago.

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:41.974
I feel a tremendous energy around us.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:42.975
Huh?

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.111
Dharak!

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.245
Barodius!

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.348
What's happening here?

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:51.283
I have no idea.

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.854
Greetings.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:21:01.059
I am Code Eve, the Mother Light of all Bakugan.

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:09.401
DAN: Just when Drago and I were about to go toe

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:12.004
to toe with Barodius and Dharak, something funky happened

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.006
and we got hit by this big blast of light.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.041
Next thing we know, we're face to face with something

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:17.676
called Code Eve!

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.278
Anyhow, she starts telling us about the origin of the Bakugan

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.947
and how the original Bakugan DNA is

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:25.350
part of the most powerful being of all, the Ultimate Warrior.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.185
That's when things started to get really nutty,

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.621
and we found ourselves in a final battle against Barodius.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:32.491
Tune in to see how all the fierce action went down!

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.960
This one's easily the most intense point of our life.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.695
Check it out for yourself.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.031
