DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.649
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.051
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.156
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.692
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.928
Lucky for us, we have Colossus Dragon on our side.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:32.165
Barodius and the Twelve Orders, you're destined for defeat.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.299
Now Drago!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.901
Bakugan brawl!

(SINGING) What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.778
Backed against the wall, gotta give it your all.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:45.678
Ah, ah.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:46.579
Ah, ah.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.480
Ah, ah.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.848
This is the final stand. Ah, ah.

Ah, ah.

Ah, ah.

The power's in your hands.

Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.396
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.800
This is Bakugan.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.868
We're calling it a day, kids, and declaring

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.403
this battle a draw.

AIRZEL: What?

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.741
What's happening?

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.178
Strikeflier, where are you?

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.379
Come on, Jake.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.080
We should split while they're still distracted.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.082
You bet.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.788
I'm frozen.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.890
Can't move.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.194
No one turns me into a Popsicle.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.496
Ha ha, way to put him on ice, Maruch.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.200
You think Dan will be in the clear now?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.836
I don't know, but I sure hope so.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.271
We've gotta keep our fingers crossed.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.207

We're not far.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.294
Hopefully, Marucho and the others

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.630
are keeping the Gundalians busy.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.965
Don't worry about Marucho.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.366
He's got our backs.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.002
Even so, he won't be able to hold off their forces forever.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.070
We need to keep moving.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.404

Why are we stopping?

Don't you see the giant lake in front of you?

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.688
Come on, dude, what's the big deal?

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.757
Don't you remember, we can walk on water here.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.727
I'm not sure this is the same as the sacred spring.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.898
Come on, as long as we're pure of heart, we'll be fine.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.199
Um, wait, Dan.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.934
Pure of heart!

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.669
It's just a regular lake.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.637
Huh?

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.673

Almost there, almost there, almost there!

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.177
But how is he--

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.180
And once again, hardcore!

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.888
Seize the day!

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.757
I think I'll try something else.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:24.737
Well, that was a very impressive

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.105
way of crossing a river.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.373
Thanks.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.776
He was talking to Shun.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.778
You ready, Fabia?

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:32.779
Thanks.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:37.850
Not bad.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.552
We all made it across, but I think

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.155
I get extra points for style.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.156
You wish.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:55.401
So Jesse, just like the rest of your incompetent teammates,

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.638
you get one final chance to prove yourself.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:03:59.606
Worry not.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.507
In all great dramas, a hero must go

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.880
to achieve his redemption.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.582
Why did I get stuck with him?

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.254
Guys, make sure you watch out for blooming buttercups.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.723
What's a blooming buttercup?

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:17.957

Ah!

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.662
They're a species of giant carnivorous flowers

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:23.830
that grow here.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.098
You mean like that one?

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.768
What a stupid name for a man-eating plant!

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.169
Wait, hold on, Dan!

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:40.546
Absolutely no overgrown weed is gonna have me for lunch!

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.015
All right, Shun.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.783

Do me a favor next time and warn me

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.906
before I step on something that might eat me, OK?

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:07.807
What for?

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.108
You handled that really well.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.377
I'd even give you extra points for style.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.578
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.847
Fabia says the generator is just over that ridge.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.250
Awesome.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.485
The sooner I get out of this stinking jungle,

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.689
the happier I'll be.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.957
What's going on here?

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:25.958
Gundalians!

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.234
We found you.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.469
It's Stoica.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.370
And Jesse.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.304
Play it cool.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:39.605
They don't know what we're after.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.275
Our comrades on the front line suspected

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.377
your forces might be a decoy.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.812
Looks like they were right.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:53.619
So now the real question is what are you really doing out here?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.622
Tell us, what is your motivation?

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.523
This stinks.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:58.958
We're so close.

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:02.995
Relax, Dan, we still have one trick left.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.833
It's time we use the secondary decoy strategy, OK?

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.334
It's all on you there, pal.

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.340
Fight hard.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.341
Hmm.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.681
Huh?

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:22.682
What?

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:27.286
We lost a cast member.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.554
Yeah, yeah, who cares.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:31.624
We'll have our hands full enough with the other two.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:34.327
If the little coward wants to run, then let him.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:37.897
He'll have his own teammates to deal with after we defeat them.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.633
Out with it, brawlers, tell us the real reason

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.936
you're wandering around the Neathian jungle.

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:48.207
Oh, we were just looking for some Gundalian cockroaches

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:49.342
to stomp.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:54.881
My, my, my, aren't you a cocky little boy.

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.282
Wait, hold on.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:58.985
These guys are ours first, Dan.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.288
Yes, I have a score to settle with Plitheon on behalf

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:05.124
of the Castle Knights.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.327
You're a real glutton for punishment, Aranaut.

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.631
When will you realize you've got no chance of beating me?

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.366
Now who's the cocky one?

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.768
Well, this should be interesting.

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:19.572
Go and get him, Jesse.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:20.873
Gate card set.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:29.582
And now the curtain rises on our first act.

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:30.817
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:36.689
Bakugan stand!

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.191
Rise, Ventus Plitheon.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.598
Get ready to feel some pain!

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.670
Here we go.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.039
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.440
Bakugan stand!

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.309
Go, Haos Aranaut.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.444
The Castle Knights will be avenged!

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.718
Victory will be ours, princess.

Come on, tough guy!

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.399
This is going to be fun.

[exertion sounds]

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.344
Hold on, where did you go?

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:34.146
Now, you see me, now you don't!

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:39.418
Wow, I'm having trouble keeping up with the action.

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:42.421
They don't look so fast to me.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.390
[exertion sounds]

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:50.997
Ability activate, Mirage Fist!

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.573
You'll pay for that!

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.041
You sure?

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:03.976
Looks like you're finished to me.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.112
Don't be so sure.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:12.685
All right, gate card open, Ansamon Judgment.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.121
What is happening?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.256
The command card Ansamon Judgment

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:21.594
leads all Bakugan who aren't Ventus to their demise.

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.563
Surrender to the slumber.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:25.064
[exertion sounds]

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.233
No, Aranaut!

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.804
FABIA (VOICEOVER): We have to maintain the illusion, Aranaut!

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.515
Watch out, Dan.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:45.051
Once Jesse is done with Fabia, I'll be taking

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.686
your precious Drago as well.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:50.523
Ability activate, Valkyrie Fist.

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:53.526
[exertion sounds]

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.462
[thud]

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.230
[crackling]

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.198
What?

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.167
I've just destroyed your gate card,

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.236
which means that Aranaut's power level has returned to normal.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.939
Come on, Jesse.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:10.843
Ability activate, Drake Twister.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.044
Let's take a spin.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.886
Let's go with the flow.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:24.590
Princess!

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.394
Ability activate, Spiral Glowdown!

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.997
[exertion sounds]

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.003
Ah!

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.981
Score one for the Castle Knights.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.517
Nice one, Fabia.

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:54.186
So Dan, are you ready to fight me yet?

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:58.157
Gate card set!

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.126
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.227
Bakugan stand!

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.596
Come on, Aranaut, let's hit 'em hard again.

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:04.897
With pleasure!

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.899
[exertion sounds]

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:07.900
Let's do this!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.936
Just finish this, will you, please?

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.204
I'm ready to fight.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:15.908
Enough talking.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.843
It's time to get back to business.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:23.282
As the lights dim, it signals the beginning of--

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:24.984
I can't wait any longer.

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:27.153
Now it's my turn to battle.

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:29.789
Bakugan brawl.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.323
Bakugan stand.

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:34.493
Rise, Aquos Lythirus.

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.395
[laughing]

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:39.065
You're doomed!

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:43.069
Ability activate, Merfolk!

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:44.537
[whooshing]

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.105
[groans]

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.245
Ability activate, Mirage Fist.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:57.616
Lights out.

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:58.617
Ah!

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.162
I see you.

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:12.732
Ability activate, Eel Weakness.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.970
But how?

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.309
They nullified our ability.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.511
How observant.

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:29.115
OK, ability activate, Mirage Jet!

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.521
Princess, we're running out of options here.

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.256
Something feels off here.

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:38.491
From what I've heard about Dan, it

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.025
doesn't seem like him to take such

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:43.028
a backseat while his teammates are outnumbered two to one.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.630
It's like they're trying to distract us.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.399
Keep them busy, Aranaut.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.236
You cannot escape.

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:51.971
That's it, isn't it?

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:55.508
You're trying to trick me, aren't you?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.911
STOICA (VOICEOVER): Why won't you say something?

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.347
DAN (VOICEOVER): Hurry, Shun, I think they're on to us.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:09.555
[exertion sounds]

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.673
I need to keep moving.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:28.674
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.746
Bakugan stand!

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:40.920
Finish them, Ventus Plitheon Ability

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.455
activate, Fly Destroyer.

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:52.264
Gate card open, Solomon Sabreur.

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.171
Ready Battle Crusher.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.310
Battle gear boost!

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:16.956
What?

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:19.291
You're not afraid of a little battle gear, are you?

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:21.126
Afraid?

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:23.662
Command card Solomon Sabreur is a cards that's

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:25.631
unique only to Castle Knights.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.566
It nullifies the opponents abilities

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.135
and decreases all of their power levels.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:33.305
The Castle Knights have their very own command card?

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:36.075
Yes, and on top of everything I just mentioned,

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.310
it also merges with Aranaut's Battle Gear,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.647
allowing a level two class to be activated.

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:43.015
Ready?

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:47.453
Battle gear ability activate, Battle Crusher Demise.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.956
Say goodbye!

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.157
[exertion sounds]

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:53.525
Ah!

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.868
Ah!

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:03.769
[explosion]

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:04.803
[groans]

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.810
Had enough yet, scum?

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.345
Not very likely.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:16.749
Gate card set!

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.084
ALL: Bakugan brawl!

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:20.552
Bakugan stand!

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.865
So much for your big dumb brawler allies, Fabia.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.901
One of them has run away and the other refuses to fight.

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:38.470
Ability activate, Fist Alley.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:49.682
Ability activate, Fencer Shield.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.719
This is one of my favorites.

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:57.723
All right, gate card open, Random Meinzer.

00:15:57.823 --> 00:15:58.590
Ah!

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.559
Not more paralysis!

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.598
What's the matter, Dan?

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:07.933
You look like you're going to cry.

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:14.340
FABIA: Aranaut!

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.608
Fabia, Plitheon will keep pummeling him

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:17.743
until you bring out Drago.

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:18.811
So let's fight.

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:22.881
Or do you want to turn and run like Shun?

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.184
STOICA (VOICEOVER): Wait a minute, did Shun take--

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.289
Where's Drago?

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:32.257
Long gone, buddy.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.793
Ha, psych, Bakugan brawl!

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.129
Bakugan stand!

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:39.698
Go, Ventus Hawktor.

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:41.667
Surprise, surprise.

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:43.869
Ventus Hawktor is in the house.

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:44.870
Hyah!

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.540
What?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.309
Where's Drago?

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.877
Isn't it obvious?

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.613
You imbecile, they switched Bakugan.

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:58.784
Ability activate, Bolting Fang Slug Shot.

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:00.486
Coming right up.

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:03.155
[exertion sounds]

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:04.923
[whooshing]

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:05.924
Ah!

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:13.065
Oh man, that felt great.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.566
I was just itching to get in there

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:16.969
and smash some Gundalians around.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.871
Sorry, pal, had to do it.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.205
Now that they know about our trick,

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:22.508
should we connect some more dots for these guys?

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:23.776
Why not?

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.745
It'll be fun to watch them squirm once they find out

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:29.214
that their days are numbered.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:32.551
We switched Bakugan early on as an added safety measure,

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:35.020
just in case you guys jumped us.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.722
We knew you'd come after me first,

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.390
thinking that I'd be fighting with Drago.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.359
So while I was keeping you distracted,

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:43.362
Shun and Drago could continue on our true mission.

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:46.165
[growling]

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.801
You slippery eels conned us again!

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.369
Yep, and we're about to restart

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:53.705
the second shield, which will cut off your reinforcements.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:58.010
Ability activate, Ninja Defense Spiral Twister.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.378
This will be a blast.

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.379
[explosion]

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:05.350
Jesse, give me something to counter with.

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.886
Ability activate, Hyper Verde.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:20.499
Ability activate, Megalo Scannie.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.901
Uh-oh.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.136
Hold on, buddy.

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:27.406
We're just about to shut these clowns down for good.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:33.512
Ability activate, Sky Fang, Cyclone Soar.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:37.416
Ability activate, Ninja Comet Streamer.

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:40.519
Nice call, Dan.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:42.955
[explosion]

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:45.724
Ah, yeah.

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:49.194
Gate card nullified.

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:52.431
Wow, that packed a bigger punch than I expected. .

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.399
Maybe we should dial it back a bit, huh?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.934
Are you getting soft on me?

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:59.271
Uh, no, I was just, uh, kidding.

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.674
I have to win this to stop them from raising the shield.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.449
Battle gear boost!

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:25.697
You're mine.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:29.368
Battle ability activate, Razoid Charybdis.

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.377
Stings, doesn't it?

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:41.280
Ability activate, Life Eater!

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.320
I've had it with these Twelve Order freaks.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.155
Time for some major demolition.

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:51.657
I'm right behind you, Dan.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:53.392
Let's make them really hurt.

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:54.927
We're going big, Hawktor!

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.330
Ability activate, Bolting Fang, Slug Shot.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.232
Stand up, Aranaut.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:04.203
Ability activate, Jumpy Mirage.

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:06.738
Feel like doing some damage, Aranaut?

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.807
[exertion sounds]

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:11.310
More than you could ever know.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.311
Ah!

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:24.356
This is gonna hurt!

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.390
[explosion]

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:32.397
Redemption has evaded me today.

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:33.332
Oh, yeah!

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.400
That's right!

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.735
Blasted!

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:39.204
You got lucky today, brawlers!

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:48.013
[laughing]

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.551
Let's go, Drago.

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.586
We have to get the shield up.

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:56.121
Lead the way, Shun.

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.723
I'm ready when you are.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.101
SHUN (VOICEOVER): Drago and I finally

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:11.603
made it through the jungle to the generator building.

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:14.239
We were racing to get the second shield up and running again,

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.675
but first we had to make our way past the team of sentries

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:17.809
guarding it.

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:19.611
Just when it looked like we were in the clear,

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.480
Kazarina and Lena appeared.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.982
We had come too far and there was too much at stake

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:27.419
to back down, so we fought them with everything we had.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:30.088
Tune in yourself to see what an incredible team we made.

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:30.989
Right, Drago?

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.791
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:36.662
Maybe we should become permanent partners.

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:39.765
