DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.195
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.431
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.100

Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Gotta give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.283
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.951
The power's in your hands.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

Ah!

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.336
Leave her alone.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.304

DAN (VOICEOVER): Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Destiny Revealed.\"

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:46.005
Code Eve, huh?

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.740
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): Yes, that is what she said.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.710
Why am I feeling so uneasy and on edge?

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.381
It's strange, but I've had this feeling before.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.183
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): I am the light force

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.618
inside the Sacred Orb.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.619
What?

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.554
Does this mean the Sacred Orb is just

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.022
a shell for the true power?

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.324
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): In the beginning

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.228
there were two dragons, one of fire, one of darkness,

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:12.465
Dragonoid and Dharaknoid, and their DNA was comprised

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.068
of genetic material from the most powerful living

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.203
organism, the Ultimate Warrior.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.772
So Nurzak's ramblings were true.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:20.673
DHARAK (VOICEOVER): Quiet.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.275
Let her speak.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.843
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): Unfortunately, the powers

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.912
of the original two were too strong

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.381
and caused the dimension to split into two.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.584
The force of the separation caused some residual energy

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.687
to scatter, which led to a different kind of creation.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:35.822
Isn't that--

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.323
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): New Vestroia.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:38.525
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): The dimension

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:42.295
in which Dragonoid lived quickly separated into six

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:46.466
distinct attribute worlds.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.135
The dimension in which Dharaknoid lived

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.304
saw the creation of only two worlds.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:56.943
Of course.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.845
Neathia and Gundalia.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.613
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): In the millennia that followed,

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:04.384
each dimension created their own origin legends as they built

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.119
their respective histories.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.388
As more and more time passed, it seemed

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:11.157
that the original two were destined to never meet again.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.861
That is, until Princess Fabia of Neathia

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.896
sent out a distress call for help

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.798
in fighting off Gundalian invaders,

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.867
and the Battle Brawlers responded.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.536
This led to the eventual meeting of Drago and Dharak,

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:27.173
the two Bakugan who inherited the original Bakugan DNA.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.976
Because they both possess the genes of the original Bakugan,

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.744
I was instantly concerned.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.747
If they were to engage in battle there was a strong possibility

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.683
that they would split the dimension again,

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.751
just like their ancestors had.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.754
This is why I continually intervened and attempted

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:45.124
to keep them from battling, but then the war between Gundalia

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.961
and Neathia came to a head and the forbidden power

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.663
possessed by the dark Bakugan was unleashed.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:55.001
It caused tremendous devastation and nearly destroyed Neathia.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.670
The simple fact is that Drago and Dharak have both

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.006
been endowed with the powers of the Ultimate Warrior,

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.942
yet they exist on the opposite ends of the spectrum,

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.944
just like shadow and light.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.680
I understand now that trying to keep them separated

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.282
would be fighting the inevitable.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:11.651
That Drago and Dharak should meet in battle

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.989
is their destiny, just as it is your destiny, Dan and Barodius.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.792
Your fates are all inextricably linked.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:20.860
Seriously?

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.496
Impossible.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.098
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): Battlers and their partner

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:29.369
Bakugan are connected by a bond, known as the Switch Code.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.938
While Bakugan can fight with any battlers,

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:35.074
it is only their partners who hold the Switch Code that

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.743
can maximize their potential.

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.112
This is why, Dan, you hold the Switch

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:42.749
Code for Drago and Barodius you hold that for Dharak.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.551
Just as Drago and Dharak were destined to battle,

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.754
Dan and Barodius were destined to be

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.422
their partners along the way.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:51.391
I always knew it.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.027
For generations the Gundalian royal family

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.429
has been aware of the bond between battlers

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.700
and their Bakugan, only we called it, The Solidarity.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.901
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): Dan, I believe

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:03.603
on earth you would commonly refer

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.838
to such a thing as friendship.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:07.507
Whatever it is--

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.075
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): We're connected.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.410
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): Be that as it may,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.712
I cannot allow your collective destinies

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.747
to endanger any more innocents.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:17.750
That is why I have decided that your final battle will be

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.353
fought in a middle dimension, where no one else can

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.854
get caught in the crossfire.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.057
This is the battle that will end the war

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.025
between Gundalia and Neathia.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.828
Does everyone understand what I am telling them?

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.697
100%.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.632
Absolutely.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.310
will take control of all the Bakugan,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.979
so make sure that you don't hold anything back.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.381
Game on, gentlemen.

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.282

DRAGO (VOICEOVER): [grunts]

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:16.469
Your problem, Dan, is that you have no vision, no master plan.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.205
You just want to be a good guy, which

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:22.842
is why having command of all Bakugan is wasted on you.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:27.747

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:48.254
can feel my spirit coming back.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.493
So is the battle over?

DRAGO (VOICEOVER): Let's go get Dharak.

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:25.658
Ah!

Bakugan scan.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:38.537
I'm going to make you hurt, Dharak.

Lavolta!

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:42.975
DHARAK (VOICEOVER): I've been looking

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.478
forward to this for so long.

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.179
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): [screams in pain]

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.881
Drago!

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:54.520
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): [growls] Is that all you've got?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.522
Don't make me laugh.

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:57.523
Ah!

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.625
[grunting]

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:01.527
Oh!

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:02.995
Watch out!

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.598

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.545
Oh, Drago!

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.013
What's wrong with you, pal?

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.018
Oh, I guess you got your bell rung pretty

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:27.219
hard with that last shot.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:29.088
It must have scrambled something inside your head

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:32.191
because you're fighting on pure instinct now.

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.760
Drago!

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.829
Playtime is over, Dharak.

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:38.898
Put Drago out of his misery.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.933
DHARAK (VOICEOVER): With pleasure.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.401

You gotta get up.

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:50.810

That's it.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:54.714
You can do it.

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.248
Nice and easy.

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:57.616
Wonderful.

00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:01.053
Why don't you take them both out with your next shot, Dharak?

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.988
DHARAK (VOICEOVER): I could do this all day.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:05.758
Chaos Magnalia!

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:06.659

You really gotta wake up.

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:10.362
DHARAK (VOICEOVER): [roars]

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.464
Wake up!

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.270

Drago!

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.542
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): [moans] Who's calling me?

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.311
I'm so tired.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:29.748
I just wanna sleep just a little while longer.

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:30.916

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.118

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.454
DAN: Drago! DRAGO (VOICEOVER): Huh?

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:36.622
Wait a minute.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.371
You had me scared for a minute.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:55.074

NURZAK: Have you no shame, Barodius?

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:01.333
Can you not accept defeat in a dignified fashion?

Be quiet.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:06.538

It's like Code Eve said, Dan.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.567
You can't fight destiny.

You just evolved again!

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:33.359
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): I know.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.793
I feel incredible.

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:38.564
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): Now you rule the entire Bakugan race.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.833
Wow, that's some responsibility.

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.534
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): I never entered into this war

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.803
to become a ruler.

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:47.439
Neither did I. The Brawlers have only ever wanted peace

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.841
for our friends the Bakugan.

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.276
We don't need to rule them, you see.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.046
We just wanna live in harmony beside them, just

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.682
as all good friends should.

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.083
CODE EVE (VOICEOVER): I understand.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:02.221
Your decision is a noble one and I respect it greatly.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:08.060
[energy beam]

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.497
It's so hard to believe that the war is finally over

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:14.566
and that peace has once again returned to our homeland,

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:17.903
but with so much devastation it will be a while before things

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.304
are back to normal.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.274
Nah, I bet things will get back on track.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:25.144
You're right, Dan.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.880
It makes me hopeful seeing everyone so happy again.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.421
Does this mean you're leaving?

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.624
Well, we did finish what we came to do.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.260
Then I guess this is farewell.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.327
I guess.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:45.164
[gentle music playing]

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:47.733
DAN: Be cool, Ren.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:48.634
REN: I will.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.536
Take care of yourself, friend.

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:53.005
Thanks again for everything.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:56.041
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): I'm sure we'll meet again, Linehalt.

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.510
Now that the royal family and its supporters

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.979
have been defeated, I shall return to Gundalia

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.284
to form a new government, one that

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.085
will only have friendly relations

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.587
with its neighboring planet.

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:11.457
That is, if you will permit it, Queen Serena.

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.258
Of course.

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:15.861
I think this war has taught us all a valuable lesson

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:18.597
about the importance of peace.

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:21.300
LINEHALT (VOICEOVER): Ren, now that I'm a Castle Knight, I

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.402
would like to remain here on Neathia

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.405
so that I may continue to serve.

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:29.007
I promise I'll take good care of him.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.776
OK.

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:34.146
Marucho, I'll never forget you my friend.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:37.616
I won't forget you either, buddy.

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:38.684
Take care.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:39.685
You too.

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:46.225
And so, I bid you all adieu, Battle Brawlers.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:51.997
[transport beams]

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.899
[ships blast]

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:57.769
Well, I guess that's our cue then, Akwimos.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.671
AKWIMOS (VOICEOVER): Yeah, sure looks like it.

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:00.906
I, uh--

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.341
AKWIMOS (VOICEOVER): I'm going to miss you.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.611
You're the peanut butter to my jelly.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:08.647
Cool as the rule, dude.

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:11.183
It was an honor to battle alongside a fine warrior

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.451
like you, Hawktor.

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.219
HAWKTOR (VOICEOVER): I learned a great deal in my time

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.120
with you, Shun.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.922
Thank you for everything.

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:19.625
I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this!

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:23.028
Oh man, I'm really gonna miss you, dude.

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:25.097
A guy never forgets his first Bakugan.

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.366
Just promise me you won't forget me either because that

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:28.834
would bust me up inside.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.569
[sobs]

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.870
COREDEM (VOICE OVER): OK, take it easy.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.238
I promise.

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.240
You're a solid dude, Jake.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.543
Take care of yourself.

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.845
ARANAUT (VOICEOVER): Shall I send them off, princess?

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:41.880
Yes, I'd appreciate that Aranaut.

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:51.390
Dan, thanks to you and the Brawlers

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.492
we have peace once again.

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:57.462
Thank you for everything you've done for us.

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.631
We are forever in your debt.

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.133
No sweat, guys.

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:04.136
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): That's what friends are for.

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:08.407
[transport beams]

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.609
I really miss Dan and the others.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:11.910
I wonder how they're doing.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.579
Yeah, oh, I know.

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:14.680
I hope they're OK.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.549
He hasn't even called his own mother, huh.

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:20.586
But I guess I should be used to that.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:21.787
Oh, my goodness.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.021
Where has the day gone?

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.090
I have to get home and fix dinner.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.459
See you later, hon.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.561
Bye Mrs. Kuso.

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:32.364
I wonder what I should make.

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:33.632
DAN: Hey, mom!

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.300
Huh?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.236
We're back!

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:40.205
Daniel?

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.106
Oh!

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:44.109
[giggles] Hey, guys!

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:46.578
[laughs]

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:51.583
[laughs]

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:53.819
[laughs]

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.354
MARUCHO: Did you miss us?

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:57.422
Mom, I'm home!

00:20:57.522 --> 00:21:00.993
Of course we did, but only a little.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.394
Ha!

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:04.296
[laughs]

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:08.066
[battle music]

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.968
ANNOUNCER: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:13.305
the Bakugan battle between Dan Kuso and Koji Beetle

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:14.773
will now commence.

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:18.010
So you're the famous Dan Kuso, huh.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.312
I've always wanted to fight you, pal.

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:23.482
Actually, we already have, buddy.

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:25.384
DRAGO (VOICEOVER): He's not going to remember that.

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:26.284
Huh?

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.486
What did you say?

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:29.688
I was just saying, good luck!

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:33.358
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan Field, open!

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:37.329
[grunts] Bakugan brawl!
