00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now, Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.128
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan,

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.431
dragon-like colossus on our side!

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.735
Bakugan, brawl!

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.743
Back against the wall.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.478
You got to give it your all.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.381
[vocalizing] This is the final stand.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.718
[vocalizing] The power's in your hand!

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.821
Two worlds collide on the inside!

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.229
You got a fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone!

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.230
This is Bakugan!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.376
It seems Nurzak forgot which emperor he was serving!

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:21.247
And now that he is gone, does anyone else share his views?

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.987
Nurzak was a feeble-minded old fool

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.722
who suffered from delusions.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:33.126
We are loyal only to you, sire.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.327
BARODIUS: Very well.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.930
Then, I suggest you return your focus to destroying

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.032
the restored second shield.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.702
I can easily destroy it using the upgraded Exokor.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.772
How much longer until it's ready, Kazarina

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.408
Three days, two if we hurry.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.409
Perfect.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.910
In the meantime, I suggest we keep

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.413
the Neathians occupied by launching a smaller

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.615
attack as a distraction.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.785
That sounds like a job for Gill!

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.153
Yes, sire.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.022
So then, it's all on your shoulders

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.624
to buy us the time we need.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.665
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Mobile Assault\"!

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.447
Flying cockroaches!

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.383
Those ships belong to Gill, Airzel, and Stoica!

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.284
Get ready.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:32.352
[grunts]

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.822
Bakugan, brawl!

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.690
Bakugan, stand!

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.826
[screeching]

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.895
Bakugan, brawl!

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.429
Bakugan, stand!

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.934
Bakugan, brawl!

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.435
Bakugan, stand!

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:53.740
Let's do this!

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.542
Bakugan, brawl!

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.343
Bakugan, brawl!

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.512
Bakugan, stand!

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.547
Bakugan, brawl!

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:09.989
GILL: Why am I in charge of buying time for Kazarina?

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.692
If she's not ready, then it should be her problem.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:13.993
This stinks, Gill!

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.728
Hey, when did we become the cleanup

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.230
crew for that little witch?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.699
While she's off playing mad scientist,

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.267
we're stuck doing the heavy lifting!

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.168
Careful!

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.436
She might be listening.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.638
Relax, Airzel.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.341
This is a secure channel and we're amongst friends here,

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.776
right, Stoica?

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.744
Of course we are.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.891
Ability activate!

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.927
High ENT Spinner!

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.395
Ability activate!

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.897
Durandal Cannon!

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.571
Well, this changes things.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.472
Yup!

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.406
Huh?

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.075
What are you dudes talking about?

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.977
Take a closer look, man!

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.612
Those aren't the usual Gundalian

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.247
soldiers we're fighting.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.248
Those are the battlers who've been kidnapped

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.351
from Bakugan Interspace!

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:12.251
[explosion]

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.187
[screaming]

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.123
Those rotten Gundalians are fighting really dirty

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:18.024
this time!

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.392
Are you ready, Drago?

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.628
Just say the word, Dan!

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.063
Ability activate!

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.299
Blaze Hammer!

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.534
Ability activate!

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.569
Crush Arrow!

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.641
Ability activate!

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.011
Spiral Pressure!

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.946
Ability activate!

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.348
Mirage Jet!

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.450
Ability activate!

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.486
Bolting Fang Slug Shot!

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:52.892
[grunting]

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.665
Guys, snap out of it!

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.066
You're fighting for the wrong side!

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:05.805
Oh, yeah?

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:09.375
We'll see about that.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.512
FABIA: It's like they're brainwashed.

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:13.579
What do we do now?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.748
Let's hit them a little harder.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.850
Ability activate!

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.851
Cross fire!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.059
Ability activate!

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.060
Particle wave!

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.765
Ability activate!

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:33.900
Blaze Fernum!

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.675
Ability activate!

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.011
Ability activate!

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.213
Ability activate!

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.915
Ability activate!

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.350
Ability activate!

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.086
Master Gill, the Neathians have

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.388
defeated 72% of our forces!

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:59.192
First battalion, fall back immediately!

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.361
Second battalion, get ready to strike!

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.130
We're ready, Gill!

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.131
Me too.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.740
Look at the chickens run!

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.675
Don't celebrate just yet.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.177
They could be regrouping for another attack.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:19.912
This makes no sense.

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.881
When we beat them in Bakugan Interspace,

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.383
they'd always go back to normal.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.051
So why not here?

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.687
Battlers inside Interspace were digital versions.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.822
Maybe the Gundalian hypnosis is stronger

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.457
when used on flesh and blood.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:35.128
If we fight any harder, we could injure the battlers.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.029
Well, we have to figure something out,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.499
because the Gundalians are continuing to kidnap kids

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.000
from Interspace as we speak!

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:52.478
[scoffing] Quit your pathetic screaming!

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:55.014
It's a sign of weakness!

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.351
Kazarina, we're running low on battlers at the front.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.252
Ugh!

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.088
Why are you bothering me?

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:04.891
Why are you pulling me away from my work here?

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.292
You're supposed to be providing me

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.795
with the time I need to complete Exokor,

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:11.264
not distracting me with petty tasks!

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.398
Ren?

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:13.833
Yes, mistress?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.701
I need you to go to Earth and bring

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.570
me back more of those brats.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.239
Yes, right away.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.407
GILL: Seriously?

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.676
Ren is the only one available for recruiting.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.645
That's what happens when you get rid of your underlings

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:26.879
to cover for your mistakes!

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.849
Don't be so quick to point fingers, you hypocrite!

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:33.319
I seem to remember you were the one who got rid of Zenet.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.754
OK, very well.

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:37.523
I will immediately dispatch someone from my end

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:38.758
to go along with Ren.

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:43.329
STOICA: Why do I get sent to this dump?

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.431
It should be Airzel doing this, not me!

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.499
He's junior in rank.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.367
What's Gill's problem?

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:50.469
This really stings!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.673
Will you please hurry and transform into your human body?

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.441
Hey, pipe down!

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.244
Don't think you can start bossing me around too!

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.584
Wow!

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.652
Not too bad at all!

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.922
Hey, let's hurry up and grab some battlers.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:12.225
Hey, knock yourself out, Ren.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.793
I've got other plans.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:14.794
What?

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.629
I'll leave you to scrape the bottom

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.097
of this barrel on your own.

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:22.101
I like to go hunting for my prey in its natural habitat.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.202
Stoica, wait!

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.175
Ren, I think we should reconsider

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:33.079
our loyalty to the Twelve Orders since they show us none.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.181
Have you lost your mind?

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:39.085
We haven't come this far to change sides, Linehalt!

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.854
I would like to know what these forbidden powers are

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:44.824
that the Dark Bakugan are supposed to possess.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.160
I wonder too about what my true duty is

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.330
as the latest generation in the long line of protectors

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.566
of the Dark Bakugan.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.569
And to find that out, I'm willing to use

00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:00.573
any means necessary.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:01.974
We stick to the plan.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.476
Do you understand me?

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.081
Time to bring reinforcements, Linehalt!

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.986
DAN: Drago, we got to break this spell, buddy!

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:24.397
So this is where the humans call home, huh?

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.666
It's almost as ugly as they are.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:30.770
JULIE: [sighs] Seeing this empty is depressing.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.139
I wonder how Dan and the other guys are doing.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.574
[sighs] I really hope they get back here soon.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:36.809
I'm starting to worry.

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:37.810
Hmm?

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:40.813
Hey, mister!

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:41.714
Huh?

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.082
Are you blind?

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.284
That's caution tape, not gift wrapping!

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:46.319
Take it easy!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.120
I just want to go in and have a battle.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.455
What's your problem?

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:51.924
What part of \"no\" don't you understand?

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:52.825
Uh.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.527
Do we have a problem here?

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:55.528
Uh, nope.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.300
I just don't understand why we have to stay

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.803
out of Bakugan Interspace.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:06.439
Everyone keeps telling me the system is fixed.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.841
So what's the big deal then, huh?

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.309
It's bad information.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:11.544
The bad guys are using it to trick

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.412
kids into Bakugan Interspace.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.648
But Dan and the others are out fighting in Neathia,

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.950
so hopefully soon these Gundalian creeps

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.919
will be banished for good.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:20.920
Dan, huh?

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.622
Is he your boyfriend?

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:23.656
Oh, no, no!

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:24.991
We're just friends.

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:29.061
Besides, my pal Runo's has been crazy about him forever.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.264
That's Dan Kuso, the best brawler ever.

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:33.532
You betcha!

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:35.201
That's why I know we're going to beat the Gundalians.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.269
Dan's the best!

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.170
Hmph!

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.705
[gasps]

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:40.773
JULIE (VOICEOVER): guy?

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.375
And how long has he been sitting there?

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.143
Hey, thanks for the information.

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:45.544
But I got to split, OK?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.480
So, uh, how much--

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.115
Don't worry about it. It's on me.

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:50.016
Huh?

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.984
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:52.885
Sorry.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:54.620
Can I get you something?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.621
Weird.

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:58.724
It's like he just disappeared.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.259
DAN (VOICEOVER): Julie is nice and everything,

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.328
but that story of hers, it all sounds

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:06.132
a bit too whack to be true.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:09.068
I want to battle so bad.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.736
Maybe I can help you with that.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:13.205
I know a place we could go check out, if you're interested.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.206
Huh?

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.285
Hey, where the heck are we?

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:28.421
KAZARINA: Calm down, my little lambs.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.823
As long as you're with me, you'll have nothing

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:33.426
to fear ever again, I promise.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.262
Now then, just look into my eyes!

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:45.504
Now, pledge to battle with all your might

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:48.140
for the glory of Gundalia!

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.042
ALL: For the glory of Gundalia.

00:11:58.517 --> 00:11:59.418
Oh, man!

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.895
Castle Knights, engage now!

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:13.032
Bakugan, brawl!

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.600
Bakugan, stand!

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.311
Bakugan, brawl.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.846
Bakugan, stand.

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.128
We should split up, you guys!

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.963
I'll take the one's on the right!

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.297
Great!

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.800
That means Fabia and I will take the left, so you guys--

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.502
We'll head straight down the middle.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.469
Let's rock, dude!

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:51.370
Ready!

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.471
This way, Fabia!

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:53.472
You got it!

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.212
[rumbling]

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.180
[growling]

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.148
What's that?

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.116
Something big!

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.552
Whoa!

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.888
I've never seen a Bakugan that huge!

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.056
It's not a Bakugan.

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:16.662
It's a Bakugan Mobile Assault Vehicle called Impalaton!

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:19.698
That thing is full on, dude!

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.134
If by \"full on\" you mean deadly, you're right.

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.403
It's a highly evolved form of battle gear.

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:27.106
Hey, Kuso, come out and fight!

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.340
[laughs]

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.310
I know that guy!

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.211
Really?

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.746
You sure about that?

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:34.880
Yes.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.749
He's the first battler I faced when I fought

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:40.019
inside Bakugan Interspace.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.320
You lost?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.322
Need someone to show you around?

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.191
Well, come on.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.158
Oh, no!

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.727
The Gundalians must have got to him!

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:49.628
Hey!

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:50.863
Do you remember me?

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.431
We met back on Earth in--

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.700
KOJI: Ability activate!

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.768
Chaos Vibro!

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:04.977
[screaming]

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:09.248
Bakugan, brawl!

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.349
Bakugan, stand!

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.990
Thank you, buddy!

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.891
Hold on.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:19.892
Here they come!

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:26.765
Huh.

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.300
I guess he doesn't share the same fond memories

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.201
of your first meeting.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:30.369
What did you expect?

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.371
He's totally brainwashed.

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:33.539
And dangerous.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:41.880
Drago, be careful out there!

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.949
Ability activate!

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.285
Blaze Reflector!

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.387
Let's nullify this dude's ability!

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.593
You can't nullify a mobile Bakugan

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:58.097
assault vehicle's ability.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.399
The anti-ability shield!

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:04.303
Drago, we got to destroy that assault vehicle!

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.772
Ability activate!

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:07.806
Cross fire!

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.810
DRAGO: Useless!

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.679
Not a scratch!

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.248
[laughs]

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.119
[grunting]

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:22.688
[screaming]

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:29.361
Captain Elright, Dan and Fabia are in trouble!

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.930
A Bakugan Assault Vehicle?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.531
That's right.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.867
It's Impalaton, which is equipped

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.568
with an anti-ability shield.

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:40.072
Our regular attacks have been totally useless against them.

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:43.375
It's time that we bring out our own Bakugan assault vehicle.

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:45.411
We only have Raytheus available,

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:46.679
and it's just been finished.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:50.582
We haven't had a chance to run performance tests yet.

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:53.252
We're just going to have to hope for the best then.

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.390
KOJI: Stay down!

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.391
DAN: Drago!

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:05.564
Hurry up!

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:08.500
We don't have much time!

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.571
Linus, upload Drago's DNA sequence to Raytheus' system,

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.673
then uplink it to Dan's BakuMeter.

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:15.574
Hurry up!

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.475
Do it!

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:17.543
Yes, sir!

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.378
You got lucky that time, punk!

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.279
Ha!

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.348
You wish!

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:23.949
The upload is complete.

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.250
All clear.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:29.054
Commencing uplink from Raytheus to Dan's BakuMeter.

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.322
Stand by for transfer.

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:34.893
Hey, what's going on?

00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:36.095
They're linking your BakuMeter.

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.063
With Drago's Bakugan Assault Vehicle!

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.264
DRAGO: What?

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.433
DAN: Yeah, seriously, what are you talking about?

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.502
FABIA: Hold on until it's finished installing, then,

00:16:43.602 --> 00:16:44.837
I'll explain everything.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:48.974
But until then, you guys, Aranaut and I will buy time.

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:51.443
Ready when you are, princess!

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:52.911
Here we go!

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:56.215
Bakugan, brawl!

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.117
Bakugan, stand!

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.552
In the name of the Neathian Castle Knights,

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.688
I will take you down!

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.656
Ability activate!

Ha!

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.810
Your puny attacks are useless!

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.111
Ability activate!

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.212
Chaos Vibro!

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.084
Aranaut!

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.853
Dan, is it finished yet?

00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:36.855
Come on, come on!

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:38.223
[screams]

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:39.324
KOJI: I'm gonna thrash you!

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.793
[screaming]

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.962
Huh?

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.536
You will not harm the princess, not on my watch!

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.040
OK, the installation's done!

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.213
BAKUMETER: Ready, Raytheus.

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:02.481
DAN: You ready, Drago?

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.482
You bet!

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:13.325
Mobile Assault, launch!

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.426
Check it!

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.333
Mind if I cut in, Aranaut?

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.368
(STRUGGLING) Be my guest!

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:28.774
Want to go for a spin?

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:31.176
Where did his vehicle come from?

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.177
Let's go!

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:42.955
I was right!

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.591
Drago is a natural on the Bakugan assault vehicle!

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.229
Like that?

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.231
Ability activate!

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.832
Strike Blaster!

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:00.239
Nice one, Dan!

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.874
Dude!

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:02.875
Are you OK?

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:07.946
Huh?

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:08.847
Back off!

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:09.882
Whoa!

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.518
He's still under the hypnotic spell.

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:13.619
Come on!

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:15.153
Dude, you got to wake up!

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.054
Enough!

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.156
You wake up!

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.158
We're not pals, OK?

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.059
Dan!

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:23.629
Dude, we're here to help you!

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.564
You've got to believe us!

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.766
Dan, if you don't let go, you'll be transported

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:29.434
back to Gundalia with him!

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:30.969
I'm not going to give up on you, man!

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.138
We're going to keep fighting until all the kids from Earth

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.139
are free!

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:40.145
I'm tired of losing battlers to those Gundalian creeps!

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.492
Fall back for now.

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:54.960
That is enough for today.

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:19.618
What just happened to me?

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:20.519
JULIE: Really?

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.388
You don't remember anything?

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:24.489
Nothing.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.625
I just remember some weird dude strolling up

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:28.827
and saying he'd take me somewhere to battle,

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:32.898
and then it's all a blank.

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:34.933
But it's totally bizarre and spooky that you woke

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:38.103
up inside Bakugan Interspace.

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:42.507
Yeah, well, there's something even spookier, but I--

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.875
I--

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:44.843
It's OK.

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:46.345
You can tell me.

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:49.081
I keep hearing this voice inside my head,

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:54.753
only I don't know who it belongs to.

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:58.256
But it keeps telling me, I'm not going to give up on you.

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.701
DAN: The Gundalians decided to launch another attack on us

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.069
at sunrise.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.772
Lucky for us, we were ready with Drago's new Bakugan Mobile

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:15.574
Assault Vehicle this time.

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.309
Just as we were about to let loose,

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:18.744
Ren showed up out of nowhere.

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.245
Doesn't this guy understand that he's

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:22.080
just being used by Barodius?

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.283
Maybe one of these days, he'll finally get a clue.

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:26.551
But in the meantime, we'll show him the awesome power

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:27.986
of our new machine.

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:30.689
Tune in and check out his reaction!

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.190
Mobile assault launch!

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.792
Oh, man, I love this thing!

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:44.469
