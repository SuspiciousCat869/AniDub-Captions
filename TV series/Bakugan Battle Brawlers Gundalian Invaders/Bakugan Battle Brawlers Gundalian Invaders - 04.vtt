DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.908
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.187
environment.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.490
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.559
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.831
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.400
OK, buddy. Let's do this.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.300
All right.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.869

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.275
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.277
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.745
Got to give it your all.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.347
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.681
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.550
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.018
The power's in your hand.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.021
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.627
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.530
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.932
This is Bakugan.

[grunts] Not bad, Jake.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.718
You got me pretty good there.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.020
Your skill is improving.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.355
Well, he does have me as a coach after all.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.256
OK, Jake.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.091
Ready to kick it up a notch?

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.103

Whoa!

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:02.655
Oh, man.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.824
I was so close to winning.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:08.561
I had you on the ropes, but I blew it.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.462
Oh!

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.864
This stinks.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.098
DAN: Take it easy. - Huh?

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.500
You fought a good fight.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.136
You really bring the intensity you show on the football field

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.072
to the battle arena in a big way.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.242
You show great promise as a battler, Jake.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.477
But there is still much to teach him, Dan.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.712
Yeah.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.981
But one day soon he's going to make a great addition

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:28.882
to the Battle Brawlers.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:29.782
Huh?

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.017
Who me?

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:31.918
Yeah.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.953
I'm a Battle Brawler.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.655
I'm a Battle Brawler.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:36.589
I'm a-- what?

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.991
Wait a minute.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:40.260
You said \"one day I will be,\" so does that mean I'm not one yet?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.828
Why not? Is it because I lost?

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:42.729
It's because I stink.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.930
Just relax, dude.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.431
You're working yourself up.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.066
You don't stink as a battler.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.035
We just have some work we got to--

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:49.936

[gasps]

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.372
I blew it.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.874
You gave me a chance and took time out to train and coach me,

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.142
and I let you down.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.243
Don't worry, Dan the Man.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.545
I'll make you proud.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.114
I'll prove that I'm worthy of the Battle Brawler title.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:02.081
Um.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.249
OK, big guy. MARUCHO (ON COMM): Dan.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.284
Huh?

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.451
MARUCHO (ON COMM): Dan, do you read me?

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.653
Yeah, Marucho. I'm here.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.855
Our security systems have detected another breach

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:09.889
from a Neathian agent.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.791
Are you serious?

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.294
It seems he's in the N4 battle arena.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.262
Can you meet us there as soon as possible?

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.432
DAN (ON COMM): We'll be there.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.402
REN: I see you have a lock on the enemy agent.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.103
So how did you manage that?

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.439
Well, Ren, you pointed out that the Neathians were

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.243
infiltrating Bakugan Interspace by bypassing the access points,

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.579
so I reset the system to raise an alarm whenever

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.514
it detects a combatant who hasn't entered

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.249
through an access point.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.550
That's very clever of you.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.719
It sounds like it was a complex job.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.754
Once I knew where to look for the weaknesses,

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:42.922
it was no big deal.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:45.725
Thanks to you, Ren.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:46.626
Uh.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.461

You're not going to win anything using little league

I'm sure you're a really big deal with the preschool crowd,

He smoked him with one attack.

Huh, Mason Brown.

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:46.446
MARUCHO: Then it must be him.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.716
That's the name that the security system flagged.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:50.650
OK.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.085
I'm going to own this guy so badly,

he'll wish he'd never stepped foot inside Bakugan Interspace.

Hey, Mutton Chops.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.256
I'm game.

It's Dan.

You're in a world of hurt now, buddy.

That's right.

So you must be the Battle Brawlers.

Maybe you want to pack up and leave peacefully.

Why would I do that?

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.849
This may be just the thing I was looking for.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:23.750
OK.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.585
So let's quit talking.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.953
Dan the Man, wait a sec.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:27.887
What?

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.555

Let me do this and prove to all of you

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.699

Is that guy serious?

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.639
I don't want to see him battle.

I'll show you.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:58.050
I'll show all of you monkeys, man.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:58.985
OK. OK.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:06:59.886
Calm down.

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.254
You can fight this battle.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.755
Really?

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.791
[grumbles] You sure about this?

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:05.691
Yeah.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:06.826
I've got faith in him.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:07.727
He could do this.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.462
No problem.

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.397
Go win this thing, Jake.

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:12.832
Yeah!

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.134
ANNOUNCER: The next battle will see Mason

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:18.871
Brown versus Jake Vallory.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.807
I can do this.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.075
Coredem and I can win it.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.477
Hmph.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:25.645
Yeah, Jake.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:26.546
Take it.

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:29.682
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan field open.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:34.053
Gate Card, set.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.055
[shouts]

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.157
Bakugan Brawl.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.059
Bakugan, stand.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.695
Go, Subterra Coredem.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:46.032
Bakugan Brawl.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.701
Rise, Subterra Avior.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.703

Ability activate.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.274
Core Knuckle.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.012
Hit him hard.

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:01.013
Hit him fast.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.014
Woo!

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.686
Ability activate.

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:07.720
Offering Armor.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.227
I thought you were a tough guy.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.828
Are you just going to hide behind a shield

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:18.197
like a scared little turtle?

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.966
You have no clue.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:20.967
What did you say?

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.603
Perhaps before entering into battle,

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.972
you should learn a little something about your opponent.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.641
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.176
You're just trying to distract me.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.511
All I need to know is you're hiding behind your shield

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:33.946
like a scaredy cat.

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.115
Ability activate.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.516

[banging]

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.525
I don't understand.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.260
This even worked on Drago.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.362
Why won't this guy go down?

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.597
Why?

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:52.999
Ha.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.334
You're a little quick to lose your cool, aren't you, big guy?

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:56.869
I get it.

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.804
I can see that you're scared.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:08:59.972
Well, you should be.

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.608
[groans] I am not scared.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.011
You're the one who refuses to come out and fight like a man.

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:05.912
Totally.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:06.812
Oh, OK.

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.347
All right then.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.716
Ability activate.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.184

[roars]

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.525
Whoa.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:20.526
Um, OK.

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.395
Gate Card, open.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:23.796
Land Pressure.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.833
Nice move, Jake.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.536
Land Pressure is a great Command Card to use because it'll

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.604
freeze your opponent.

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:32.838
Ha ha.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.173
Now what, pal?

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.283

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:45.284

COMPUTER: Jake Life Force, 60%.

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.496
That was just a small taste.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.432
Gate Card, set.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.167
Bakugan Brawl.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.068
Let's go.

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.003
Bakugan Brawl.

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:07.273
MASON AND JAKE: Bakugan, stand.

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.507
[roars]

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.408
All right.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:10.876
Let's try this again.

[yelps]

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.705
Battle Howling will prevent you

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:42.241
from activating any abilities, so you

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.677
are essentially helpless.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:47.179
I've wasted enough time.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.582
Ability activate.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:52.184

ANNOUNCER: Battle over.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.265
Winner, Mason Brown.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.166
Hm.

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:09.168
Big fail for a big guy.

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:11.704
Man, I can't believe I lost.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:12.638
What was that?

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:13.539
You're pathetic, Jake.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.007
Boo.

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.710
Just go home, you bum.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.611
Jake!

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:19.745
It'll be OK.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.946
Don't worry.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:21.847
Ha.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.449

[grumbles]

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:28.487
I'll be seeing you around, my friend.

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:33.025
[ominous music]

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.961
[grumbles]

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.667
MASON (VOICEOVER): Our search continues, Avior.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:43.736
JAKE (VOICEOVER): Time to redeem ourselves, Coredem.

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:44.737
Yeah.

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:50.910
Jake, I'm sorry.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.012
I let you down.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.547
Hey, Dan.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:55.448
[giggling]

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.649
DAN: Julie.

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:57.783
Oh, wow.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.752
You actually let him battle?

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:00.686
Yeah.

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.388
He wanted to prove himself so bad.

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.423
I thought it would be good for his confidence,

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:05.958
but it totally backfired.

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:07.593
What's done is done, Dan.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:09.228
We have to focus on what's important now.

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:10.129
Yeah.

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.030
I know.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.231
We got to find that creep Mason.

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:13.132
JAKE: [shouting]

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.166
Ah!

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:15.167
BOTH: Huh?

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.639
JAKE (VOICEOVER): I looked like a total fool

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.941
in that battle arena.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:24.543
I let Dan the Man and all of the other Brawlers down.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:26.412
Most of all, I let myself down.

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.080
I had a chance to show everyone what I could do,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.815
and I blew it, even though I had the number

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.217
one Brawler as my coach.

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:33.452
But I won't make that mistake again.

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:38.491
If I ever see that creep Mason Brown again, he's going down.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.392
[grunts] Yes.

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.394
Yeah, baby.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.496
Look at him.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.332
I thought losing would make him depressed.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.734
Seems like it lit a fire in him instead.

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:50.436
I don't think it's that simple.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:51.537
Huh?

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:54.106
Aw, Dan, I know all about Subterra Brawlers,

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:55.374
so leave it to me.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:56.909
[whistle blowing]

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.078
JAKE: Hey, Julie, what's up?

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:00.346
Dan tells me you battled yesterday.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.247
Yeah.

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:02.715
It was a disaster.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.783
I just wanted to prove myself as a brawler.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.952
I should have followed Dan's teaching more closely.

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.021
It might have ended differently.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.023
Dan knows best.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.159
JULIE: I used to think that way too, Jake.

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.527
Huh?

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.831
I used to follow Dan around like I was a little lost puppy.

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.433
I wanted to be a better brawler, and I thought

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.536
that meant being just like Dan.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.805
And did it?

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.541
Dan is an awesome brawler, no question.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.377
But his style of brawling isn't the best way for everyone.

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.449
He's wild and impulsive, and that works for him.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.617
But it didn't work for me.

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:39.518
Really?

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:41.620
Go on.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.157
Every brawler must find their own style.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:49.361
Think about how important strategy is when you're

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:50.496
on the field playing football.

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.431
Strategy?

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.935
Success involves following your playbook.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.637
You need to adopt a similar approach

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.339
inside of the battle arena.

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:01.507
Oh.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.242
JULIE: Dan's method of battle would

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.710
fail you in a football game.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.414
Your strength is in executing a well-planned, step-by-step

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.450
attack which anticipates every possible reaction

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.751
from your opponent.

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.954
Just like football, you need to formulate your own sort

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:16.188
of playbook for brawling.

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:18.424
Your style must involve planning.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.325
Planning.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:20.259
Yeah.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:21.360
You should be able to visualize

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.461
every round of battle.

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.196
Before I fight it.

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:26.165
I think I get what you're saying, Julie.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:27.499
I understand.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.369
So remember that next time you're in the battle arena

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.937
ready to throw down.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:35.341
Take a moment and think of your playbook.

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.177
Then, as you're getting ready to execute your plan,

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:41.680
take a deep breath and visualize how it will unfold.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.616
[wind rustling]

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.352
OK.

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:48.487
Visualize the attack.

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:50.422
[inhales]

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:51.991
[exhales]

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:56.595
Are you seriously back for more?

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.130
- You stink, Jake. - Yeah.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.031
Go home.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.199
You're no brawler.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.500
Oh, man.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.236
That's a really, really harsh crowd out there tonight.

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:06.138
You think Jake is ready for this?

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.206
You bet.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.641
He's going to settle the score.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.775
I can feel it.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.111
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan field open.

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:14.947
Gate Card, set.

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:17.249
Bakugan Brawl.

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.118
Bakugan, stand.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:21.520
Go, Subterra Coredem.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.589
Bakugan Brawl.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.557
Bakugan, stand.

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:26.992
Rise, Subterra Avior.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.060
[laughs]

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.596
Don't let my last performance fool you.

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:33.299
This battle's different.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.768
Ability activate.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:36.769
Bolting Chain.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:37.803
[electric crackle]

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:40.939
Ability activate.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.007
Dimension Hole.

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:46.679
Oh, not bad there.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:50.015
But let's see how long he can hold out.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.951
Ability activate.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.920
Scale Arrow.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.456
[blasting]

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:00.526
Oh yeah?

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.594
Ability Offering Armor.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.230
I just nullified your ability.

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.032
Just like I knew you would.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.101
Ability activate.

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:12.338
Phantom Blow.

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:15.741
Did you also know that ability wouldn't work on me?

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:17.843
Ability activate.

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.244
Battle Howling.

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:20.779
[roars]

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.818
Gate Card, open.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:26.819
Change Link Force.

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:30.689
What's happening?

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.959
Oh, no.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:38.030
You think I'd actually fall for that twice, dude?

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.498
[blasting]

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.967
[groans] Ugh.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:45.137
Maybe he did learn something from our last battle.

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.672
All right, man.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.640
He used Command Card Change Link Force

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.676
to bounce the Battle Howling attack

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:51.910
right back in their own face.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.545
How awesome.

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:56.048
Way to go, Jake.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:57.015
Ha.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.517
All part of the plan.

00:16:58.617 --> 00:16:59.418
Hm.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.486
OK.

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.054
So you've done your homework this time.

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:03.355
Let's go again.

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:04.490
Don't worry.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.893
He won't get the drop on me this time around.

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:10.462
Gate Card, set.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:11.964
Bakugan Brawl.

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:13.799
Stick to the plan, Coredem.

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:14.900
Bakugan Brawl.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.002
MASON AND JAKE: Bakugan, stand.

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.937
[roars]

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.839
Ability, activate.

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:23.041
Scale Arrow.

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:26.044
I'm not going to lose to a newbie like you.

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:28.747
Ability, activate.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.416
Offering Armor.

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.417
[boom]

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.018
[roars]

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.220
- [grunts] - Oh no.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.121
Coredem's hit.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.022
Hold on!

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.490
[grunts]

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:40.559
Aw, man.

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.327
He really packs a punch.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:43.662
Coredem's in trouble.

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.431
What do I do?

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:48.434
Every brawler must find their own style.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:51.637
Take a moment and think of your playbook.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:52.738
That's it.

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.006
Got it.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:57.042
I can't freak out and do something wild and impulsive.

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:58.377
I have a strategy.

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:01.547
I just have to take a breath and visualize the battle.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:02.614
Stick to the plan.

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:05.851
[snarls] Had enough yet, newbie?

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.753
Why don't you just give up?

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:10.122
That's not part of the plan.

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:12.357
Ability, activate.

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:15.027
Armored Exia.

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:18.297
Armored Exia is an ability unique to Subterra Coredem.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:21.733
He uses his whole body's energy line to absorb your power.

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:27.840
I didn't expect such a strong defense.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.374
[grunts]

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:31.176
Hey, put me down.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:34.546
[shouting]

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:36.982
JAKE: Touchdown!

00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:39.451
You're going to pay for that one.

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.353
Time to put you to bed.

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.323
Ability, activate.

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.692
Long Aercules.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:47.926
He's got reach with that neck.

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:48.927
Defense.

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:55.434
COMPUTER: Ready Rock Hammer.

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.469
Battle Gear Boost.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.949
He has Battle Gear?

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.351
Big deal.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.819
I'll show him.

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.720
[shouts]

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.389
Battle Gear Ability activate.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.591
Rock Hammer Beo-Blaster.

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:27.599
What the-- no!

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:28.567
ANNOUNCER: Battle over.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:32.404
Winner, Jake Vallory.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.405
Oh, wow.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:34.573
He actually did it.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:37.342
That was totally awesome.

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:40.612
[laughs] Just like we planned it, dude.

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:42.648
Nice one.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.916
We got taken.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.684
He must have been waiting all along for you to stick

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.219
your neck out like that.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:50.722
I can't believe we got beaten by a newbie like that.

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:52.691
I thought it was because I was getting old,

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:55.060
but maybe it's who's the problem, Mason.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.495
Pipe down, you.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.397
That kid got really lucky.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:00.098
It won't happen again.

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.833
Let's go now.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.036
Stop right there.

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:05.737
Looks like we're too late.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:06.805
Way to go, Jake.

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:07.706
Nice.

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:08.607
Yes.

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:09.908
It was a very impressive win.

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:11.643
Congratulations, Jake.

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:12.544
Good job.

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:13.612
Uh.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.547
I actually won?

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:16.949
Ha ha ha.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.751
Does this mean I'm an official member of the Battle Brawlers?

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:20.953
Oh, yeah!

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:24.990
JULIE: Really?

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.958
Jake won?

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.360
That's totally awesome.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.328
Yeah.

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:31.563
And it's all because of you, Julie.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:32.564
Thanks a lot.

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.933
Well, Dan, all I really did was

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.268
have a little chat with him.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.169
No big deal.

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:38.337
JAKE: Listen up.

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:40.238
The key to winning is strategy.

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:41.139
What?

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:42.040
Huh?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.109
Set!

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.210
Remember, guys.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.245
Visualize the battle and stick to the plan.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:48.146
[whistle blows]

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:49.147
Hut, hut, hut.

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.115
Oh!

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:51.583
Ugh.

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:53.585
What the heck is he doing?

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.120
I wonder if landing on his head

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.356
li that was part of his strategy.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.524
[laughs]

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.592
Oh.

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:01.760
Looks like I'm going to have to give him

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.929
some pointers on teamplay next.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:05.831
[laughs]

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.601
REN (VOICEOVER): More Neathian sleeper agents

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.870
have infiltrated the Bakugan Interspace in search

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.372
of the world's best battlers.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:14.906
It looks like they're trying to kidnap

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.508
and brainwash them to help the Neathians

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.176
in their war against Gundalia.

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:19.845
Then Sid and Zenet showed up again

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.080
and challenged the Brawlers directly to a fight.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.549
As a Gundalian, I didn't feel right letting the Brawlers

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.717
fight my battle for me.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.753
So I joined in with Dan and the others.

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.888
Tune in next time to see the world's greatest brawlers

00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:31.890
battle it out with the Neathian forces.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.959
Bakugan Brawl.

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:37.596
Gundalia's counting on us, Linehalt.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:43.435
