DAN: After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan Interspace

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.658
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.431
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.032
Now Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.200
Bakugan brawl!

THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.983
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.418
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.554
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.360
You've got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.229
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.230
This is Bakugan!

[music playing]

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.942
Next time we see each other, remember what

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.744
I said about showing weakness.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.380
Because I won't be showing you any.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.148
I've had it!

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.151
We have to go after Jake right now.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.821
Gundalia or bust!

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.757
Yes, I think that's our only option.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.359
So any idea how to get there?

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.461
I can lead us.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.595
I know where it is.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.397
Then we leave immediately.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.934
I can't allow it.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:45.939
Trying to infiltrate Gundalia on your own is far too dangerous.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.775
We can't afford to lose you.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:49.776
But Serena.

DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Genesis.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.352
Urgh!

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.488
I hate this!

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:02.922
Come on Dan.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.191
Come on nothing Marucho!

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.361
I know it's dangerous but saving Jake is worth it.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.099
I know you're frustrated.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.100
And angry.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.436
[sigh]

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.671
Aranaut.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.640
I haven't heard from Linus in a while.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.242
Can you please go check on him and make

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.977
sure he doesn't need any help?

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.245
Of course Princess.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.246
I'll be right back.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.385
I've been in your shoes before,

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.154
feeling helpless and wanting to take on the Gundalians

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.523
by myself.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.958
Like that time when I went to retrieve Aranaut.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.928
I'm sorry Fabia.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:42.996
It's too dangerous.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.498
I forbid you from making this rescue attempt.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.367
I don't care what you say Serena!

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.636
Nothing is going to stop me.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.538
Get back here now!

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:52.939
Fabia!

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.608
FABIA (VOICEOVER): I ignored my sister's orders and went ahead.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.177
Even though I was fueled by anger,

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.312
Kazarina nearly defeated me.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.914
I barely made it out of there.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.283
When I returned, Serena opened my eyes.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:07.120
My selfish actions not only put myself in danger

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.955
but also the rest of Neathia.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.823
Had I been captured, our defenses would

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.326
have been seriously weakened.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.228
Serena is right to be concerned.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.196
Losing the Brawlers could cripple any chance

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.667
we have of defeating the Gundalians.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:21.668
Maybe.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:26.272
That still means we're abandoning Jake.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.609
When I moved to Bayview, Jake was the first person

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.910
to be friendly to me.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.880
Heads up!

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.951
Nice hands dude.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.688
Oh!

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.257
Hey, you're the new dude that just transferred in right?

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.391
Yeah, I heard about you.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:46.793
It's Stan right? Or Pan.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.694
Hah, dude.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.462
It's Dan, Dan Kuso.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.330
Right!

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.230
Dan.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.099
My name's Jake, Jake Vallory.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.200
Big up!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.802
Yeah, back at you pal.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:56.836
Jake!

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:57.737
Tickity tock.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:58.871
Let's go!

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.640
Sorry!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.741
Aw, snap!

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.476
[jake laughs]

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.777
Throw much buddy?

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.045
[dan laughs]

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.780
Guess throwing a football is different than throwing

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.215
a Bakugan. - Huh?

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.183
Bakugan?

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.951
Are you a battler dude?

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:12.852
Yeah.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:13.753
Wicked!

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.221
Can you teach me man? Can ya?

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.122
Can ya?

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.323
Come on Dan the man.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.591
Teach me! - Take it easy!

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.792
You're going to give me whiplash.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.997
I was his mentor, and he trusted

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.899
me completely like a brother.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.967
Ah!

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.869
I can't just leave them behind like that.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.537
I won't do it!

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.905
Calm down Dan.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.607
Jake's our brother too.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.310
If we put our heads together, we can figure something out.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.244
(SHAKILY) Oh yeah.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:39.145
OK.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.447
What I think we should do is--

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.282
Anyone else have any ideas?

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.654
Well, when I went after Aranaut,

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:51.024
I snuck in disguised as a Gundalian guard.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.360
I don't think that trick will work with a group this big.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.330
The most obvious way would be to transport ourselves directly

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.499
from Neathia to Gundalia.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.701
Not if Queen Serena has forbidden us to go.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.903
He's right.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.339
They'll never let us anywhere near the transporter room.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.475
I suppose we could try to stow away on a Gundalian ship.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.445
But we still need to figure out how to get aboard.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.247
Could we use our BakuMeters to--

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.314
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Drago.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.616
Huh?

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:17.917
Did you say something?

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.018
What?

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.653
You just said my name.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.355
No I didn't.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:23.690
Sorry.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.060
I could have sworn I heard my name.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.728
I understand you have some video

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.396
that you're anxious to show me.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:31.497
Yes, your highness.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.099
Please have a look.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.100
[gasp]

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.436
Our surveillance cameras captured

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.237
these images when Dragonoid Colossus

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:39.672
flew out of the Sacred Shrine.

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.884
Oh my.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.721
Dragonoid Colossus has chosen Dan and Drago.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:57.557
LINUS: OK guys.

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:59.192
It's finally ready.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.093
Time to eat.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.294
ALL: Huh?

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:03.296
You guys will never come up with a brilliant plan

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.297
on an empty stomach.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:07.667
Wow.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.435
Did you make that?

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.471
It's no big deal, just something

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.506
my mother used to make for us.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.507
Looks great!

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:17.610
Sweet dude!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.611
Yeah!

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.013
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Drago!

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.316
There it is again!

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.051
You're a man of many talents Linus.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.919
Smells amazing man!

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.254
Am I going crazy here?

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.522
Why do I keep hearing voices?

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.361
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Drago, don't be afraid.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:36.295
Come to me!

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:37.196
What?

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:38.264
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Drago!

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:39.365
Better get me a shovel.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.366
[laughs]

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.506
Dan!

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:47.573
Drago!

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.675
What the heck just happened?

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.377
They both disappeared yo!

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:59.218
[groaning]

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:00.853
What?

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:01.788
Shun!

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:02.688
Marucho!

[eerie music]

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.463
Where the heck are we?

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.899
And what happened to everyone else?

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.967
Something weird is going on.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.369
I was hearing voices.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.408
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: You are in between dimensions.

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.409
Whoa!

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:33.619
[roar]

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.421
Who's that?

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.190
Whoa!

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.091
It's the voice I was hearing.

Did you see that?

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.665
I think so.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.841
I am Dragonoid Colossus.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.643
Dragonoid Colossus?

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.011
NURZAK: That is correct.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:01.681
And he is also the guardian of the Sacred Orb.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:02.582
Hey!

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:03.549
I know you.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.518
You're from Gundalia.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:06.519
I'm Nurzak.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.888
I'm Mason.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.756
Remember us?

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.725
What are you doing here?

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.861
Should you not be more worried about why

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.463
it is you're here Dan Kuso?

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:18.764
Hold on a sec.

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:22.168
All I care about is how we get out of this place.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.170
NURZAK: When you're caught between dimensions,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.339
there is usually no hope of escape.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.507
But you have one chance.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:29.408
What is it?

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:30.676
Tell me!

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:33.446
Do you want to leave this place?

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.714
Of course we do.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.949
Then you must fight me!

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:37.950
[roar]

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.119
Careful Dan!

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.931
Well hang on.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.767
What does fighting us have to do with protecting the Sacred Orb?

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.869
Yours is not to question the challenge.

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.906
I have told you what is required to escape from here.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:02.942
Do you accept the gauntlet that's been thrown down?

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.278
or do you choose to rot for eternity?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:08.281
Rotting for eternity doesn't sound very fun to me.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.751
I was just thinking the same thing.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:15.021
We accept!

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.356
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:18.791
Bakugan stand!

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.663
[roaring]

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.568
We got to fight our way out of here, Drago!

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.506
We have to find Dan and Drago, Aranaut!

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:37.076
[upbeat music]

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.478
Let's do this, buddy!

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.547
Ability activate!

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:44.350
Lumino Fernum!

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.185
Let us see if you are worthy.

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.056
Drago!

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.626
[groaning]

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.027
Drago!

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:00.900
Oh no!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.003
You realize you're being tested?

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:07.506
The Sacred Orb is the origin of all Bakugan.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.543
According to the ancient text, since the beginning

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:13.879
Dragonoid Colossus has been tasked with protecting the Orb.

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.720
It was also said that the only two capable of defeating him

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.389
were the dragons of fire and darkness.

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:25.992
Dragonoid and Dharaknoid.

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:28.661
If Drago loses here, then your fate

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:30.730
will be sealed and never again will

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.801
you have the chance to face Dragonoid Colossus.

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:39.405
Instead, he will give Dharak the same opportunity to battle.

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:41.340
And of course if he loses to Dharak,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.576
then the Sacred Orb and all of its powers

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.945
will fall into the hands of Emperor Barodius.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.548
Ability activate!

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.117
Hyper Reflector!

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:58.391
This is the most important test of your lives.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.193
Don't forget that Brawlers.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:03.596
Prove to Dragonoid Colossus that you

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:06.599
are a worthy successor to protect the Sacred Orb

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.367
and keep it safe from Barodius.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:16.709
Hah!

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:19.378
Is this really the best that the Earth has to offer?

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.113
How embarrassing.

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:25.051
Hey buddy, I think this dude is going to be a handful.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.253
That's putting it mildly.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:30.189
So let's show him we can be a handful too, huh?

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:31.624
Sounds like a plan.

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:35.094
Let's kick it Drago!

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.163
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:38.431
Bakugan stand!

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.300
DRAGONOID COLOSSUS: Standing in midair!

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.301
Impressive.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:51.944
SERENA: You're telling me that they

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:53.879
just disappeared into thin air?

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:54.780
Yes.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.881
It's true.

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:58.017
We all saw it happen right in front of us.

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.418
Yeah.

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:03.122
It was right after his BakuMeter lit up like a Christmas tree.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.090
What!

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.492
Why didn't you tell me that before?

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.761
The timing coincides with the activity

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.997
we witnessed from the Sacred Orb earlier Queen Serena.

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:15.334
Is it possible these things are connected?

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.770
SERENA (VOICEOVER): I wonder if their disappearance

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.672
was the will of the Sacred Orb.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.275
Drago Battle Gear!

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:26.212
Let's do it.

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:27.179
Ready Explosix.

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:30.883
Battle Gear boost!

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.227

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:47.833
Explosix Neo!

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.270
Engage!

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.645
Not even a scratch?

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:04.450
Let's try again, but this time from point-blank range.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.920
Do you really expect me to sit and wait for your next attack?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.921
You fool.

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:15.094
Let's speed things up a bit.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.128
Ready Jakalier.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:21.400

Shooting Flamer!

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.758
You are not as fast as you think.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.363
Then I guess it's time to go even faster!

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:52.498
Ready Drago?

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.000
Crank it to 11 buddy.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.569
That's the spirit!

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.270
Ability activate!

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.238
Lumino Hammer!

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.707
[roaring]

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.612
It doesn't matter how much you think

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:07.980
you're increasing your speed.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.615
From my perspective, it's like you're

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.816
standing completely still.

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:11.817
Gah!

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:14.987
What!

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:16.188
Where did he go?

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.425
Peek-a-boo

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.326
[triumphant laugh]

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:21.860
Who's the slow one now?

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:22.895
[roar]

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.165
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.100
Explosix Neo!

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.004

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:37.343
[groaning]

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.583
Congratulations Drago!

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:45.985
You have defeated me.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:46.885
Thank you.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:47.953
I guess.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:50.823
I need you both to pay close attention.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:52.091
Huh?

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.192
Dan!

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.193
Drago!

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:05.504
The ancient texts don't tell the whole story

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.640
of the genesis of the Bakugan.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.042
The first two to be born from the Sacred Orb

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:13.545
were Dragonoid and Dharaknoid.

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:14.446
Whoa!

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.315
Nurzak talked about them.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.417
The rest of the Bakugan species

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:21.820
were born of the DNA sequences that each of these dragon

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.155
fathers possessed.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:26.625
However, though all Bakugan share a few strands of DNA

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:29.328
with the original Dragonoid and Dharaknoid,

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.298
there are only two who are direct descendants of them

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:35.467
and therefore possess the Ultimate Warrior gene.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.069
Ultimate Warrior?

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:38.437
Yes.

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:41.206
The potential to be the most powerful Bakugan in existence.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.975
But there can only be one.

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.311
And neither of the candidates have awoken to their destiny

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.412
yet.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.514
Are you saying that Dharak and I are the two

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.649
direct descendants and that we possess

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:53.319
the Ultimate Warrior gene?

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.887
Now it makes sense.

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:58.223
All the mixed feelings of exhilaration and uneasiness I

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:01.160
had when the Sacred Orb's light was upon me.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.262
And then that strange light that appeared

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.230
the last time I battled Dharak.

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.599
The pieces are finally starting to fit together.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.667
Drago.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.869
You and Dharak are like the opposite sides

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:12.071
of the same coin.

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:14.973
One representing light and the other darkness.

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:18.010
As such you are the only ones who can defeat each other.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.878
Whoever reigns victorious shall wield

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:22.748
the power of the Sacred Orb and will be free to use it

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.550
for good or evil.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.320
If they win, there will be no peace in the universe.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.189
Now that I know my origins, I will

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:33.859
make it my mission to defeat Dharak once and for all.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.694
That fills me with hope.

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.930
Are you sure you can pull off such a feat?

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.331
Absolutely.

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.800
Then it's time that I give you what you've earned.

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:44.169
Whoa!

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.270
What's that?

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.741
[roaring]

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.758
Drago.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.126
Oh snap dude!

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:10.929
It looks like I've evolved again.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.235
From here forward, you will be known as Pyrus Blitz Dragonoid.

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.269
That's a bit of a mouthful.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.171
Is it OK if I just call you Drago?

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.839
That's Mr. Drago to you.

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:21.840
Yeah.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:25.177
[alarm blaring]

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.416
Status report!

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.850
There's been a dimensional anomaly

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.452
near the third shield sir.

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:34.353
[all gasp]

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.155
The Gundalians!

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:37.189
Put it on the screen!

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:41.360
I see something,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.728
It's Dragonoid Colossus!

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.596
Hey!

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:45.597
And Dan!

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:49.868
Look!

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:52.337
[roaring]

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:57.876
What's up guys?

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:58.777
What do you mean?

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.045
You tell us.

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.381
Where did you guys disappear too?

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:06.418
Yeah, why does Drago look like he's evolved again, huh?

00:18:06.518 --> 00:18:09.588
But first, tell us how you wound up riding--

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:12.291
Huh?

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:13.525
Master Nurzak!

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.027
Mason!

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:17.095
Did you miss us, Ren?

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.964
I thought you were goners.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:22.534
You better explain why you have Gundalians with you.

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:24.903
I found these guys trapped between dimensions.

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.139
I know we've had our differences in the past and all that,

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:29.575
but I couldn't just leave them there.

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.410
That'd be way too harsh.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.612
How do you know we can trust them?

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.147
Because it was Barodius who sent

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.782
them there in the first place.

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.917
Please believe me when I say that there

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:43.355
is no loyalty in my heart for Emperor Barodius.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.625
He is a power-crazed dictator who must be stopped.

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:49.661
I tried before, but I was betrayed by Kazarina.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:51.396
And that is why he banished me.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:54.633
[roaring]

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.768
I have always feared and respected

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.504
the power of the Sacred Orb.

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:02.741
Unlike Barodius, I have no desire to possess it.

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:05.711
That is why, Princess, if you allow me,

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.981
I will fight by your side to defeat my former master

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.083
and protect the Sacred Orb with my life.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.554
And we'll fight too.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.089
Won't we Mason?

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:19.591
Well it's not exactly like I can go back there,

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:22.027
not after they've already tried to get rid of me once.

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:29.101
For now, I'm prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:32.204
But I'll be watching the both of you.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:33.805
Whatever you say.

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:36.141
Hey, do you think you can go a day without acting

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.142
like a smart aleck?

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:39.044
Can you go a day without nagging?

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:40.412
I guess that's a no then.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:41.947
NURZAK: I promise that the kindness

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:43.415
and forgiveness you have shown us,

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.083
Princess, will not be forgotten.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.219
Actions speak louder than words.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:50.088
Then how about we quit all this talking and get a move on,

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:50.989
huh guys?

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.058
Get a move on to where Dan?

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:54.526
After what you just went through,

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.361
don't you want a breather?

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.430
A breather, are you nuts?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.032
We got to go to Gundalia to grab Jake!

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:00.933
[all gasp]

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.634
But how Dan?

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:03.669
[grunt]

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.940
Dragonoid Colossus has more than enough

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.142
strength to get us there.

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:11.910
Hop on everyone.

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:16.448
Awesome!

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:18.617
Yeah!

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.085
Best road trip ever!

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:23.722
Hah!

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:28.427
Hold on everyone!

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.028
Next stop Gundalia.

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.965
[upbeat music]

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.077
Stay strong Jake.

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.478
We're coming for you pal!

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.848
[roaring]

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:58.590
I hope you know what you're doing Brawlers.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.859
May the Sacred Orb protect you.

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:09.534
DAN: Thanks to Dragonoid Colossus and his massive power,

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.036
we finally found a way to Gundalia.

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:13.305
All we had to do was find Jake, and then scoop him up

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:14.473
and head back to Neathia.

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:16.108
Then Ren changed the plan.

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.776
I guess there were a bunch of his former teammates

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:20.278
who needed to be rescued from Kazarina's lab.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.980
Sure it made the mission way more dangerous,

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.483
but no one deserves to be stuck in her house of horrors.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.119
The only tricky part was actually finding the lab.

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.554
You've got to tune in to see where our search landed us.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.590
We've seen some heavy battle action before,

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.559
but we've never had Dragonoid Colossus on our team.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.396
This is going to be seismic!

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.731
