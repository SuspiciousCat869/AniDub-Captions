DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.920
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.123
Now earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.692
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:29.095
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.464
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.066

NURZAK: The Sacred Orb that Emperor Barodius seeks not only

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.720
holds the secret to the origin of the Bakugan,

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.756
but it is also the source of their ability

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.391
to continually evolve.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.560
An object possessing such great power

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.328
is incredibly dangerous to anyone who

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.031
does not fully understand it.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.899
That is the reason why the emperor's

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.802
father chose not to pursue it.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.871
He believed it would bring about the destruction

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.639
of anyone who possessed it.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.608
Then why does Emperor Barodius have

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.110
such a lust for the Sacred Orb?

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.414
He believes that he can harness the Orb's power

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:58.651
and use it to his own advantage.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.120
[laughs] Surely you realize that my father was

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.990
a superstitious fool, Nurzak.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.760
There is no reason to fear the power of the Sacred Orb,

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.497
rather we should embrace it and use it to create

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.098
the Ultimate Warrior Bakugan.

CAPTAIN ELRIGHT: Thanks to the power from Drago's element,

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:39.526
the restored second shield is even stronger than before.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.562
The Subterra ship we spotted is likely just a scout,

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.831
otherwise we'd be under attack now.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.300
The battlements are all rebuilt, so now what?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.637
Maybe we should send out some of our own scouts?

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.505
We need to be cautious.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.707
I say we put a team together and go restart

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.075
the first security shield.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.677
We can do it.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.479
The Gundalians have retreated for now,

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.415
so it'll be easy to creep right in under their noses.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.351
So I guess you have a plan of attack then, Dan.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.921
Well, I, um, uh--

[music playing]

You're clueless, aren't you?

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:18.898
Mm- hmm.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:19.799
Ah!

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.700
Hmm.

BARODIUS: Our scouts have reported

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.338
that the second shield is operating at increased power.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.507
Tell me you've got a strategy, Kazarina.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.743
If we increase Exokor's ability level to a class two,

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.712
then regardless of the shield strength

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.948
I am confident that Dharak will be able to crush it

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.282
like a tin can.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.551
Those are strong words, Kazarina.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.953
Yes.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.556
How long would it take to give Exokor the required overhaul?

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.091
Three days.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.960
Are you serious?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.629
Who knows what the Neathian forces are doing while we

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.898
sit here twiddling our thumbs.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.500
Emperor Barodius, I recommend that we

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.902
strike back immediately.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.537
Did you hear me?

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.405
The shield is stronger than before.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.374
It would be a struggle for our troops to breach it

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.275
should they attack.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.776
And whose fault is that?

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.545
Grr.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:06.879
Grr.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.581
Gill makes a good point.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.216
Every moment we give the Neathians

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.018
provides them with an increased advantage,

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.486
which we cannot afford.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.990
The fact is, we must be ready to attack at any moment,

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.325
and we will do so, Kazarina.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.460
Yes, sire.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.028
I want you to lead a reconnaissance mission

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:24.364
so you can advise on our first strike point.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.932
Take Nurzak with you.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:26.899
Me, sire?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.534
Wouldn't I be better, uh--

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.970
How dare you question the emperor's orders?

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.072
Why don't you leave the strategizing

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.141

Talk to me.

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:43.616
The dimensional radar has picked up

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:44.651
another ship approaching.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.386
It's definitely Gundalian in origin.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:47.820
It's a Haos ship.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.689
It's Kazarina.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.325
Nurzak, Emperor Barodius has ordered

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.327
the both of us to lead a reconnaissance mission

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.228
on the surface.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.529
NURZAK: Very well then.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.603
Gill better not have any ideas about being second-in-command.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.872
That will never happen.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.708
Mason, I hope for your sake you prove

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.510
more useful than your counterparts

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.879
Sid, Jesse, and Lena did.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.616
Get there and bring me some results.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.985
Yes, Mistress Kazarina.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.086
Be on your way.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.654
I'll send your orders soon.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:22.655
Yes, ma'am.

KAZARINA (VOICEOVER): I'll knock down the second shield

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.662
and prove to Emperor Barodius that I am the only one

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:33.499
worthy of being his right hand.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.035
Looks like their scout ship has picked up a friend.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.771
Well Dan, it's not an attack force yet,

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.040
but it's safe to say they're gearing up for something.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.476
Yeah, yeah, but what, dude?

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:44.544

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.112
It's making me crazy.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.947
Well, rather than sitting around guessing,

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.882
why don't we take a look for ourselves?

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.017

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:51.918

OK, great.

We're a team, Mason.

Mistress Kazarina, Mason and Avior have fled the ship!

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:56.949
Huh, what?

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.351

Grr.

You need to calm down, Kazarina.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.224
Where does he think he can go?

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.927
Is it possible that he's switching sides on us?

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:09.061
Oh!

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.696
How dare he?

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.732
After giving him a chance to redeem himself,

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.600
he's going to betray us and humiliate

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.602
me in front of the emperor!

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:18.738
Just take it easy, Kazarina.

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.439
He can't get very far.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.507
Nurzak?

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.876
For the time being, this is our secret.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:27.280
If I capture him quickly, the emperor will never know.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.383
You would like that wouldn't you because then I would

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.018
be in your debt, of course.

Well, your teammates have been taken down one by one.

Aren't you worried your days are numbered?

I prefer to focus on the task at hand, which is why I have

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:36.962
Ahh!

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:43.936
[groaning]

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:47.039
[mystical sounds]

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:57.916
[grunting] Ahh!

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.918
Mason!

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:01.887
[grunting]

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.990
[mystical sounds]

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:06.992
Ah!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.898
Somethings wrong with the Sacred Orb.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:15.601
Our sensors are picking up a massive dimensional twister

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.069
near the front line.

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.003
Oh no.

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.872
That's where Fabia and Marucho are.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:20.839
Watch out!

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:23.308
That's a dimensional twister.

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.411
If we get caught up in that we'll be

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:26.578
bounced around between dimensions

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.547
and won't be able to make our way back.

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:30.015
That's not good.

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:33.152
The Sacred Orb is angry.

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:35.154
NURZAK: It is sending us a warning.

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:36.121
Huh?

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.089
Oh!

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.023
Hmm.

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:41.026
[mystical sounds]

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.731
It seems that our former emperor's

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.233
theory was correct after all.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.135
It is time we retreat, Sabator.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.071
Yes, sir.

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.605
Master Nurzak!

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:54.840
Trust me, Ren.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.943
We do not want to anger the Sacred Orb any further.

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.111
Huh?

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.413
They're escaping!

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:02.714
Ready to go?

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:03.715
Yes.

00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:07.219
[transporter sounds]

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:10.956
Ren, no!

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.358
Marucho, don't go!

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.861
[grunting]

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.132
We'll protect you, Princess.

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.701
[mystical sounds]

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:30.142
[action music]

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:53.599
I learned some very valuable truths today.

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:54.600
How about you?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.268
What have you learned, Ren?

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.511
[soft music]

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.013
Thank goodness you both made it back safely.

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.550
So why do you think the Sacred Orb got so gnarly?

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.019
Maybe it was all that earthquake action

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.121
from the battling that made it mad.

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.389
I don't think so.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.725
We've been fighting the Gundalians for quite some time.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.494
That's right, and if the quakes from those battles

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.596
didn't anger it, then why now?

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:26.698
Something must have changed.

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:29.601
What was different about this battle?

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:32.604
The difference is there were two friends fighting each other

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:34.206
on the battlefield today.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.340
What do you mean?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.576
I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm telling

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.311
you Ren will come back to us.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:45.117
You allow that worthless Mason to escape

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.219
and you lose to the Brawlers!

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.221
I am sorry Emperor Barodius.

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.322
Please forgive me.

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:51.990
I'll do anything!

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.194
You have already done enough.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.162
[explosive sound]

00:19:57.262 --> 00:19:58.163
Oh!

00:19:58.263 --> 00:20:12.511
[screams] [moans] [heavy breathing]

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.947
What do you want?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.481
I'm sorry.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:20.452
I didn't get Mason, but the pain of your punishment will pass.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:23.689
Did you come here to offer me hollow words of condolence,

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:25.424
or are you just trying to rub it in?

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:28.727
Either way, I don't have time for this, Nurzak.

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:33.699
Actually Kazarina, the real reason that I came

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.501
was to tell you that I'm leaving the emperor.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.837
Why should I care about that?

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:41.773
Because now that Gill is the emperor's second-in-command,

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:44.643
it would seem that you need to hang your hat somewhere else,

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:45.711
and quickly.

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:46.845
Ha!

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.847
You don't beat around the bush, do you Nurzak?

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.653
Very well then, consider us partners in crime.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.400
ZENET: Totally had it with that loser Ren.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.969
He keeps blowing it, yet somehow Emperor Barodius

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.705
keeps him around and punishes everyone else for his failures.

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:16.208
Well, I'm not taking the fall for him, that's for sure.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.645
No one's going to erase me for something that's not my fault.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:22.147
It's time the others knew what a valuable member of the team I

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:23.348
really am.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.317
I'll use that weirdo Shun to help me demonstrate

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.985
my mad brawling skills.

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.821
Maybe you should tune in as well to see me in action.

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.823
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.125
That's right.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.927
Girls rock and I'll prove it.

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:39.097
