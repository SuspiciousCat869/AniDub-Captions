DAN: After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan Interspace

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.479
and forced us out, things took a turn for the worse

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.980
in the battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.616
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.017
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.854
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.123
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.625
to keep Barodius from stealing the Sacred Orb.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.062
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.865
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.008
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
Got to give it your all.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.283
This is the final stand.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.651
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.554
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.360
You've got to fight for what's right

Something must have happened to Dan and the others Ren.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.583
Do you think they saw us?

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.952
It sounds like they did.

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:28.088
Well, I'm guessing we should make the first move then.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.088
OK.

Hey there guys!

Glad you're here.

MASON: Why does Barodius wear suspenders?

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.733
It's to keep his pants up.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:14.968
Huh?

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:15.969
Correct.

Ah.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.874
What's this?

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.344
It's a top secret lair that Nurzak built.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.912
So where is he then?

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.148
He sacrificed himself to save me.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.949
[sigh]

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.851
Man, that's terrible news.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.086
What happened to Dan?

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.921
Have you seen him?

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.756
Yes, he's been captured.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.458
They've got Drago too.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.792

It's complete.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.693
I guess it's time we take the good news to Emperor Barodius

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:14.694
then.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.698
[roaring]

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:22.268
So you've managed to synchronize Drago's DNA?

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.804
Does that mean it's ready to be spliced with Dharak's

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.040
so we can trigger an evolution?

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.408
Yes sire.

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.010
I should warn you that forcing Dharak's body to assimilate

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.947
the foreign DNA will be extremely painful

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.815
and could cost him his life.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:37.550
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.620
Why would we risk such a thing?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.290
You can play mad scientist all you want with the other Bakugan

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.360
Kazarina, but not with the Emperor's and not

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.962
with our best weapon.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.564
Enough!

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.499
I want to evolve!

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.602
Let's do this now!

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:56.669
Hmm.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.571
You heard him Kazarina.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.106
Let's proceed.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.174

You can't really--

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.012
Silence Gill!

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.814
Don't underestimate Dharak.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.918
Very well Dharak.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:15.088
Prepare yourself and I will begin the DNA transfusion.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.928
Bring it on!

Incredible!

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.964
[panting]

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.507
Did he really evolve that quickly?

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:10.543
Yes, the transfusion was a success!

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.745
Would you like to rename him sire?

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.147
Hmm.

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.449
[growling]

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.818
I think I will call him Phantom Dharak.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:21.487
I like it.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.562
I can feel the energy flowing through my veins!

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:33.566
It keeps growing in intensity.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.769
Wake Drago and prepare him for battle.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.638
I'm ready to crush him.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:39.906

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.810
Huh, interesting.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.012
What is it Kazarina?

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:49.882
As you are already aware sire, Neathia's third shield

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.552
is equipped with a special security feature that prevents

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.654
any Bakugan who possesses Gundalian

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:58.024
DNA from passing through it.

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.760
But now that it's been fused with Drago's DNA,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.730
Dharak's new genetic sequence has mutated and is

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.032
no longer purely Gundalian.

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.500
What are you talking about?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.269
What abomination have you created Kazarina?

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:14.140
He's a hybrid whose genetic code will allow him to pass

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.875
through the third shield.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.410
Excellent work.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.978
It's that kind of strategic thinking

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:22.215
that I look for in my number two Kazarina.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.182
[gasp]

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.617
Thank you sire.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.386
I do it in your honor.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.955
GILL (VOICEOVER): I can't believe he's replaced

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.790
me with her as his number two.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.192
How dare he turn his back on me like that,

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.594
after my years of loyalty?

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.063
Where's Drago!

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:38.865
[grunting]

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.100
I want to crush him!

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.604
Let me out of here right now!

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:45.772
Settle down Dharak!

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.240
[roaring]

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.142
BARODIUS: With the Brawlers scattered about here

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.344
on Gundalia, now is the perfect time

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.045
to attack the third shield.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.114
So pull yourself together immediately.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.216
Do you understand me?

00:06:57.316 --> 00:07:00.853
You will have a chance to take care of Drago later.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:01.921
Too bad.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.524
I want to finish him now!

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:06.058
What did you say?

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.161
As you wish master.

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.137
You're in charge while I'm gone Kazarina.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.873
I want you to find the rest of the Brawlers

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.175
and eradicate them.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.178
And what shall I do with him?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.879
Whatever you see fit.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.448
Consider it a gift from me.

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:31.784
But don't you dare lay a finger on Drago.

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.386
He's all mine.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.188
Don't worry Dharak.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.088
Gill.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.623
You will come with me.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.624
Yes sire.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:45.631
Try not to mess up Gill.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.934
I'd hate to see you get left behind

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.635
or become a casualty of war.

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.637
[tense music]

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.214
REN: So then, you guys weren't able to capture Jake?

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.582
SHUN: Unfortunately no.

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.450
It also seems that your old teammates have

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.452
been brainwashed by Kazarina.

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.388
This Gundalian invasion has been a serious bummer.

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:11.891
Yeah, they definitely thrashed us pretty hard.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:16.128
I'm really worried about what they might do to Dan and Drago.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.496
I know.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:20.700
If they brainwashed them like they did to my friends, then

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.834
we're in trouble.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.870
Then I guess we better break Dan and Drago out

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.971
before that can happen.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.172
Yeah.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.107
And remember, failure isn't an option this time.

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.943
I'm going to find Master Nurzak.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:34.247
There's a chance he might still be alive.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.147
Oh.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.249
OK Mason.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.352
If you insist on that, then we'll split up.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:42.555
Hey Fabia, are you coming?

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.223
Didn't you tell me that Nurzak got

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.892
swept away after saving you?

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.429
Yes, that's right.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.498
Then wouldn't you say you have an obligation

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.066
to see if he's OK?

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.168
Come on, Princess.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.570
What do you think?

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.205
What's wrong precious?

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:02.541
Are you too good to risk your life for a lowly Gundalian?

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.609
It's not that.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.344
I appreciate what Nurzak did.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.380
But I owe Dan and Drago more.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.182
When I came to Earth, they immediately accepted me

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.417
as one of their own.

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.753
Then when I asked for help, they came to Neathia

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.988
without any hesitation.

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.891
Please understand I owe a bigger debt to them.

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:23.963
Good luck.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.598
I really hope you find him.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:26.999
Hmm.

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.100
OK.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.903
I get it.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:31.904
Be careful.

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.620
Did you see the way she sloughed us off like that?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.155
I never did like Fabia.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.056
Trust me.

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.457
We're better off without her.

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:53.359
Avior, the Princess is ail right.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:01.334
Let's go Avior!

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.735
We've got to find Nurzak!

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:08.007
Why can't we wake up from this nightmare Drago?

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.613
Have you figured out what you're going

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:14.981
to do with the Brawler yet?

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:15.881
Huh.

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.984
Decisions, decisions.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:23.389
It's not exactly like you need another zombie servant.

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:25.524
Maybe you should think about using him to send

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:28.027
a message to the resistance?

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.996
Interesting.

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:33.132
It certainly would break the Brawlers' spirits if I finished

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.800
off their precious leader.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.135
They'd never recover.

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:37.970
[laughter]

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.841
I'm really sorry mistress Kazarina,

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.744
but Marucho got away from me.

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.613
Never mind that right now Jake.

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:50.483
I want you to get a good look at your old friend here.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.018
Pathetic isn't he?

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.886
Why don't you stick around and watch

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.588
me put him out of his misery?

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.456
I'm sure you'll find it amusing.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.795
[explosion]

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:03.696
Ugh!

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:04.597
What happened?

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:07.633
[alarm blaring]

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.971
What's going on?

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.339
We're being attacked.

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:14.807
I want a status report, immediately!

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:15.708
Yes.

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:18.210
[tense music]

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.516
Hit it Linehalt!

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:24.717
Don't hold back.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:27.620
Don't worry!

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.621
I won't.

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.726
Come on!

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:38.564
GUARD: Sir!

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.332
We have trespassers in the castle!

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.968
So, the first attack was a decoy.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.941
It sounds like the Brawlers have

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.509
infiltrated the castle again.

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.411
Those insolent fools.

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.748
Can I trust you to take care of this for me Gill?

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.249
Yes.

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:59.819
I'll take the others to Neathia with me.

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.222
This way!

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:06.892
Going somewhere Brawlers?

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:08.661

Hah!

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.339
And now you're going to pay.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.975
We've taken you down before Gill.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.478
And we'll do it again, so you better move.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.047
I hardly think you're in the position to be making

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.316
threats right now Brawler.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:34.487
Perhaps, you should accept that this is the end for you.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:35.788
Say goodbye.

Hold on a sec!

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.895
We haven't even launched our Bakugan yet!

Hey Ren!

00:12:58.544 --> 00:12:59.979
We've got this one handled.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.514
Go ahead.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.448
Thanks Ren.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.216
Be careful!

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.217
Ren!

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:07.820
Don't worry

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.954
(WORRIEDLY) Huh.

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:09.855
SHUN: Fabia!

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.857
Let's go!

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:12.858
Come back.

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:16.629
Huh?

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:17.963
Don't worry about them.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.431
You're fighting me now.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:20.466
[grill growls]

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:27.206
There's an elevator up ahead that will take us down.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.441
How do we know they won't be waiting to ambush us

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:30.943
once we step out of the lift?

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:33.045
We don't have a choice!

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.446
Fingers crossed.

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.049
I just hope Dan and Drago can hold on.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.586
You need to focus.

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:42.121
Stop worrying about Ren.

00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:43.656
He can handle the likes of Gill.

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:44.557
He'll be fine.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.125
You're absolutely right.

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.494
Thank you Aranaut.

It sound like we're missing quite the party.

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:21.660
Should we go and join in?

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.230
As much fun as that sounds, we have more

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.265
important things to deal with.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.333

Once this beam hits him, he'll be vaporized.

I just need to lock on target.

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:53.592
I have an idea!

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:57.129
Perhaps, you would like to do the honors?

00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:01.467
That is, if you think you can.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.102

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:13.859
Ability activate!

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.295
[grunting]

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:17.863
Mirage Fist!

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.735
[roaring]

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.075
Let's go.

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:32.744
This place is starting to remind me of everyone

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:33.879
we've lost in battle.

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:44.256
I know you feel guilty, but losing him wasn't your fault.

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.758
Ah?

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.294
You're thinking about Nurzak aren't you?

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:50.496
Oh, Yes.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:51.697
Right.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.200
Maybe Mason is right and Nurzak is still alive.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.302
All we can do is hope for the best.

00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:00.506
In the meantime, shall we?

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:04.076
OK.

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:05.277
Hold on tight.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.278
You bet!

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.317
FABIA (VOICEOVER): I guess Aranaut

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:15.487
doesn't remember his former master Jin after all.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.594
Ability activate!

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.062
Dark Saber!

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:25.063
Hah!

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:28.267
Battle Gear, ability activate!

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:31.303
Vicer Orochi!

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:35.274
Ren, how dare you betray the emperor after he allowed

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.176
you a life above ground!

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.077
Huh, you've got to be kidding me!

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.412
What's that?

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:43.782
I fell for the emperor's tricks and did terrible things.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:46.718
But thankfully, the Brawlers forgave me and taught

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.954
me the true meaning of loyalty.

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:51.857
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:52.858
Battle Trubine!

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.963
[groaning]

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:58.964
Hold on pal!

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.732
We just might have to hold them off

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.634
long enough for the others to find Dan and Jake

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:03.635
and get back here.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:05.070
Then we'll have some backup.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.805
OK buddy!

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:08.106
These guys are punks.

00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:09.374
We can win this thing.

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.643
Battle Gear ability activate!

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:13.278
Razoid Charybdis!

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.346
Watch out!

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.519
Hah!

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:22.588
Is that the best you can do?

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:27.793
Pay very close attention to this Jake.

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:31.096
Dan Kuso the mighty leader of the Battle Brawlers

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.298
is about to be reduced to dust.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.435
Battle Gear boost!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.253
[kazarina laughs]

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.968
FABIA: Neathia used to be such a peaceful and wonderful place

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:10.902
to live.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.938
Those times are a distant memory.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.440
Since the Gundalians invaded, life has been a nightmare

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.109
with so many lives lost.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.378
But now, it seems like we actually have a chance

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:20.846
of winning once and for all.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.581
I just hope that the price of peace

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.349
isn't more casualties of war.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:27.085
Unfortunately with Phantom Dharak leading the charge,

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.687
I don't know if that's possible.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:31.490
You should tune in to see what happens!

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.891
The action is so intense.

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:34.393
It's like nothing you've seen before.

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:41.900
