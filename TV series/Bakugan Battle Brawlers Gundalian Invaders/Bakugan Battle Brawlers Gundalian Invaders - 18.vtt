DAN (VOICEOVER): After the Gundalians hijacked Bakugan

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.177
Interspace and forced us out, things

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
took a turn for the worse in the Battle for Neathia.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.649
We decided to join Fabia as she returned home so we

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.051
could help with the fight.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.887
Once we got there, we were made members of the Castle Knights.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.156
Now Earth and Neathia were united in the struggle

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.725
to keep Barodius from stealing the sacred orb.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.129
Lucky for us, we have the most powerful Bakugan, Dragonoid

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.664
Colossus, on our side.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.032
Now, Drago!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.602
Bakugan, brawl!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.571
THEME SONG: What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.975
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.010
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.645
Gotta give it your all.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.080
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.415
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.883
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.718
The power's in your hand.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.788
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:03.296
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.799
This is Bakugan.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.269
[suspenseful music]

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.073
I really don't understand you, Jesse.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.442
Doesn't it tick you off that we're the ones rotting in jail

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.443
here?

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.578
Why should we be their scapegoats, huh?

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.447
The Twelve Orders are blaming us so

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.482
that Barodius will spare them.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.350
Our necks are on the chopping block.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.519
Are you really going to sit there with your nose in a book

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.720
until it's too late?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.290
I never figured you for a coward, Jesse.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.325
I am merely pensive.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.560
Huh?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.161
If we're unhappy with the ending that's

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.863
been penned for us, then perhaps it is

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.932
time we rewrite it ourselves.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.202
Yes, I lost Drago, but the second shield

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.704
would still be down if you hadn't let Dan and Shun

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:45.805
distract you like that.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.507
I know it's your favorite tactic,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.476
but don't think you can shift the blame to me.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.811
I'm not one of your worthless lackeys, got it?

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.146
What?

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.716
There's still one last sucker we can throw to the lions.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:59.285
I never liked Jesse, anyway, so it'll be fun to serve

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.120
him up to Emperor Barodius.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.323
Ugh.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.224
Master!

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.358
Master Stoica, sir!

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.259
STOICA: What is it?

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.293
Jesse's escaped!

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.194
Huh?

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.262
What?

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.763
KAZARINA: Now what, Stoica?

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:14.934
STOICA: Somebody bring me Ren right now!

Guys, pitter-patter.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.384
We're moving as fast as we can.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.285
Yeah.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.553
Quit being so bossy, will you?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.754
Come on, dudes.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:37.457
I bet I could stack 10 bricks before you do two.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.459
Easy, just a little bit further.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.793
Just a-- ah! - Oof.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.694
Ah.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:42.762
Ugh!

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:43.963
I meant to do that.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.965
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.235
[laughter]

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.239
Guys, are we gonna let the Gundalians win?

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.774
BAKUGANS: Never!

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:57.210
Then why aren't we out there fighting?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.211
Hey, Jake.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.613
What's with the grumpy face, huh, dude?

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.781
The second shield is back up--

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.283
Dude, we need to keep hammering at them

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.352
while they're still scrambling for cover.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.354
We need to rebuild first.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:09.656
Drago's right.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:10.690
No, he's not!

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.258
We finally got them on the ropes,

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.760
and now you want to take a break?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.928
We're gonna lose momentum.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:15.862
It's a mistake.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:16.996
Seriously, dude.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:19.098
Ugh, we're not ready.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.366
What do you mean?

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:24.671
The Gundalian forces outnumber us 2 to 1, that's what.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.106
We need to strengthen our fortifications to prepare

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.341
for any future battles.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.810
I didn't come here to play with building blocks.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.713
Hey, guys, can you give us a hand here?

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.715
Yeah, one sec.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.952
Listen, are we cool?

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.987
Yeah, yeah, we're cool, dude.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.655
I'm gonna do a perimeter check.

DRAGO: He reminds me of how you used to be.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.832
Just because I'm new at this doesn't mean I'm stupid.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:55.034
I'm gonna find me some Gundalians to thrash,

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.637
and then I'll show Dan and the others that I was right.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.638
Come on, Jake.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.042
Dan doesn't think you're stupid.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.243
Oh, yeah?

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.247
Well, he sure treats me like it, but not anymore.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.782

It's Jake.

[suspenseful music]

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.272
Why are we headed back toward Neathia?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.475
We should be running in the opposite direction.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.443
We barely made it out of that prison,

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:40.680
so I say it's time to split before they catch us again.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.916
We need to give them one final performance, upon which

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.085
we may be fairly judged.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.253
Whatever.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.155
I still say we run.

[wind rustling]

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.525
Hmm, it's too late for that.

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.764
As you can probably guess, I've

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:01.067
been sent to retrieve you both.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:03.970
And what if we refuse?

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.440
That's a question I don't think you want the answer to.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.176
Why don't you just tell me, Linehalt?

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.778
How about I show you?

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.013
Well, I'm standing right here, Linehalt.

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.181
What are you waiting for?

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.683
You're finished.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:20.019
That's enough, Linehalt. Master Stoica

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.356
has assured me you have nothing to fear if you return with me

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.390
immediately to Gundalia.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.029
You'll be safe.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:33.533
Hmm.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.235
By the pricking of my thumbs, something

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.171
wicked this way comes.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.574
Do you understand what I'm saying, Ren?

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:42.575
Not really.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:49.849
What I'm saying is that I don't believe

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.617
you're being honest with me.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.919
Huh?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.920
Take him.

Jesse.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm ready.

[wind rustling]

JAKE: What is that?

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.267
Dude, no one told me about these things!

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.168
Ah!

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.604
This is gonna hurt!

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:12.572
Ooh!

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:13.573
Ugh!

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:14.674
You gotta lay off the cheeseburgers.

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.309
Ugh! Dude.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.276
That was too close.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.845
We should head back now.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:20.146
Forget it.

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.148
I didn't almost get chomped by a giant head of lettuce

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.650
just to go back to Dan with my tail between my legs.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.787
You're supposed to be my partner, now act like it.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.322
OK, calm down.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.157
Dude, I am totally calm!

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.259
FABIA: You could have fooled me, Jake.

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:34.994
What are you doing out here?

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.529
Fabia?

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:37.663
I'm not going back.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:39.432
The faster we take down Gundalia,

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.434
the faster peace returns to Neathia.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.369
You're very brave, Jake, but if you really

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.005
want to help Neathia, don't try and take on the Gundalian

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.039
invaders by yourself.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.107
You're not strong enough.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.108
Huh?

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.546
The truth is, none of us are.

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.081
We need to stick together.

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.482
On our own, we're vulnerable.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.751
But united, we're strong.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.855
A loss now, Jake, would be just devastating, given

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.557
the progress we've made so far.

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:05.691
Hmm.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.227
I never thought of it that way.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.996
FABIA: It may not seem like much to you,

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.665
but believe me when I say that the smiling faces on

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.901
that building site today were the first I

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:18.371
can remember seeing in Neathia since this war began.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.573
And now with the brawlers by our side,

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:24.510
I truly believe peace will return to my home.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.312
That's all I really want.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.314
Can we go back?

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:29.315
Hmm.

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:33.786

Huh?

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.257
Princess, stand back!

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.861

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.634
FABIA (VOICEOVER): Aranaut, we have to protect the front line.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:52.271
JAKE (VOICEOVER): Coredem, let's serve up another dose of pain!

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.540
How fitting that the co-star of my final

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.976
performance be Princess Fabia.

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.947
I am honored to play opposite such a marquee performer.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:01.848
Wha?

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.182
Huh?

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:06.986
If I'm successful, those who wish to cancel my contract

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:09.222
will instead extend my engagement.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.456
Jesse.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.024
Don't worry yourself, Ren.

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:15.862
If I fail this time, I will return with you.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:20.800
And you'll still have your trophy to give to your masters.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.134
What are you doing?

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.669
Enough with this yacking!

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:26.239
If we're going to fight, then let's fight.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.474
We're ready when you are, pal.

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:29.809
That's right.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.277
I guess we're fighting, Aranaut.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.278
Indeed.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.884

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.464
Bakugan, stand.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.965
Rise, Ventus Plitheon.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.240
It's gonna feel great to have one more kick at the can.

[roars]

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.544

Bakugan, stand!

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:10.149
The only one who'll be doing the kicking is me.

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:11.384
Here we go.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.319
Bakugan, brawl.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.254
Bakugan, stand.

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.189
Go, Haos Aranaut.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.992
In the name of all the Neathian Castle Knights,

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.627
I will triumph!

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.499
No, Ren.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.968
This performance is mine, solo.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.536
Gate card, open.

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:32.471

BOTH: Ah!

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.441
Don't worry, kiddies.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:39.211

Oh, yeah!

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:58.190
While armor may provide a frightening appearance,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.359
it is really what lies in the heart of your enemy

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:01.560
that one must fear.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.663

Are you OK, Aranaut?

I have been battling like an amateur.

Forgive me, Princess.

We can still win this one.

I let you down.

I told you to stay out of this.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.479
This may have started as a solo,

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.548
but it will end as a duet.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.376
Bakugan, brawl!

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:45.678
Bakugan, brawl!

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:46.578
Bakugan, brawl!

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.247
Bakugan, brawl!

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.448
ALL: Bakugan, stand!

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:52.551
[roaring]

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:53.585
Ability activate.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.020
Life Eater!

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.488
Ability activate.

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:58.223
Razen Breaker!

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.259
Do you noobs think you can handle--

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:03.162
--a dual attack?

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.531
[yelling]

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.900
Ability activate.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.801
Light Wave!

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:09.802
Ah!

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:17.309
She nullified the ability.

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:19.278
It doesn't matter!

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.480
Gate card, open!

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.581
Ring Zero!

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:23.882
[grunting]

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.050
What's happening?

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.019
FABIA: They nullified our ability.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.054
Here's a little Subterra styling.

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.222
Ability activate!

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:31.957
Change Exia!

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:35.461
[growling]

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.464
What the?

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:41.667
[energetic music]

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:42.735
Do something!

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.204
He flipped the gate card effect?

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:46.171
Bingo.

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.006
Change Exia is a reversal trick that

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.209
takes the effect of your opponent's gate card

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.411
and turns it back on them.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.512
Now we can't--

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:54.480
FABIA: Can't win.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.081
That's right.

00:16:56.181 --> 00:17:00.786
Neathia's future is one of freedom from tyranny, Jesse.

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.287
Oh, no.

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:03.555
Ability activate!

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:05.824
Aurora Impact!

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:09.328
The final curtain is about to drop--

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:10.829
on you!

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:11.797
Ah?

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:15.367
[yelling]

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.207
BOTH: [grunting]

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:24.176
Victory is ours, Princess.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:27.579
[energetic music]

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.885
Time for my final bow.

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.022
Let's go, Ren.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.957
Huh?

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.294
I am, after all, a man of my word.

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:48.167
And now I must face my critics, regardless of the outcome.

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:49.168
Very well.

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:58.377
That's right!

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:00.079
We kicked those dudes to the curb.

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:06.218
[dramatic music]

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:16.228
KAZARINA: Have you finally accepted your fate, Jesse?

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:19.765
Or do you need to rack up another colossal failure for it

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.066
to sink in?

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.535
Nice work on the retrieval, Ren.

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.604
In fairness, I was also involved

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.239
in the battle that was lost.

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.942
Well, I'll let you share that information with Emperor

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.110
Barodius in person.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.611
[growls]

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:37.349
So, are you two finally ready to pay the piper?

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.518
It is you who needs to be ready to bid

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.920
adieu to Gundalia's finest actor.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.821
Wha?

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:43.755
Huh?

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:45.591
The applause has finally faded,

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:47.259
and the curtain has dropped.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.129
There are no more encores to be had on this stage or any other.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.465
So now the actor takes his final bow.

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.366
Ha!

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.701
Are you serious?

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.236
Do we really have to listen to this?

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:00.038
Now you know how I feel.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.740
I can't take anymore of this.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.108
I'm ready to go now.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.810
Anything to get away from this weirdo.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:05.711
Huh?

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.646
Plitheon?

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.048
Finally at a loss for words, Jesse?

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.584
What a shock.

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:15.654
[dramatic music]

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:16.622
Huh?

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:21.560
Ah.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.695
Turning on your battle partner, Plitheon?

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.264
You truly are despicable.

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:28.367
[laughs] Lower than scum.

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:31.370
[grunting]

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.205
Plitheon, it's OK.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:36.909
Sometimes co-stars have friction between them.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:40.579
It's a natural part of the relationship.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.781
I meant what I said.

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:46.318
Call me what you want, but I'm done with this guy.

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:49.888
[dramatic music]

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:02.367
Ren, it looks like the spotlight

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.769
has shifted to you now.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:17.482
Farewell.

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.534
STOICA: So we stick to the plan and blame this defeat on Jesse,

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:36.435
got it?

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.369
Yes.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:38.737
That way, Emperor Barodius doesn't

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.072
question our competency.

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:41.807
And what are you two doing down

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:46.078
here, whispering and scurrying around like a couple of rats?

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:47.779
You may have everyone else fooled,

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:49.915
but you don't have me fooled.

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:53.318
I can smell your desperation and your treachery

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.720
from a mile away.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.088
[chuckles]

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:57.089
Ugh!

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:03.061
[laughing]

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.333
MARUCHO (VOICEOVER): With the second shield

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.268
back up and working, we shifted our focus

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:11.737
to rebuilding our bases.

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:14.373
Unfortunately, it didn't take long for the Gundalians

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:16.274
to start circling overhead.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.110
Then something incredible happened.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.445
Somehow, Ren managed to make his way through.

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.481
Somewhere, there was a breach in our security,

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.783
but figuring out where would have to wait.

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:27.519
Ren and I had a score to settle first.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:30.489
Tune in to catch some monstrous brawling action!

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:33.859
Bakugan, brawl!

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.895
This battle is unbelievable!

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:40.332
