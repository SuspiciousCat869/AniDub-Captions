WEBVTT

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.975
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.910
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.780
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.083
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.686
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.254
environment.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.556
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.626
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.595
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.430
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.898
and is trying to take over.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.466
OK, buddy. Let's do this.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.367
All right.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.935
Bakugan Brawl.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.905
THEME SONG: What are you going to do?

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.308
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.310
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.512
Got to give it your all.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:47.414
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.748
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.550
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.951
The power's in your hand.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.088
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.693
You got to fight for what's right

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.229
before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.564
This is Bakugan.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.241
What just happened?

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.610
I trusted you, Ren.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.012
Ah.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.281
Brawlers welcomed you into our family.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:27.253
As of now, our friendship is completely over, Marucho.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.288
[gasps]

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:39.199
I can't believe he betrayed Marucho like that.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.501
I guess little Maruch is taking it pretty hard,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.402
isn't he?

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.536
Yeah.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.040
He's been hiding out in his house ever since.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.542
I should probably go check on him.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.677
Wait.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.278
I think it's better if you just leave him be.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.880
Don't you care about your friend?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.849
Of course, I do, but--

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.317
Marucho needs our support.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.852
Let's go.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.153
Huh?

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.088
I finally did it.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.756
ALL: Huh?

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.792
Finally did what, buddy?

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:06.960
Check this out.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.899
Akwimos?

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.867
I don't understand.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.870
What's the big deal about Akwimos?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.772
Just take a listen.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.174
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.075
Huh?

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:22.976
[groans]

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:23.877
Cool is the rule, dud.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.079
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.882
[energetic music]

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:33.620
DAN (VOICEOVER): The Bakugan Brawlers in \"Hostile Takeover.\"

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.521
Cool.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.189
How did you get him to talk?

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.292
Ever since Jake mentioned that only real Bakugan speak,

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.929
I've been working on a speech program for the digital ones.

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.164
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.165
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.399
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.500
Go away.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.669
Why does he keep saying that over and over?

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.038
I programmed him to have a laid back personality,

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.273
and this is what the speech generator

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.173
came up with randomly.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.676
[laughs] Laid back, huh?

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:57.877
You bet.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:01.014
Well, buddy, looks like you're in better spirits.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.782
We've got Gundalians to fight.

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.183
I can't stay depressed forever.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.184
Huh?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.521
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.189
You're awfully quiet, Fabia.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.291
What's the matter?

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.191
Huh?

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.593
Oh, it's nothing.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.328
But you sure about that?

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.696
You can tell us anything, you know?

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.000
Fabia?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.336
Sometimes, I worry if you guys ever really believe me.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.437
Huh?

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.206
After being deceived by Ren, how can you

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.107
extend your trust so easily?

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.977
Surely you guys must have a lot of doubts about me.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:31.878
Ha.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.046
Don't worry about it.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.481
We trust you.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.717
When we saw how angry you got about Bakugan

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:41.588
being used in war, we knew you felt the same way we did.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:42.822
I see.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.091
DAN: And that's all the proof we needed.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.826
We're on the same side, Fabia.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.665
Yes, we are.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.667
I think it's time I give you these.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:55.568
Whoa.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.737
Are those new Bakugan?

00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:01.274
FABIA: Meet Aquos Akwimos, Ventus

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:05.078
Hawktor, and Subterra Coredem.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.313
These are the original Bakugan.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.214
Are you sure?

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.182
Of course.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.617
I brought them from Neathia.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.985
Just what I always wanted.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:12.885
Awesome.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.053
A real Bakugan.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.054
Yeah.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:18.758
Hello there.

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:19.659
I'm Shun.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.560
Whoa.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.628
You're the ninja.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.062
That's right.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.197
That's awesome.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.832
Maybe you can help me with my stealth attacks.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.500
I usually more crash and burn with things,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.202
but I know sometimes the subtle approach is better.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.169
What do you say?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.571
Huh?

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.874
Hey, uh, my-- my name is Jake.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.943
That's a strong name.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.245
Nice to meet you, Jake.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:40.780
Oh, man.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.316
The real Coredem is the coolest.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:44.817
My name's Marucho.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:47.253
I'm very pleased to meet you, Akwimos.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.588
What's up, little kid?

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:49.722
What?

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.757
Knock the rock, baby.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.692
Uh, OK.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:53.993
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:54.894
Whoa.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.562
Cool is the rule, huh?

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.463
I like that.

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.032
Oh, it's just a little something

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.600
I programmed him to say.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.868
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.202
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:04.404
Cool is the rule, dude. Yeah.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:05.304
Yeah.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.406
I really dig it, man.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.707
It's awesome.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.742
I think I'm going to use it myself if you don't mind.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.110
Check it out. - Wha--

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.378
Cool is the rule, dude.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.747
[chuckles] Not bad, huh?

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.916
[laughs] This is a real trip, man.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:17.917
No kidding.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.391
KID: I heard that we weren't supposed to battle those guys,

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.793
because they're dangerous.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:29.062
What were they supposed to do?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.230

Oh, no.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.130
We lost.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.631
They're strong.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:06.699
Hm.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.001
Well, you guys are pretty good, I guess.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:09.969
You'll be of use to us.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:10.870
Come on.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.904
Let's go.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:12.905
BOTH: Huh?

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.143
Where'd they go?

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.383
MAN: Loyal soldiers of Emperor Barodius's army, march.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:27.153
Go forth and destroy the enemy Bakugan.

Those Earth children aren't half bad after all.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.932
At this rate, it's only a matter of time

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.168
before we get our hands on the Element, sir.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.137
I'm not sure that we have enough.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:22.375
Go, Ren, and bring me more Bakugan battlers immediately.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.976
I don't care how you do it.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:27.346
Yes, as you wish, sire.

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:28.247
OK.

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:30.449
So remember laid back is the key.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.384
Ready?

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.885
Hey, dudes, take a chill pill.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.320
No need to get your socks in a bunch.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.323
We got no time for the drama ramas, so just relax.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:39.091
Hey, not too bad.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.127
It's not zen, but it'll do.

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:44.430
And so concludes today's lesson on how to be laid back

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.832

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.634
Hey, little dude, I totally dig this whole laid back

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:49.669
way of being.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.103
Thanks for showing me the way, my man.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.405

What just--

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.087
He's taking children back to Gundalia with him to fight.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.589
He's toast.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:10.489
Ha ha.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.524

Hmph.

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.637
Look who showed up.

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.306
You've got some nerve showing your face around here, Ren.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.742
You got no business here.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:32.345
Do you hear me, you creep?

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.113

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:36.916
Actually, you're wrong, Dan.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:37.917
Very wrong.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.088
Let's go.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.724

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.994
Actually, you'll be battling with us.

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:48.928
Huh?

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.162
What are you talking about?

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.864
I recognize you two.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.733
You guys are Casey and Taylor.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.635
You know them?

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:56.536
MARUCHO: Yeah.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.371

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.172
Go ahead and do your thing, guys.

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.308
We'll come back for you a little later.

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:03.609
Come back later?

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.313
Something strange is going on here, Aranaut.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.748
Strange how?

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.583
I'm not sure.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:14.053
I just have a feeling they're up to something.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.756
I think you and I need to follow Ren.

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:18.024
OK.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.726
Get out of the way, guys.

We won't let you mess with Master Ren.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.064
Master Ren?

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:28.534
It sounds like they've been brainwashed by the Gundalians.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:29.735

Your Bakugan are looking pretty beat up, guys.

Oh yeah, pal?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.336
Hey, Shun, why don't we show him exactly how beat up our guys

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.237
are?

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.138
Hm.

[groans]

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.142
What?

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.611
What just happened to me?

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.512
Taylor.

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:28.247
Looks like we got her back.

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:29.548
That's good news.

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:31.717
Hey, better hurry and dive out.

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.352
You're in danger staying here.

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:36.455
Just go.

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.456
Uh, OK.

What's with all the red, dude?

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:33.912
Huh?

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:36.482
The Command Card Ruby Storm increases Rubanoid's power

Hey, Casey.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:39.711

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:42.180
Run now before they grab you again.

Well, that one got away, but I still

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:55.627

Ha.

Right on schedule.

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:25.524
OK.

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.458
This should do it.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:27.926
Hm.

What the--

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.013
Oh, we just got forced out of Bakugan Interspace.

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:50.582
But how?

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:52.150
What is going on, dude?

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.585
I have no idea.

REN (ON COMM): Then let me explain.

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:56.555
Huh?

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:59.691
As of this moment, Bakugan Interspace

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.927
is now under my sole control.

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:02.828

JAKE (VOICEOVER): I can't believe

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:10.836
that super creep Ren took over Bakugan Interspace

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:11.970
and booted us out.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.839
What's even worse is that none of the kids

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.741
want to believe that we're not in charge anymore.

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.209
But it's too dangerous.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.345
We have to stop them from diving in, no matter how we do it.

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.781
Luckily, we managed to figure out a way to hack ourselves

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.816
inside, using our Bakugan.

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:27.285
Just wait till I get my hands on that Ren.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:30.989
I'm telling you, he's going to be one sorry Gundalian.
