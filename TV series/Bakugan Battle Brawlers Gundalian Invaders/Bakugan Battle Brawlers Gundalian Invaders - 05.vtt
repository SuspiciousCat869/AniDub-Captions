[music playing]

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:07.574
DAN (VOICEOVER): Since our return

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.908
to Earth after defeating Zenoheld,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.810
a whole lot has happened.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.713
The most exciting thing is that Bakugan Interspace finally

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.017
went online globally, allowing kids from all over the world

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
to show their battling skills in a safe and friendly

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.187
environment.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.490
Unfortunately, it seems like not everyone

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.559
wants this virtual realm to remain happy and free.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528
A mysterious evil force from another world

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.363
has infiltrated Bakugan Interspace

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.931
and is trying to take over.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.400
OK, buddy, let's do this.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.300
All right!

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.869
Bakugan, brawl!

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.872
THEME SONG: What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.275
The odds are stacked against you.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.277
Back against the wall.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.779
Gotta give it your all.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.347
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.815
This is the final stand.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.216
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.951
The power's in your hand.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.821
Two worlds collide on the inside.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:03.897
You gotta fight for what's right before it's gone, gone, gone.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.932
This is Bakugan.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.400
[dramatic music]

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.938
[crowd cheering]

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.441
This guy's pretty good.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.708
Who is he?

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.144
Don't know, but we're gonna take him down.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.513
Go, Snapzoid!

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.949
[hissing]

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:26.786
Nice play.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:30.657
I can see now why you're a top-rated brawler, kid.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.926
Time for the girls to have a go.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.261
Come on, Glotronoid.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.264
[energetic music]

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.834
[roaring]

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.681
Whoa.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.917
The gentle wind blows like a mournful swan song

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.652
before the final curtain.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.055
Ability activate!

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.056
Balfire!

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:13.132
Aw, man.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.536
Not bad, big guy.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.537
[whimpers]

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:18.538
Hmm.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.075
All right!

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.409
All right! BOTH: Wha?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.310
[clapping]

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.512
Ha, well done.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:26.980
You both fit the bill nicely.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.881
Yeah.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.948
You'll be coming with us now.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:29.849
Huh.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:30.850
[gasps]

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.387
[energetic music]

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.555
DAN (VOICEOVER): The Bakugan Battle

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.825
Brawlers in \"Confrontation.\"

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.360
It's strange.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.396
This makes absolutely no sense.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.297
Hey.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.432
What's happening, you guys?

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.834
Good, you're both here.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.335
'Sup there, Maruch?

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.970
I hope my message didn't startle you,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.438
but the matter was rather urgent.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.339
No worries.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.842
What's the deal there, buddy?

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.711
Well, I wanted you to take a look at this.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.079
DAN: What is it?

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.948
MARUCHO: This is the system data from Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:04.117
It tracks each and every player who enters the environment.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.319
I increased the security protocols after we

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.787
discovered the Neathian moles.

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.189
Very impressive.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.257
Recently, our security program has recorded

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.660
some strange occurrences, and it seems as though someone has

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.627
been messing with the system.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.563
Well, don't look at me.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.664
I never touched it.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.667
[laughter]

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.268
I wasn't accusing you, silly.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.503
The readings are weird.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.837
They say that a number of our battlers

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.206
are disappearing from inside Bakugan Interspace

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.108
even though they haven't actually teleported out.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:30.043
But how?

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.644
That makes no sense at all.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.948
Maybe there's a bug or something in the system?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.218
I wish the explanation was that simple, but it's not.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.020
I've run a systems check, and everything is 100%.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.622
Then it must be--

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:43.990
The Neathians.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.491
It would make sense.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.261
According to our records, everyone who has disappeared

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:52.265
has been among the top-ranked battlers in Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.067
Could this have something to do with their war

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.401
against Gundalia?

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.736
Kidnappers.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.071
Not necessarily.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.173
It's strange, but it seems like everyone who goes missing

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.774
eventually returns to BI.

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.476
Well, if too many people disappeared,

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.211
it would set off alarm bells.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.580
But why would you steal people away if you're just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.515
going to let them come back in?

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.416
You're right.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.884
It doesn't add up.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.053
Whatever they're up to, it's got to be rotten.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.688
We can't let them get away with it.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.291
Yes, I agree with the both of you, which is why I

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.226
came up with this little plan.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.461
What plan?

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.896
Well, Dan, it involves using some data

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.766
that Ren was able to extract from the system for us.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.336
[suspenseful music]

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.277
Hey, what is this place?

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:39.178
BOY: Where are we?

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.081
GIRL: I wanna go home!

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.183
Hush now, my precious ones.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.419
There's no need to be afraid.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.855
No one here will hurt you, I promise.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.990
Relax, and look into my eyes.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.764
I trust the recruitment of battlers is going well, Gill?

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:01.534
Yes, all according to plan, Master Barodius.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.302
OK, very well, then.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:07.974
Your services aren't required yet, Dharak.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.208
Hmm.

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.711
I'm ready to serve you whenever the time comes,

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.812
Master Barodius.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.914
[laughs]

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.619
Did you notice?

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.587
Sid and the others aren't back from battle yet.

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:22.955
So what?

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.291
Are you their babysitter all of a sudden now or something?

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.193
Now that they've had a taste of battle,

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:29.195
they can't satisfy their appetites.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.230
Perhaps they're hungry like the wolf.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.636
Hey, you two mushbrains.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:37.603
How about a battle?

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:38.905
- Gah. - Uh.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.173
Quick, let's split.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.008
I'm right behind you.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:43.009
Come on.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.514
What are you looking at?

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.450
MARUCHO (ON PA): Good afternoon, everyone.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.052
Could I have your attention, please, for a very important

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.220
announcement.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.355
If I could draw your attention to the monitors,

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.858
the following people have entered Bakugan Interspace

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.727
and should be considered dangerous.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.396
If any of them approach you asking to do battle--

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:06.999
Hmm, that's a nice offensive play, battle brawlers.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.401
Now that they've called us out,

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:10.603
looks like we'll have to take the battle to them.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.572
But as long as they're around, we won't

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.774
be able to continue recruiting.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.210
You're probably right, Zenet, but Drago

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.345
is no ordinary Bakugan.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.547
Defeating him won't be easy.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:22.682
Hmm.

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.550
Sounds like fun to me, Sid.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.687
You know how I love a good challenge.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.188
Ha!

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.858
Let's go find those battle brawlers and take care of them

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.659
so we can get back to business.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.862
That was the smart play, Marucho.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.965
Now the Neathians' movement will be severely limited.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.366
Thanks.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.702
Hey, Ren, should we start trying to pinpoint their location now?

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.537
We should.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:45.805
We'll give you a hand too, guys.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:46.706
Huh?

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.407
Let's click here, here--

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:49.375
Whoa, whoa!

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.843
Dan the Man, take it easy, dude.

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.712
This isn't a video game you're playing with here.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.280
If you're not careful, you might mess things up.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.315
You know, you really should leave it to Marucho and Ren.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.617
OK, OK?

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:00.253
Are you saying I don't know my way around technology?

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.387
He's right, Dan.

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.790
You burn popcorn in the microwave.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.525
That was an accident.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:06.859
Oh, fine.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.394
I'll just stick to brawling.

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:09.962
That's what I'm best at, anyway.

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.497
Hurry up and find those guys so I can

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.799
give them a good thumping, OK?

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:16.602
[laughs] Yeah, that's what I like to hear.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:17.937
Incredible.

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.138
What is it, Ren?

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:22.508
Well, your level of dedication toward my people

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.442
is what I mean.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:24.577
Hmm?

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.813
You're fighting just as hard to defend Gundalia

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.080
as you would your own planet.

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.249
You're one of us now, Ren.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.084
The battle brawlers aren't just a team.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.286
We're family.

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:35.021
Which means that if anybody threatens a member,

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.589
we band together to fight.

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:44.664
Well, then, I thank you.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.132
[chuckles] [alarm blaring]

COMPUTER: Security alert.

Security alert.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.135
Unauthorized access.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.469
Receiving transmission.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.639
You clowns think you're clever with that little stunt

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.141
you just pulled exposing us?

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.542
Huh?

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.443
Look.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.011
Aren't those two guys--

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:01.013
Those lousy Neathian agents!

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.915
How did you access this frequency?

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.417
It's on a secure server.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:05.384
Hmm.

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:07.286
Your security system is so basic,

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.255
a kindergarten student could crack it.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.389
Get out!

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:12.458
Yeah, well, why don't you make us, tough guy?

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:15.061
Meet us in a battle arena, and we'll settle things that way.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:15.962
Fine!

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.430
We'll be there.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.731
[growls]

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.633
Now what?

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.001
We go and fight.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:22.969
Yeah, let's go.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:25.171
Hold on.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.439
I'm coming too.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.941
Like Marucho said, we're in this together.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:29.842
Awesome.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:31.010
Let's do this, buddy.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.778
Hmm.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.014
Hmm.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:37.617
REN (VOICEOVER): It's go time, Linehalt. Bakugan brawl!

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:43.089
DAN (VOICEOVER): Let's send these creeps packing, Drago.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.029
So these guys are the mighty battle brawlers?

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.799
[laughs] They look like a bunch of lightweights to me.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.402
Tell me again why you're so scared of these geeks.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.503
Hey!

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.139
Will you please quit flapping your gums?

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:02.241
I'm with Sid.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.578
Why are we still talking when we could be battling these fools?

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:06.646
Hmm!

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:09.181
Remember who's in charge here, Contestir.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.485
Are you the ones responsible for battlers disappearing

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.419
from here?

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.520
Watch out.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.355
Looks like we're dealing with a genius here.

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:17.390
Quiet, you!

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.225
I've heard enough of your smack talk.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.626
Ready, Drago?

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:21.827
You bet.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:22.762
Huh?

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.430
So this is the infamous Drago?

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.499
Pyrus Bakugan aren't usually my taste,

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.667
but I guess I could deal.

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.702
Since these guys are trying to kick us out,

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:32.638
it seems only fair that we take a parting gift.

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:33.739
Say what?

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.109
I said we're taking your precious Bakugan.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:41.781
Oh, you have got to be out of your mind there, pal!

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.083
That's not your decision to make.

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.385
Got it, brawler?

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:48.187
Let's do this, Dan.

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:49.322
Kick it.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.657

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.401
How do you like me now?

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:36.869
It's almost over.

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:39.338
Ability activate.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.273
Vanguard Lola.

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:42.274
Ah!

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.343
[grunting]

00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:48.380
Drago!

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.349
COMPUTER: Dan life force, 10%.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.951
That must've hurt.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:55.587
Sorry I can't back you up, Dan.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:56.655
No sweat.

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:59.158
Drago and I can pull this one out.

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.426
Right, pal?

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.595
Gate card, set!

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.731
Bakugan, brawl!

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.099
Bakugan, stand.

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.267
Let's do this!

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:10.069
Here we come!

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.370
[growls]

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.572
Wait for me!

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:14.673
[growls]

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:17.810
Let's strike the final blow, Zenet.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.111
You glory hog.

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:21.580
Don't forget I'm the one who brought him to his knees.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.048
COMPUTER: Ready Destrakon Gear.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.021
Ready Sparta Blaster.

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:33.392
BOTH: Battle gear boost!

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.895
[energetic music]

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:51.610

Destrakon Gear Brinel.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:54.580
Ugh!

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.481
Dan!

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.949
Hang on.

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:58.450
Oh, no you don't.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.420
Battle gear ability activate!

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.922
Sparta Blaster Sunbeam!

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.424
What the?

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.559
Ah, I can't see anything!

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:08.894
Ha.

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.163
Let's see you try and use your battle gear now, brawler.

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:13.599
[laughs maniacally]

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.567

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:18.337
REN (VOICEOVER): Come on.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:19.338
Finish this.

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:25.778
[grunting] Dan!

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:26.678
Drago!

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:29.114
Gate card, open!

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:32.551
Power Splatter!

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:35.120
He just dropped our power levels with that gate card.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.388
How is that even possible?

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.289
Bah!

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.357
Whoa.

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:41.326
[grunting]

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:44.329
We're almost home, buddy.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.265
Battle gear boost!

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:49.735
[dramatic music]

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.311
Battle gear ability activate!

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:02.448
JetKor Flame Impact!

[roaring]

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:12.624
Augh!

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.059
Ugh!

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:16.662
Whoa, he smoked them both at the same time.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.031
Looks like this guy is hardcore, Zenet.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:21.333
A gate card that interlocks with the battle gear?

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.234
Oh, man!

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:23.302
This is awesome!

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:24.236
Ha, ha.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.205
I need you to focus here, Zenet.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:27.172
He's strong.

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.574
We haven't won this yet.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.743
If we keep using our standard abilities, we're going to lose.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:34.913
Well, why don't we try something different.

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.381
Ability activate!

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.516
Andromeda!

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:38.851
Excellent choice.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:39.751
Here we go.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.253
[energetic music]

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:44.823
[grunting]

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.227
His battle gear's gone!

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:49.428
[roars]

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.197
COMPUTER: Zenet life force, zero.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:53.632
What just happened?

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:56.468
I sacrificed my Bakugan to get rid of Drago's

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.270
battle gear, that's what.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.105
It's a groovy little ability that's

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.874
unique to Haos Contestir.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.675
Let's finish them!

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:04.576
Yeah!

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:06.612
Ability activate.

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.213

COMPUTER: Dan life force, zero.

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:16.989
Drago!

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.396
You OK?

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:25.898
I'm fine.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.599
I'm sorry, Dan.

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:29.134
It was all my fault.

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:32.170
It's no one's fault. Don't worry about it.

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:33.372
Listen, Dan.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:35.707
You and your buddy Drago there put up a good fight.

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:37.209
And since it was two against one,

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.878
we're gonna give you a break this time and not take him.

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.381
But know this-- we've got our eye on you, got it?

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:43.248
Hmm.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.684
Huh?

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.886
Let's hit the road, Zenet.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:49.555
Hey, hold on a sec!

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:51.857
Don't get your pants in a bunch, Dan.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.358
Our paths will cross again.

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:55.694
Like I said, we're watching.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:58.230
Bye-bye.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.300
[growling]

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:05.137
[all gasp]

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:06.138
What the?

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:10.676
Where, uh, exactly are we?

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.811
They're ready now.

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:16.548
Sid, I have orders from the emperor.

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:20.419
Just stay away, period.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.754
Do not engage the brawlers anymore.

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:26.058
Dealing with them is Ren's job from now on.

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:26.959
Yes, sir.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.393
I understand.

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:41.607
[sighs]

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.542
Don't worry.

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.978
Today was a success, Ren.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.213
It was, but just barely.

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:51.016
The battle could have easily gone the other way.

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:52.050
But it didn't.

00:20:57.322 --> 00:21:01.593
The future of our people is at stake, so failure

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:08.066
is not an option, Linehalt.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.735
DAN (VOICEOVER): Shun had been missing for a while

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:12.304
when this strange Neathian dude named Jesse showed up.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.273
The way he spoke and dressed, it was like he thought

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:15.774
he was an actor in a play.

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:18.844
But weirdo or not, Drago and I knew we had to take him down.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.346
But then Fabia dropped by right in the middle of our battle

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.681
and crashed the party.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.082
I didn't understand.

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:26.284
If they were both Neathians, why was she fighting against him?

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.619
It made no sense.

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.621
Then I wondered if maybe Shun knew something about it.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.890
But you won't believe what he told me once I found him.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.659
Tune in to hear for yourself.

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.160
Bakugan, brawl!

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.995
Total insanity.

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:42.734
