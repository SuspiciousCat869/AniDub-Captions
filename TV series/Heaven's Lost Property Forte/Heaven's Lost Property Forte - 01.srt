1
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,750
Watch out...

2
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:47,416
She is coming... A new angel.

3
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,583
That... dream?

4
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,916
Good morning to you, Master.

5
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,083
Are you awake yet?

6
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,875
Of course I am! Do I have
to tell you every morning

7
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:00,958
not to scare me like that?!

8
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,791
Stop straddling him, Alpha.

9
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,583
And Tomoki, you
should be awake already.

10
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,625
What's that?

11
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,166
Uh... What do you
want me to say here?

12
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,416
Good morning, Tomoki!

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,375
Sohara!

14
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,708
Are you up? We have
school, you know.

15
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,791
Aw, crap!

16
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,791
If Sohara sees me like this,
she'll kill me without thinking

17
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,166
twice about it. What
the Hell am I gonna do?!

18
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,458
Ikaros, you gotta shoot me!

19
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,791
Right now!
Shoot me in the jimmy!

20
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,166
Shoot you in your what?

21
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,416
Tomoki...

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,875
Ikaros! Shoot me!

23
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,750
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Eishiro Sugata.

24
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,916
And these here are my assist--

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,750
Aw... Sugata...
These are all your

26
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,250
previous assistants,
aren't they? The Pretties?

27
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,916
Anyway, the mysterious
black hole, which appeared

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,833
in the sky over Sorami
recently, remains there,

29
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,666
its true nature
still unknown to us all.

30
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,583
However... Last year
during Christmas...

31
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,916
I witnessed the anomaly
with my own eyes.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,333
The New World
does indeed exist

33
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,791
on the other side
of this black hole.

34
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,875
Congratulations!

35
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,250
It's a little rub-on transfer
I had designed. I figure I can

36
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,083
sell these babies off
at a thousand yen a pop.

37
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,458
Like I was going to say,
what we have to do now is

38
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,666
find a doorway that
leads to the New World.

39
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,875
If we peruse human history, we
can see giant structures built

40
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,541
in the distant past that also
depicted paths into a New World.

41
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,333
For example, this is a mural
within one of the pyramids--

42
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,583
Tomo! Come on! You better get a
move on or we're gonna be late.

43
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,791
Here. At least drink
your milk before we go.

44
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,958
You, too, Nymph
and Ikaros. Drink up.

45
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,416
Thank you.

46
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,041
Thank you, Sohara.

47
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,458
Cool. Forget anything?

48
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,291
Nope. I'm all good.
Let's get outta here.

49
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,791
Little refresher.
We live in Sorami City.

50
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,208
It's a small place, about
seven thousand people...

51
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,375
and it's completely
surrounded by mountains.

52
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,000
It's nice. The town isn't known
for anything in particular.

53
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,416
If it was, it'd be the smile
on the old farmer's face.

54
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,208
Or maybe that huge
four-hundred-year-old

55
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,791
cherry blossom
tree that sits on

56
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,250
the gorgeous hill
right outside of town.

57
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,916
That all changed of course...

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,583
the day when Ikaros
fell out of the sky.

59
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,458
Not long after that, Nymph
showed up. She pretty much put

60
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,375
the final nail in the coffin
of my days of peace and quiet.

61
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,583
Oh well... C'est la vie.

62
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,208
Lately, I've actually gotten
used to living like this.

63
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,791
Far as I'm concerned, as long
as nothing else goes screwy,

64
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,500
I'm totally cool. 'Cause
nothing beats peace and quiet.

65
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,041
Am I right?

66
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,625
I am so sorry. Dragging you
back into this is the last thing

67
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:36,875
I wanted. But you have to
watch out... for the angel.

68
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,041
Take good care
of her... Will you?

69
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,958
She's trapped... by the sky.

70
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,166
They've returned?

71
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,666
Yeah, that stupid dream again.
I hadn't had one in a long time,

72
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,125
so I'd almost forgotten
what they were like.

73
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,875
But after so
long without one,

74
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,916
it felt, I don't
know, kinda weird.

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,958
Having a weird dream shouldn't
be a big deal to you anymore.

76
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,333
You're old enough to be
experiencing certain feelings--

77
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,833
I can assure you, Prez,
it was not that kinda dream.

78
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,416
Oh gosh, Tomo. You mean
it's those same dreams

79
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,125
you used to have all the time?

80
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm sure it's your desire
to go to the New World that's

81
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,916
caused you to have this dream
again. When you repress things,

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,041
dreams are
where they pop up.

83
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,208
Nuh-uh!

84
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,958
Somewhere deep in
your subconscious you've

85
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,041
finally started to realize
that you are a member of

86
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,041
the New World Discovery Club.
That's all this is, Tomoki.

87
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,333
No, it's not!

88
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,541
Hey, what if
we did that thing?

89
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,041
Everyone did it all the time
in the Synapse a while back.

90
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,166
Remember that thing?

91
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,458
But... it could be dangerous.

92
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,166
What's dangerous?
What are you talking about?

93
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,166
The Dive... Game.

94
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,875
The Dive Game, you say?

95
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,416
What the heck is that?

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Exactly what it sounds like.
It's a game where we would

97
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,708
dive into a person's dreams.
It was pretty popular.

98
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,500
Everybody up there
liked playing it.

99
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,958
What's the... Synapse?

100
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,958
Stop there! I forgot
to mention that all

101
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,750
Synapse-related questions
are strictly forbidden.

102
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,458
Those files are locked
away, classified top-secret!

103
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,541
And you're better
off not knowing.

104
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,500
Better off not knowing?

105
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,583
That's right. So... What
do you think? If you play

106
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,958
the Dive Game, you'll be able
to go inside Tomoki's dream.

107
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,875
You wanna?

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,583
Initializing connection.
Ring Gate... Open.

109
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,750
You guys be careful
on the other side.

110
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,291
Be careful of what?

111
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,041
What? You and
Ikaros aren't coming?

112
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,916
You know very well...
that Angeloids can't sleep.

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,583
Dreams are somewhat
of a taboo for us.

114
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,416
Master, please, just...
use caution on the other side.

115
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,875
'Kay.

116
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,250
'Kay, here goes! Your next
stop, Tomoki's dreamscape!

117
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,458
Oh, wow!

118
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,166
Just as vast and empty as
I expected his head to be.

119
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,125
Well, what do you
think we should do first?

120
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,333
Well, usually, it starts off
having this blue-haired chick

121
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,541
with wings soaring up to me.

122
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,166
Oh... There she is. Hey, lady!

123
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,166
Or not...

124
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,833
Oh-god-oh-god-oh-god!
Not her! Not her!

125
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,625
You really like 'em
big, don't you, Tomoki?!

126
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,500
Run faster!

127
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,333
Is that a female?

128
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,500
Man! I thought we were dead!

129
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,166
Wow, you've got the
dreams of a crazy person!

130
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,916
No I do not! This is
not my freakin' dream!

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,625
I'm afraid... this is the
dream I had last night, Tomoki.

132
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,333
Yeah, slight
miscalculation on my part.

133
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,541
There was nothing slight
about it, you bonehead!

134
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,333
You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

135
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,416
I made an honest mistake.

136
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,833
I will be such a jerk!
I almost died!

137
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,041
Least I found a nice souvenir.

138
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,625
Made it worth the trouble.

139
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,916
Like what?

140
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,166
Wait. That's a crystal from the
cave we were just trapped in.

141
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,791
Hello, my precious. You
must be worth a boatload.

142
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,458
Once I cash you in, I'll
never have to work again.

143
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,416
Not another
day the rest of my--

144
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,708
Where'd it go?

145
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,625
Did I forget that part?
You won't be able to

146
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,625
bring anything
back from a dream.

147
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,625
Since that's where it comes
from, that's where it stays.

148
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,041
Too bad, so sad.

149
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,041
Okay people, let's
reconnect to Tomoki's dream.

150
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,708
Have a safe trip.

151
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,625
Better'n last time I hope!

152
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,875
What is this awful place?!

153
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,625
You mean this isn't
your dream, either?

154
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,291
Not even close!

155
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,458
Incoming!

156
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,541
Get 'em boys!

157
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,500
Suck on this.

158
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,083
That's right.
Sayonara, bitches.

159
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,291
This was my dream, everybody!

160
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,833
Nymph, help us! We're in the
dream of the one person whose

161
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,916
dreams we should absolutely
stay the Hell out of!

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,416
Get us out of here!

163
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,583
Straight into another this time.
Is this one yours, Tomoki?

164
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,916
Oh, no!

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,833
Hmmm... Whose is
it this time, then?

166
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,375
What's your deal?

167
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,333
Oh, nothing!

168
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,833
Terrible! Just terrible! We've
landed smack in the middle of

169
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,666
the dream I had last night!

170
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,000
Which means, oh god,
it's that dream!

171
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,916
We should probably
start by looking around.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,708
Why not?

173
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,500
No! They wouldn't!

174
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,291
Wanna take a bath with me,
you twisted little thing?

175
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,333
Sohara...

176
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,458
Tomo, you're
such a little horndog!

177
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,833
You're so hot...

178
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,083
Oh, get your fingers
out of there! That tickles!

179
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,875
What is your problem, creep-o?

180
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,125
How could you possibly
have such a sick dream?!

181
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,333
But... This isn't...
This isn't mine...

182
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,041
What's wrong with that damaged
little head of yours that

183
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,291
it would imagine
such deviance?

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
Come on up here,
my sexy boo-boo...

185
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,291
I swear. Totally
not my dream at all.

186
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,875
Fore!

187
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,000
Sugata?

188
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,958
Yes?

189
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,250
Sometimes, you just can't
help what you dream about,

190
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,625
am I right?

191
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,750
Am I right or not?!

192
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,750
Yes.

193
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,166
Stop it, you dirty little man!

194
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,833
Get that ass back here, baby!
You know I need some of that!

195
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,583
What are people gonna
say?! Get away from me!

196
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,875
Come on, baby!

197
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,291
Tickets please! Tickets
please! Tickets please!

198
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,375
Can't catch me, Mr. Bear!

199
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,333
Aw! Gimme your
goo-goo ga-ga, honey!

200
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,666
Lemme show you what I mean by
"busted!" Assume the position!

201
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,250
Say my name!

202
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,625
Uh... Check please.
I'm ready to go.

203
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,625
I want you to
listen here, Tomoki.

204
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,583
In life, you gotta
always dream big.

205
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,833
Dream big?

206
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,291
Yes. As big as you can.

207
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,583
Your grandpa here
dreamed big, too, you know.

208
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,875
Yeah, I dreamed
before I left this earth,

209
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,000
I'd take all the girlies
of the world to bed.

210
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,500
Only two billion, nine hundred
and fifty-seven million,

211
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,291
two hundred and
seventy-two thousand,

212
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,708
six hundred sixteen to go!

213
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,625
Grandpa!

214
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

215
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,958
And to think, I was so
close, too. Listen, Tomo...

216
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:17,916
Be sure to dream. And
when you do... Dream big!

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,625
Grandpa!

218
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,166
So, what's the
verdict, your honor?

219
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,083
Can we go to my dream now?

220
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,750
Hold that thought
for one moment.

221
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,541
I have a feeling I need
to check something here.

222
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,625
There's some kind of block
on Tomoki's dreamscape!

223
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,791
Did you say a block?

224
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,916
For a dream, it sure
has a lot of nerve.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,666
But I'll hack this thing!

226
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,583
Master, please stop. The Dive
Game is not meant for humans.

227
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,208
Huh? Why not?

228
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,208
Well, Master... It's...

229
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,583
There we go!
Hacking complete.

230
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,041
This time, I'm absolutely
positive it's Tomoki's!

231
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,000
Right... let's do this.

232
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,000
Whoa, Tomo. This is
what your dream looks like?

233
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,708
I guess we finally made it.

234
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,541
This is wrong!

235
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,916
Wait, we're still not there?

236
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,625
No! My dream is always
on this lush, grassy field.

237
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,791
Not some stark barren void!

238
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,083
I mean, c'mon,
look at this place!
