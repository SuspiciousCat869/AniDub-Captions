1
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:34,708
Wake up. Come on, Tomoki!
Please, you have to wake up!

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,375
Hey... Been a while.

3
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,083
Tomoki!

4
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,000
Whoa! What's going on?!

5
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,000
Something awful has happened!

6
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,541
There's a... second-generation
Angeloid, and--

7
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,500
They pulled me
out of his dream?!

8
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:06,125
No, it's worse.
Someone took my place!

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,375
It's her. The new model!

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,833
Hi, mister. Wanna
play dolls with me?

11
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,083
Who... Who're you?

12
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,541
Come play dolls
with me. It's fun.

13
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:32,875
But how? Nothing should be
able to penetrate the block on

14
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:37,000
Tomoki's dreamscape!
This new Angeloid...

15
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,916
Is she really that powerful?!

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What the hell are you doing?!

17
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,625
Somebody's been
a very bad dolly!

18
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,416
Cut it out!

19
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,375
Is there something
the matter... Master?

20
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,625
That dream... What the Hell?

21
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,083
So much of the phenomenon...
that science cannot explain...

22
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,166
has occurred near girls
on the verge of womanhood.

23
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,166
During the mid-1800s, the Fox
Sisters founded Spiritualism

24
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,458
in America based on
their odd experiences.

25
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,333
And there were the Cottingley
Fairy photos in England.

26
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,250
These are just two of the
examples of supernatural events

27
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,750
that have taken
place around young women.

28
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,125
Could this correlation be
the work of the New World,

29
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,875
a.k.a. the Synapse? Hmm...

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,750
Given the form
The Angeloids take,

31
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,583
that isn't hard to believe.

32
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,666
That said, if one of them finds
themselves in the midst of

33
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,083
such a phenomenon,
they should watch out.

34
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,333
The girl in question might
be nothing more than bait.

35
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:33,000
Ah, the great outdoors.
Oh, my empty belly!

36
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,750
Tasty! Dead ahead!

37
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,250
Squid?! For me?! Score!

38
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,083
I haven't eaten
in forever! Thanks!

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,541
Gotta eat 'em one at
a time, all careful-like,

40
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,375
get all the flavor out of 'em.

41
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:07,791
Savor each 'n' every one.
Taste that tasty squid!

42
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,416
Look at me! This is
sad with a capital C!

43
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,333
I'm the Synapse's bestest
Angeloid in in-your-face combat!

44
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,833
I'm Astraea!
A Delta type, even!

45
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,666
How come I can't power down
the whole bag at once, huh?!

46
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,625
Wait a minute...
this is all his fault!

47
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,333
Revengeance!

48
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,375
Let's see how much
he likes being hungry!

49
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,708
Bye, Mom! I'll see ya later!

50
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,958
Look both ways
and all that stuff.

51
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,708
Man, Alpha is such a
screw-up. How does somebody

52
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,541
forget to go shopping?

53
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,208
Gimme snacks already!

54
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,375
Oh! Maybe there's still
something good in the fridge?

55
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,625
Guess I'm hearing things...

56
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,250
Brr... Brr... Brr...

57
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,375
Oh, jeez. What are you doing?

58
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,541
I snuck in like a food
ninja when nobody was looking

59
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,166
so I could eat the yummies!

60
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,333
But there isn't anything
yummy inside this fridge.

61
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,041
There's only me! God, why!

62
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,458
Aw, can it! I'm hungry,
and I actually live here!

63
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,500
My tummy! My tummy! 

64
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,916
Nymph wants a snack!

65
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,625
My head!

66
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,083
Wait. What about...
Yeah, of course!

67
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,166
What?

68
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,291
Alpha grew 'em all from seeds.

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,875
I got a bad feelin' about this.

70
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,500
I mean, Ikaros loves
watermelons almost as much as

71
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,625
she oves the
dummy-bug, right?

72
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,000
You got that right.
She'll stomp our faces

73
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,500
if she finds out. But...

74
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,375
She's not gonna
miss a few of 'em!

75
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,875
O'course not! What Ikaros
won't know doesn't hurt us!

76
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,000
Yum!

77
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,833
Awesome!

78
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,458
Ooh. Let's eat a big one now!

79
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,666
Dummy! Big melons aren't
any better than little ones!

80
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,625
You see? Good thing
I came along with you.

81
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,916
All this ended up
being a lot to carry.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,375
Yes, thank you...
for the company.

83
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,291
And for the recipe, too.

84
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,291
Sure! And speaking of shopping,
I'm really proud of how you can

85
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,333
do it all by yourself
now. Good job, Ikaros!

86
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,041
Sometimes, when Master
does not give me a list,

87
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,708
I still make mistakes.

88
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,083
Well, what do you
still need to get?

89
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,708
Potatoes, for use
in tonight's supper.

90
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,666
Huh? You're buying them all?

91
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,791
I am cooking for four.

92
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,375
Let's see Tomoki,
and then Nymph is there,

93
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:56,166
and you're eating of course.
Who am I not accounting for?

94
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,000
Master said... "buy for four."

95
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,458
Okay.

96
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,208
Typical Tomoki.

97
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,458
I am totally stuffed.

98
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,541
I am gonna have a food baby.

99
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,791
Yeah, so uh...

100
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,125
We're screwed...

101
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,791
Any bright ideas?

102
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,583
'Cause once... a buncha
flies tried to make her

103
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,041
watermelon patch
their salad bar...

104
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,375
Alpha fired up her
Artemis projectiles

105
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,583
and blasted 'em all to Hell.

106
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,708
That was fun,
huh? See ya later.

107
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,125
Yes. I had a lot of fun today.

108
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,750
I am home.

109
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,083
I think we're in trouble here!

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,791
Isn't there something
we can do?! Come on!

111
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,250
Is something wrong?

112
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,458
Wait what about that
hacking thingy you do?!

113
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,750
Can't you tell
the plants to like,

114
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,583
grow more watermelons,
now and stuff?!

115
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,416
I dunno. I've never
used it on plants before.

116
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,458
But... I guess I
don't have a choice, huh!

117
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,166
Why did you make that?!

118
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,708
It's your fault!

119
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:38,791
Hey! Shut up down there!
Huh? Help! Get it off of me!

120
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm melting! Melting!

121
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,750
All that's left of the
dummy is a seed! Look at him!

122
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,208
Yeah! Thanks for
that, Captain Obvious!

123
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,333
Let's plant him
and see what happens!

124
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:06,208
Hey! What are you doing?!
Nooooo!

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
Nymph... please open up.

126
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,625
Nah, it's cool.
Don't worry about it!

127
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,416
We're fine. We're all
fine here now, thank you.

128
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,750
Why was Master
screaming, Nymph?

129
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,125
Why was Master
screaming, Nymph?

130
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,708
Crap... she's on to us!
Cards, don't fail me now!

131
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,875
Uh...
Delta-ate-'em-all-I-swear!

132
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,458
Why?!

133
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,208
Start talking, dingbats!

134
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,083
Whatever. Not my fault.

135
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,291
Blondie's the
one who started it.

136
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,875
No, I'm not! Liar,
liar, pants on fire!

137
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,416
I wasn't stuck, I was hiding!

138
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,666
Least I wasn't
stuck in the freezer.

139
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
And you're so short...

140
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:14,791
You'd still be in there
if I hadn't gone to the door.

141
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,333
Ah, shut up already!

142
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,250
All this crap went down just
'cause you were hungry, right?

143
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,208
Huh?

144
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,375
I told ya you could come
eat here whenever, didn't I?

145
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,291
So shut up and
eat... you dummy.

146
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,208
Thanks for the food.

147
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,458
Thanks for the food.

148
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,416
Thanks for the... food?

149
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,333
Dumb-dumb!

150
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,583
Hey! You thieving jerk!

151
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,958
Least I'm not a
dumb-dumb, dumb-dumb! Hey!

152
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,625
Great, here we go again...

153
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,916
I'm takin' this, take that!

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,833
I will take that! Eat it!

155
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,583
Hey! Leave my food out of it!

156
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,000
So Delta, what
are you gonna do now?

157
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,000
Huh?

158
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,208
Still gonna
try and kill Tomoki?

159
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,708
What do you think I should do?

160
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,250
It's not for me to say.

161
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,125
Master hasn't contacted me,
but I know I'm not supposed to

162
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,958
go back to the Synapse.
You and Alpha seem to be

163
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,458
having a good enough
time down here, though.

164
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,250
So, that wasn't very nice
of you earlier. Why'd you put

165
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,375
all the blame on me?
You ate just as many

166
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,791
"wallermeloms" as I did.

167
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,625
Yeah, I'm sorry, I panicked.

168
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,041
Though, I gotta say Nymph,
for as tiny as you are,

169
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,958
you sure can pack it away.

170
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,625
"Tiny," huh? Come back here
an' call me that to my face!

171
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,833
Hey! Gotta go!

172
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,375
Oh yeah! Sorry, Nymph! You
can't chase me 'cause you don't

173
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:56,583
have wings anymore!
Neener-neener-neener!

174
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,916
Wait... Where...?

175
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,833
Whatever. It's your own
fault you lost your wings.

176
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,041
You and Ikaros turned
your backs on the Synapse,

177
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,875
so you're nothing
but big ol' traitors now.

178
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,750
I don't get it. Like,
why did they punk out

179
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,541
on the Synapse, anyway?

180
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,375
Wearin' me out. After
all that, I didn't get

181
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,416
a single damn croquette.

182
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,708
Hey. It's me, God. Please
do me a solid and take me away

183
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,416
to a world without
Angeloids. Amen.

184
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:33,916
Huh?

185
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,500
You want me to
take you there, mister?

186
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,458
Do I... know you?

187
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,583
Want me to take you
away to a world, mister...

188
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,041
without any Angeloids at all?

189
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,875
Aw hey, you're all little
and junk, but you care about

190
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,541
other people. That's
so friggin' adorable.

191
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,458
Anyway. It's getting late.
You should head home.

192
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,250
See ya!

193
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
You're nice to me.

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I have an idea. Wanna
play dolls with me, mister?

195
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,583
Sorry, Nymph! You can't
chase me 'cause you don't

196
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,333
have wings anymore!
Neener-neener-neener!

197
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,083
I know Delta's too dumb
to mean anything by it...

198
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:44,000
but without wings, and without
a master... What good am I?

199
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,208
This reject is
good for nothing...

200
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,041
except tossing
on the scrapheap.

201
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,958
It's okay... 'cause Tomoki
would never say that!

202
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,125
Oh, Tomoki... he's so...

203
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,375
Sugata?

204
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,750
Dammit, the bug is fast!

205
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,958
There he is!

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,958
Three... two... one... adios.

207
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,458
How does he keep doing that?!

208
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,750
This time... let's aim
for 40 seconds, all right?

209
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,833
Oh. But I'm worn
out! C'mon... call it a day.

210
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,625
Not on your life.
In the words of Sun Tzu,

211
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,291
"Know thy enemy," Nymph. I
have to investigate the Synapse

212
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,375
while avoiding the Harpies.

213
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,791
Yeah, that's cool.
Forty seconds, huh?

214
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,250
Damn that little bug!
Next time he's going down!

215
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,583
We better keep our eyes peeled.

216
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,750
One... two... three...

217
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,916
Hi, Nymph.

218
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,750
Oh, Tomoki. What's up?

219
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:12,041
Uh, five... six...
seven... eight... Huh?!

220
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,416
Come on... Let's go on a date.

221
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,416
But! Sugata... He's
depending on me to--!

222
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,666
He'll be fine.

223
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,541
No! Wait! Tomoki!

224
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,875
Thirty-seven... Thirty-eight...
Thirty-nine... Forty.

225
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,625
I've hit a bit of a snag.
Just pretend I'm not here.

226
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,041
Oh, no! Our hearts go
out to you, good sir.

227
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,000
As if! Say your prayers,
ya little cockroach!

228
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,333
Quickly!

229
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,875
Oh no ya don't!

230
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,500
Sugata's fine. I'm sure of it.

231
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,166
What's wrong?

232
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,083
Do you wanna... go back home?

233
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,041
That's Master... and Nymph?

234
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:20,250
What is this...
sensation I am feeling?

235
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,625
Master is my master.
I carry out his orders.

236
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,625
That is supposed to be all.

237
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,833
My reactor. It hurts.

238
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,541
Why they went
AWOL from the Synapse?

239
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,958
That's what you're asking?

240
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,916
Yeah... I thought
you'd know, Sensei,

241
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,416
'cause you're super-smart.

242
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,375
Good call. See,
it's a love-triangle.

243
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,791
Actually... no...
It's a love-square.

244
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,500
Math, my mortal enemy!

245
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,458
Astraea, my dear.

246
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,625
Yeah?

247
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,750
I believe we're in
for some stormy weather.

248
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,041
Not that I
dislike a bit of drama,

249
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,166
so long as nobody
goes overboard.

250
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,541
"Stormy?"

251
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,708
I brought you out here...

252
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,708
'cause there's
something I wanna tell you.

253
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,958
Yeah?

254
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,375
Nymph... I really
wanna become your master.

255
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,625
You dragged me here
for that? Oh, very funny!

256
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,541
I'm dead serious.

257
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,875
Why now?

258
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:45,500
My wings... got torn off... and
everyone says I was... a reject.

259
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,000
You're so not.

260
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,000
A worthless mistake...

261
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:53,625
Not to me. You're adorable.
I've always thought so.

262
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,083
From the moment I met you,
I wished you were my Angeloid.

263
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you... really mean it?

264
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,416
Yeah. Cross my heart.

265
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,791
Honest?

266
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,291
Then... I'll start the
imprinting process right away.

267
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,791
Good, but before you do, can you
do me one, tiny favor first?

268
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,000
Name it. I'll do anything.

269
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,375
Kill yourself.

270
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:38,333
T-Tomoki...
Why would you say that?!

271
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,125
I... wanna know what love is.

272
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,250
"Love conquers all,"
doesn't it?

273
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,291
You betrayed
the Synapse for love.

274
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,666
Now... kill yourself! And prove
your love! Prove it to me!

275
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,291
Prove it! Prove it!
Prove your love! Prove it!

276
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,708
Show me! Show me
what love is! Show me!

277
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,166
Of course. Why would
he ever choose me?

278
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,583
Who the Hell are you?!

279
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,083
How dare you
pretend to be Tomoki!

280
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,375
Darn... I guess ya caught me.

281
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,083
I'll just have to learn
about love a different way.

282
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,458
It's such a pleasure
to meet you. I'm the new

283
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:30,833
second generation Angeloid...
type Epsilon... Chaos.

284
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:35,750
Nymph, would you tell me, pretty
please? What does "love" mean?

285
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,041
Paradise Song!

286
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,791
Bye-bye, brat!

287
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,125
Nymph... I really
wanna become your master.

288
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,291
That wasn't... fair!

289
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,458
Nymph. I don't
know what "brat" means...

290
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,791
But it doesn't sound too nice.

291
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,208
No way! I hit her dead on!

292
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,750
My master sent me to Earth...
to track down Ikaros...

293
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,791
and rip the variable
wing core out of her.

294
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,708
Master says the variable
wing core is the Synapse's

295
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,083
most valuable technology.

296
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,625
You know... I just don't care
about boring stuff like that.

297
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,000
But I turned myself into
Tomoki Sakurai 'cause there's

298
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,083
something I do care
about, a whole bunch!

299
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,083
Yeah, brat. What's that?

300
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,750
It doesn't make any sense
to me. How come you two

301
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,416
turned your backs
on the Synapse, huh?

302
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,875
Master said you've been
infected by love, but I

303
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,791
don't understand, 'cause we're
not programmed to feel love.

304
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,000
That's why I need
you to tell me, Nymph.

305
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,916
What is love?

306
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,041
Please tell me, Nymph. Before
you're dead. What is love?

307
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:06,375
What is love? What is love? What
is it? Tell me what love is!

308
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:13,833
What is it? What is love?
What is love? What is looove?

309
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,083
Please, don't be
afraid. I'm a friend.

310
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,250
The Harpies can't
get to us in here.

311
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,416
Who are you?

312
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,083
What the--?!

313
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,416
It's begun. I knew it.
