1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,166
What's all the fuss about?

2
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,875
Dude... let's go check it out.

3
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,666
Who is that? What
is she doing? Gross.

4
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,833
Oh, Astraea, no.

5
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,791
What were you doing
out there, Delta?!

6
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,541
I was hungry. I had to eat.

7
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:27,375
Oh, don't worry about it.
But, as long as you're here...

8
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,541
Maybe it's time we made an
addition to the student body.

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,916
No way in Hell!
That's just one more way to

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,833
stir up trouble in my
life! I won't allow it!

11
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,458
Come on, how about
a one day trial?

12
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,541
And she should join
the same class as Tomoki.

13
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,958
Oh, yes. This will make
a lovely social experiment.

14
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,583
And you'd look adorable
in a uniform, Astraea.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,166
All right, fine.

16
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,708
We don't have much time
before class starts, so Ikaros,

17
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,208
you're up. Show Astraea
where the locker room is.

18
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,041
Yes... Master.

19
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,833
What are you up
to this time, Tomoki?

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,791
Yeah, wha-- Tomoki?

21
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,708
It's been too long
since I showed up!

22
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,500
My name's Tomoko! And
that's the quantum converter

23
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,625
Sohara broke a while ago.
Ikaros was nice enough to

24
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,833
fix it for me, so I'm
gonna take it on a test run.

25
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,916
Hi... So... you ready?

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
What?

27
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,041
It's one of the rules we have
at this school. The first thing

28
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,208
we do with each new student
is conduct a full physical exam.

29
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,125
Oh... Well, if
that's what you do.

30
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,625
That's what we do.
Let's start with your hips.

31
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,541
You mind spinning
around for me?

32
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,916
Okay.

33
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:52,500
Oh, I'm so sorry
my hand slipped!

34
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,375
I apologize. But since we're
both girls, there's no shame

35
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,291
in a little accident, right?

36
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,416
Yeah, right.

37
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,416
Good, so next
we'll do your bust.

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,791
To Hell with her waist!
Boobies! Boobies! Boobies!

39
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,416
Oopsie! My hands slipped again!

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,541
Ooh! These suckers might
be as nice as Sohara's!

41
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,500
Hey!

42
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,458
What are you doing to her?

43
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:21,166
You're such an a-hole! Ahhh!

44
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,583
My name is Astraea.
Of all the foods I've eaten,

45
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,125
rice balls are my favorite.

46
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,333
She has wings.

47
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,875
Oh how cute.

48
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,333
Be nice to the
transfer student.

49
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,208
It's never easy being
the new kid in town.

50
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,416
All right. So the
answer to question two...

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,375
So hey, Ikaros. Astraea's
a bit too dumb for this class.

52
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,875
Why don't you teach
her something else,

53
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,625
so she doesn't
slow everyone down?

54
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,458
Yes, Master.

55
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,416
You have three apples
and four oranges.

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,083
How many total pieces of--

57
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,458
I eat all of them!

58
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,458
Okay, let's move
on. Seven bananas--

59
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,916
I eat all of 'em!

60
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,375
I still have this nasty poison.

61
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,833
I'll kill Tomoki
this time for sure!

62
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:08,625
Astraea.

63
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,833
You wanna give these a taste?
You're always hungry, right?

64
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,625
She likes me!
She really likes me!

65
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,875
Don't mind if I do!

66
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,458
It's like a
party! In my mouth!

67
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,375
Finally, class is over.
Time to mosey on home.

68
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,750
Hold it, Sakurai!
You've got detention.

69
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,000
Or, have you
forgotten already...

70
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,291
about your last test score?

71
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,166
So uh... What
are you guys in for?

72
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,458
Spanish class is
freakin' killing me.

73
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,750
I was bored and
this seemed interesting.

74
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,500
You're not here because
you're behind in a class,

75
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,583
are you, Prez?

76
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,291
That's precisely why.

77
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,833
Whoa? What subject would
you have trouble in?

78
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,125
Ethics, of all things.

79
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,291
Yeah, that makes sense.

80
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,666
Still, I'd hate
to be you, Tomoki.

81
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,833
What? Why would you say that?

82
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,833
Oh, goodness. You haven't
heard. 'Cause of this.

83
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,666
"Boys at Sorami High That You'd
Like As Your Boyfriend Survey."

84
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,125
Look at the bottom. Because
that's where your name

85
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,625
seems to have fallen.

86
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:33,375
Aw, look! He's unpopular,
and he's stupid. Poor dumbass.

87
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,333
What's your guys'
freakin' problem?

88
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,375
You are always peeping
on the girls' locker room.

89
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,375
What makes you think
you'd be popular with them?

90
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,375
So what? You're against me?

91
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,916
Maybe you should go
back to kindergarten

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,583
and learn to
not be such a tool.

93
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,458
Sha! As if! I'm still way
cooler than a kindergartner!

94
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,125
I'd be sixth grade, at least!

95
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,666
And you dingbats'd be
lucky to make fifth!

96
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,583
Pretty sure you're
way dumber than us.

97
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,375
No way!

98
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,625
Yes way!

99
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,916
Hey, Miss Ikaros.
I need to know, how do you

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,583
read this character right here?

101
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,791
Talk about dumb
enough for kindergarten!

102
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,583
Astraea's behind
on her first day?

103
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,666
Yes, in every subject.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,125
Dum-dum!

105
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,666
You're the dumb one,
ya freakin' cockroach.

106
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,041
Yeah, you lowlife pervert!

107
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,666
What did you call me?!

108
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,750
Sounds to me like we need
to set this record straight.

109
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,333
If you'd like, I can
throw together a little

110
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,250
competition on
the grounds outside.

111
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,083
Hell yeah. You do that.

112
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,625
You dumb chicks'll see
that I really am smart!

113
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,708
I'll show you!
I'll show all of you!

114
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,541
Ladies and gentlemen, it's
time now for the first ever

115
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,833
Smart-Kid Championship
Quiz Show. I'm your host...

116
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,666
known all around town as Eishiro
"New World or Bust" Sugata.

117
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,958
And I am his assistant,
Ikaros, the one who

118
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,916
made up all the questions.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,083
Now then, to explain the rules
of the game. The quiz questions

120
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,750
will be answered by
whoever buzzes in first.

121
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,375
If the contestant answers
correctly, that person's seat

122
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,250
will rise one level higher.
However, a wrong answer

123
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,291
will result in a punishment.

124
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,625
The first to give ten correct
answers... will rise to the top

125
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,166
of the tower and will
be crowned the winner.

126
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,500
And that winner will
receive from our sponsor,

127
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,208
the Satsukitane Group,
these fabulous prizes...

128
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,958
A one-month trip to this
luxurious South Seas island,

129
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,250
courtesy of Satsukitane Tours.

130
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,250
As well as a one-year
passport to their water park

131
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,166
and of course a
signed first-edition

132
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,333
photo collection of
Mikako Satsukitane, Wrestler.

133
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,875
So then, who will
be our winner today?

134
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,666
The stands are packed
with cheering fans..

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,875
Tomoki's a cockroach!

136
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,375
You are a dumbass!

137
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,666
Shut up!

138
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,541
It's too bad, but our
own Tomoki seems to have

139
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,458
no home crowd support today.

140
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,291
So, um... What's all that?

141
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,625
What's all what?

142
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,583
All that... down
there below us...

143
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,583
You know, that's
a very good question.

144
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,166
Very good, first question...

145
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,250
It is... a question on ethics.
There is someone on the side of

146
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,750
the road tossing out empty
soda cans. What do you do?

147
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,875
I kill everybody.

148
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,083
What is that?! Octopi?!
The seat opened up and

149
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
dropped Mikako down
into a pit full of octopi!

150
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,500
We're doing this?

151
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,208
Yeah!

152
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,500
Had to ask, didn't ya?

153
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,833
Right. Next is an
agriculture question.

154
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,458
Aomori Prefecture is
famous for its apples.

155
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,916
What is the Spanish
word for "apple?"

156
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,708
Man... zanno?

157
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,416
This time, there's
a pigsty at the bottom!

158
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,416
Moving on to math. This
will be a giveaway question.

159
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,125
What is one plus one?

160
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,208
Purple!

161
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,625
What is this? She's
fallen into an eel pit!

162
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,541
You're all so freakin' dumb!

163
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,791
Next question. There's
a girls' changing room

164
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,708
right before your
eyes. What do you do?

165
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,166
I take a peek!

166
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,958
Oh, no! It's a pile of shit!

167
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,583
Tomoki has fallen
into a pile of shit!

168
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,083
Jerk!

169
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:10,958
Lowlife!

170
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,750
You suck, Tomoki!

171
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,708
The already very, very
unpopular Tomoki is now having

172
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,916
trash hurled
at him by the girls.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,833
As for the correct answer.
That would be "do not peek."

174
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,416
Let's keep going.
The next question is...

175
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,708
And that's how the quiz show
continued. Round after round.

176
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,416
With pretty much disastrous
results for everyone.

177
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,083
Manzann-a?

178
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,916
A big plate of rice balls!

179
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,791
Kill 'em all.

180
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,708
The "Barnyard Sonata."

181
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,833
Well, except for Nymph
who was the only one of us

182
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,916
able to give
any correct answers.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,583
That's the ninth question
Nymph has answered correctly!

184
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,333
Only one more
and she's the winner!

185
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,583
Yeah!

186
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,250
Contrary to that,
Tomoki is doing terribly.

187
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,666
He has yet to answer a
single question correctly.

188
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,000
He's fallen so
much, he's buried.

189
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,166
Well... At this point, Nymph's
victory is all but assured.

190
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,416
On to the next question.
The subject is health

191
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,750
and physical education. Now...

192
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,750
Well, wait, what is this?

193
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,666
Oh, it's nothing.
So the question is...

194
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,208
Sohara Mitsuki of
Second Year, Class C...

195
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,416
has what measurements?

196
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,875
What? Ikaros, what the crap
kind of question is that?!

197
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,791
Does... anyone on
the panel have an answer?

198
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,958
No freakin' way
they do! And I swear...

199
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,041
I sure as Hell
won't be answering it.

200
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,625
In centimeters,
her bust is ninety-two.

201
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,416
Waist, fifty-nine.
Hips, eighty-four.

202
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,458
If you wanna be specific,
her waist measured fifty-eight

203
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,583
until two days ago. But
when I glanced this morning,

204
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,375
it had risen to fifty-nine.
I believe the reason for this

205
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,083
to be the two
pieces of shortcake she

206
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,916
readily consumed yesterday.

207
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,875
He's absolutely right!
Tomoki has answered correctly!

208
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,708
Moving on, now. What time did
Asaka Maiko of Second Year,

209
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,375
Class A take
her bath yesterday?

210
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,208
From 9:57 p.m. until 10:34 p.m.,
for a total of thirty-seven

211
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,666
minutes, or to be more
precise, thirty-seven minutes,

212
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,625
twenty-one point
zero eight seconds.

213
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,125
Incidentally, her
favorite bath powder

214
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,666
is Strawberry Chestnut Splash.

215
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,166
Next question. What color
are the panties of the

216
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,166
three pretty girls standing in
the front row of the audience?

217
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,750
From right-to-left,
white, pink, and polka-dot.

218
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,041
Yesterday, it was polka-dot,
striped, and flowers.

219
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,375
Before that, pink,
white, and a light teal.

220
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,666
Tomoki's correct
answers just keep on coming!

221
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,541
And his seat continues
to rise... along with the

222
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,875
crazed outrage
from the girls below him!

223
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,958
Ladies... and gents...

224
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,500
they're side-by-side! Tomoki
has reached the same level as

225
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,291
our first place holder, Nymph!

226
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,916
It all comes down to this.
Whoever answers the next

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,833
question correctly will win.
What's this? Another giveaway?

228
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,208
The next question
is a giveaway question!

229
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,500
One of the previously-asked
questions will be asked again.

230
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,916
Here goes... There is
a girls' changing room

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,458
right before your
eyes. What do you do?!

232
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,708
Crap. This thing's over.

233
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,083
That Tomoki
cockroach is gonna win.

234
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,583
I'm gonna be sick!

235
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,750
This is it, ladies. You've
done your best to make fun of me

236
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,958
for being unpopular and
dumb and ugly and whatever.

237
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,916
But in the end, I'm the
one who wins this thing!

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,416
Starting tomorrow,
I'm gonna rip into you!

239
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,208
Dummies! Ha ha!
You're so freakin' dumb!

240
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,125
This is it, Tomoki. We
need your answer, please.

241
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,166
My answer is... I do not--

242
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,833
Huh?

243
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,166
What's wrong with him?

244
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,166
Answer, Tomoki.
You can do it!

245
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,625
There is a girls'
changing room...

246
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,666
right before your eyes...

247
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,666
What do you do?
What do you do?

248
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,208
No. That can't be what's
happening. Don't tell me he's

249
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,541
fighting against his
Inner Dude up there!

250
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,166
Don't screw this
up, man! Come on!

251
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,125
It's just a game show!
Lie if you have to, man!

252
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,083
Just give the
right answer, dammit!

253
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,000
Say it, Tomoki!

254
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,625
I take a peek.

255
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't peek.

256
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,208
And Nymph is the
winner! Everyone, please,

257
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,041
a warm round of
applause for our champion!

258
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,375
You win.

259
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,833
Several days passed... but
things didn't get much better.

260
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,375
The news about how I blew
the Smart-Kid Championship

261
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,875
got around Sorami pretty fast.

262
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,291
Look, there he is.

263
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,708
You mean the stupid
one we heard about?

264
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,875
Everyone in town started
looking at me like I was

265
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,250
the biggest idiot
they'd ever seen.

266
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,833
Tomoki Sakurai. Today's the day
I kill you 'til you're dead!

267
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,041
Not my fault I'm
more self-aware than them.

268
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,083
I'm so hungry.

269
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,375
Astraea, what are
you doing over there?

270
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,333
Dummy!

271
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,291
You're the last person
who should be calling me that

272
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,041
and you know it!

273
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,750
Dummy! Dummy! Dummy!

274
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,541
It's like that,
huh?! Rematch time!

275
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,416
What is this thing?

276
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,416
It's just a little board
game... where the truth is

277
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,333
literally laid out for
you in black and white.

278
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,541
Being some mythical
creature from a strange place,

279
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,250
you've never seen
this game before.

280
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,166
No way you're gonna beat
me your first time playing.

281
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,750
Now, you're gonna be
the biggest idiot in Sorami!

282
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,791
You big dummy!

283
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,666
So...

284
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,875
You gonna show me how to play?

285
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,208
Sure... Check it out. Just put
this piece here, surrounding my

286
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,166
white piece here, and
then you flip it to black.

287
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,583
Now what?

288
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,958
Um... Well... let's see,
uh... I guess I'll go here.

289
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,041
What next?

290
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,250
Well, if you put one there,
most of my white pieces will

291
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,833
turn black, won't they?

292
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,708
Yeah, good.

293
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,916
And now what?

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,625
Let's see... I put
this piece here and...

295
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,041
I win!

296
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,208
Dummy! Dummy! Dummy!

297
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,708
Oh, is that right?

298
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,750
Fine! Then... Then
we're playin' this next!

299
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,250
Ten seconds...
Twenty seconds...

300
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,500
Wait a minute! I can't read!

301
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,208
I win!

302
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,000
Dummy! Dummy!

303
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,625
No. This game is boring. I
challenge you to Stick-Man Kick!

304
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,041
Sure. Bring it on, baby!

305
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,708
Check out that killer pass!

306
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,041
Yeah, shot on goal!

307
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,416
Long pass blowin' right by you!

308
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,333
Interception!

309
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,875
Interception denied! Boo-ya!

310
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,500
Uh, guys. This doesn't
seem to have anything to do

311
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,208
with how smart
either of you a--

312
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,000
Take that, dummy!

313
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,500
You're the dummy, dummy!

314
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,375
That's exactly what
they're doing, Sugata.

315
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,000
I just wondered
what you thought.

316
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,583
Here it comes, dummy!

317
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,000
Dummy!

318
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,208
Dammit, Tomo!

319
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,541
Geez, how many times
are you gonna do this?

320
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,375
You will be paying
for that window, you know.

321
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,208
Busted!

322
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,291
Two, three!

323
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,375
Stop! That's not how you play!

324
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,666
Dummy! Dummy!

325
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,583
I lost...

326
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,041
Great! What do you wanna
play next? Old Maid, maybe?

327
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,625
Nah. I'm cool with
being the loser today.

328
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,458
Yep, I said it. I'm the big
loser, okay. Now are you hungry?

329
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,916
You wanna eat before you go?

330
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,166
You're always hungry.

331
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,000
Ooh, Nymph. Nice job. You
arranged the food perfectly.

332
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:18,916
Hey!

333
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,083
Excellent,
they're finally here.

334
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,250
Jeez, you two, it's
about time you showed.

335
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,458
Sorry about that. We were
just having ourselves

336
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,250
a really killer contest.

337
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,833
Everything is ready... Master.

338
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,833
Raise your glasses. Here's
to our good pal Tomoki.

339
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,041
The biggest moron our fair
town Sorami has ever seen!

340
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,208
Jeez, keep your
voice down, would ya?!

341
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,125
To Tomoki...

342
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,416
Yeah, fine. To me.

343
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,250
I think I'd like
some of that, too.

344
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,166
Sure.

345
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,458
Meat is awesome!

346
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:58,291
Hey, Astraea. Could you pass
me that? I wanna try some.

347
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,125
Yeah. Here.

348
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,625
Cool, thanks.

349
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,625
Sugata, you're not having any?

350
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,916
I'll eat later.

351
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,708
That quiz the other day sure
was a good time, wasn't it?

352
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,833
Tomoki, you ready
for your revenge yet?

353
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,625
No way, I'm over it.

354
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,833
Aw, Miss Ikaros...

355
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,541
Astraea. Hey...
if you ever faint. Like...

356
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,125
from hunger... come over
here and eat. Anytime.

357
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,083
What'd I say?

358
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,333
Thanks. Even
though... you're dumb!

359
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,125
Hey!

360
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,041
Hey! What the
Hell are you doing?!

361
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,083
Hey!

362
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,583
You're dumb!

363
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,416
Nuh-uh! You are!

364
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,375
What are you doing?!
That's my food!

365
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,625
We're trying to have a
nice dinner. Don't ruin it.

366
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,416
Dummy! Dummy! Dummy!

367
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Another day in paradise...

368
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,250
Yep.

369
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,375
Dummy! Dummy!

370
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,625
Dummy! Dummy! Dummy! Dummy!

371
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,750
At least she
is enjoying herself.

372
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,250
It is a little disturbing
that, unlike Beta,

373
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,500
she has yet to
break her imprinting.

374
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,208
My daughters are so amusing.

375
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,708
What is that?

376
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,208
Ah, there you are... Daedalus.

377
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,083
Funny thing. While following
a bug who recently trespassed

378
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,416
into the Synapse...
I found evidence of you

379
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,666
accessing Tomoki's dreams.

380
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,000
You were also the one who broke
the seal on the Uranus Queen

381
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,958
and ejected her to
Earth, weren't you?

382
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,458
So what if I did?
There's nothing you can do.

383
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,166
Harpy and Gamma's
Prometheus Cannons won't even

384
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,208
dent the barrier I
have established around me.

385
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,583
Oh, I know that. I'm
actually here to deliver

386
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,208
a small message of courtesy.

387
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,541
About the
second-generation Angeloids.

388
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,083
They've been perfected.

389
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,583
Perfected?!

390
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,125
The new model is far
more advanced than that

391
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,375
pathetic first
version you built.

392
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:53,791
Their destructive power
alone... is unfathomable.

393
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,708
What are you
planning to do now?

394
00:23:56,791 --> 00:24:00,416
What do you mean? That
should be obvious to you.

395
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,041
I'm going to destroy
the Alpha... and the Beta.

396
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,958
Next time...
"Tomoki-Eating Watermelon"
