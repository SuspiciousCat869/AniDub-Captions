1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,791
And good morning to ya. First
up today, our top news story...

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,208
Still tired.

3
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,375
Got a question for ya.

4
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,250
Yeah?

5
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,625
You've gotten to the point where

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,000
you can wake up in the
morning without me having to

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,083
do it for you, haven't you?
I mean, you're up early

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,708
during summer vacation
when there's no school.

9
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,041
It's 'cause Ikaros
gets me up every day.

10
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,875
Oh. Yeah, that's right. You
have someone else here to help.

11
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,541
That makes sense.

12
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:00,458
Well... I guess I can sleep in
now. Might as well, since I have

13
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:06,958
the time for it. Good. That's
good. Everything's going great.

14
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,208
Yeah. I've never been so full.

15
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,083
Wait! Where's mine?!

16
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,250
You said I could come over
and eat anytime I wanted.

17
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,666
As long as we're on
that subject, why are you

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,666
hanging around my
house all the time?

19
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,958
I really have,
like, nothing to do.

20
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,583
Don't give me that B.S.!

21
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:29,750
Why not?! Hmph! Ikaros gets
to do whatever because of

22
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,333
"you're her master," but all
Nymph does is watch her stories.

23
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,208
If I can't be here,
it's no fair she gets to!

24
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,625
However true what
you're saying might be...

25
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,791
Nymph doesn't have a master.
It's not like she has her

26
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,416
pick of a
dozen places to stay.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,333
He's right. I'm an
Angeloid without a master.

28
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,375
Sometimes, I try to imagine
myself in a world where

29
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:54,000
I do have one. But
it always vanishes.

30
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,916
I know Tomoki well enough
by now that, hopefully,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,208
he'd agree to
become my master.

32
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,500
If I could just ask him, maybe
he'd find it in himself to

33
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,750
accept this wingless,
good-for-nothing.

34
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,916
Knowing Tomoki, though...

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,125
Astraea, if you
haven't eaten breakfast...

36
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,458
Why're you
staring at me, Nymph?

37
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,958
Oh, uh... Nothing, forget it.

38
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,916
Dummy! Hey,
dummy! You wanna go?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,750
Huh? Think you
can take me?

40
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,125
Can you not see
I'm reading the paper!

41
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,666
Man, you're lame.

42
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,500
Man, I can't relax
here at all. That's it.

43
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,375
Time for peace
and quiet, Plan B.

44
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,500
Uh, Master, you left your tea.

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,000
Later suckers.

46
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,291
Frequently before
natural disasters...

47
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,625
certain phenomena...

48
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,125
sometimes seen as
warning signs, are recorded.

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,916
A good example of this
is small animals fleeing

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,333
before an earthquake.

51
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,083
Or swarms of jellyfish
warning of the destruction of

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,833
marine ecosystems due to
climate change around the globe.

53
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,666
Oh, Sugata.

54
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,583
Recently in Sorami, we've
seen baffling outbreaks of

55
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,708
freakish weather... mass
suicides of deep-water fish...

56
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,541
and the blanket installation
of shady-looking pipes.

57
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,916
Could this be due to the
influence of the New World?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,583
Could they be pulling the
strings across the divide?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,958
Have you picked
out a favorite yet?

60
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,291
What do you mean by that?

61
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,583
For your new
Pretty, of course.

62
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,375
There's a surprising
number of applicants.

63
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,625
This one. She makes an excellent
candidate, doesn't she?

64
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,541
Hey, hot stuff.

65
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,458
Ikaros. What's wrong with you?

66
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,041
Not me. Master.

67
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,375
Wait. What?

68
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,625
He refuses to come
out of the bathroom.

69
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,125
The bathroom is
a place of comfort,

70
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,458
where all
mankind finds relief.

71
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,916
Say what you will, but this
is where I am the most relaxed.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,708
Recently, we had a nice,
little warm-water-rinse

73
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,500
toilet seat put in.

74
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,833
This is the most
important room in the house,

75
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,208
so I'm quite particular
about the décor.

76
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,416
Hello? Master?

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,250
I'm not comin' out! The
bathroom is the last place of

78
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,916
refuge you four have left me!

79
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,875
You heard him.

80
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
Should we leave him alone?

81
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,458
No way! None of us'll be able
to use the can when we gotta go.

82
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,666
I thought something
like this might happen.

83
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,875
So I secretly installed
a remote control for

84
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,666
the warm-water-rinse
toilet seat.

85
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,333
Having a homeowner
who finds solace in the

86
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,250
privacy of the
bathroom is one thing,

87
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,291
but the fact that you
had to plan for this.

88
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,416
So how does it work, exactly?

89
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I have learned that humans
are susceptible to heat.

90
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,708
Oh, that is nice. Just lovely.

91
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,250
That doesn't really
sound like it's doing

92
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,291
what you wanted it to do.

93
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,125
This is ridiculous.
Ikaros, lemme see that!

94
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,750
You need to
crank it up higher.

95
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,791
To eleven!

96
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,250
Hot-hot-hot!

97
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,875
Uh, Tomoki, you all right?

98
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,791
Why don't you just give up
and come out? Otherwise that

99
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,750
hot water could burn another
two or three holes in your butt.

100
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,291
She said "butt!"

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:01,083
Damn... those stupid girls!
Trying to sell us humans short!

102
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,750
The latest reports from
the meteorological observatory

103
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,208
state that, while
the El Nino effect,

104
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,875
responsible for
unusual weather worldwide,

105
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,375
may have ended in the
spring... It's possible that

106
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,833
the La Nina effect, another
cause of unusual weather...

107
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,125
What is it now?

108
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,250
It's Master again.

109
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,916
What's the problem this time?

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,625
I've tried, but he won't
come out of the closet.

111
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,500
Not again.

112
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,791
Everybody's made a secret fort
in their room at least once

113
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,000
when they were a kid, right?
I wonder why it is you feel so

114
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,375
relaxed when you retreat into
the sanctuary of your closet.

115
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,208
Hello? Master?

116
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,291
Eat it! I am not coming out!
You already retrofitted

117
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,875
the Hell out of my precious
bathroom! So I can promise you

118
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,333
I am not coming
out this time! No way!

119
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,250
You heard what he said.

120
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,833
He sounds pretty cheesed.

121
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,166
Leave him alone?

122
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,708
I thought something like
this might happen as well.

123
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,500
Oh. Another remote.

124
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,666
You've taken it
upon yourself to retrofit

125
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,083
everything in the house,
haven't you, Alpha?

126
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,750
So what can you
do with this one?

127
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,125
I reconsidered this morning's
events. If Master says he

128
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,125
wants to remain secluded,
it is our duty as Angeloids to

129
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,083
support that decision,
no matter how we feel.

130
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,583
Goo-goo... ga-ga.
Ga-ga... goo-goo!

131
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,000
Listen. He sounds
so happy in there.

132
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
Nice job, Ikaros.

133
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,875
I am glad.

134
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,500
But... what's he gonna
do about food and stuff?

135
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,125
If he shuts himself away,
he'll need something.

136
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,375
Yes, I prepared for that.

137
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,208
It smells like a
fish market farted.

138
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,083
Wait. You can't give
him all that stuff raw.

139
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,583
It'll upset his stomach.

140
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,500
Not a problem. Watch this.

141
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,041
This is not right.

142
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,333
You can't put...
living things...

143
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,916
into a freakin' microwave!

144
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,000
It won't open! Holy
freaking crap, it won't open!

145
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,458
He's having a blast now.

146
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,416
Hey, are you out there?!

147
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,250
Super nice job, Ikaros.

148
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,791
I am glad.

149
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:35,625
You've forgotten one thing.
Uh... How's he s'posed to, uh...

150
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,041
you know...
go to the bathroom?

151
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:38,708
Open up!

152
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,000
He does that a lot.

153
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,291
Not a problem.

154
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,250
You gotta let me out!

155
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,250
Smells like freedom!

156
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,875
Master yelled at me today.

157
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,416
Oh, Ikaros. Are you all right?

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,416
Yes.

159
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,166
What are those
pipe-things sticking out?

160
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,000
Proposal.

161
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,250
Oh, cool. The actress
on Barnyard Sonata

162
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,625
is getting married. Remind
me to tell Nymph about this.

163
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,500
Sohara, I have a question.

164
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,041
Sure, what is it?

165
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,625
When somebody proposes to you,

166
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,708
is marriage what
happens afterward?

167
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,708
Yep. Check it out. After the
proposal, you have a wedding

168
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,375
and you get to wear a
beautiful dress like this one.

169
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,166
Isn't it gorgeous?

170
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,916
A proposal, then a wedding?

171
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,916
You look like
something's bothering you.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,916
Uh... It's Master.
I think he proposed to me.

173
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,041
What're you talking about?

174
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,958
Uh. Nothing.

175
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,708
Maybe the heat's making
you lightheaded. I know!

176
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,375
We should go get some ice cream.
That's the best thing to do

177
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,208
when it's hot outside. Yeah!

178
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,208
That felt awkward.
Why is that?

179
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,791
Well, Nymph. Thanks for
helping me on the weekend.

180
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,875
Nah, I'm happy to help.
So, how was the Synapse?

181
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,125
You find out anything?

182
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,416
The harpies are really
keeping a close watch.

183
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,125
I didn't get to meet with
Daedalus, unfortunately.

184
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,625
But if what I'm thinking
is correct... something...

185
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,458
is going to
happen soon enough.

186
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,791
I don't know what, though.
Still need to research.

187
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,708
Here.

188
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,625
I'll let you borrow it for a
while. Once you learn how to

189
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,583
use it, you'll be able to
investigate on your own.

190
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,333
Great. Thank you.

191
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,916
Right! Lay 'em down!

192
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,125
Gambling is so
much freakin' fun!

193
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:07,875
Good. You recognize the fun
times to be had with poker.

194
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,916
That's the first step in
being a good sport, dear.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,291
Times? First step?
Is this more math?

196
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,708
Sure. What's one plus one?

197
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,541
Blue!

198
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,750
Why don't we just have dinner?

199
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,291
Here we are, Astraea. The whole
spread is for you. Dig in!

200
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,916
Eat as much of
it as you want to.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,583
Are you for real? I haven't...

202
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,500
I haven't belonged
anywhere in so long.

203
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,291
I can't go back to the Synapse.
And I'm, like, way too stupid

204
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,583
to try and feed myself.
Oh, thank you!

205
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,916
Mistress, the boss would
like a quick word with you.

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,041
I have to excuse
myself for a moment.

207
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:00,125
There's plenty more, dear.
Take your time, enjoy yourself.

208
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,666
Astraea...

209
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,833
Yes?

210
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,125
We should all know
where we belong in life.

211
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,375
Have you figured
out your place yet?

212
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,333
I see it as clearly as
a bright and sunny day.

213
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,583
Let's all play a
game together. Who's in?

214
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,250
Why are you all
still hanging around here

215
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,875
every morning?! It's old!

216
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,833
Oo-oo-ooh! Let's play cards!
Sensei taught me to gamble!

217
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,458
It rules! I wanna
play "poke-her!"

218
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,500
Fine, whatever. Just don't
make any trouble, okay?

219
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,250
Wait. Where
are you running to?

220
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,916
I'm busy, doin' stuff. So keep
it down. I have very important

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,250
scientific work to attend to.

222
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,500
Finally, this
sucker's almost finished.

223
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,333
And so, by placing mirrors
at a 45-degree angle in the

224
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,458
bend of each pipe, the mirror
reflects an image making

225
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:25,291
visible, that which is beyond
the reach of any normal pipe.

226
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:34,166
This has been a long,
hard undertaking. The fact is,

227
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,041
for the past six months, I've
been connecting these pipes

228
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,458
to my room from all
over town. Time and again,

229
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,458
so often I lost count.
I would strike water

230
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,250
while digging my tunnels.

231
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,583
I took extra-special care when
laying pipe in places where

232
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,708
only girls could enter.
And while Sohara and the others

233
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,291
may know my face... nothing
is better than not being seen

234
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:04,000
by anyone. Working in absolute
solitude, my plan went forward.

235
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,291
At times boldly,
at times delicately.

236
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,791
I overcame many
challenges in this manner,

237
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,208
until my sweat and efforts
finally came to fruition.

238
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,291
I was building my summer
vacation science project,

239
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,166
and it was gonna rock.

240
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,916
I call it... The
Sorami All-Access...

241
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,250
Tomoki Peeping System!

242
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,833
This magnificent apparatus
connects my room with

243
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,583
all of Sorami's
steamiest spots.

244
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,291
These pipes afford me the
"libertine experience" from

245
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,541
my very own home!
Hell, yeah! I can have

246
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:46,791
all the thrills I want, 24
hours a day, 365 days a year!

247
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,375
So what're we watchin'?

248
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,166
Oh god! Don't touch! You
can't touch without asking!

249
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,583
Aww...

250
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,041
Don't give me that sad
puppy face! What are you doing

251
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,416
up here in my room, anyway?!
Now go downstairs and play!

252
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,791
What the crap, dude?
You said I could come over

253
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,500
any time I was
hungry, didn't you?

254
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,666
Ugh, fine. Hold on,
I got somethin' right here.

255
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,750
Bam! Chow down, ding-bat!

256
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,750
So... Don't s'pose you feel
like playing cards with me?

257
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,291
Dammit! No!
I told you, I'm busy!

258
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,458
Whatever, dummy.

259
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,791
Shut up! You're the dumb one!

260
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,458
Man, it took forever
to get her outta here.

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,083
Never bored with this
twisted stuff, are you?

262
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,041
No, it's not that! You
don't understand, Nymph!

263
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,166
You couldn't understand!
This is just, uh, you know...

264
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,750
I'd be glad to help
you out if you need.

265
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,458
One condition...

266
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,083
Just... let me call you Master.

267
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,916
Ma... Oh, never
mind, it's nothing.

268
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,541
What was all
that weirdness about?

269
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,291
Whatever the case is
with her, it's time for

270
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,458
some all-you-can-peep with me.

271
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,166
Now, Tomoki...

272
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,916
N-No, Sohara! This isn't
what-- I mean it's just--

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,750
Crap! This is it! I'm a goner!

274
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,875
Do you really not think
anything of them? The Angeloids?

275
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,791
Just look at them. Ikaros,
Nymph, and Astraea are all

276
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,583
ridiculously attractive.
Do you really not

277
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,000
think anything of them?
That just doesn't even

278
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,833
seem normal.
It doesn't make sense.

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,833
I told you, they've got wings.

280
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,166
Big floppy wings
stickin' outta their backs.

281
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,833
Okay, but still. Lately you've
been doing sicko stuff to

282
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,458
both Nymph and
Astraea, haven't you?

283
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,416
Uh, well maybe a
little, but who wouldn't?

284
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,958
I-I got like,
hormones 'n' stuff!

285
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,541
Just wait. When it comes
to Ikaros, you don't do

286
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,000
any those things, do you?

287
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,208
So... why is that?

288
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,125
Wow, I'm not real sure.

289
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,958
Now that you mention
it, it is kinda weird.

290
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,791
Wait, Sohara don't go.

291
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,583
What the Hell? She left
without doing anything.

292
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,833
Normally, she follows her same
pattern: chop me and then smash

293
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:46,166
a bunch of my stuff.
Wait! Of course!

294
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,958
Why didn't I see it
before? Sohara's gotta be...

295
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,875
Yeah, that's it!

296
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,958
She's just a dummy! I bet
she didn't even know what this

297
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,291
whole brilliant
setup is! Dummy! Dummy!

298
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,625
Sohara is a dummy!

299
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,625
You know I can hear you, Tomo.

300
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,125
So, what do we do about this?

301
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,958
First priority is
we get back at him for

302
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,208
being the grade A jerk he is.

303
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,583
No! Astraea! Don't take
your clothes off out here!

304
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,000
It's indecent! Gasp!
Not you, too, Nymph!

305
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,791
I can see everything!

306
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,666
Well, gosh! Maybe I'll
have to strip down, too!

307
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,833
The yard! Which one is it?!
Which one is the yard?!

308
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,416
Oh, yeah. This is the one!

309
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,958
My eyes!

310
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,500
Nice, it worked!

311
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,375
Suck on that, dummy!

312
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,791
Master is screaming
in there. Is he all right?

313
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,416
You're a fine one
to ask that question,

314
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,791
after the insanity you pulled
with the toilet and closet.

315
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,166
Stupid broads.
They have no idea

316
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,791
what they've
just set into motion.

317
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,583
Dummy Dumb-head!

318
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:06,416
Because... The Tomoki Peeping
System works both ways!

319
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,583
Nyaah!

320
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,791
You learned your
lesson yet, Tomoki?

321
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,791
What now?

322
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,291
There's a bug!
A bug in the tube!

323
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,708
A bug?

324
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,666
Now for the cherry on top!

325
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,083
A passionate kiss
fwom widdle ol' me!

326
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,875
Ikaros, what did he do?! Tomo!

327
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:00,333
What was that? The last
time there was kissing...

328
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,291
I did not... feel like this...

329
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,583
No! Sohara, don't!

330
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,541
You're not going
to get away with this!

331
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,708
Not today!

332
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,958
Let's smash the
crap outta this thing!

333
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,000
Stomp it 'til there's
nothing left but dust!

334
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,458
Hell yeah! Astraea smash!

335
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,125
It appears I was correct.

336
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,000
Something is wrong
with my reactor.

337
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,291
Master...

338
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,208
Reactor approaching
critical overheat.

339
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,500
Activate auto-repair cycle.

340
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:43,083
Delete all memories of Tomoki
Sakurai, presumed cause of

341
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,916
the malfunction.
Reboot imminent.

342
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,458
The outbreak of torrential
rains over the Genkai Sea is

343
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,333
gradually moving to the south...
and will be making landfall in

344
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,041
the Northern
Kyushu region sometime

345
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,875
early tomorrow afternoon.
Wind gusts as high as

346
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,958
seventy kilometers per
hour have been recorded,

347
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,708
which takes this storm out
of the realm of tropical storm

348
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,208
and into typhoon territory.
This is a big one, folks.

349
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:52,625
More... More love. Just wait,
ladies. It's on its way.

350
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,291
I am coming to
show you what love is.

351
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:09,041
Next time... "The Edge
of an Indiscriminate Requiem"
