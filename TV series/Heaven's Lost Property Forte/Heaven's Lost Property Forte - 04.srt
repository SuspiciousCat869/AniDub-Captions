1
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,041
Beta betrayed me, and
the Gammas have failed.

2
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,583
Fly home... before
your task is complete,

3
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,583
and there will
be... consequences.

4
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,291
Yes... Master.

5
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,875
No flying back to the Synapse
'til I kill Tomoki Sakurai.

6
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,000
You'll be needing
my help again.

7
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,041
Yes please!

8
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,000
Think back to how that
sumo tournament went down.

9
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,208
Tomoki's going to be a tough
nut to crack, don'tcha think?

10
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,916
Like a walnut!

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,666
Lucky for you,
I have a brilliant idea.

12
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,708
Awesome! So what do I do?!

13
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,666
Wrestling's okay and all,
but when it comes to the

14
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,958
Japanese art of war, there's
more than one way to skin a cat.

15
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,250
Oda Nobunaga was a
powerful warlord during the

16
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,833
Sengoku Period, a time
of chaos and bloodshed.

17
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,458
One time, while fighting at
Okehazama, he snatched victory

18
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,416
out from the jaws of defeat.

19
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
And he won the Battle of
Nagashino by looking beyond the

20
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,375
tactics of the day and
using thousands of riflemen.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,708
He was clearly
ahead of his time.

22
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,916
But what gave
him that advantage?

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,833
History says that Nobunaga
always kept a world map

24
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,708
and globe in his room.

25
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,250
It's not unreasonable to think
that maybe he'd discovered the

26
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:25,666
existence of the New World and
gleaned some knowledge from it.

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,791
The New World... I imagine
it fascinated Nobunaga.

28
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,291
Yeah, I'm out. Good
luck finding your next Pretty.

29
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,750
First snow of the year!

30
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:50,583
Ah, the perfect day...
to do absolutely nothing.

31
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,083
War is Hell!

32
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,333
All students, report to the P.E.
field immediately! Two teams.

33
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,541
Boys on one, girls on the other!
We're going to duke it out

34
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,875
like our ancestors always
did... with snowballs!

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Commander of the girls'
team, Mikako Satsukitane!

36
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:19,375
Commander of the boys'
team, Tomoki Sakurai!

37
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,875
I don't wanna play!

38
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,083
The rules of the
game are as follows...

39
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,791
To maximize the fun factor,
you can keep playing in

40
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,416
our snowball fight, no matter
how many times you get hit.

41
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,083
Whichever team
successfully incapacitates the

42
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,708
other team's commander
first is the winner.

43
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,083
Screw this crap.
Someone untie me already.

44
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,708
That nap ain't
gonna take itself...

45
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,375
And... the prize for winning.
Your team gets to do whatever

46
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,041
they want to the losing
team for an entire day.

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,625
Well, folks, whaddya think?

48
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,541
Like, anything anything?

49
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,416
Your Lordship!

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,208
Command us, Your Lordship!

51
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,666
Your Lordship!

52
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,833
To arms. The time for
victory is soon at hand.

53
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,708
Your Lordship!
What's it gonna be?!

54
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,833
The enemy... is at Honno-ji!

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,583
Well, they sure are

56
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,625
getting themselves
psyched up down there.

57
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,458
They're getting something up.

58
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,208
But Mikako! If we lose
this battle, who knows what

59
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,750
those boys are
gonna do to us?!

60
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,416
Guess we better
not lose, then, huh?

61
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,958
Yeah, we do have Ikaros
and Nymph on our side.

62
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,791
I'm probably
worrying for nothing.

63
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,750
Oh, I have something else
in mind for the two of them.

64
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,625
After all, we have to give
those poor boys at least

65
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,083
the illusion of a chance.

66
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,375
Why?!

67
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,958
Angeloids. I would
love a soak in a hot spring.

68
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,875
Huh? A hot spring?

69
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,041
Poke around with your radar for
any untapped hot springs nearby.

70
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,166
That's right up your
alley, isn't it, Nymph?

71
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,708
Uh... it was. But ever
since stupid Gamma and Harpy

72
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,000
took my wings,
my radar's been kinda funky.

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,375
Well then, you're
worthless to me.

74
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,291
Ikaros, how about you?

75
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:07,041
My radar is not nearly as
powerful as Nymph's, even now.

76
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:11,000
But I am able to dig down to the
water once you have found it.

77
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,625
Then that is just
what I will have you do.

78
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,000
Blast that mountain,
would you? I'm feeling lucky.

79
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,083
Targeting.

80
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,375
Hey! Whaddya
think you're doing?!

81
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,125
Don't be stupid! Tomoki
will get mad if you just start

82
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,291
blasting stuff away at random!

83
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,250
No guarantees, but
lemme at least try my radar

84
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,416
before you guys go nuts.

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,875
Okay. Gimme a sec here.

86
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,416
Well, I'll leave you to it.

87
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,541
Watch and learn!
I'm the Synapse's bestest

88
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:53,583
close-combat Angeloid!
Type Delta! Astraea!

89
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,333
You don't stand
a snowball's chance in...

90
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,583
I don't know, like, an oven?

91
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,333
Let's get this
party started, shall we?

92
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,083
The enemy is dug in,
high on the mountainside.

93
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,458
Getting behind them
is too risky. Instead,

94
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,541
we attack them
head-on to distract them.

95
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,208
Then we move in on
their flank for the kill.

96
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,875
Well, my Lord? What say you?

97
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,666
I'm with you, Four-Eyed Dragon.

98
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,333
Let loose...
the snowballs of war!

99
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,000
Ready! Fire!

100
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,958
Left flank, deploy! Move,
ladies! Hit 'em upside the head!

101
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,000
Right flank, sweep
in and take them dow--!

102
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,416
My Lady!

103
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,291
We're under attack! The enemy
commander and a group of

104
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,541
his men are charging towards our
location like a pack of demons!

105
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,041
Hold on. They're doing what?!

106
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,083
So cold!

107
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,083
It's go time!

108
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:09,041
Take out their heavy
hitter as fast as you can! Go!

109
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,875
So that's their devious
plan! The boys are gonna try

110
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,083
and take me out first,
'cause I'm the most dangerous.

111
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,958
They're in for a surprise!

112
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,583
Bring it on, chumps!

113
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,125
Show me what ya got!

114
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,875
What the--?

115
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,958
Stay on target!

116
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,458
Whoa! What did I do?!

117
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,125
Fire away!

118
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,500
Why, Tomo?!

119
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,708
That's it! Keep pelting her!
It's the only way we'll win!

120
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,791
Come on, I surrender!

121
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,416
Yeah, more snow!
Pile it on! It's all good!

122
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,458
We'll find her in the spring!

123
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,208
Mission accomplished.

124
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,541
Hold on, what
about me?! I'm a threat!

125
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,041
Yeah. Whatevs. You can
ignore this one, guys.

126
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,458
All boobs, no brains.

127
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,166
You're... so gonna pay!

128
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,291
"No brains," huh?! Wait'll
you get a load of this!

129
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,083
Super ultra snowball atta--!

130
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,333
Huh?!

131
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,791
Attack!

132
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,208
That's the spirit!
Don't let up!

133
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,708
Sundown. That's
enough for today.

134
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,083
This sucks. I got nothing.

135
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,000
Lame-o. If I still had
wings, finding a hot spring

136
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,625
would be a piece of cake.

137
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,541
Try to relax.

138
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,333
I just realized.

139
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,708
Last year, around
now, that was when

140
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,958
the Gammas took my wings away.

141
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,041
I haven't had a master
for a whole entire year.

142
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,916
Guess I'm not a very
good Angeloid, am I?

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,291
Incorrect.

144
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,708
It's cool. This is still
way better than when I was

145
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,000
getting bossed
around in the Synapse.

146
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,541
My old master wasn't
very nice to me.

147
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,916
Sometimes, I do get
a little jealous, Alpha.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Tomoki's... a
pretty good master.

149
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,625
Which makes me
think about Astraea.

150
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,708
The only reason she
came here is because

151
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,750
her master ordered her to.

152
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,916
Oh yeah.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,416
I hope she is not
having a hard time.

154
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,916
There you are! Any luck,
my little dowsing rod?

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,958
Uh, sorry. I haven't
found anything yet.

156
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,125
If only you
came with a receipt.

157
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,708
How am I supposed to
enjoy a hot spring now?

158
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,416
Dig one yourself, Mikako.

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,250
Huh?

160
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,916
Sugata?

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,333
I know of the situation.

162
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,666
It should be you.

163
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,458
All righty, then. Long as
you think it's a good idea.

164
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,958
Here goes!

165
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,541
We kicked ass today!
Right, your Lordship?

166
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,625
Of course, Young Cub!

167
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,833
Sure, the enemy
commander got away,

168
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,500
but one more good
push and they're goners.

169
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,375
And after tomorrow, they'll
wish they'd surrendered

170
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,083
when they had the chance!

171
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Now...

172
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,833
I believe it is time...

173
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,166
we show our prisoners
a little hospitality!

174
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,041
Yes, sir...

175
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,666
Hey! Quit it!

176
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,083
Coochie, coochie!

177
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,125
Cut that out!

178
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,041
Get away!

179
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,416
Please! No!

180
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,458
This is terrible! I never
knew humans were so mean!

181
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh, you'll get yours!

182
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,916
My master ordered me
to take you out, insect,

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,041
and that's what I'm gonna do!

184
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,416
An elephant never forgets!

185
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,833
I'm gonna kick you right in the
elephant when I get out of here!

186
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,666
Your Lordship! I bring
you horrible news!

187
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,291
Buffoon! I'm busy here!

188
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,125
Well, you see, it's
the girls! They're--!

189
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,500
So uh... Could
you do me a favor?

190
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,500
Well that depends.
What do you want?

191
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,000
'Scuse me, Prez? Are
you sure it's okay for us

192
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,500
to be relaxing like this?

193
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,000
Of course it is. Most of
the girls who got caught

194
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,500
have boyfriends
over there, anyway.

195
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,791
I hope no one's
being too naughty.

196
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,833
Ladies? A little dip would
do you a world of good.

197
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, don't you two
fret. It's just us girls.

198
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,208
Wings, no wings. Nobody
here's gonna give a flip.

199
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,750
Oh... my... God!

200
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,583
Lordship! Your
enemy is clever!

201
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,333
She's raising the
morale of her forces!

202
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,375
Nice way to end the day, huh!

203
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,583
Among other things!

204
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,333
This feels good.

205
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,916
Have either of you
seen... Sohara?

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,666
No. I wonder where
she could have gone.

207
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,833
What is the meaning of this?!

208
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,500
They're waging war...
in my pants!

209
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,541
But I can't... look away!

210
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,166
Your Lordship!

211
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,041
Back off, man! This...
is vital surveillance!

212
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,958
But... there's been a coup!

213
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,583
What did you say?!

214
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,916
The... the popular guys...

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,041
Your Lordship, once you
left, they... I can't say it.

216
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
It's just too horrible!

217
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,666
This has gone on long
enough. Let's get you untied.

218
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,166
I just... couldn't
bear to watch it.

219
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,375
Oh, Shun...

220
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,750
Run away while
you still can, Yuki.

221
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,500
My hero, Hiro!

222
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,375
Hey, there. You all right?

223
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,500
Duh! I'm so all right,
it's not even funny!

224
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,166
I let myself
get caught, hello?!

225
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,458
Laugh it up, sugar-tits!

226
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,208
Seize them! All of them!
Off with their heads!

227
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,291
Sir!

228
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,666
No, even better!
Off with their tops!

229
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,916
Just keep running!

230
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,125
Get back here!

231
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,750
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

232
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,708
Sorry, Your Lordship.
It's all over.

233
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,333
You buffoon!

234
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,500
I'll tell you when it's over!

235
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:00,291
Taste our cold wrath!
We're the unpopular guys!

236
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,250
We've got nothing to lose!

237
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,083
They've all been caught
up in an icy bloodlust.

238
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,250
I never thought
it would come to this.

239
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,333
What the--?

240
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,541
You buried me...

241
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,958
No, it can't be!

242
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,666
You buried me... in snowballs...

243
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,541
while I was wearing
a damn skirt!

244
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,458
Your Lordship! Over there!

245
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,125
That sounds like... Sohara!

246
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,208
And that's even
possible because?

247
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,916
I can't say for sure.

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,250
But I think
we're looking at...

249
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,750
the Abominable Snow-haraman!

250
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,625
Legend tells...
of spirits in the snow.

251
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,791
If they grew angry
enough, they'd freeze any

252
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:55,250
unfortunate human nearby
within their icy embrace.

253
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,958
One of those spirits must
have merged with Sohara.

254
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,541
Her anger served as
a catalyst, turning them into

255
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,958
a creature the likes of
which the world has never seen.

256
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,541
Look out!

257
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,833
You brave bastards!

258
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,166
Incoming!

259
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,416
Damn it, Sohara!

260
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,291
How dare you blast my guys?!

261
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,958

00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,416

all savage and junk!

273

00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,833
Get me outta this snowball!

275
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,958
Okay, okay, hold your horses!
Sit still for a second.

276
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,166
Ah, thanks. I owe ya.

277
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,125
Wait. This is
totally my chance, huh?

278
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,166
Why not chop
him up right here?!

279
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,625
Yup. Still stuck.

280
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,500
Lemme guess. Your master
ordered you to kill me?

281
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,166
You Angeloids are all the
same. Some dude in the sky

282
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,708
tells you, "Do this,
do that..." and you obey.

283
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,625
Huh?!

284
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,833
Nothing personal
though, right?

285
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,041
I mean, you're
just following orders.

286
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,041
Lame.

287
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,666
Shut up! You don't know me!

288
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,250
Following orders
is what we do!

289
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,458
Carrying out our masters'
demands is the whole reason

290
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,208
us Angeloids exist! So there!

291
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,208
Stop it! Stop looking up at
me like you feel sorry for me!

292
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,125
Just shut up and die!

293
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,666
Astraea. What are you doing?

294
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,708
Hey, Ikaros! What's up?!

295
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,041
Wow. Long time, no see, huh?!

296
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,375
What are you talking about?

297
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,708
You were there
in our tag-team match.

298
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,791
How'd she know it was me?!

299
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,083
You look well.

300
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,666
Thanks, you, too! Hey,
have you been working out?

301
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,666
Astraea...

302
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,791
I don't care whose
orders you're following.

303
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,000
If anything happens to
Master, anything at all,

304
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,125
you will answer to me.

305
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,083
Oh-jeez-oh-jeez-
oh-jeez-oh-jeez!

306
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,000
If I piss off Ikaros, she'll
blast me to smithereens!

307
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,083
I... gotta do that thing!

308
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,208
Isn't this just perfect?

309
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,541
Why don't you come sit closer?

310
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,916
No way.

311
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,958
Guess again! The winning
team gets to do whatever

312
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,416
they want to the losing team.

313
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,375
Mikako...

314
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,166
Yes, Sugata?

315
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,083
You're wearing... a swimsuit
or something, aren't you?

316
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,250
Of course not.
Where's the fun in that?

317
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,875
If you want nosebleeds,
chase after Tomoki.

318
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,458
Oh, loosen up.
I'm just playing.

319
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,791
One question. I'm curious
why you insisted I be

320
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,708
the one to dig for
the hot spring earlier.

321
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,125
As long as I've known you,
any time you dig a hole,

322
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,750
you seem to find gold.

323
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,458
Yeah, like when I struck
gold. I was a bit short on

324
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,583
walking-around money that day.

325
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,666
Don't forget,
you've struck oil, too.

326
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,625
The government was
getting mouthy with my dad

327
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,333
over fuel reserves. I had
to take 'em down a peg.

328
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,750
See what I mean? For you,
digging a hot spring...

329
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,291
is child's play.

330
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,083
Speaking of child's play.
Remember how we used to

331
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,375
build forts and
tree houses all the time?

332
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,125
Those were the days, huh?

333
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,541
It's late. Are you thinking
of heading home soon?

334
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,708
Why bother asking?
You know what the answer is.

335
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,875
I have... no home
to head back to.

336
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,791
You poor dear...

337
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,208
Oh... caught something.

338
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,833
So cold... so cold...
and hungry, too!

339
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,458
What are you doing out here?

340
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,500
You're... not mad, are ya?

341
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,750
Until you kill Tomoki, you can't
return to the Synapse, can you?

342
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,541
Hey! Who spilled the beans?!

343
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,166
Because you're an Angeloid.
Your orders are absolute.

344
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,291
Failure is not an option.
They'll kill you for it.

345
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,833
You can fly, but you're
stuck down here with us.

346
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,791
I feel sorry for you.

347
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,166
Nothing personal though, right?

348
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,416
I mean, you're
just following orders.

349
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,875
Screw you.

350
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,000
Stupid human.

351
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,791
Here.

352
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,875
Nothing else on
the menu, I'm afraid.

353
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,875
What? That's for me? Yay!

354
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,416
Be well, my lovely daughters.

355
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,833
Next time... "The Brother
Who Came From Heaven"
