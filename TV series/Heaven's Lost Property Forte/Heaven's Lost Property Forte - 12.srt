1
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,166
So what do you
plan on doing with her?

2
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,458
I'll return her to
her previous form.

3
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,333
And I'll monitor her treatment.
It's the best way to

4
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,125
keep him from finding
her. It should be fine.

5
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,458
And by him... you
mean Chaos's master?

6
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,166
That's correct.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,166
He got Ikaros and Nymph, too.
This guy's made the two of them

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,208
suffer so much, I'm
curious who he is. I mean...

9
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,291
Who he is doesn't matter.

10
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,750
Tomoki...

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,750
Just make sure that she's happy.
That's all I came here to say.

12
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,708
It's the best any of
us could hope for her.

13
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:09,708
Wait...

14
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,250
I want to thank you...
for truly loving my daughters.

15
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,708
It means more than
you could ever know.

16
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,125
Memory data recovery
one hundred percent complete.

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,791
Reactor function
normalization complete.

18
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,750
Auto-repair protocol
terminating, now.

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,041
Whew! Wake up, Alpha.
You're back to normal.

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,541
Did everything you
did make her better?

21
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,458
Duh, of course. Now that my
wings are back, I've recovered

22
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,291
my information processing
abilities. So this was no sweat.

23
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,250
That's so awesome. Then can you
do something about these next?!

24
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,625
You powered these babies up
all crazy-super-charged earlier!

25
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,708
It was the coolest ever!
Do it again, please! Can you?

26
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,875
Sorry, but I can't.

27
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,750
Huh? Why not?

28
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,583
Just... do it yourself.

29
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,500
You still have a lot of room
to grow. Put forth the effort,

30
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,458
and you might find you're
able to do it without my help.

31
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,208
Effort, huh?

32
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,208
Yeah, I'll put forth effort!

33
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,875
Hey, Ikaros, you're up.

34
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,666
Wait, are you
sure you should be?

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,916
Yes... I feel fine. I promise.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,958
And your memory's
back now, right?

37
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,375
He proposed?

38
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,666
Yeah, it's this thing the humans
do on TV a lot where they

39
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,208
promise they're
gonna be together forever.

40
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,708
We'll be together forever. Just
back off before you kill me!

41
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,208
Yeah, so... you
do remember everything?

42
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,208
Yes, I... remember.

43
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,250
That's great.

44
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,291
Well that's a
load off our minds.

45
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:36,458
I remember. I remember
Master proposing to me.

46
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,208
Good morning. Our
top story today is...

47
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,833
Hey, Ikaros, what's...

48
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,041
Morning, Tomoki.

49
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,833
What the crap?! Why the Hell
are you two here this morning?!

50
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:53,791
Lighten up.

51
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,875
When are we ever
not here, dummy?

52
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,916
Okay, whatever.
Ikaros, breakfast, please.

53
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,333
Whose house is
this anyway?! Jeez!

54
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,916
I gave Ikaros a pretty stern
talking-to about not doing

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,041
anything funny in the bathroom
again. So I should be able to

56
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,916
take my time in here
and not have anyone bug me.

57
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,458
Nothing beats peace
and quiet, that's for sure.

58
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,250
Sorry. Occupado.

59
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,791
Master, I apologize, but I...
well, it's about your proposal.

60
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,333
Take a hike!
And fix that door!

61
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,541
You don't even know
basic bathroom manners?!

62
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,833
How little common
freakin' sense do you have?!

63
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,916
I said I was sorry, Master.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,291
First thing you do
at a bathroom is knock!

65
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,666
I knock?

66
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,375
That's right, genius!
You hit the door like this!

67
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,625
Oh yeah. And don't
forget to flush. Got it?

68
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,500
Yes, Master.

69
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,583
All right. Now that
we're clear on that

70
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,625
I'm gonna need you
to do me a little favor.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,875
Sure has been a while.
Okay. Let's do it.

72
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,583
Of course, Master.

73
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,041
Conversion process
will commence momentarily.

74
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,541
It's Sorami's own
Cinderella. Tomoko!

75
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,791
Hello! Whatcha think? Huh?

76
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,125
Today's the last
swim class of the year!

77
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,125
And I'm gonna
rock their world by

78
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,500
turning into their pool water!

79
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,166
They're real obscure,
you haven't heard of 'em.

80
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
So you're gonna be
swimming with us today, Prez?

81
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,958
That's right. They
combined our classes today.

82
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't know how to swim,
but with this heat...

83
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,625
even I wanna jump the
heck in and get all wet!

84
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,541
If you can't swim what
are you even doing here?

85
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,041
Here they come! Girls
in swimsuits! I'm gonna just

86
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,083
roll them all around in
my palms a little! He-he!

87
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,375
Nymph! Over here!
Wanna play some Marco Polo?

88
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,000
Water...

89
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,041
What's your deal, Sohara?

90
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,458
It... was like
something touched me.

91
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,208
Water...

92
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,583
Sensei! Is
something the matter?

93
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,916
Must be my imagination.

94
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,666
Water's the
freakin' best! Water!

95
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,875
Water is grabbing my boobs!

96
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,083
This is so gross!

97
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,541
Someone help!

98
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,833
The water! It's in the water!

99
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,250
It's the water. There's
something wrong with it!

100
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,000
Nymph!

101
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,041
Water!

102
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,791
Oh. Flat as a
wet ironing board.

103
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,750
This is definitely Tomoki!

104
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,958
Nymph, give me
a hand would ya?

105
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,958
Here it is.

106
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:05,916
What the--?!

107
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,125
W-W-Water!

108
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,666
That's what ya get,
Tomoki, you jerk.

109
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,250
Later, dummy!

110
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,791
You really don't think
we should leave it at that?

111
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,666
Personally... I believe a
much more severe punishment

112
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,041
should be enacted
this time around.

113
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,583
Whoo, I reek of chlorine. For
a second there, I really thought

114
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:34,500
I was going to get washed out to
sea. Oh well! Time to figure out

115
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,666
what I'm going to be turning
into for my next amazing trick.

116
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,583
Coulda sworn I
heard somethin' back here!

117
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,000
When I find him, I'm gonna
give him my special chop!

118
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,375
I'll take pictures!

119
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,875
Crap-sticks! They're after me!

120
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,958
Sensors say Tomoki's
still on school grounds.

121
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,416
Madame President!
The dragnet is in place!

122
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,666
Good, because the enemy is still
close. Go over the campus with

123
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,291
a fine-tooth comb
until you find something.

124
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,708
Anything?

125
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,125
No sign of him down this way.

126
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,625
Balls. I'm trapped.

127
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,958
What about back here?

128
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,416
Double-trapped!

129
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,375
I'll just duck
in here for now.

130
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,208
Is this it? That fabled place?
The place where young maidens

131
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,166
go to "freshen up?" It is!

132
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,291
The girls' bathroom!
This is totally not where I

133
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,625
planned to go, but who gives
a flip! Hell, Tomoko's a girl,

134
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,708
it makes perfect
sense to be in here.

135
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,708
Still, it's kinda weird
not seeing a single urinal.

136
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,500
Whatever. I'm
here and I'm safe!

137
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,208
Time for calisthenics!

138
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,083
And now a deep inhale!

139
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,333
We need these
in the boys' room.

140
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,375
I've been holding it forever.

141
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,916
Girls!

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,250
That cockroach Tomoki must've
crawled back under his rock.

143
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,875
Didn't he get flushed
down the sewers or something?

144
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,000
We should be so lucky!

145
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,000
Are they about to?

146
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,833
This is it! Tomoko's climbing
another step towards adulthood!

147
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,625
So what do you wanna do now?

148
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,666
I couldn't do it. Call me
chicken, but some things should

149
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,500
just stay secret. Yeah.
Guess I'd rather hold fast to

150
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,250
the illusion that girls
have that sweet floral scent.

151
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,833
Not good.

152
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,250
That was too close.
Sohara and the others know

153
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,250
Tomoko's really me!
If they see me, I'm dead!

154
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,916
This is getting ridiculous.
Where could he have run off to?

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Too bad, huh? I was looking
forward to some violence.

156
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,416
Let's blow it off.
We should just

157
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
clean this
restroom and go home.

158
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,583
Good idea.

159
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,791
Wait a second. Someone's in
the stall over there. Excuse me.

160
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,916
We're about to clean the
restrooms. You mind hurrying up?

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,166
Why?! Why is this
happening?! No, wait.

162
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,916
Calm down, Tomoki. Ikaros
is out there with them, too.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,958
Which means I can do this!

164
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,708
Is that...?

165
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,125
Morse code?

166
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,958
G-e-t S-o-h-a-r-a o-u-t
o-f t-h-e b-a-t-h-r-o-o-m...

167
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,083
Get Sohara... out of
the bathroom... right now.

168
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,958
Why-are-you-in-ter-

169
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,500
Why are you...
in-ter... preting.

170
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,916
That's Morse Code.

171
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,416
Yeah, so. Just between us
girls... you don't suppose...

172
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,458
Tomoki's behind that
door coppin' a big squat on

173
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,916
one of our cans? Huh?

174
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,958
That's nuts. Not
even Tomo would be...

175
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,041
Tomo, is that you?

176
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:35,625
Meow... meow...

177
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,750
It's him!

178
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,791
Incidentally, in my pocket
here, I just happen to have a

179
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,041
saw that will cut through any
lock you might come across.

180
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,250
Thank you very much.

181
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,083
Crap! This bites! I gotta
vamoose! And fast! But how?

182
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,000
They're blocking
the only way out! Yes!

183
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,375
Last chance. Over the top!

184
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,458
Oh, yes. I also strung
barbed wire across the

185
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:01,541
top and electrified it. It's
kinda like a toilet prison.

186
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,333
You're as prepared as Alpha.

187
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,916
Out of options. I'll
have to make a mad dash

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,833
for the door! Oh god!

189
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,583
And I told my boys
to shoot the Hell out of

190
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,208
anyone running toward
that exit who isn't us.

191
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,750
But way more merciless.

192
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,750
End of the road! No way out!
Trapped in a world gone wrong!

193
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,208
If I don't get outta here,
I'm a dead man! Or chick!

194
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,583
But how? How do I escape
when every path is blocked?!

195
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,000
Tomo...

196
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,708
Grandpa?

197
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,625
But I don't want
you to go away, Grandpa!

198
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,541
That'll totally suck!

199
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,416
Sorry, kid. But I'm
going to have to get out of

200
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,666
the country for a while.
Maybe a long while.

201
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,291
But why?

202
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,916
Your grandma.
She found out about my

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,666
philanderin' ways again.

204
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,125
I can fix that.
I did it before, 'member?!

205
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,583
It's all good.

206
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:02,000
For any good woman,
it's water under the bridge.

207
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,208
For any good woman,
it's water under the bridge?

208
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,625
That's right.

209
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,500
Your grandma's
a good woman, boy!

210
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,083
In time, it's all
water under the bridge!

211
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:24,916
Think, Tomo.
What are you, right now?

212
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,416
That's it.
There's my way out!

213
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,125
For any good woman,
it's water under the bridge.

214
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,958
That's right! Because right
now, I am a very fine woman!

215
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,125
Only question is, Grandpa,
can I make it under the bridge?

216
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,875
Yes, you can, you sexy bitch.

217
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,208
No time like the
present. Here goes!

218
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,291
We got 'im!

219
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:08,250
Um, Sohara. What
the Hell are you doing?

220
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,666
Lesson Four...
Sewage water treatment.

221
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,458
One: Sewage water is recovered
from each house's yard

222
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,125
by a special truck.

223
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,333
This is a long and stinky
process that pays very poorly.

224
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,458
Two: It is carried to a
treatment plant for processing.

225
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,916
Three: The dirty water
passes through dis-in-fe--

226
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,750
machines, until it is finally
made into clean water again.

227
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,541
It's at this point that it
is discharged back out to sea

228
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,333
where the process
starts all over again.

229
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,875
And class... dismissed!

230
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,250
Another pain in
the ass day for Tomoki.

231
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,458
Master, I still need to
talk to you about something.

232
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,375
C'mon, Ikaros! I just told you
this morning about the bathroom!

233
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,500
Knock it off!

234
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,208
Oh, right. First, you knock.

235
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,625
Whoa. She really is learning,
isn't she? If I teach her these

236
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:15,000
things, one at a time, she'll
actually pick 'em up. Cool.

237
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,875
Knock means...
to hit. No problem.

238
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,750
Also, don't forget to flush.

239
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,000
Master?

240
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,500
Ikaros, hey!

241
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,458
Have you seen Master anywhere?

242
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:46,458
Oh, dear. He hasn't
gone missing again, has he?

243
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,958
I have something
to discuss with him.

244
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,375
Which is?

245
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,625
Well... it's... his proposal.

246
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,500
Okay, Ikaros... why
don't you take a minute.

247
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,041
I want you to
start at the beginning

248
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,375
and tell me
exactly what happened.

249
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,083
I've been getting
flushed out to sea

250
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,458
a whole lot lately, haven't I?

251
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,250
Oh, good.
Don't wanna be late.

252
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,833
What the Hell?

253
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,625
Ikaros!

254
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,791
Will the groom
please step forward?

255
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you vow to love and
honor each other, in sickness

256
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,125
and in health... for as long
as you both shall live...

257
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,916
so help you
God in Heaven above?

258
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,083
I do.

259
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,416
Ikaros...

260
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,875
Okay. Time to seal
your vow with a kiss.

261
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,791
Whoa! Back up a sec!
What's going on here?!

262
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,208
It's a wedding, silly.

263
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,791
I got that. But why?!

264
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,291
Well, see, Ikaros told us you
proposed to her. So go ahead.

265
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,000
Make her an honest woman.

266
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,166
Look, I don't know how
this all got outta hand,

267
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,208
but it's clearly
a misunderstanding.

268
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,125
Seriously, I don't ever
remember proposing to you!

269
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,583
That's too bad,
because I thought this

270
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,375
such an opportunity.
It seemed the perfect time

271
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,000
to bring into the
light everything that's

272
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,958
been hiding in the shadows.

273
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,458
Well? Which one you
gonna choose, Tomoki?

274
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,541
Of course... you could always
stay with Door Number One

275
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,583
and marry Ikaros,
here. But sorry.

276
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,375
This chick is
already spoken for!

277
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,458
You're what?

278
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,291
Tomoki?

279
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,791
What the Hell is this?

280
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,625
When do we get cake? They
promised there would be cake!

281
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,416
So sad, nowhere to run.
This is too much fun.

282
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,666
Master, you're
not hurt, are you?

283
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,833
I'm fine.

284
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,666
Look! Over there!

285
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,375
Chaos?

286
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,458
Hi there, mister!

287
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,250
Yet another fine mess
falls right in my lap.

288
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,875
I just want my
peace and quiet back!

289
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,791
So I wonder who
Tomo woulda chosen...

290
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,416
if we didn't get interrupted.

291
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,833
I know Tomoki's
happiness comes first, but...

292
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,250
I still think it'd be nice if

293
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,791
things stayed like
this a while longer.

294
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,458
Yeah, with all of us
enjoying our time together.

295
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,875
Together.

296
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,791
Why is freakin'
everyone in my house?!

297
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,166
What? It's our happy ending!

298
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,583
It's like we're
one big family.

299
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,000
I had some free time,
so I thought I'd stop by.

300
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,083
See how Chaos is doing.

301
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,583
So what do you think?

302
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,958
I have to say, the food's good.
Thank you so much, Ikaros.

303
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,750
She doesn't appear
to be hostile at all.

304
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,375
What do you say you become
her master, too, Tomoki?

305
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,208
Jeez, why me, huh?!

306
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,708
One more won't make
any difference to you.

307
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,833
Anyway... you're going to
be Nymph and Astraea's master.

308
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,083
Isn't that the case?

309
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:54,416
Oh, yeah. I guess so, huh? But
don't go getting the wrong idea.

310
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,125
Just because I'm your
master, it doesn't mean

311
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,041
I'm going to
fall in love with you.

312
