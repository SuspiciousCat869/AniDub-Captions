1
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,916
Tomoki, wake up!

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:43,083
Run away! Go as fast as
you can! She's coming for you!

3
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,333
Wait a sec. She who?

4
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,375
Of course. You don't
know who I'm talking about.

5
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,291
I mean... Chaos.

6
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,666
Who's that?

7
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,708
What should we
play next... Mister?

8
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,125
That dream again.

9
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,375
'Bout time you woke up.

10
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,541
How come?

11
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,583
It's raining like crazy. We're
so gonna be late for school.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,458
I wonder if
we'll get a typhoon.

13
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,583
Who cares, how's Ikaros doing?

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,458
Your reactor is
definitely out of whack.

15
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,458
I'll run a diagnostic, okay?

16
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,666
How're you holding up, Ikaros?

17
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,791
I'll stay home
with Alpha today.

18
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,083
Somebody should
really keep an eye on her.

19
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,833
Get some rest, okay?

20
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,625
Uh... all right.

21
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,833
Fevers suck.
Take it nice and easy.

22
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,583
Well, be good.

23
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,000
Later, guys.

24
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,208
Who was that... boy?

25
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,875
Huh? Oh, man! Good one.

26
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,166
You really had me
going there for a secon--

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,625
We're getting torrential rain,
but only in very specific areas.

28
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,583
It gets weirder.
The typhoon itself

29
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,833
seems to be reversing course.

30
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,625
This is, technically
speaking, impossible.

31
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,750
It's now heading due
south... straight for--

32
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,375
Straight for Sorami. For us.

33
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,291
That's just... creepy.

34
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,958
Huh? It reminds me
of that funky-ass dream.

35
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,166
What dream?

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,291
With the angel chick.
She wanted me to run

37
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,000
before something bad got here.

38
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,958
Bad, eh? Like what?

39
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,625
I dunno, she
called it... Chaos?

40
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
The storm's moving inland.

41
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,333
We really need to check
this out. It'd be a lot more

42
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,583
helpful if the
Angeloids were around.

43
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,041
What's Astraea,
then? Chopped liver?

44
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,791
Astraea?!

45
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
Out you go.
That's a good girl.

46
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,458
Aw... Bye, fridge!

47
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,041
Dude, the weather's ass.
I'm staying in here,

48
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,833
where it's nice and dry.

49
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,583
I think that's
probably a good idea.

50
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,291
If Chaos truly is on her
way here, we shouldn't assume

51
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,750
her target is Ikaros.
It might just be Tomoki.

52
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,583
Tomo... Don't ya
think it's kinda weird?

53
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,375
Not having Ikaros and
Nymph in class with us?

54
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,125
I know, I'm as worried
about Ikaros as you are.

55
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,041
Jackpot!

56
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,000
Dripping wet!

57
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,708
Man, this sucks!

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,041
Totally soaked, to the bone!

59
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,958
How come our shirts
have to be white?

60
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,583
Ah, what are we gonna do?!
You can see right through 'em!

61
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,791
Dude, this weather rules!

62
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,750
No Angeloids today
and wet schoolgirls?

63
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,000
What did I do
to get so lucky?

64
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,708
Tomoki, you pervert!

65
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,541
I don't get what's happening.
Your auto-repair program

66
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,000
kicked in by itself,
and it seems to be

67
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,291
erasing your
memories of Tomoki.

68
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,458
Who?

69
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,958
Well... they haven't
all been erased yet.

70
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,666
But, there isn't
any way to cancel the

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,166
auto-repair protocol.
If I still had wings...

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,500
it'd be a piece of cake.

73
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,750
Without 'em, I don't have
that kind of power anymore.

74
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,125
Anyway, your circuits
are all funky right now.

75
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,041
You're staying in
bed today and that's that.

76
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,500
Merging both satellite feeds.
You can see that we're sitting

77
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,541
very much in the
heart of the storm.

78
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,500
Astraea, dear. Status report?

79
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,333
All clear! And it's windy!

80
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,208
This is... from
when we went to the zoo.

81
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,916
And this... is from
the summer festival.

82
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
And this...

83
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:15,708
This is... This... is my
master... Tomoki Sakurai.

84
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:24,833
He's... My master... I
don't... want to... lose him.

85
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:32,666
The times he got mad.
The times he was kind.

86
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,333
I don't wanna
forget any of it!

87
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,791
It's been a while.

88
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,583
You! But... you're dead!

89
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm back... and
I'm bigger than before.

90
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,250
There, in the darkest
depths of the ocean,

91
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,250
I learned so much about
love! So very, very much!

92
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,875
Chaos, stop it.

93
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:02,291
Now I'll teach you three about
love! Here's your first lesson!

94
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,083
Astraea!

95
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,458
How did Chaos
survive the ocean?!

96
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,333
Run away!

97
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,166
Go tell Ikaros
to get over here!

98
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,916
I'll keep her
busy as long as I can!

99
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah? Gotcha. On my way.

100
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,375
What? Say again?
I missed that last part.

101
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,916
What about the "Dive Game?"

102
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:50,000
Listen! Tomoki! Dive into
your dream! Locate Daedalus!

103
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,375
Huh?

104
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,708
Tell her that Chaos has
evolved! She'll understand!

105
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,000
Evolved?

106
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,041
We'll need your help
to save the Angeloids!

107
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,875
Hurry, there's not
a moment to waste!

108
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,208
I'll do what I can!

109
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,500
Found it.

110
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,166
Wait... Does Sugata want
you to jump into a dream?

111
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,958
I didn't quite get
all the sciency stuff,

112
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,250
but it sounds like the
dookie's hitting the fan.

113
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,791
Here, Sohara. Sugata
wants to talk to you.

114
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,583
Hello? Yeah, no problem.
I've typed a whole bunch of

115
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,500
numbers as student
council treasurer.

116
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,458
Sounds like it's
right up my alley.

117
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,083
Think that did the trick?

118
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,541
Well... gotta go.

119
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,416
This is...

120
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,666
Are you... Daedalus?

121
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,916
Oh, thank goodness!

122
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,125
Yeah! Love hurts, doesn't it!

123
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,958
Delta!

124
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,333
Nymph, no!

125
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,916
Chaos!

126
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,750
Time for a little snack...

127
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,791
It's gonna be hungry work,

128
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,208
teaching you all
about love, Nymph.

129
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,083
Please, come in.

130
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,875
What is this place?

131
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,291
Nymph and Astraea!

132
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,708
I know there are many things
you'd like to ask me, Tomoki,

133
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,583
but right now...
you have to trust me.

134
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,291
That's Chaos. A
second-generation Angeloid.

135
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,333
The poor thing's creator
has twisted her psyche.

136
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
You have to stop her.
You're the only one who

137
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,291
stands the slightest
chance. If not...

138
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,625
I am so friggin' fed
up with all this fighting.

139
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,375
I'm sick of the drama.

140
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,291
Forgive me... Tomoki.

141
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,333
Not for myself! This
sucks for them the most!

142
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,916
They enjoy peace and
quiet as much as anyone!

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,625
Wearing pretty clothes,
pigging out on snacks,

144
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,333
laughing with friends!

145
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,125
That's what they
deserve. Not this!

146
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,791
You're right.

147
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,125
Give me that!

148
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,208
No, Alpha! No way! You
can't fight. You're too weak!

149
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,291
No... I'm all right.

150
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,875
Listen! If you get hurt
any worse, those memories

151
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,666
are gone forever! All of them!

152
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,041
Are we playing tag?

153
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,125
Almost time.

154
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,083
Right!

155
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,916
I asked Daddy to evacuate all
the locals to someplace safe.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,125
Good.

157
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,750
And Sugata...
How's Ikaros holding up?

158
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,375
Is she still all feverish?

159
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,750
Fighting Chaos before, Ikaros
sacrificed the Hephaestus to

160
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:15,250
send them both to the bottom of
the ocean. She barely survived.

161
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,125
Chaos is undoubtedly
stronger now. But by how much?!

162
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,500
Nymph, when she attacks
you, analyze the pattern.

163
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,541
Right!

164
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,041
I will use my
Artemis missiles to

165
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,833
blast all of her
wing-blades off.

166
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,000
And then you swoop
in. We get one shot.

167
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,125
Lock on to Chaos and hit her
as hard as you can, Astraea.

168
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,000
Got it!

169
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,916
Alpha. Keep your distance.

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,958
If she gets her hands
on you, you're done for.

171
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,541
Look out!

172
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,375
Sensei, no!
Are you all right?!

173
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,416
I'll make you a deal.
If we survive this,

174
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,250
we'll play poker...
whenever you want.

175
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,458
Deal!

176
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,666
Pattern of attack...
identified! Sending!

177
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,291
Transfer of attack
data, complete.

178
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,375
Artemis armed. Engage!

179
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,291
My turn!

180
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,125
Gotcha!

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,291
Got you!

182
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,416
Dammit!

183
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:42,333
Such pathetic rejects.
Killed by a newer toy.

184
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,166
My fallen angels
meet a fitting end.

185
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,333
I bring love.
Do you accept it?

186
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,625
Let them go, Chaos. Now!

187
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:07,250
Just hang on. Here I come.
I'll... save you both.

188
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,333
Alpha! Stop! You're too
weak to go Uranus Queen Mode!

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,250
Are you trying
to kill yourself?!

190
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,083
No, don't! That's my job!

191
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,958
Ikaros!

192
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,375
No more playtime?
Your human master's love has

193
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,250
made you weak, just like him.

194
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,250
"Love..."

195
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,708
I may not know what
that is... No. I do know.

196
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:46,416
Even if I lose all my memories,
and forget my master forever...

197
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,166
I will fight, until
there's nothing left of me!

198
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,250
To defend Master's life,
and his happiness!

199
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,833
It's so dark at the bottom of
the ocean. There was no one to

200
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,666
play with me. It was lonely.

201
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,083
I was a good girl. I taught
the fishies all about love.

202
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,125
I loved the fishies!
Lots and lots!

203
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,708
I loved them to
pieces! And now, Ikaros...

204
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,666
I'm gonna show
you the same love!

205
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,250
So long, Ikaros.

206
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,083
Stop it!

207
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,708
Don't die, Ikaros!
That's an order, dammit!

208
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,125
You have to obey
your master, right?!

209
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,208
Hey, Nymph! Astraea!
Same for you!

210
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,916
I'll become your master,
if that's what it takes!

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,333
I'll boss you
around all damn day!

212
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,375
Tomoki...

213
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,208
Because... I don't
wanna lose any of you.

214
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,541
I admit... sometimes...
you drive me effin' crazy.

215
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,625
But every day is
a brand new adventure.

216
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,250
Every day... is awesome.

217
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,833
So don't even think
about dying, any of you!

218
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,125
Yes... Master.

219
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,375
If you're doing this...
just because I got caught...

220
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,541
I am warning you,
I will so kick your ass!

221
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,291
You better mean it, okay?!

222
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,750
You said "ass." Nice one.

223
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,541
Shut up! My love...
is better than his!

224
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,125
You're too late.

225
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,083
What?

226
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,208
My master gave me an order!

227
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:35,708
Oh... I'm getting weak. You're
hacking my system, aren't you.

228
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,125
Go, Nymph.

229
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,791
Her wings grew back?

230
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,583
But how?! This is incredible!

231
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,458
They're beautiful!

232
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,375
Please be safe, everybody.

233
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,583
And I was so
close to killing you.

234
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,916
You may think being here with
a kind master made us weak.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,916
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,916
His kindness is our strength.

237
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:08,291
And now, Chaos... you are going
to witness it... firsthand!

238
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,541
Why are you all lying to me?!
Ikaros, you only sent me down

239
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,166
to the bottom of the ocean
because you love me, right?!

240
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,750
'Cause love is pain.
And there was so much of it,

241
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:39,041
down there in the darkness. I
was so lonely. I was terrified.

242
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,250
But now, I've returned so
I can love you all right back!

243
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,583
I'm gonna love you
until there's nothing left!

244
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,750
Nymph! Do you read me?!

245
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,541
Loud and clear!

246
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,625
Chaos's post-evolution
attack strength is unknown.

247
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,208
The three of you will have
to orchestrate a group attack

248
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,875
in order to take her out.

249
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,541
What do you have in mind?

250
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,916
Turn up your hacking field
as high as it will go, and do a

251
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
one-time rewrite of Ikaros and
Astraea's ability programming.

252
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,083
I'm uploading battle
tactics via your data stream.

253
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,875
'Kay! We'll give it our all.

254
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,500
Hacking field up!
Full power!

255
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,166
What?

256
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,291
Alpha!

257
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,833
Variable Wing Safety:
Release! Artemis: Full Fire!

258
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,833
That won't work twice!

259
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,000
Artemis missiles can track
their target pretty well.

260
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,833
That's why I hacked
into their homing code,

261
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,208
to make sure every one
of 'em landed a direct hit!

262
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,583
Your turn, Delta!

263
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,583
Right!

264
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,833
She can maybe beat
all of us one-on-one.

265
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,125
But together,
we're non-stoppable!

266
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,000
Die, you little...

267
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,458
Bedtime, Chaos!

268
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,541
Aegis: Engage!

269
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:45,166
That hurt. It hurts,
it hurts, it hurts.

270
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,041
Because... you all
love me so very much!

271
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,083
Please, hurt me some more!

272
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,375
This time, you're goin' down!

273
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,458
Oh thank you, Astraea!

274
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,416
Down, I say!

275
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,250
Thank you! I loved
hundreds of fish and birds to

276
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,833
get strong enough
to come back up here,

277
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,958
but 'til now there
was nobody to love me back.

278
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,916
Yes! 'Cause you're
gonna love me to death!

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,958
Love me to death! Love me
to death! Love me to death!

280
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,375
What are you waiting
for, huh? Somebody love me!

281
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,250
Love me until I'm just
a smear in this crater.

282
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,958
Love me to pieces!

283
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,500
It's okay now.

284
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,625
Mister?

285
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,083
Guess you've had
a pretty rough time, huh?

286
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,583
I really wish I had played
with you that day at the park.

287
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,541
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,916
What's happening?
My chest hurts.

289
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,833
But it's different than
the other hurt. It's warm.

290
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:52,000
How come? What is
this feeling? It's so...

291
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,916
Thought I told
you to take it easy.

292
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,541
Still... You
rocked today. A lot.

293
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,958
Whoa... Ikaros!

294
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:09,291
Next time... "Forte Wings
Soaring for Tomorrow"
