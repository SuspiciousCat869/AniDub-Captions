1
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:36,250
What is love? You and Tomoki
Sakurai, you love each other,

2
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:41,625
don't you, Nymph?
Well, don't you? C'mon, tell!

3
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:48,125
Oh... Drat. You can't, because
he doesn't love you, does he?

4
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:56,208
Of... course! How could he love
a wingless nothing like you?

5
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,375
What a greedy little
Angeloid you are, Nymph.

6
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,083
Tomoki is Ikaros's master.

7
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,500
You had better leave
my Tomoki alone, you tramp.

8
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,083
You know I've
always hated you, right?

9
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,875
No, you're wrong! They
wouldn't say that! Just shut up!

10
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,791
Shut up. Shut up!

11
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:21,250
High time we took
you to the junkyard.

12
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,083
You can't even fly.

13
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,791
You're such a waste.

14
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,208
No!

15
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,750
Damaged goods.

16
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,958
We're gonna sell you for scrap.

17
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,958
Such a waste!
Broken toy! Such a waste!

18
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,291
No!

19
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,333
Thanks for tagging along.
I know shopping's a drag.

20
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey, no sweat. I'll even let
you pick up the bill for lunch

21
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,166
to make it up to me.

22
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,916
Huh?!

23
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,875
So! What's on
the menu tonight?

24
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,791
Croquettes!

25
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,333
Yeah!

26
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,333
Oh, guess what! You're not gonna
believe this, but Ikaros can

27
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,416
go shopping all by
herself now! Crazy, huh!

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,250
I'm really proud of her!

29
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,916
Whoa. No kidding?

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,291
You remember when Astraea
first showed up here,

31
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,750
how she was always trying
her best to destroy you?

32
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,791
These days, you
guys are pretty tight.

33
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,416
Of course... the one
who's improved the most

34
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,375
has gotta be Nymph.

35
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,916
I mean, when she first showed
up, there was something kinda

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,833
scary about her,
wasn't there? And now...

37
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,166
She seems a lot...
I dunno... happier.

38
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,125
Whatever you've been
doing, keep it up.

39
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,875
Huh? What're ya talking
about? I haven't done crap.

40
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:05,833
But... you know... this peace
and quiet? I am diggin' it.

41
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,833
Ditto.

42
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,958
Sohara and... Master?

43
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,250
How is he here?

44
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,833
Damn it! Ow, let go!
You lying freak!

45
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,708
I'm so gonna kick your ass!

46
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,583
Do you hear me? You are dead!

47
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,750
You... piece of turd!

48
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,500
Shut your trap,
you broken-down toy!

49
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,625
Nooo!

50
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,458
What do we do?

51
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,791
They perfected a
second-generation Angeloid.

52
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,750
 "Second-generation" how?

53
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,333
That creature is
far more powerful

54
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,625
than the originals I created.

55
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,416
You invented Angeloids?!

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,791
But she... is in a
class totally unto herself.

57
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,666
Huh?

58
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,833
Hi, Ikaros! I was
hoping you'd show up.

59
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
I'm not broken! I'll kill you.

60
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,833
Tear you to shreds. Kill you!

61
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,916
Oh, Nymph.

62
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,833
You will pay. Variable
wing safety: disengage.

63
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,250
Enemy located: Target lock.

64
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,416
Artemis missile--

65
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,833
Master...

66
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,708
Damn it! Why can't she see
that she's being manipulated?!

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,833
You coward!

68
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:17,666
Ikaros. Blow Nymph to
pieces. That's an order.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,125
An... order?

70
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,291
Bye, Nymph.

71
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,833
No! Alpha!

72
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,333
Run away!

73
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,333
Hey, now. What's
the big idea, Ikaros?

74
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,750
Did you... just
disobey my command?

75
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,291
I am sorry to
disappoint you, Master.

76
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,500
But I am unable
to destroy Nymph.

77
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,333
What are you?

78
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,666
I am...

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,791
Your Angeloid, Master.
Type Alpha. Ikaros.

80
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,166
Now, please order
me as you will.

81
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,958
Well, for punishment...
you can destroy yourself.

82
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,166
Start with your right arm.

83
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,958
Master.

84
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,500
What the heck was that?
You think they're doing

85
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,791
construction
nearby or somethin'?

86
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,291
I gotta head out.
Thanks for the ramen, Sohara.

87
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,125
O... kay?

88
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,083
Gotta... help Alpha.
She needs me.

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,375
Gotta help.

90
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,916
Yeah, right. Why don't I
just fly right back there?

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,500
"Nymph, I really wanna become
your master," she says to me.

92
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,083
I so fell for it.

93
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,500
How'm I supposed to help
Alpha? I'm not even any good

94
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,333
in a fight. Just a wingless...

95
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,125
Piece of trash!

96
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,958
Why would anyone...
ever bother taking me in?!

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,416
Nymph, is that you?

98
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,583
Delta...

99
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,166
Whoa, what happened
to your face?!

100
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,541
Go help, Alpha! She's gonna
die if you don't! Please go!

101
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,583
What? Wh-What are
you talking about?!

102
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,875
She has to be
going through Hell!

103
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,875
And it's all because of me!

104
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:08,166
Fine! I'm going then! I have
no idea why, but whatever!

105
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,541
Hold it, Delta.

106
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,583
Kill the Beta for me.
That's an order.

107
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,125
Stupid girl. You thought
you had gotten away from me?

108
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,750
You'll remain my toy...
for as long as you live.

109
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,416
What's wrong,
good-for-nothing?

110
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,125
Have you forgotten
what comes next?

111
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,750
This is the
part where you beg,

112
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,875
"Oh please, Master.
Please don't scrap me!"

113
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,041
You have your orders, Delta.
Hop to it. Start by chopping off

114
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,958
her limbs. And after
that, rearrange her face.

115
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,125
I obey, Master!

116
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,416
I don't wanna do this, Nymph.
But Master gave me an order!

117
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,375
I have no choice!

118
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,791
Don't worry about it. It's
okay. Angeloids do what their

119
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,625
masters tell 'em.
Simple as that.

120
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:26,041
My living here has been like...
a dream. But I'm an Angeloid.

121
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,333
We're not even supposed
to... have dreams.

122
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,083
I'm sorry!

123
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,500
Don't you dare!

124
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,583
Tomoki...

125
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,291
Who says Angeloids
don't get to dream?

126
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,041
Who says an Angeloid can't
tell her master to go shove it?

127
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,791
Who cares about wings?
You're fine without 'em!

128
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,625
Enjoying candy apples,
or having a good cry, or...

129
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,666
thinking zoo animals are cute.

130
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,791
Nothing's wrong
with any of that.

131
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,541
Well... yeah, but...

132
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:09,541
You're great.
Just how you are.

133
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,750
I am? Really? Tomoki!

134
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,958
Thank you, Tomoki!

135
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,541
Astraea.

136
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,083
That day... at the snowball
fight. I asked if you were

137
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,333
gonna kill me because
you actually wanted to.

138
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,000
So make up your mind!
What is it that you wanna do?!

139
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,333
Delta!

140
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,375
U-Uh... Y-Yes... Master?

141
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,250
Deal with that insect later.
Chaos is still toying with

142
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:50,666
the Uranus Queen. Go. Slice
our dear Ikaros to ribbons.

143
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,666
Uh... I obey, Master.

144
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,541
I swear... I'm gonna come
back and kill you both!

145
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,416
Knew that blast
wasn't construction.

146
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,291
I got a bad feeling...
that won't be the last of 'em.

147
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,666
That jerk! What's
his deal, anyway?!

148
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,458
Make up your mind! What
is it that you wanna do?!

149
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,916
Ikaros and Nymph
don't give a crap about

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,041
the Synapse now 'cause of him!

151
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,666
How'd they fall for that
dumb bug?! Humans are trash!

152
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,375
All they're good for is
smashing and chopping up!

153
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,875
He's so dead! He's goin' down!

154
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,583
Oh, look.

155
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,583
Oh, balls! I'm starting
to like him, too!

156
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,208
Astraea likes someone?

157
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:02,000
Y-- I mean no! I mean yes,
but I don't "like him" like him!

158
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:06,916
Quit babbling, Delta! Destroy
the Uranus Queen, immediately!

159
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,333
You listen when I
am talking to you!

160
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,250
Make up your mind!

161
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,208
I am ordering you!

162
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,625
Shut up!

163
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:45,166
You broke your own chain,
Astraea. Naughty, naughy!

164
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,916
Hey... Can you tell me?
Is that what love is?!

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,833
I don't know what
love is! I'm stupid, okay?!

166
00:13:54,916 --> 00:14:00,000
But... just now...
I decided for myself!

167
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:13,916
What the?!

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,416
I don't know...

169
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,416
but I think it's
gonna get bloody.

170
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:23,333
So that's the second-generation?
Chaos, type Epsilon.

171
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,833
Can Astraea defeat
her in battle?

172
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,375
The Delta... is dumb.

173
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,125
Not the wording I
would have chosen, but--

174
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,625
I boosted her emotive
and combat abilities...

175
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,500
at the expense of
her computational skills.

176
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,333
True. I could have
found a way to give her

177
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,875
something more to
work with upstairs.

178
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,166
But I didn't... because it
wouldn't've made a difference.

179
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,625
Delta's wings are designed
for hyper-acceleration.

180
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,250
She's the fastest
Angeloid in existence.

181
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,166
That's not all. She's equipped
with the Aegis-L Shield.

182
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,125
Wow...

183
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,333
And the hyper-vibration
photon sword, Chrysaor.

184
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,958
My Delta wields the
greatest weapon and shield

185
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,125
of any Angeloid.
She's no tactician,

186
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,250
but in hand-to-hand
combat, she's unstoppable.

187
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,916
You caught me off-guard
for a sec! It's fine.

188
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,833
I'll kill you from far away!

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,791
I can't block
these much longer!

190
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,625
Delta isn't equipped with
any long-range weapons.

191
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,666
If Chaos keeps
that distance...

192
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,875
She's done for.

193
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:11,166
I can't let her win! I finally
made up my mind for myself!

194
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,666
I'm finally doing what I want!

195
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:21,083
This was fun. But it's
time to say "bye-bye."

196
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,416
Huh?

197
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,833
Sorry, playtime's
over... Chaos.

198
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,000
Ikaros, you're okay!

199
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:37,041
Aw, no fair. How'd you
get better so quick, Ikaros?

200
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,625
I know! You fixed yourself,
huh! And you did it in the

201
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,791
short time I've been playing
with Astraea? That's so neat!

202
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,791
Your toy is ginormous! But guess
what! Two can play at that game!

203
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,166
Whoa! No way!

204
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,083
Try grabbin' this!

205
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,791
Oh, no! That brat
just cut its arm right off!

206
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,708
I'm not done yet!

207
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,333
Ikaros, no!

208
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,250
You don't wanna play?
Then it's nap-time!

209
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,541
Go!

210
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:21,916
Increasing speed to Mach
Ten... 11... 12... 13... 14...

211
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
Why did you hit
me with your toy?

212
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:27,000
15... Mach 16... 17...

213
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:31,416
This is messed up, Ikaros.
Why're you doing this to me?

214
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,666
My master... swims very well.

215
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,250
What?

216
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:40,625
Angeloids sink like a stone. As
you're about to learn... Chaos!

217
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,291
Current depth.
Twenty-two hundred...

218
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,416
twenty-three hundred...
passing twenty-three fifty.

219
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,375
We're going down to the
bottom of the ocean, huh,

220
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,958
just you and me! I
hope you thought ahead!

221
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,833
I do not intend
to survive. But...

222
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,041
If my death will stop
you! I am ready to die!

223
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,541
Before we break,
tell me a bedtime story.

224
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,250
About what love is.

225
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:31,375
Yeah! I wanna know what love
is! Please tell me what it is!

226
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,541
Tell me! What is love?!

227
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,333
I do not know.

228
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,291
I can't tell you...
because I do not know myself.

229
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:48,791
But... whenever I think about
Master... my reactor hurts.

230
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,000
It aches. I can't
help it! But why?!

231
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,375
Why does the mere thought
of it make my reactor ache?!

232
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,833
Is... Is that what
love is? I don't know!

233
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,333
You're crying?

234
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,416
If I were to let you go now...

235
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,416
you'll definitely hurt my
master. The thought of harm

236
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,166
coming to him...
hurts worse than anything!

237
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,166
I die... to protect
my master! That I know!

238
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,708
Aw, Ikaros, no fair.

239
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,666
C'mon, c'mon,
where are you?!

240
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,291
Ikaros!

241
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,416
Astraea.

242
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,875
Huh?

243
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,791
Can you tell me?
Do you know what love is?

244
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,375
Huh?! Well you know
it's--! It's like um...

245
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,166
C'mon you know what it is!

246
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,625
I am sorry. But I don't.

247
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,833
I have never
known... what love is.

248
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,625
I'm just... I'm just like her.

249
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,375
Please. I want
to go see Master now.

250
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,666
'Kay, all done.

251
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,875
Thanks, Sohara.

252
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,750
♪Ouchie, ouchie... go away!♪

253
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,125
There you go,
Nymph, good as new.

254
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:11,291
I wish you could sing that and
magic me up a new pair of wings.

255
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,166
Nymph, listen. If
you're still bummed out--

256
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,958
In this household, we don't
come through the roof like...

257
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,000
Sugata! I'm glad you're okay!

258
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,000
What's all the
shouting about this time?

259
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,166
Tomoki's new skylight.

260
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,500
...looking for food.
Am I right? Am I right?

261
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:36,875
Come on! Can't you use the
front door like normal people?!

262
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,833
But, since you're back safe and
sound... I'm gonna let it slide.

263
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,166
Yes... Master.

264
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,375
Next time...
"Shoot-out! Fishing at the

265
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,041
Jumbo Carnival of Dreams"
