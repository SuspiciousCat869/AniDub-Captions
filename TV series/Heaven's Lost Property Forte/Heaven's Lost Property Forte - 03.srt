1
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,666
I see. Somehow Tomoki's
dream connected to

2
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,875
this "Synapse" place
you're talking about.

3
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,000
And when it did,
your people sensed danger

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,375
and made the decision
to kill Tomoki.

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,125
What do I do? It was an accident
but I gave away secret info

6
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,708
while I was restarting. Gotta
think of a brilliant plan!

7
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,583
Ooh!

8
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,166
That was weird, I was
totally talking in my sleep!

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,166
What did I say?

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,000
I thought
Angeloids didn't sleep.

11
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,250
Oh, poopie, you knew
that? Okay, gimme a sec.

12
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's see, I was just, um...

13
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,333
What you meant to say was that
the "New World" is hovering

14
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,083
in the sky above Sorami?

15
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,458
New World? What do you mean?

16
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,833
It's not a New World,
stupid, it's the Synap--

17
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,625
Does the "Rule" refer
to the chinquapin tree

18
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,291
that Tomoki saw in his dream?

19
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,500
Of course not! The Rule's
that big stone thing

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,333
with all the
writing on it. Duh!

21
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,375
Oh... Thanks for telling me.

22
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,958
Crap! He got even more secret
info out of me! That's it!

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,791
I have no choice!
I have to kill him now!

24
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,333
He dodged me!

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,750
Wait! What are you doing?!

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,458
That's interesting to hear.
That you've come to our world to

27
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:50,541
kill our good friend Tomoki. Are
you listening to me, Astraea?

28
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,125
Yes, please forgive me!

29
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,458
Pay careful attention to me now.

30
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,208
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,166
I've decided to help you out!

32
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,958
Mikako, you've got that look
on your face you get every time

33
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,000
you find yourself a new toy.

34
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,958
You should know, he can be
quite a formidable opponent.

35
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,041
I knew it! You have to
tell me his secret weakness!

36
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:22,958
Let's see... First things first.
You're going to need to learn

37
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,750
the ancient martial
arts of your new home.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,958
Wow! They've got
so many stands this year!

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,791
Give me a bite of
your cotton candy.

40
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,208
I wonder if Tomoki
remembers that time.

41
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,375
Where's Mikako?
I haven't seen her.

42
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,041
Supposedly she's been
out here all day setting up.

43
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,250
Something about an
event for this evening.

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,583
Really?

45
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,583
Wanna see?
It's right over there.

46
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,666
Oh, hell no. I remember
this d-bag from last year.

47
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,500
Almost got me killed. I got
a bad feeling about this.

48
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,500
Such a fun festival.

49
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,125
This makes two years in a row.

50
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,541
Let me go! You lunatic,
get your hands off me!

51
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,000
Unclench and relax,
Tomoki. It's not like

52
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,958
everybody's cleaning
their guns so we can have

53
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,625
a shootout in the
woods like last year.

54
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,916
In fact, I've done some
reflecting. Originally,

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,500
a festival was a holy gathering,
to showcase the glory of God.

56
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,666
This year I thought we'd be a
bit more dignified and hold...

57
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,625
our first sumo tournament.

58
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,666
Sumo... tournament?

59
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,666
Wra-ssa-lin'.

60
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,791
This is it. The legendary fall
tournament... begins right now!

61
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,625
In round one, we've
got the Madonna of the

62
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,958
shopping district. Daughter
of the stationery store owner!

63
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,875
And with the access she has to
colored pencils, she's sure to

64
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,541
turn the white ring red!
The Pencil Madonna, Makiko!

65
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,083
The grand prize is a
cool ten million yen!

66
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,291
Plus, a once in a
lifetime chance to

67
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,666
share a bath with the
Satsukitane family's geisha!

68
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,333
Guess they found a reason
for me to take this seriously.

69
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,083
And now, walking definition
of "genuine article!"

70
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,208
I will now show you a mask...

71
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,125
the likes of which
has never been seen!

72
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,916
Mask du Pants!

73
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,708
As official representative
of the Satsukitane family

74
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,125
I hereby declare the
first Satsukitane Cup

75
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,375
Fall Tournament
as open! Good luck!

76
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,458
I'm your play-by-play announcer,
gym coach Taizo Matsuyama!

77
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,583
Color commentary
by Eishiro Sugata...

78
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,583
and our special guest, Nymph.

79
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,125
What does sumo taste like?

80
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,791
Sumo is a sport
and this isn't it.

81
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,500
Nope! We're doing
this by American rules!

82
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,666
Right. And we're
bringing it live.

83
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,875
While heavily favored to win,
Sohara and her patented killer

84
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,750
chop will be stepping
in as this year's referee.

85
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,958
And we're sorry we won't
get to see her compete.

86
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,291
Well, this first round is going
to be one for the record books!

87
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,833
Sugata, what's your take?

88
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,208
The data I've accumulated
states that Makiko was in the

89
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,708
amateur wrestling club
during her high school days.

90
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,166
So is it salty or sweet?

91
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,041
It's Makiko with
the first strike.

92
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,916
Oh, and she lands an incredible
tackle, right into the ropes!

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,708
Oh, and she's up in the air
for a head-slam to the mat!

94
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,041
And just like that,
we have a pin!

95
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,500
Mask du Pants is
one pathetic wrestler!

96
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,666
One... two... thr--

97
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
What happened? She
stopped the three-count

98
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,958
right before she was done!

99
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,416
I honestly don't know.

100
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,541
Noooooooo!

101
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,416
He's groping her!
Oh, the humanity!

102
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Pants is groping Makiko!

103
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,541
I... I... I give up!

104
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,791
Makiko just
threw in the towel!

105
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,458
That's one way to grab a win.

106
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,750
Though he won the match,
the women of the audience are

107
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,500
booing Pants as
he leaves the ring.

108
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,291
Not making any
friends out there.

109
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,291
Gotta come up with something
real killer while I still can.

110
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,333
Nymph! Come here a sec!

111
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
Yeah, Tomoki, what's up?

112
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,208
Please, you gotta turn on
your Cool Guy Jamming for me!

113
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,666
If you do, I'll buy you anything
you want later. I swear! 'Kay?

114
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:49,083
Anything I want, huh?
Okay, I'll do it.

115
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,500
Ladies!

116
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,375
Holy crap, it's Mask du Pants!

117
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,833
So dreamy!

118
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,416
Kick ass. Now the chicks
won't be against me anymore.

119
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,416
I love you, Mask du Pants!

120
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,416
Thanks! And what
color are your panties?

121
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,375
Get bent, cockroach!

122
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,500
What the Hell just happened?

123
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,166
I turned it off.

124
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,666
I turned the
Cool Guy Jamming off!

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,000
Why did you do
something stupid like that?!

126
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,041
I hate it.

127
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,458
I hate it! I hate it!
I hate it! I just hate it!

128
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,625
Sheesh, what's up her butt?

129
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,916
Moving on to round two.
In the red corner,

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,208
the unsmiling beast, Ikaros!

131
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:47,250
And in the blue corner, that
guy from the takoyaki stand!

132
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,250
That ten million
yen is mine, baby!

133
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,541
Okay, Ikaros, you got him!

134
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,208
And the referee
halts the match!

135
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,625
I'd call this a very
decisive win for Ikaros!

136
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,208
In this round, Sugata steps in
the ring, who until a moment ago

137
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,041
was sitting comfortably in his
commentator's chair. No way!

138
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:21,375
He's already in a tight spot!
The man's face is being crushed!

139
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,666
This does not look good!

140
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,250
He's down! Mikako just
wasted Sugata and he was

141
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,541
the one favored
to win the round!

142
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,458
That's a gripping
power of 400 kilos.

143
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,250
Unbelievable, Nymph!
Once your face is caught

144
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,625
in something
like that, lights out!

145
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,916
I had a hunch it would be
like this. Prez sets up some

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,125
grandiose prize just to snatch
the whole thing for herself.

147
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,291
Well, I ain't
gonna let that happen!

148
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,166
Hope you're ready in there,
Astraea, because you're up next.

149
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,541
Are you sure about this outfit?

150
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,375
That is the proper costume
for age-old Japanese combat,

151
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,958
worn for generations.
Now, get out there

152
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,875
and jack up
Tomoki something fierce.

153
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,250
I want his face
to look like sausage!

154
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,083
Right!

155
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,750
I'm looking, and I don't
see too many matches left

156
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,000
on tonight's docket.
Sugata, any comments?

157
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,375
It seems Mikako is the
clear favorite at this point.

158
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,791
It would be a shock to
us all if she didn't win.

159
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,875
Seriously, what
does it taste like?

160
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,125
Ladies and gentlemen! It's
time to change things up a bit.

161
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,083
The next round will
be a tag-team match

162
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,458
with four combatants.

163
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,750
The rules are simple.
Whoever wins advances to

164
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,291
the final round
and battles for victory.

165
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:37,416
Good gravy, folks! We got
an elimination match! Sugata?

166
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,166
Sounds like it. We just
need to know who's competing?

167
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,166
What's this? Are we looking
at a shot of the changing room?

168
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,541
You're here to give these
people a good show, all right?

169
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,250
Go on, give it a shot.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,083
Mother of pearl! Are
you trying to kill him?!

171
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,416
I apologize.

172
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,500
If you have a weak stomach, this
is the time to exit the arena!

173
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,958
'Cause we just don't know
what these two will pull!

174
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:09,875
In the red corner,
Mask du Pants and Ikaros!

175
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,958
And now it's time we introduce
a mysterious new contender!

176
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,583
Hailing from Mongolia, raised
in a poor farming village,

177
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,791
this secret weapon has
entered the tournament to

178
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:32,083
support her family! Greetings
from the land of the loincloth!

179
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,750
In the blue corner, the
mysterious sumo wrestler...

180
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,666
Delta Yama!

181
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,125
What are you
doing up there, Delta?

182
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,583
Solly! I no speaky
you clazy ranguage.

183
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,583
The question that remains is who
will be Delta Yama's partner?

184
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,666
Having to stand ground against
those other two, I don't know.

185
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,125
Nymph, would you like
to enter the tournament?

186
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,250
Don't stare at me
like that, you dumb-bug!

187
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,791
This fruit isn't ripe yet!

188
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,500
Soap opera fanatic...
Sorami's idol... it's Nymph!

189
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,833
Time for you to
hop in the ring, Nymph.

190
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,625
I bet Tomoki will be more
than thrilled to fight you.

191
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,041
Maybe I will enter the fight.

192
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,166
And so, the tag-team match
of the century has begun!

193
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,083
At the top, it's Pants
toe-to-toe with Delta Yama!

194
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,958
Look at that! Yama unleashes
a weapon right out of the gate!

195
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,750
I wouldn't really
worry about that.

196
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,791
And she takes herself out!

197
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,000
Gropey, gropey,
gropey, gropey...

198
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,250
This is terrible!
Pants has slipped into the

199
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,833
same obscene
attack we saw before!

200
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,416
No more of that!

201
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Gropey, gropey, gropey...

202
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,208
The referee is
putting a stop to this!

203
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,625
Back off, Miss Ref. It's
not like I'm breaking any

204
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,833
tournament rules here, am I?

205
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,416
Your thoughts, Sugata?

206
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,250
Technically, the move is not
illegal, so not even the referee

207
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,500
can prevent him from performing
it. He's in the clear.

208
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,666
No.

209
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,708
Check out Pants
getting his grope on!

210
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,208
This man isn't letting
up his attack one bit!

211
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,333
His hands are
crawling all-- Whoa!

212
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,375
She's got a sword in the ring!

213
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,125
Master is in danger.

214
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,583
Ejection! Ejection!

215
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,666
Now we're down to
just two combatants.

216
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,625
Seems to be something
wrong with Pants...

217
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,708
I'm not really feeling
it. Not against those.

218
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,000
You jerk!

219
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,583
Whoa! Is that a Cobra Twist?

220
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,333
Actually it's an "abdominal
stretch," also known as

221
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,500
the "grapevine hold."

222
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,166
Well? You give up?

223
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,458
Not yet, baby!

224
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,083
Ha! I got you now!

225
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,875
Ladies and gents,
Nymph has fled the ring!

226
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,833
Which means Mask du Pants
is moving on to the final round!

227
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,125
Thank you very much!

228
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,333
Hey, how's it goin', Nymph?

229
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,583
Sorry about earlier.
It's all part of the show,

230
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,125
so no hard feelings, eh?

231
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:38,500
My reactor is acting funny
again. I'm an Angeloid,

232
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:45,000
and yet... I feel as if...
I've fallen... in love.

233
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,541
This is it! Who
will be victorious?

234
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,166
This'll be his last day
on Planet Freakin' Earth!

235
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,000
Take this loser to town, Prez!

236
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,041
Mask du Pants is
taking the whole thing!

237
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,250
M.D.P.! M.D.P.!

238
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,625
The final championship
bout... begins now!

239
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,750
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
you've all been waiting for!

240
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:10,625
Today's main event! And here
comes our first finalist...

241
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,416
In the blue corner, the Grinning
Gangstress, Mikako Satsukitane!

242
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:25,625
President! President!
President! President! President!

243
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,750
Mikako!

244
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,250
And, in the red corner...
The Undertaker of Underwear,

245
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,083
Mask du Pants!

246
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,541
Hooray. Hooray for you, Master.

247
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,375
You pervert!

248
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,208
Go nipples!

249
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,375
Illegal object!

250
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,958
You wanna check inside my pants,
feel free to stick your hand in.

251
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,208
I don't mind if we
break the rules a little.

252
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,875
And now here's a
little gift from me to you.

253
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,833
It's a chain-link
deathmatch, folks.

254
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,541
What should we be
looking for in this fight?

255
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,250
Basically, however Pants decides
to counter Mikako's Iron Claw

256
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,208
will be the determining
factor in this match.

257
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,458
We're now joined by
our guest, Ikaros, who has

258
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,333
completed her matches and
is now petting a watermelon.

259
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,583
Correct.

260
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,958
Whoa! Looks as if Pants
has already been seized!

261
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,166
Well, this is disappointing!

262
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,166
Now, Mikako's victory
is all but assured!

263
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:53,375
Sesame oil! M.D.P. has
drenched himself in sesame oil!

264
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,375
Huh. Not a bad tactic.

265
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,750
Thanks. Now prepare
for a whuppin'!

266
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,041
Pants launches into
a ferocious attack,

267
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,583
relentlessly grabbing
for Mikako's ample bosom!

268
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,708
But Mikako slips on some
of the spilled sesame oil!

269
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,166
You're mine now!

270
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,500
Tomoki, you have
crossed the line.

271
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,291
Pants is behaving
like a twisted savage!

272
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,958
And look at the ladies.
They're completely mortified.

273
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,125
Behind her is an
electrified chain-link fence!

274
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,916
No joke, Mikako's
really in a tight spot now!

275
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,833
Hold on...

276
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,208
Somewhere during the match,
the referee has disappeared.

277
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,416
Up there.

278
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,416
Everyone look to the sky!
A mysterious masked wrestler

279
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,666
has appeared from nowhere!

280
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,833
Heh! Long as this
chain-link fence is in place,

281
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,416
ain't nobody gonna
stick their no--

282
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,750
Boom! Through the
chain-link with her bare hands!

283
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,041
Flying body press!

284
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,416
Ooh! She's slaughtering
him with a double attack of

285
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,083
flying chops and electricity!

286
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,541
She's reaching, oh,
to catch him in mid-air, oh,

287
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,208
and performs an
Argentine Backbreaker!

288
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,166
I'm... not so sure that
Pants' spine is supposed to

289
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,083
bend that way. His people
might wanna call a doctor.

290
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,541
He won't be able to
stand up again after that.

291
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,750
What's this?

292
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,666
Unbelievable! After
taking a furious beating,

293
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,416
what is it driving this
young man to get back up?

294
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,250
I... wanna soap
you up... all over...

295
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,333
And the referee steps in
to lift the masked wrestler's

296
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,500
hand in the air! But why?

297
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,416
This makes no sense!
Pants is still on his feet!

298
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:27,000
That's true.
But he's already dead.

299
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,958
So, you alive again?

300
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,583
Who ends up walking
away the winner then?

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,375
If he died during the
match, it must be that

302
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,166
mysterious masked wrestler.

303
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,041
Which would be you, Sohara.

304
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,125
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

305
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,625
I was backed into a corner,
too. So why don't we just say

306
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,208
the winner was Tomoki?

307
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,833
Are you serious?!

308
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,333
As a heart attack.

309
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:06,041
Kick ass! Ten million in prize
money! And a bath with geishas!

310
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,583
If that's settled...

311
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,166
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting
the World Championship Final!

312
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,000
Wrestling is bullshit.

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,500
Come on! Let's you and
I play us a little game.

314
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:25,625
First... Tell me, when
people die, where do they go?

315
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,708
Please... Don't come back
next year. I really never wanna

316
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,666
see you again,
you crazy gun-nut!

317
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,958
Man, a lot
happened in one night,

318
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,041
but the festival
was fun, wasn't it?

319
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,208
Are you sure
that's all you wanted?

320
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,500
I said I'd get you anything.
And I do keep my promises.

321
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,541
'Cause the last time
you had a candy apple,

322
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,916
you said they
were gross tasting.

323
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,000
You remember that?

324
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,166
Course, you cried
over it like a baby.

325
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,208
But I do like them.

326
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,958
Candy apples.

327
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,125
I like them a lot!

328
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,208
Hey, Tomoki, aren't
you going to have one, too?

329
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,375
Nah, I already had a bunch of
takoyaki and other junk today.

330
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,125
You don't eat a
lot of sweets, do you?

331
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,291
Not really.

332
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,083
Next time... "Mortal Combat!

333
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,333
Hot Spring Snowball
Fight at 1.4° Below"
