1
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,541
It's definitely spring, huh?

2
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,708
Hey, Sugata! What's happeni--

3
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,458
Ah. Tomoki, ladies,
you're just in time.

4
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,958
For what? Wild
Nature Fight Club?

5
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,541
I was about to locate
food for my guest.

6
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,958
I may have waited
too long as it is.

7
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,416
I am so hungry.

8
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,875
Delta?!

9
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,000
She tried her hand at fishing,
and spent three days straight

10
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,708
tangled up in her own line.

11
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,041
Huh?!

12
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,750
You've had nothing to
eat for three whole days?!

13
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:16,375
As if. More like a whole
week! Suck it, haters!

14
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,708
I have somewhere I
need to be. Do me a favor.

15
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,833
Try and catch some
fish out of the creek.

16
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,541
No way, dude!
Fishing is bullshit!

17
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,500
You refuse, then?

18
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,208
Hell yes I do!

19
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,041
Ah... That's too bad.

20
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,666
Fishing, yay.

21
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,375
I always knew you
were a master baiter.

22
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,583
Hey, Nymph. A moment?

23
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,208
Yeah, what's up, Sugata?

24
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,333
I'm in need of your expertise.

25
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,958
Hold onto my watch for me.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,833
Okay?

27
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,041
Also...

28
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,708
Oh. Sure, I can do that.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,833
Sugata, what are you...?

30
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,291
Like I told you...
somewhere I need to be.

31
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,166
No way.

32
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,083
Onward.

33
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,291
Um...

34
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,416
I didn't notice that
you had tagged along.

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,791
Hey wait. I've seen
this place before.

36
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,166
We're inside Tomoki's
dream, right? But when we

37
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,000
dove in before, he kept
saying it wasn't his. Weird.

38
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,833
Sugata... why are we here?

39
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,833
To investigate a bit.

40
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,416
What are we going
to investigate.?

41
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,333
It's pretty empty up here.
Just that big stone thing...

42
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:47,458
a few trees... and blue sky,
as far as the eye can see.

43
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,250
Sohara. Look down.

44
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,083
There's nothing to be
afraid of. Just keep still.

45
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,500
'Kay.

46
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,875
Tell me, Sohara. Does the
name "Synapse" ring any bells?

47
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,291
"Synapse?"

48
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,666
They're the ones who built

49
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,875
Ikaros and the
others, aren't they?

50
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,083
That's right.

51
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,333
Way back when, Ikaros told Tomo
she was "made by the Synapse,"

52
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,833
or something like that.

53
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,125
Based on what I've
gathered from Astraea,

54
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,375
that magnetic disturbance
hanging over our town...

55
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,250
is actually
the Synapse itself.

56
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,750
Oh...

57
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,916
Also, while I daresay we
shouldn't tell him just yet.

58
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,958
Tomoki's dreams are somehow
connected to the Synapse.

59
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,541
Huh?!

60
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,708
I'm saying it's a real place,
and we're gliding over it now.

61
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,583
Wait. Sugata, what
are you talking about?!

62
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,291
How'd a place like this
get inside of his dream?!

63
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,041
No idea.

64
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,541
I can't find the "how" before
I've figured out the "what."

65
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,416
I hoped coming here
might give us some answers.

66
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,166
Careful what
you touch up here.

67
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,708
Sorry about that.

68
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,833
I think I can see my house!

69
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,666
Yeah. Let's go. I want
to look around a little more.

70
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,833
Right.

71
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,916
All I'm catching
out here is a cold.

72
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,166
Buck up, you big baby.

73
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,000
Man, I'd be a popsicle.

74
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:46,916
Huh?

75
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,875
What the eff am I holding?

76
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,416
But... How did...?

77
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:15,833
No clue what it does. Something
for the ladies, maybe?

78
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,083
It's pretty warm up here, huh?

79
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,458
It is.

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,208
I'm surprised. Who knew
the Synapse would be all...

81
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,083
woodsy and cute?
I mean, I was expecting it

82
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,375
to be more... you know...

83
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,083
Yes. You were expecting it to

84
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,208
look more "Death
Star" than "Endor."

85
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,333
Totally. 'Cause think about
it. This is where they make

86
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,666
the Angeloids and their
super-powered cards, isn't it?

87
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,708
Well, probably not
this particular street,

88
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:47,708
but I know what you mean.
The lack of people is curious.

89
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,875
No kidding. We haven't seen
anybody since we got here.

90
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,875
Hmm. Maybe we'll happen
upon a bunch of Angeloids.

91
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,666
And wouldn't that be
quite the experience.

92
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,666
Yea...

93
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,000
Sugata!

94
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,791
I'll fight her if I have to.

95
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:25,166
It looks like everyone here
is an Angeloid... doesn't it?

96
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,416
Indeed.

97
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,875
But... who could've
made them all?

98
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,375
Let's find out.

99
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,291
See, this is more like
what I was expecting.

100
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,708
Let's head inside.

101
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,500
What?! You're going in there?!

102
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,166
We're not going to figure out
anything just by staring at it.

103
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,208
Who... or what... awaits us?

104
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
They're oblivious to me...

105
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,958
Oh man. Please don't let the
boss be all up in my face again.

106
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,458
What the...?

107
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,291
No fair! I didn't
sign up for this!

108
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,833
Sugata ties me up and
then just freakin' leaves!

109
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,458
And Sohara and Prez
are off who-knows-where!

110
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,000
Master... I
brought you a snack.

111
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,958
Is it not good?

112
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
What, are you nuts?!
Get rid of that thing!

113
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,541
How about this?

114
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,166
It's gonna eat me!

115
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,916
Look over there. It's Tomoki,
that pervert from Class C.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,333
He's always getting
in some kind of trouble!

117
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,791
What a pain in the ass!

118
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,041
Oh. But... he seems
like such a fun guy.

119
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,166
Whenever I see him, I just
know it'll be a good day...

120
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,541
I guess... I, uh...
you know... I like him.

121
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,375
What is this?

122
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:39,708
This dome... is some sort
of nexus to all human reality.

123
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,250
What happened to me a
moment ago? Leaping from

124
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,875
place to place. Are they keeping
a constant watch over us all?

125
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,500
No! Of course! If...

126
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,625
If this theory I'm
currently forming...

127
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,625
turns out to be correct!

128
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:09,041
I guess I, uh...
you know... I like him.

129
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,875
It can't be!

130
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,875
So... whaddaya think they're all
doing in their capsules, bug?

131
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,041
They're dreaming, of course.

132
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,208
What's going on here?

133
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,250
You know, much as I'd just
love to tell you all about it,

134
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,791
I'm gonna kill
your friend here instead.

135
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,541
Time... to... say goodbye.

136
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,000
Funny you should say that.

137
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,208
What?! You're
playing the Dive Game?!

138
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,333
How is that even possible?!

139
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,458
Simple, Nymph has my
watch. I had set an alarm

140
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,250
to a certain time,
and told her to

141
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,458
pull me back out
when it went off.

142
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,500
I knew you'd catch me
eventually. I factored that

143
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:14,208
into my timeline.
Trust me, I've seen plenty.

144
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,708
Damn you!

145
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,208
I was rightfully wary,
not knowing quite what the

146
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,208
New Worlders were capable of.

147
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,583
Damn you! You're dead!

148
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,750
But it seems that,
biologically speaking...

149
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,041
Son of a...!

150
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,625
You're not a
far cry from humans.

151
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:33,208
And whoever's in charge here!
I know you're watching all this.

152
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,875
I shall return. This, I swear.

153
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,083
Insolent bug!

154
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,833
Fascinating.

155
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,583
Throwing down the
gauntlet now, are we?

156
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,958
Welcome home.

157
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,875
Wait. We're
back? Safe at last!

158
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, right on the dot.

159
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,416
Well, duh.

160
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,750
Aha! Sure, leave me out there
alone to get all the food...

161
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,083
while you're in here
doing whatever the crap!

162
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:15,958
Tomo...

163
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,833
Being lazy is my job, dammit!

164
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,083
I'm sorry. How 'bout
I give you a hand?

165
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,666
Huh? For real?

166
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,458
So, hey,
how'd the fishing go?

167
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,750
I didn't catch jack.

168
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,750
Hey, Nymph.

169
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,750
What's up?

170
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,291
Tell me the truth.

171
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,500
Do I really exist?

172
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:36,208
Ah... So, you saw
it then, huh? Yeah.

173
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,041
That's why there was
a block on Tomoki's dream.

174
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:47,625
For whatever it's worth...
yes. You are real.

175
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,875
You didn't catch
anything? That's scandalous.

176
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,041
Fish are smart. Back off.

177
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,500
I suppose we'll make do with
the stew I whipped up from

178
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,750
the wild vegetables
Sohara and Mikako found.

179
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,750
I brought you something.
It oughta get your

180
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,041
strength back up, so dig in!

181
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,875
Wait... that something is food!

182
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,750
This chick is my
favoritest person ever!

183
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,833
There's more. You want some?

184
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,291
This too, if you like.

185
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,333
Keep it comin'!

186
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,291
I am stuffed!

187
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,916
Hey, that's great!
I'm glad you liked it!

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,291
Well, I'm just sorry
you had to wait so long.

189
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,541
Oh! What am I doing?!
I can't get all chummy with

190
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,750
the enemy like this! If Master
finds out, I'm dead meat!

191
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,625
If you dummies think
I'm saying thanks for this

192
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,500
no-fish-having stew,
you're totally wrong!

193
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,291
Huh?

194
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,333
This is not a thank you!

195
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,791
So, I brought you home, purple
pointy thing. What do you do?

196
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:20,125
Maybe I was right before and
it is some fancy adult toy?

197
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,791
Now how do I use
this bad boy? Like this?

198
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,083
Oh, wait! Boobies?
No... what if...

199
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,250
it's art? Yeah, booty art!

200
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,666
Ooh-la-la!

201
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,666
Or maybe...

202
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,625
Roll the tension away!

203
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,541
Ah, now the front!

204
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,041
Oh man! I don't know
what you're supposed to be,

205
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,916
but you got a
lotta potential! Huh?

206
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,250
That's so... trippy!

207
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,208
Yes! Of course!

208
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,625
Finished at last! Huh?

209
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,083
Jeez, what's
with all the racket?

210
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,541
Good morning to you... Master.

211
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,125
Ikaros! Card, now!

212
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,625
Here.

213
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,583
My dream is about
to be fully realized!

214
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:32,791
Feast your eyes on...
Panty-Robo 2.0!

215
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:37,875
Huh?

216
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,541
What is that exactly?

217
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,000
Duh, use your eyes! It's only
the super-transforming bike

218
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,375
I've wanted ever
since I was a little kid!

219
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,541
Oh... you want me to ride you?

220
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,458
Yeah! Let's burn some rubber!

221
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,583
Alpha?

222
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:13,791
And so...

223
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,750
from that moment forward...

224
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,333
Panty-Cam, go!

225
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,416
we were a team.
A boy and his bike.

226
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,541
He never looked at me funny
when I told him what hijinks

227
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,166
we were getting up to.
He just rolled with it.

228
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,083
We spent bunches of
time together, 'til we were

229
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,625
more than just
robo-bike and owner.

230
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,791
It's like... like he
was the brother I never had.

231
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,875
Target, left o'clock!
If I take him out now,

232
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,125
Ikaros will never
know it was me!

233
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,708
Say your prayers,
Tomoki Sakurai! Uh!

234
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,375
Huh? Uh... Hey,
didn't see ya there.

235
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,458
Hey! What the heck
is that thing doing here?!

236
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,291
I'm starving!
And it's all his fault!

237
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,166
I'm gonna get you,
dummy! And your food!

238
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,916
Okay, Panty-Robo!
Do your thing!

239
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,375
Dammit! Nothing? 
What's wrong?!

240
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,583
No! The pervometer's on empty!

241
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,333
I'm on it!

242
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,916
Your turn, buddy! Panty-Robo,
transform and finish her off!

243
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,791
Banzai!

244
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,541
Now, Robo! Take
out her defenses!

245
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,250
Get off!

246
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,958
And we did. By groping
her wondrous funbags...

247
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,500
we saved all of humanity.

248
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,416
Hey, buddy! I'm home!

249
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,166
Balls!

250
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,208
Tomoki. Who's your friend?

251
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,666
Uh, him? No one! I swear,
it's not what it looks like!

252
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,000
I've heard enough.
You told me before,

253
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,416
my panties were gone.
Did you not?!

254
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,958
Yeah, but...
not like... gone gone.

255
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,083
Prepare... to meet your maker!

256
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,041
This is it! Game over, man!

257
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,416
Tomoki...

258
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,833
Panty-Robo?

259
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,958
You are... and always
shall be... my friend.

260
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,291
Why, God?!

261
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,541
Save yourself!

262
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:26,125
It is too late for
me. Please, live on!

263
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,041
Don't... leave me!

264
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,541
We were not together long,

265
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,000
but I am a better
robot for knowing you.

266
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,791
You and I... are brothers...

267
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,708
Noooooooo!

268
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,875
To... mo... ki...

269
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,666
Things were never the
same... but time moved on.

270
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,958
Master...
will you be all right?

271
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,291
Saying goodbye...
is just a part of life.

272
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:21,000
Gotta wonder, though... what
was that purple pointy thing...

273
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,416
that fell from the sky,
and changed my life?

274
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,583
Lost property from the Synapse.

275
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,000
Synapse?

276
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,666
Luckily, it was nothing
important. I betcha no one even

277
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,250
noticed it was gone.

278
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,083
Huh? What the Hell are
you rattling on about?

279
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,333
The world we saw in
your dream... Remember?

280
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,000
You can see the gears
just spinning in place.

281
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,541
Oh, what's the use?

282
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,791
Yeah, what's up?

283
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,083
I promise, Master...
No matter what...

284
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,708
I will always be at your side.

285
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:03,208
Master, may I... go and play?

286
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,125
Next time...
"Reach a Decision!

287
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,416
The Up and Down
of Heaven and Hell"
