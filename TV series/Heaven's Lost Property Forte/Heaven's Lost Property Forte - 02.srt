1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,500
Yo. Remote. This is boring.

2
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,416
Here.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,958
Cool. Thanks, Nymph.

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,541
Uh... sorry about that.

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,666
Just... be more careful, okay?

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,083
He responded
that one had nothing

7
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,000
to do with the other,
echoing the sentiment of...

8
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,750
Whoa, what's up? She
looked kinda cute there.

9
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,875
Yeah, she did!

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,416
Shut up, you!

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,125
Master. Your tea
is ready to drink.

12
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,166
Yeah, uh, thanks.

13
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,375
Oh god! Is Ikaros becoming
aware of her sexuality?!

14
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,541
You need me?

15
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,583
No, I do not! No!
No! No! This is insane!

16
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,375
Lusting after mythical beings?!
There's nothing normal about it!

17
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,125
I've gotta do something
about my overblown libido!

18
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,541
Tomoki, are you here?

19
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,833
Master went into the
mountains this morning.

20
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,250
The mountains?

21
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
He was yapping something
about training himself.

22
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,166
Well, he picked
the worst time for it.

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,541
Is something wrong?

24
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,541
Dreadfully.
He's been targeted.

25
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,416
Good afternoon,
everyone. Tomoki here.

26
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,458
I've come high into
the mountains to train.

27
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,666
Here I feel I'm at a safe
distance from the mythical

28
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,208
creatures who, lately
have become unusually sexy

29
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,625
for some reason.
Focus, focus...

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,541
Master...

31
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,916
Need me now?

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,666
Be quiet!

33
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,833
How 'bout now?

34
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,125
Stop already!

35
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,166
And so, I have made my
way to this Zen temple...

36
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,458
in order to gain control
over my earthly desires.

37
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,250
I found him.

38
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,416
The other day, when I was near
the great cherry blossom tree,

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,208
an Angeloid I'd never seen
before fell from the sky.

40
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,000
And I'm not quite
sure how I know this...

41
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,916
but I got the vibe that
she's after Tomoki's life!

42
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,000
Tomo!

43
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,583
Deploying wide-area radar.

44
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,708
Identifying enemy
Angeloid type and location.

45
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,083
The enemy Angeloid has already
made contact with Master.

46
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,458
No way we'll make it in time!

47
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,500
Oh, gosh!

48
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,000
Processing return data.
Threat identified as

49
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,625
close-combat model Angeloid.
Type Delta, Astraea.

50
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,000
Target confirmed.
Tomoki Sakurai.

51
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,583
You will be... eliminated.

52
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,666
Oh, never mind, it's Delta.
So, you wanna go eat all the

53
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,166
leftovers in
the fridge with me?

54
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,166
Yes.

55
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,000
What?! At a time like this?!

56
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,625
Are you sure
that Tomoki's okay?

57
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,000
If it's Delta, he's fine.

58
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,875
And what is that
supposed to mean?!

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,875
So what's the
deal? Is she weak?

60
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,625
Not hardly. More
like ridiculously strong.

61
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,833
And better than Alpha
in close-quarters combat.

62
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,333
But then?

63
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,291
We first-generation combat
Angeloids didn't come equipped

64
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,125
with all that
much functionality.

65
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,666
Here's an example.

66
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,625
For as much computational
and emotional control I have,

67
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,500
my combat abilities are low. And
because Alpha has computational

68
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,750
and combat abilities, her
emotional control is low.

69
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,000
Make sense?

70
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,625
Now, since Delta is stacked
with combat skills and emotions,

71
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,166
that means her computational
abilities are low.

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,375
I see.

73
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,166
Wait. I'm lost.
What are you saying?

74
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,625
Delta... is a
blithering idiot.

75
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,458
Ah, for cryin' out loud.
Another one? Really?

76
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,750
This just has trouble
written all over it.

77
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,041
Young Sakurai, I think
you should move on to

78
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,583
waterfall training next.

79
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,333
Oh... Yes, sir.

80
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:16,541
Oh, oh, oh! I wanna do it,
too! Over here! Me, me, me!

81
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,041
It makes sense that Ikaros'
master would be like this.

82
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,000
He won't be an easy mark.

83
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,291
The fool doesn't even know
I came here to kill him.

84
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,125
Go ahead... Let your
guard down! You are so dead!

85
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,916
So, so, so...

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,583
So... so cold!

87
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,208
Holy crap, are you all right?!
Mr. Priest, where are you?

88
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,000
I need some help!
Hurry! Mr. Prie...

89
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,916
You rang?

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,958
Stop it! No! Since when
is your name Mr. Priest?!

91
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,291
Away with you,
worldly desires!

92
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,875
Only reason I came up
here was to gain control

93
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,958
over my stupid desires!

94
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:17,291
Control... Over...
My... Desires...

95
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,250
Come on, buddy. I'm just
tryin' to help you out here.

96
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,416
Damn it, I am not giving up.

97
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,958
Not giving up, not giving up!
Away with you, worldly desires!

98
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,083
Sensors say Master is here.

99
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,208
You worry too much.
I'm telling you, he's fine.

100
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,166
Of course I'm worried,
he's still my best friend.

101
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,750
Actually, I'm more curious
about what this training is

102
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,416
he's going through.

103
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,750
Why don't you wait
here while I go inside?

104
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah...

105
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,416
It'll give me a chance
to gauge the situation.

106
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,000
All right. I guess if
I don't get rid of these

107
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,458
my desires
will never go away.

108
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,791
Thank you. You've
been so good to me.

109
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,916
Oh, just one more
for the road, girls!

110
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,541
Tomo Sense tingling! Nymph?

111
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,583
Pervert!

112
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,083
Why are... you here?

113
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,458
Sleazebag! You've been
leering at me the way you do

114
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,666
the girls in those
magazines, haven't you?

115
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,708
I can just imagine!

116
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,708
Now... You have to take off your
clothes so I can examine you.

117
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,708
But that needle is way too big
for me to take the whole thing!

118
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,916
Or even worse!

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,125
Time for your spanking!

120
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,541
Thank you, Master.
May I have another?

121
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,583
That's what you've
always wanted to do to me,

122
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,666
isn't it, you jerk-face?!

123
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,000
Would you stop hitting me?!

124
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,250
Yeah? Why should I?!

125
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,416
For someone your age,
you've got some nerve!

126
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,125
Maybe your opinion will
matter once you grow up some!

127
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,333
Especially in this region!

128
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,500
Fine then. You wanna see what
I'll look like all grown up?

129
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,250
Why don't you check this out?!

130
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,291
Since Angeloids don't
age, I'm going to use this

131
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,666
pseudo-growth
device to show you.

132
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,708
Now fall to your knees
and gaze upon the fine body

133
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,708
I could develop in five years!

134
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,500
Well? This is how I'd
look five years older.

135
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,416
Check out my huge cans.

136
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,541
No, wait! Not yet!

137
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,916
Aw, yeah. These are
my breasts in ten years!

138
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,666
Close your eyes!
Don't look at me!

139
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,500
I swear they're
gonna to get bigger!

140
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:39,666
Imagine living this long,
and they're still no bigger.

141
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,916
You sick pervert!
I hate you, Tomoki!

142
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,416
Oh look, Nymph is back.

143
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,333
Hey! How'd it go?

144
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,500
Did you find
anything out about the...?

145
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,041
Did something happen to her?

146
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,458
I will go see
how Master is doing.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,958
After this, I can
get back to training.

148
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,791
But first, just one more look!

149
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,041
Tomo Sense is tingling!

150
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,166
What is Ikaros doing here?

151
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,750
Whoa! What is this filth?!

152
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,166
Have you ever seen
anything so horrible?!

153
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,708
Master? Are such simple
magazines really that dangerous?

154
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,958
Oh, Hell yes! These naked
women gang up to seduce men!

155
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,541
It's awful! Somebody's
hatching some kind of evil plot

156
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,916
somewhere, I tell ya! I'll
deal with these things later.

157
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,125
Acknowledged.

158
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,625
Eliminate all dangers
to Master... Initiate.

159
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,750
Multiple enemies
identified... Targeting...

160
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,833
Commencing elimination mode.

161
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,625
Nice job, Ikaros. You've
done good. Go on home, now.

162
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,708
Yes... Master.

163
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,416
Hey Ikaros, have any luck?

164
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,666
Master was in adequate health
but he did not seem to be

165
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,125
in a happy mood.

166
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,625
Is that right?

167
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,625
Yes.

168
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,208
Oh Tomo.
I'm worried about you.

169
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:05,083
Wow. You're right, this tree
looks... exactly like the one

170
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,958
we saw in Tomoki's dream.
I wonder what it means.

171
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,916
Ikaros. I hate to ask,
but would you look at this?

172
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,125
Could you tell me
if this acorn is of

173
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,791
the same variety as
the chinquapin tree?

174
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,875
Yes.

175
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,541
Commencing structural
analysis... Fifty percent...

176
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:28,458
Eighty percent... One hundred
percent. Analysis complete.

177
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,625
Genomes of both
organic substances...

178
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,750
are an absolute match...

179
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,958
Identical species
and variety confirmed.

180
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,708
I knew it. Of course.

181
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,666
Sugata. What
does all that mean?

182
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,541
All of our answers
are in the New World.

183
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,250
Up beyond the sky.

184
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,958
Rest in peace. I'll miss
you, beautiful ladies.

185
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,875
You're gone too soon. So sad.

186
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,875
What is he doing over there?

187
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,125
Look how defenseless
he is right now!

188
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,666
That's a porno mag! Ooh!
If I can pull him even more

189
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,125
off his guard, maybe
I can kill him right now!

190
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,083
Excuse me, sir...

191
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,750
There's an even more incredibly
dirty porno mag over here.

192
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,750
What's this?

193
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,958
Bang!

194
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,208
Oh, my God.

195
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,958
No! Don't close it!
Hold on a sec!

196
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,791
Check it out! How about this?

197
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,166
See? Flashie... flashie...

198
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,791
Nowadays, that kind of
soft-core crap wouldn't even

199
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,583
turn on a middle-schooler.

200
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,083
Fine. Then what do you
think about this, big boy?!

201
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,583
This... this is...

202
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,625
One more page to go!

203
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,583
Damn centerfold!

204
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,000
No! I can't take off any more!

205
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,333
Enough of your futile
resistance, stupid paper!

206
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,833
Dammit! Isn't there anything
around here that can cut this?

207
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,875
Like some scissors
or a box cutter?

208
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,166
Sure.

209
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,750
Oh, thanks a million!

210
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,500
What do you think? Cuts
pretty well, doesn't it?

211
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,291
I can't believe my
desires are so entrenched in

212
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,750
my psyche that
it's come to this.

213
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,416
Here you go, dude.
The priest told me I should

214
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,958
bring this stuff to you.

215
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,541
Thank you.
I gratefully accept this.

216
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,916
You finally let your
guard down, stupid bug.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,708
The food you're
eating is poisoned.

218
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,958
Loaded with vicious
and deadly poison...

219
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,333
that I forgot to put in!

220
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,000
You have to give
me that food back!

221
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,583
The Hell's wrong with you?!

222
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,750
Let go!

223
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,916
Stop! Stop! I can't breathe!

224
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,708
No! Stop wriggling!

225
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,875
Tomo! Tomo!

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,750
It's all good!

227
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,416
Grandpa?

228
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,416
Whether they're human,
or mythical beings,

229
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,166
long as they got boobs.

230
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,625
Doesn't matter. They're
all still chicks, right?

231
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,500
It's all good.

232
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,708
I finally get it,
Grandpa. It's all good.

233
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,625
What's that?

234
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,333
Here are the Six Domains. When
a person dies, they are taken to

235
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,458
one of six worlds, depending
on the life they led.

236
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,875
The realms are called the
Hell Realm, the Preta Realm,

237
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,041
the Animal Realm, The Asura
Realm, the Human Realm,

238
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,916
and the Blissful Realm. This is
a path that cannot be avoided...

239
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,333
if one ever hopes
to atone for one's sins.

240
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:59,875
This is the enlightenment my Zen
temple training has provided me!

241
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:06,416
Finishing strike! Welcome
to the Six Domains of Tomoki!

242
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,541
Tomoki Hell Realm!

243
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,291
Stop doing that! It burns!

244
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,333
Tomoki Preta Realm!

245
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,166
This... is... so... gross!

246
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,666
Tomoki Animal Realm!

247
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,666
No!

248
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,791
Tomoki Asura Realm!

249
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,666
I can't take any more of this!

250
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,625
Where's the door
out of this place?

251
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,791
Um... what's that?

252
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,458
Welcome... Tomoki Human Realm.

253
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,666
No! No! I said no!

254
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,625
Come on, man. Just look at it.

255
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,791
That's what she said.

256
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,500
What in the world
is that thing?!

257
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,333
Tomoki Blissful Realm, man.

258
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,916
Fine, but what is that?!

259
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,000
No more!

260
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,833
I'm home.

261
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,208
Welcome back, Master.
It is good to see you.

262
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,000
Would you like to take a bath?

263
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,500
Nah, not right now. I'm beat.

264
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,875
Master's spirits are low.

265
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,208
Perhaps I should not have

266
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,250
eliminated those
magazines for him.

267
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,583
Activating card.

268
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:23,916
Read me...! Read me...!
Read me...! Read me...!

269
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,083
What on Earth?!

270
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,583
Ikaros...

271
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,750
Master?

272
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:42,500
You big lunkhead. You
did all this just for me?

273
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,666
Yes... Master.

274
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,625
I am glad. As long as Master is
happy, that is all I could want.

275
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,458
Read me! Read me! Read me!

276
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,416
Master...

277
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,958
Your magazines tell me
they would like a festival to

278
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,500
celebrate their resurrection.

279
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,958
Sure! Paint the
town red! Do it big!

280
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,250
Due to unforeseen contingency...
Circuits shutting down.

281
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,500
Commencing initialization.
Restarting. Reaffirming mission.

282
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,375
Dreams are... an imperfect,
unique phenomenon,

283
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,625
experienced only
by Earth humans.

284
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,750
One year ago, an
incident of uncertain origin

285
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,041
occurred in which the
dream of one human became

286
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,625
connected to the Synapse.

287
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,041
Concluding there
was no immediate danger,

288
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,250
the Supreme Council's
ultimate decision was to

289
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,583
let it pass. Until several
days ago, when evidence was

290
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,708
discovered of humans
infiltrating the Synapse's core.

291
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,541
The core is where
the Rule resides.

292
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,500
The Rule?

293
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,958
Although not acknowledging
any interference with the Rule,

294
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,291
the Synapse Supreme
Council determined that

295
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,541
this action posed
a security threat.

296
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,083
The alert level was
elevated to stage four.

297
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,708
And it was ruled that
it is now necessary to

298
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,375
eliminate human target
Tomoki Sakurai at once.

299
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,750
My mission is to eliminate
Tomoki Sakurai at once...

300
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,750
and determine the cause of...

301
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,250
It appears...
you and I are going to

302
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,958
need to have
ourselves a long talk.

303
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,750
Next time... "A
Proud-Fought Battle"
