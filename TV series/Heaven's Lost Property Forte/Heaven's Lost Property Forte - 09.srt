1
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,666
Peace and quiet.

2
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,416
Sure is nice, huh?

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,791
Crap, I just typed in
the wrong numbers again!

4
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:38,833
Son of a...

5
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,875
Peace... and...
friggin'... quiet...

6
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,041
It's been nothing but love and
tears and battles to the death

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,333
around here, lately. I approve
of all the drama, of course...

8
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,458
but I'm not getting
to have any of the fun.

9
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,875
All of this evil... and
nobody here to vent it upon.

10
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:07,583
Well... nobody...
except you, my dear Sohara.

11
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,166
You look buoyant.

12
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,958
Guess it's that time of year
again. Crazy, huh?

13
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,666
Me and the gang are hitting
up the local shrine for

14
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,500
the summer festival,
just like always.

15
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,083
I can't believe how
relaxed I feel right now.

16
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,125
Yoo-hoo! Tomo!

17
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,541
So... we meet again.

18
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,208
You didn't think that you
were shut of me, did ya?

19
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,666
Gather 'round, time to
unveil this year's event!

20
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,208
Oh yes, but first...

21
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,208
This way, ladies.

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,166
You boys'll be thrilled
you decided to come, when you

23
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,500
see what your class president's
cooked up for you tonight!

24
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,458
I present the Yo-Yo Fish-Off!

25
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,291
Huh? What?

26
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,916
Snowballs and wrestling and
live ammo and now this?! No way!

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,125
I've said it before and I'll say
it again. Fishing is bullshit!

28
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:54,666
I suppose I should explain
the rules. Oh, clumsy me...

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,916
Thank you...
for that... but... why?

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,625
Now Tomoki... remind your horny
classmates what yo-yos are.

31
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,750
Huh? They're, y'know, those
toys that go "boing boing."

32
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,833
Oh yes.
"Boing boing" is right!

33
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,291
Got one!

34
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,125
What the--?!

35
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,750
No!

36
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,625
Y'see? Boing-boing,
just like you said!

37
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,916
Look!

38
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,500
The pool is
swarming with girls!

39
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,125
What's the big idea?!

40
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,916
Noooo!

41
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,416
The rules are very simple.
Everyone breaks up into

42
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,833
two-person teams. Whichever
team reels in the breast catch

43
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:07,125
will be declared the Yo-Yo
Fish-Off champ. Easy as pie.

44
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,916
Such a shame, though. Tomoki
would have been a shoe-in

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,708
to win this one...
but sadly he's already said

46
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,916
he doesn't even want to try.

47
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,583
Tomoko knows what to do
with a rod! Tide is optimal.

48
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,958
Wind:
north-by-somethin'-or-other.

49
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,833
All right, ladies and germs!
On your marks... Get set...

50
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,791
Let's do this!

51
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,333
Here we go!

52
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,291
Class President Satsu-kitane
delivers yet again with

53
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,958
today's Yo-Yo Fish-Off
competition! I'm Mr. Takehara,

54
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,708
the math-teacher-slash-host
who's got everyone's number!

55
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,500
I will provide...
color commentary.

56
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,875
Remember, first place goes to

57
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,833
whichever team fishes
the biggest ta-tas,

58
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,916
a.k.a. yo-yos, out of the pool!
It's chaos in the water as our

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,416
melon-maddened menfolk make
a beeline for the boobies!

60
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,958
Oh, no!

61
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,041
We're done for!

62
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,541
Stay away from me!

63
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,625
I've gotta hunch these are
the two teams to watch, folks!

64
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,833
Tomoko and Sugata are fast,
but Satsukitane and that one guy

65
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,666
are right at their heels!

66
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,166
Sure hope my hands don't slip
while I'm measuring the haul!

67
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,875
Good thing it's
just us girls, huh?!

68
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,416
No! Let me go! Let me go!

69
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,958
The little minx has resurfaced
with four more teats to tally!

70
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,458
Ink 'em up!
Ink 'em up! Waaaaaay up!

71
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,500
Thank you. I'll
treasure them forever.

72
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,333
To-mo-ko...! To-mo-ko...!

73
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,541
In she goes! No question who's
the fan-favorite here, folks!

74
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,041
Tomoko and Sugata put
the "jug" in juggernaut

75
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,041
with their fourth
catch of the day!

76
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,791
Yeah! Dream on! You keep
your gender-bent paws off of me!

77
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,750
Go ahead and try it!
You feel lucky, punk?!

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,125
Come back when you're
bigger, little guppy.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,250
She released Nymph back
into the wild! Attagirl!

80
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,291
Excellent angling etiquette.

81
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,041
Wouldn't have helped
their score anyway.

82
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,708
Correct.

83
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,666
Stop messing around.
We're running out of time!

84
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,666
Catch us a girl with curves!

85
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,625
Aye-aye!

86
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,375
Now then. Time to
call in the big guns.

87
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,541
Jackpot!

88
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,875
Here juggy-juggy-juggy!

89
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,166
Speak of the devil!

90
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,083
I'm gonna get ya!

91
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:56,041
Oh, did I forget to mention?
This is a contact sport.

92
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,458
Showtime!

93
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:09,291
Oh! No! Oh, you got me!

94
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,250
Tomoko went down
in a hail of gunfire!

95
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,333
Is this the end of the road...

96
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,458
Hey! Shake it off,
you gigantic baby!

97
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,000
Meanwhile, Madame President
and the other guy have

98
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,791
landed a pair of backbreakingly
epic sweater puppies!

99
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,833
Oh, Sugata!
Whatever are we gonna do?!

100
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,166
Catching them with a pole is too
slow. Let's switch methods...

101
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,291
mass-harvesting!

102
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,375
Right!

103
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,625
Sugata and me, we managed
to put up a pretty good fight.

104
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,041
But Prez kept bringing
the hurt, like hard-core.

105
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,250
Every time I went to
seal the deal, there she was.

106
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:48,458
Time was almost up, and we still
hadn't landed any big catches.

107
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,791
Best! Festival! Ever!

108
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:56,708
He's so rude! Who's he calling
a guppy?! Stupid pervert!

109
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,958
He had to toss
you back, Nymph.

110
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,083
Look at those bug-bites!

111
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,541
What did you just call 'em?!

112
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,875
Nothin'!

113
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,250
Least I can spell "bug-bite!"

114
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,166
Are you having fun?

115
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,958
Oh. Hey, Alpha!

116
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,625
Hey, why aren't they fishing for
your boobs in the pool, Ikaros?

117
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,458
I think that I've...
had enough of water for now.

118
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Yeah... guess so. I mean, after
what you had to do and all.

119
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,041
I'm sorry you were forced to
take a life. But the truth is,

120
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,541
if you hadn't
stopped Chaos, none of us

121
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,458
would be standing here.

122
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,500
Correct.

123
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,000
Any luck?

124
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,500
Yeah, but all bad.

125
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,500
Ten minutes to go, sports
fans! Team Satsukitane's at the

126
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,916
head of the pack!

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,708
But the pool's all fished
out! Damn that Astraea for

128
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,500
having epic funbags!

129
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,666
Legend tells of a creature.

130
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,083
A thing that guards the pool.

131
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,583
Those who've laid eyes
on it speak of it with

132
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,791
fear and reverence.
A Leviathan that

133
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,041
glides through the
chlorinated deep...

134
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,708
its bustline
continually growing larger.

135
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,708
Bustline?

136
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,500
She... She's huge!

137
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,041
An omen...!

138
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,250
Are you all right, Master?

139
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,958
Maybe Fate is trying to tell
me... that it's high time...

140
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,500
I cop a feel!

141
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,458
Master...

142
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,000
Launch the boat.

143
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,000
There's no time to
explain! Boobies, ho!

144
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,708
We're taking on water!
Damn! She's not responding!

145
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,083
Go! I'll hold her together!

146
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,000
Right!

147
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,666
Sugata...

148
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:38,833
If I... If I survive, I swear
I'm gonna propose to Ikaros.

149
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,375
What does that
mean? "Propose?" 

150
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,583
I'll bring her...
a bouquet of flowers.

151
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,000
The biggest ever!

152
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:35,500
Dear Ikaros, I'm sorry.
After this one last haul,

153
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:41,166
I was gonna propose to you.
But if you're reading this...

154
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,250
I guess... my luck ran out.

155
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,333
Even so... I
don't regret a thing.

156
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:05,833
I may be gone... but
the boobs that I've seen...

157
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,791
will jiggle... forever!

158
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,375
Forever!

159
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,458
And there's the whistle!
After a white-knuckle night

160
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:29,375
of fishing, Team
Satsukitane wins it all!

161
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,416
Heading out?

162
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,208
Yeah.

163
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,375
Until next time.

164
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,666
'Til then.

165
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,500
Ah! That's better! So uh...

166
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,125
You sure you don't
wanna cut him down?

167
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,041
Positive!

168
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,291
The whole Yo-Yo Fishing
thing was bad enough,

169
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,083
but what's wrong with Tomo?

170
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,500
Sometimes he treats
me like a piece of meat!

171
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,375
And he told you
he would propose?

172
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,208
It's like he doesn't even
think before he opens his mouth.

173
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,375
Sohara...

174
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,625
What's up?

175
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,125
Tell me... What is love?

176
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,166
Huh?

177
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,791
The entire concept.
I do not understand it.

178
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:33,166
But... sometimes my reactor
hurts when I think of him

179
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,291
and it gets hard to breathe.

180
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,333
I see... For what it's worth,
I'm in the same boat as you.

181
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,458
I don't understand
it, either. Not really.

182
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,375
It hurts you... but you always
want to be around the person.

183
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,541
Is that it?

184
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,750
It is.

185
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,291
Come on, you.

186
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,541
Ikaros must have
feelings... for Tomoki.

187
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,375
Sorry! Guess I zoned out.

188
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,208
You're proposing, Moota?!

189
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,833
With a
diamond-studded horseshoe.

190
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,875
Umami, let's be
together forever.

191
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,291
That's so sweet.

192
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,916
He proposed?

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,208
Yeah, it's this thing the humans
do on TV a lot, where they

194
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,583
promise they're gonna
be together forever.

195
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,625
Together forever...

196
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,750
What's with you?
Oh! The love thing.

197
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,958
Are you still bummed out
about not knowing what love is?

198
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,208
I think Tomoki's got
something that could help you.

199
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's see... where'd
it... Ah! Here!

200
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,208
"My First Errand..."

201
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,750
Yeah!

202
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,958
Oh, no... don't! If you keep
chasing me, all my clothes...

203
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,208
The Hell's this crap?

204
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,833
Oh, you naughty,
naughty man!

205
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,875
Oh man, home safe at last.
Where did you find that DVD?!

206
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,916
What the Hell are you doing?!

207
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:13,416
It's not even mine!
Bad Angeloids! Bad!

208
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,083
Um, Master...

209
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,500
Fine, it is!

210
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:20,916
Remember when you said...
you were going to propose.

211
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,333
Huh?!

212
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,416
After... the boob fishing.

213
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,958
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no! I
didn't mean proposal proposal!

214
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,958
I meant, like... uh,
Backpedal! Backpedal!

215
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,166
But. There is something
I have been meaning to give

216
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,416
to the both of you.
It's called an allowance.

217
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,541
And Nymph.

218
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,958
An allowance?

219
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,125
Why not? You
two can handle it.

220
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,250
Sohara was just
telling me how Ikaros can

221
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,875
go shopping
all by herself now,

222
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,208
and I'm sure there's gotta
be stuff you want too, right?

223
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,791
Is this an errand?

224
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,750
No! It's for fun!

225
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,958
This money is yours now. You can
spend it on whatever ya want.

226
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,375
Understand?

227
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,666
Awesome. I'm never gonna run out
of snacks again! Hey, Alpha!

228
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,250
Whatcha gonna do wi--

229
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,875
Why are you petting your money?

230
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,833
I am bonding
with my allowance.

231
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,875
Huh? Something that
would please Tomoki?

232
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,250
Correct.

233
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,375
Oh, I can think of a ton
of things you could get for

234
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,250
Tomo that he would really
enjoy. Pile o'porn, maybe?

235
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,083
Nah! That boy's got enough
smut to last a lifetime.

236
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,708
Save your money, Ikaros. Just
treat him to some together time.

237
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,416
Together...

238
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,375
Um... Are you pissed
at me or somethin'?

239
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,125
It's together time.

240
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,708
Oh great, this rules.
We'll be together forever.

241
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,791
Just back off
before you kill me!

242
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
Aw, man. That was close!

243
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,958
Master, did you just say
we would be together forever?

244
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,208
Yeah... Somethin' like that.

245
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,500
Ikaros greeting... Hi!

246
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,291
Pleasing Tomoki,
that's the idea?

247
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,333
Correct.

248
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,708
Well, he's probably
still sore from

249
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,375
our little
fishing competition.

250
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:28,083
Why not draw him a nice bath,
and then hop on in with him?

251
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,375
Master...

252
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,916
Ah, what the crap?!
Down periscope!

253
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,750
Master did not seem to
like that much. Maybe...

254
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,666
I do have to
purchase him something.

255
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,666
So what kind of purchase
would please Tomoki?

256
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,791
Correct.

257
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,333
Well, what do you think?

258
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,708
Yes, but...

259
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,833
He'll like it.
I guarantee you.

260
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,208
All right then.

261
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,916
I will go buy it immediately.

262
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,708
Somethin'...
I can help ya with?

263
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,625
Yes, please.

264
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,583
These are so good!

265
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,291
Preach on, sister!

266
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,458
Delta! I don't remember
you asking if you could

267
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,250
have any of my snacks!

268
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,250
What's the big deal? You bought
a bunch. There's more than

269
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,125
enough to share! Huh?!

270
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,666
Hey! Hands off!

271
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,458
I'm starvin' over here! At least
I'm not stingy like you are!

272
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,125
What's with all the racket?!

273
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,583
Oh, hey, Tomoki. Here.

274
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,958
Take it. 'Cause it's just
gonna go to waste if you don't.

275
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,041
Thank you.

276
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,750
What the Hell?! When I took
some, you were all like,

277
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,166
"Oink, oink, Astraea!"

278
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,458
Shut up! Jus'...
shut up already!

279
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,500
You're a butthead! How come
he can have some?

280
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,958
I am home.

281
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,083
Hey, Ikaros. Welcome back.

282
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,541
I wanted it, so I...

283
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,791
I get it. They
destroyed your garden,

284
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,041
so you bought yourself that.

285
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,750
Man, it was balls getting eaten
by that watermelon monster.

286
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,375
This was a mistake. I knew it.

287
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,625
This watermelon
is what I wanted.

288
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,416
Whatevs. It's all good. You
took your allowance and bought

289
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,416
something for yourself with it,
just like you're supposed to.

290
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,083
Good job. I'm proud.

291
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,958
Master was pleased with me.

292
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,916
Sugata's idea
must have been correct.

293
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:11,875
But why? This watermelon...
is something I wanted,

294
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,583
not something
that Master wanted.

295
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,208
Master, did you just say
we would be together forever?

296
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,625
Yeah. Something like that.

297
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:27,458
Maybe that moment... was
Master's way... of proposing.

298
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,166
It's so sparkly...

299
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:11,166
And now it's gone. I'm so
deep underwater, I can't move.

300
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,958
No fair.

301
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:18,375
I wish she would have
told me what love is.

302
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,250
Everything... hurts a lot.

303
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,958
It hurts?!

304
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,708
My reactor hurts.
I can't help it!

305
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:34,291
Of course! So
that's what love is!

306
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,250
Did that hurt you,
little fishies?

307
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:47,458
Someone had to show you...
what love really is!

308
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,125
I have to eat you now,
my lovelies, so I can get

309
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:55,291
big and strong! And once I do,
I'm gonna go back up there...

310
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,625
and show them what love is!

311
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,583
All of them! All of them!

312
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:08,791
Next time... "Peek Into
the Fantasy Field"
