[theme music]

6
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,500
-Supreme Commander,
where are you going?

7
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:24,767
-Gyuki.

8
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,167
-Supreme Commander, if you
go running off like that,

9
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,434
you'll draw attention.

10
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,100
This isn't like you.

11
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,434
Where do you intend
to fight tonight?

12
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,834
-At Osaka Castle.

13
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38,900
You don't have to come.

14
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,434
-Osaka Castle?

15
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,934
You're joking.

16
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,434
I'm sure you know who
waits there, don't you?

17
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,967
Hagoromo Gitsune
is no mere Yokai.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,434
-I've heard.

19
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,408
-She's the great
Yokai who's lived

20
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,774
in the capital
since ancient times,

21
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:57,208
so powerful she can
even rule over humans.

22
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,174
Stop this.

23
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,808
It's not the time yet.

24
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:04,274
You must gather strength as
the next Lord of Pandemonium.

25
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,574
-Enough, Gyuki.

26
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:12,108
If you're trying to say Hagoromo
Gitsune's the current one,

27
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:16,008
then all I have to
do is surpass her.

Princess Miyako!

00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,274
-So we are going to
be eaten after all.

35
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:53,141
The future I foresaw
is coming true.

36
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:54,641
Let me out!

37
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:57,074
I beg you!

[growling]

00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:58,241
-Ayakashi.

40
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,441
I see my future.

41
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:08,808

are going to-- No!

45
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:22,574
I knew it.

46
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:24,241
Every one of the
princesses brought here

47
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:28,108
possesses some kind of power.

48
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:30,708
They want her livers.

49
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,374
-There's no need to be
afraid, Princess Yo.

50
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,341
Your flesh and
blood will live on

51
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:40,874
as part of the foundation of
our millennial Yokai capital.

52
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:42,974
Resign yourself,
my lovely princess.

53
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:01,894
-Lord Ayakashi...

54
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,706
You're here.

55
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,576
-What's this?

56
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:23,849
An intruder?

57
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:25,709
-Who might you be?

58
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:34,909
-A yakuza?

59
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:44,676
-I'm nurarihyon, the Supreme
Commander of the Nura Clan.

60
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,109
Sorry, but that's my woman.

61
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:48,409
I'm taking her back.

62
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:49,843
HAGUROMO GITSUNE:
What's all this?

63
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,409
A Yokai rescuing a human?

64
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:54,476
What an odd thing to do.

65
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,043
Are you a deranged
lone rat of some sort?

66
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:05,309
-Hey, guys.

67
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:07,843
So you decided to join.

68
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,676
-We are your Night Parade.

69
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,976
-Wherever you go,
we shall follow.

70
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,609
-You're a bunch of fools.

71
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:17,809
-We seem to have many
odd guests, insects

72
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,443
who don't know their place.

73
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,176
Who among us shall
make this show

74
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,143
an entertaining one for me?

75
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,076
-Allow me that honor.

76
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:29,076
I am [? gairota ?]
from Rashomon.

77
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:32,343
Remember this name as I send
you to the depths of hell!

78
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,743
Lightning Club Hurricane!

79
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,709
They've all blow
away without a trace.

80
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,876
-That was rather brief.

81
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,809
-Gairota!

82
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:44,776
-Move it.

83
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,476
I'll cut down
anything in my way.

84
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:57,843
-Follow the Supreme Commander!

85
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,043
-It's a free for all!

86
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:00,176
[chuckling]

87
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,476
-It's fun babysitting
the Supreme Commander.

88
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,776
If we live through this, let's
have another drink or two.

89
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:10,409
-Don't falter, just
focus on the present,

90
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,709
and you'll have nothing to fear.

91
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:15,643
-Don't worry about us, Gyuki.

92
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:18,643
We're all originally
born from the darkness.

93
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,243
None of us fears death.

94
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:24,109
We'll either lead our commander
to victory or die trying.

95
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,843
-Very well said, Hitotsume.

96
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,509
-What are you all doing?

97
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:31,976
Show them what a superior
class of ayakashi is like.

98
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,409
-Kill those who defy
our dark mother.

99
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:35,376
-I don't think so.

100
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,743
-Such child's play!

101
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,109
-You're Gyuki from Mt.

102
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:01,643
Nejireme.

103
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:02,343
-Mt.

104
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,609
Kurama's Great Tengu?

105
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:05,843
-Ah.

106
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:09,909
You look well, but the
child prodigy, Ume Wakamaru,

107
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:12,809
has grown up a fool,
if he's opposing us.

108
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,943
I suppose it can't be helped
under a reckless leader who

109
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,443
doesn't know his limits.

110
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:18,576
-That's true.

111
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,843
Our commander does march
to a different drum.

112
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,043
However--

113
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:23,843
-Hm?

114
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:27,576
-That's what makes him fun.

115
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:30,109
-Get behind me, and stay
out of sight, princess.

116
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:34,109
-Hey!

117
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,343
Calm down.

118
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:36,776
Easy.

119
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,609
-Princess Yo, Princess Yo!

120
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:40,543
She's in trouble.

121
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,276
-Lord Ayakashi.

122
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,809
-What an amusing show.

123
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:55,709
Having such fine
actors is a rare thing.

124
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,409
It's been a hundred years
since a Yokai opposed me.

125
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,443
-Get your hands off my woman.

126
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:01,909
Now!

127
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:10,909
-Oh.

128
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,209
Have you fallen
in love with her?

129
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:15,643
This play has some
rather unexpected twists.

130
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:23,009
Does this princess have the
power to enchant an ayakashi?

131
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:27,543
If so, it makes me want to
taste her liver even more.

132
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:30,576
-Princess Yo!

133
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:33,609
-Hidemoto, Hidemoto,
are you there?

134
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:35,776
-What's the rush, Koremitsu?

135
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,209
-We've lost many
from the main family.

136
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,543
-Even from here I can tell
what's going on in Kyoto.

137
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:45,976
Those barriers of yours could
never stop a powerful ayakashi.

138
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,543
-They were no good at all.

139
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:49,876
-And after 28 years of training.

140
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,876
-Get rid of them now, Hidemoto!

141
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,176
-Ayakashi do live
for hundreds of years.

142
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,776
You shouldn't
worry about losing.

143
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,809
You two, return.

144
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:03,143
-The ayakashi that
you were interested in

145
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:04,843
has headed to Osaka Castle.

146
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,809
-Him, huh?

147
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:08,609
He's the only Yokai
who would ever

148
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:13,143
come eat at an onmyoji's home.

149
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,609
He's a funny one.

150
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,609
But he can't kill
Hagoromo Gitsune.

151
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,143
What's he up to?

152
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:19,876
-Wait.

153
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,776
Where are you going?

154
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:25,909
-Osaka Castle, to observe him.

155
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:27,009
-Wha?

156
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,009
-Want to come too?

157
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:31,076
-Look at Osaka Castle.

158
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:33,109
The Night Parade of a
Hundred Demons is there.

159
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:33,909
-So it's true.

160
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,476
The Yokai had access to it.

161
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,009
-It's the end.

162
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,676
-The Toyotomi and Yokai?

163
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,143
I must tell Master Tenkai.

164
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:52,709
-What?

165
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,776
Is that it?

166
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:59,109
It seems you're just a weak
ayakashi like all the others.

167
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,109
This is a side show.

168
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,776
Entertain me.

169
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:06,676
Can you see how
many tails I have?

170
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,909
That's how many times
I've been reincarnated.

171
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:15,423
Now they react to any hot-headed
ayakashi who comes after me.

172
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:18,015
What's wrong?

173
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:20,381
Don't you want to save her?

174
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,648
Dance.

175
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,915
I shall enjoy watching you
dance to your last breath,

176
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:27,181
young ayakashi.

177
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:28,215
-Lord Ayakashi!

178
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:40,008
-Hagoromo Gitsune is
no ordinary ayakashi.

179
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:44,675
In turbulent times, she
emerges and possesses children.

180
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,808
She waits until the
moment their nature

181
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:51,342
becomes darkest, and takes
them over, aging them.

182
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:56,108
She absorbs all their malice,
and becomes more powerful.

183
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:59,608
Her life lasts as long
as humans' though.

184
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:02,608
So when her host's
life comes to an end,

185
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:07,108
she goes into hiding until
another suitable host appears.

186
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,708
-A rebirth Yokai.

187
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:11,743
You can't defeat her unless
you seal her real body.

188
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:14,110
She'll just return
across the eras.

189
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:16,577
-Wearing people
like Hagoromo robes,

190
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,010
always seeking to
disrupt the capital.

191
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:21,877
And that's where
she gets her name.

192
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,243
What worries me is
that she's collecting

193
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,243
all those human livers.

194
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,810
She's clearly planning
something, something very big.

195
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:32,143
-Can that ayakashi you're
interested in defeat

196
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,043
somebody like her?

197
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:37,677
-I don't think he stands a
chance, even one in a million.

198
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,210
-So then--

199
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:42,543
-However, he has one thing.

200
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:45,410
And that's room for growth.

201
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:48,643
He did gather that Night
Parade of a Hundred Demons

202
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:49,943
in only a century.

203
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:56,877
-Lord Ayakashi!

204
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,410
-I think not.

205
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:02,043
I'm aware of your powers, and
that just wouldn't be fun.

206
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:02,943
-Stop it.

207
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,410
Why are you doing this?

208
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:06,410
It's senseless.

209
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:08,377
I don't understand you at all.

210
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,310
Going this far, is this the
way that all men behave?

211
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:15,077
-Oh, you say such
adorable things.

212
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,477
Listen.

213
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,977
In this world, there are many
intelligent men, both ayakashi

214
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,277
and human.

215
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,310
You chose poorly.

216
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,243
It's unfortunate that your
first should be stupid.

217
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:29,343
Especially since he
is your last as well.

218
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:34,777
-Princess, how do I seem
to your eyes right now?

219
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,510
Do I look as stupid
as she just said?

220
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:46,143
When I think about you, princess,
my heart fills with joy.

221
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,710
-What?

222
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,277
-You're like a
cherry blossom to me,

223
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,677
so beautiful and so
delicate, yet so innocent.

224
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,777
You give peace to
all those around you.

225
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,710
And just having you by my
side will make everything else

226
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:02,310
seem brighter.

227
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,110
I see it now, that future.

228
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,343
-The future?

229
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:07,810
You mean you and me?

230
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:12,143
RIKUO: You seemed so
miserable when we met.

231
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:14,443
I'll make you happy.

232
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:15,843
How about it?

233
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,310
Standing before
you now, do I look

234
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:21,943
like a man who could
make you happy?

235
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,377
I doubt I do.

236
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,577
I have to show you
how great I am,

237
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,810
if I want you to fall for me.

238
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:35,010
I almost forgot myself,
trying to impress you so much.

239
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:37,543
It's time that you gave
her back, Hagoromo Gitsune.

240
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,310
HAGOROMO GITSUNE
(VOICEOVER): What's this?

241
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,010
He changed suddenly.

242
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:43,477
-Lord Ayakashi.

243
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,810
-Let's go.

244
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,477
The darkness starts know.

245
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,643
The real battle of Ayakashi.

246
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,477
HAGOROMO GITSUNE:
My tails aren't

247
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,977
reacting even though
he's right there.

248
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,243
I can't see him.

249
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:05,043
-My spirit blade?

250
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,043
-That won't work.

251
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:16,810
What-- What kind
of a sword is that?

252
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:26,610
It's fading away?

253
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,877
My Yokai energy, it's fading!

254
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,377
Wait.

255
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,577
Don't go!

256
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,477
The power I collected
for my unborn child,

257
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,943
for my precious baby!

258
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,343
Come back here!

259
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:41,943
How long do you think it
took to gather all this!

260
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,043
-Lady Yodo!

261
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:45,377
-What in hell did
that bastard do?

262
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,443
-Princess Yo!

263
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:49,477
-Commander!

264
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,810
We'll all take care
of everything here.

265
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:55,710
You go after her, and make
sure you finish her off!

266
00:15:55,743 --> 00:16:01,377
-Gyuki, keep her safe.

267
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,110
-Don't let 'em escape, men!

268
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,943
-You're gonna have
to face us first.

269
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:10,777
-Yes.

270
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,977
That's right.

271
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,977
Keep going.

272
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,143
Go, and become the
Lord of Pandemonium.

273
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,610
Race to the top, Commander!

274
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,877
-You swine.

275
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,043
Do you have even the slightest
inkling of what you've done?

276
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,777
It took years to
gather that much power.

277
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,543
And it's gone now,
thanks to you.

278
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:49,677
I don't expect this to
restore my lost strength,

279
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,710
not with just your liver.

280
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,310
Even your entire
life won't be enough.

281
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:57,443
This side show is over now.

282
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,243
-Hidemoto.

283
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,777
-Shikigami Hagun,
Twelve Ancestral gods,

284
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,310
defeat the demons
and cleanse the evil.

285
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:22,477
God of the Eastern Sea,
Ame; of the Western Sea,

286
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,177
Shukura; of the
Southern Sea, Kyojo;

287
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,310
of the Northern Sea, Gukyo;
gods of the Four Seas.

288
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,977
Hagoromo Gitsune's powers
are fading quickly.

289
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,210
To think he weakened
her this much.

290
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:39,343
-Mind your own business, please.

291
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:42,943
Who do you think made
that sword you're using?

292
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,577
It cuts well, right?

293
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,410
Only Yokai though.

294
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:48,910
She's all yours, Nura.

295
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,310
-So is this gonna mean
that I owe you one now?

296
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:52,977
-Stop!

297
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,077
What are you doing?

298
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,610
Who do you think it is
you're dealing with?

299
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,543
Damn you!

300
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:04,910
You'll pay for this.

301
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:07,243
I swear that you'll pay!

302
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:10,343
A curse on you, a
curse, nurarihyon!

303
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:13,110
For the crime of
destroying my dream,

304
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:16,510
I will make certain you suffer.

305
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:20,443
I curse your bloodline
for all eternity,

306
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,410
for generations to come!

307
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:25,843
Your children,
your grandchildren,

308
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:28,777
they'll all be bound
by this fox's curse!

309
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:41,210
-He actually defeated her.

310
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:45,177
Guess this makes you the
new Lord of Pandemonium.

311
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,943
-Lady Yodo!

312
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:50,110
[sobbing]

313
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:53,243
-Without their leader, those
ayakashi will probably scatter.

314
00:18:57,643 --> 00:19:02,244
And if I act now, I might
be able to defeat you too.

315
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,077
What now?

316
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,543
What does the Lord of
Pandemonium intend?

317
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:12,510
The Tokugawa's world is bright,
and darkness will definitely

318
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:13,843
fade.

319
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:17,610
It'll be a hard place
for Yokai to exist.

320
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:19,643
-You don't have to tell me that.

321
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,643
I know what's gonna be like.

322
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,010
And that's why I'm gonna be
the master of all those Yokai

323
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,810
who might fade Away

324
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:30,543
-To protect ayakashi, huh?

325
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:34,543
You'll accept humans, and
protect ayakashi world?

326
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:35,943
Coexistence?

327
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,710
That'll be hard.

328
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,177
-I don't think so.

329
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,110
I'll just have to
become invincible.

330
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:45,477
-You're unbelievable, you know?

331
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,210
-Lord Ayakashi!

332
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:52,110
-Princess Yo, what
are you doing there?

333
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:56,043
-Lord Ayakashi, your wounds.

334
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:57,219
-Hey!

335
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,146
-Are you all right?

336
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:09,246
-I was worried, Lord Ayakashi.

337
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,279
Please rest.

338
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,012
I'll stay here, and
heal your wounds.

339
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:17,012
These and any future ones.

340
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:21,446
-Coexistence, it could
happen with this ayakashi.

341
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,079
[laughter]

342
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:28,479
-It was a complete victory.

343
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:30,346
-The Nura Clan's invincible!

344
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,346
-Invincible!

345
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:35,279
-No holds barred
tonight, right, Gyuki?

346
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:40,079
-Even if it takes generations
to do, I'll get his kiss.

347
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:42,246
-This princess seems
to fancy me now.

348
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,612
-You're a suave one, Hitotsume.

349
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,579
-What-- what is all this?

350
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:49,546
-Thanks for hosting!

351
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,979
-Hey, get over here!

352
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,212
-Let's make some room
for the loser brother.

353
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,779
-This is the Keikain
Clan's main estate!

354
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,546
Why are Yokai here?!

355
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:00,379
-You won't be popular
if you're grumpy.

356
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:01,779
-Yeah.

357
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:02,279
-Hidemoto!

358
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:06,446
-I see.

359
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,046
So you're going back.

360
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,946
-Unlike that female fox, I'm
not interested in this land.

361
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,279
I've got the title I wanted
now, so I'm going back to Edo.

362
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,346
-I'm thinking of
trying something.

363
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,946
If it succeeds, it'll
be a strong barrier.

364
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,246
Even Hagoromo
Gitsune wouldn't be

365
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,212
able to a thing for 400 years.

366
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,579
Still, I'll be dead
and gone in 50 years,

367
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:36,079
so that isn't really my concern.

368
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:37,979
-50 years, huh?

369
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:40,779
A humans life isn't that long.

370
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,946
This could be the
last time we meet.

371
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,646
-Who knows?

372
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,712
I may become a Hagun,
and see you someday.

373
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:51,946
I wonder how powerful
he'll become.

374
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,946
Shame I won't be
around to see it.

375
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:58,812
-All right.

376
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:00,646
-Supreme Commander!

377
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:02,079
-What took you so long?

378
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,179
-Help me, Lord Ayakashi.

379
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:06,279
-All right, guys.

380
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:08,412
We're all done with Kyoto.

381
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:10,146
So gather around behind me.

382
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,379
We're going home.

383
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,879
[cheering]

384
00:22:17,153 --> 00:23:58,720
[theme music]

385
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:02,253
-Without power, you're
stuck here until you die.

386
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,753
-I need to know.

387
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:07,987
Hagoromo Gitsune's
in Kyoto, isn't she?
