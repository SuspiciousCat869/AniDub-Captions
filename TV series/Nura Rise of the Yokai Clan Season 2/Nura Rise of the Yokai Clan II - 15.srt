00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:24,158
>> HUH? WHAT THE HELL?

174
00:09:24,158 --> 00:09:26,124
SO YOU’RE A NICE YOKAI, HUH?

175
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:28,291
MY PIPE’S NOT COMING OUT.

176
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,224
>> YOU BASTARD!

177
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,191
>> DON’T BUTT IN!

178
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:35,358
YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT

179
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,958
FOR YOUR TURN!

180
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:43,724
NEXT IS YOU RIGHT THERE!

181
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,558
>> RYUJI, GO AND RETRIEVE

182
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:47,758
NENEKIRIMARU WHILE YOU CAN.

183
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,924
>> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

184
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,924
>> IN CASE THE WORST HAPPENS.

185
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,324
IS THAT CLEAR, RYUJI?

186
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:57,458
YOU MUST FLEE.

187
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,124
>> NURA!

188
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:05,358
>> NEXT WILL BE YOU, THE GIRL.

189
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:08,891
>> OIKAWA?

190
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:11,224
FOR OUR MASTER...

191
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:23,591
>> WHAT THE--

192
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:43,491
>> MASTER!

193
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,358
THANK GOODNESS

194
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,624
YOU’RE STILL ALIVE.

195
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:48,758
I THOUGHT HE’D DESTROYED YOU.

196
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:51,991
I’M RELIEVED, SO RELIEVED,

197
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,991
BECAUSE I CAN’T KEEP

198
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:59,524
PROTECTING YOU.

199
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,458
>> LOOK AT THIS, HUH?

200
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,458
I CAN’T BELIEVE

201
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,791
THAT YOU’RE STILL ALIVE.

202
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,458
>> YOU’LL HAVE TO DO BETTER

203
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,291
THAN THAT TO KILL ME.

204
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:24,358
THESE GUYS FOLLOW ME AND

205
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:25,724
THEY’VE PLEDGED THEIR LOYALTY

206
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,424
TO ME AND MY FEAR.

207
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:30,624
AS LONG AS I’M ALIVE, I WON’T

208
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,724
LET YOU LAY A HAND ON THEM!

209
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,724
IF YOU WANT TO DESTROY THIS

210
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,724
NIGHT PARADE, THEN YOU’LL HAVE

211
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:46,658
TO KILL ME FIRST, BASTARD!

212
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:56,324
>> HE GOT ALL OF YOU?

213
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:57,791
DAMN IT!

214
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,124
HE’LL PAY FOR THIS!

215
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:01,291
>> WHAT IS THIS?

216
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,891
>> HE’LL PAY FOR THIS.

217
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,424
HE’S NOT GONNA TOUCH YOU.

218
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,991
>> RIKUO.

219
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:12,258
>> MY HUNDRED DEMONS!

220
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:13,591
>> MASTER?

221
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:15,291
>> HE’S STARTING TO CHANGE BACK?

222
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,458
>> THE SEAL.

223
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,258
THE YOKAI AURA HERE IS FADING.

224
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:19,958
>> OH, NO!

225
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,591
NURA, YOU CAN’T FIGHT HIM

226
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:22,591
LIKE THAT!

227
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,858
GET BACK! NURA!

228
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:36,948
>> AAH!

229
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,848
>> YOKAI BATTLES ARE ALL ABOUT

230
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,248
FEAR, BUT THIS THING

231
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:41,681
DOESN’T FEAR ANYTHING.

232
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:42,781
HE CAN DESTROY A NIGHT PARADE

233
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:43,781
HIMSELF.

234
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:49,281
>> STOP IT, RIKUO!

235
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,048
>> HUH?

236
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:00,648
>> MASTER RIKUO!

237
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:03,648
>> OH, WOW! HE ACTUALLY CUT HIM!

238
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:04,948
>> HUH?

239
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,581
>> THE NENEKIRIMARU.

240
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:09,248
NOW WATCH CLOSELY, YOU TWO.

241
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,148
THAT’S NENEKIRIMARU.

242
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:13,681
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

243
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,314
>> MASTER RIKUO!

244
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:20,814
HIS TECHNIQUE STARTED WORKING

245
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:21,814
ON HIM?

246
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,248
>> I’VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

247
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:26,848
HIS TWO FORMS ARE OVERLAPPING.

248
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,914
>> AAH!

249
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:34,614
>> DON’T GET COCKY!

250
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,014
>> THE COMMANDER IS FACING

251
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,814
A RELENTLESS ONSLAUGHT.

252
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:40,048
IF HE LOSES, HIS HUNDRED DEMONS

253
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,548
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CALL FORTH

254
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,114
THEIR POWER NO MATTER HOW

255
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,081
EXCEPTIONAL THEY ARE.

256
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,014
TSUCHI-GUMO’S FEAR...

257
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:52,848
>> AAH!

258
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,048
>> WILL DESTROY

259
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:57,281
THEIR NIGHT PARADE.

260
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,948
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

261
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:00,448
YOU AREN’T JOKING, ARE YOU?

262
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:03,348
>> NO, SO DON’T WORRY.

263
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:05,581
I MADE SURE TO SEND SOMEBODY

264
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,348
THAT I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH IN.

265
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,348
>> I GUESS YOU ARE

266
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,581
A DOTING GRANDFATHER.

267
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,614
>> HA! HE WOULDN’T TAKE NO

268
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,248
FOR AN ANSWER.

269
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,614
>> HUH.

270
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:29,714
I’M DONE.

271
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,681
THIS IS BORING.

272
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,214
I WONDER IF I’LL BE ABLE

273
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:34,414
TO FIND MORE PREY

274
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,581
TO ENJOY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

275
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,748
>> MASTER?

276
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:42,714
>> RIKUO?

277
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,481
>> I’M NOT GONNA LOSE.

278
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,814
NOT HERE.

279
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:48,948
>> WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOU?

280
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:53,848
WHY DON’T YOU JUST DIE?

281
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:55,081
>> MASTER?

282
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,081
>> PLEASE DON’T STAND UP.

283
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,481
>> NO, I HAVE TO

284
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:03,681
BECAUSE I’M THE COMMANDER.

285
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,381
>> IT LOOKS LIKE I DIDN’T

286
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,081
DESTROY HIS HUNDRED DEMONS

287
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:10,748
JUST YET.

288
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:12,814
INTERESTING.

289
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:18,714
YOU KNOW, YOU’RE PRETTY GOOD.

290
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,548
I’LL BE ABLE TO KILL

291
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:25,814
SOME TIME WITH YOU.

292
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:28,748
>> HEY, GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!

293
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:29,748
>> I’LL HANG OUT

294
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,581
AT SOKOKUJI TEMPLE.

295
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,781
BE THERE AND BRING THOSE

296
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,748
HUNDRED DEMONS OF YOURS.

297
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,581
>> WAIT! HOLD ON! COME BACK!

298
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:42,081
TSUCHI-GUMO!

299
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,648
TSUCHI-GUMO!

300
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:47,614
TSUCHI-GUMO!

301
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,648
>> WHERE ARE WE?

302
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:58,248
>> IS THIS THE PLACE, MY LADY?

303
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,548
>> YES. I WILL BEAR MY CHILD

304
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,581
HERE.

305
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,548
HOW I’VE WAITED

306
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,681
AND AFTER OVER A MILLENNIA.

307
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,414
>> MY LADY?

308
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:17,048
>> COME BACK! IT’S DANGEROUS!

309
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:22,381
>> I’LL BE FINE, KYOKOTSU.

310
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,581
>> IT’S SO DARK.

311
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,581
>> KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF IT!

312
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:27,581
>> HUH?

313
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:29,248
>> IT’S BLACK FOR A REASON.

314
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:31,248
ALL THE HATRED IN KYOTO

315
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:32,714
WAS RELEASED WHEN THE SEALS

316
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:34,514
WERE BROKEN AND IT HAS DYED

317
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,281
THIS LAKE’S WATERS.

318
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,848
AND ALSO, THIS IS WHERE

319
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:40,414
OUR LADY GAVE BIRTH

320
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:42,048
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

321
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,314
NUEGAIKE POND, IT’S CALLED.

322
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:46,048
DARKNESS SURROUNDS IT.

323
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,614
IT’S WHERE NUE WILL BE BORN.

324
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:55,214
>> LORD ZEN, PLEASE, THIS WAY!

325
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,448
>> OVER HERE! WE NEED YOU HERE!

326
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:58,448
>> DAMN IT!

327
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,781
I HEARD YOU ALREADY, SO QUIT

328
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,281
CALLING FOR ME ALL AT ONCE!

329
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,514
JUST TAKE ALL THE CRITICALLY

330
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:05,281
WOUNDED TO THE TREASURE SHIP.

331
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,948
>> THAT WAS WEIRD.

332
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,348
I USUALLY HAVE MORE STRENGTH

333
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:09,348
THAN THAT.

334
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:10,948
>> IT WAS LIKE I DIDN’T HAVE

335
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,081
ANY POWER.

336
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,714
>> HOW IS RIKUO?

337
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,081
WITH THAT TERRIBLE BEATING

338
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,181
HE TOOK, IT’S AMAZING

339
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:23,981
THAT HE’S STILL ALIVE.

340
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:26,281
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

341
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,714
MAYBE WE JUMPED INTO THIS

342
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,814
