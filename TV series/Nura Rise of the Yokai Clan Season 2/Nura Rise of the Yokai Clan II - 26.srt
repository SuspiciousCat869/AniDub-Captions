RESURRECTION AS NUE.

346
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,150
RIKUO AND HIS NIGHT PARADE

347
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,316
WERE ABLE TO DRIVE HIM

348
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,850
OFF FOR NOW,

349
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,883
BUT ANOTHER BATTLE

350
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:03,416
IS SURE TO BE COMING SOON.

351
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,350
UNTIL THAT TIME COMES,

352
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,916
RIKUO NURA, HIS HUNDRED DEMONS,

353
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,650
THE KEIKAIN ONMYOJI,

354
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,490
YURA AND I MUST BE PREPARED.
