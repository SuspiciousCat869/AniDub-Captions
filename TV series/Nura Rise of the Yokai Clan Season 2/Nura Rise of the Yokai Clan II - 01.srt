1
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,300
RIHAN (VOICEOVER):
Seven-fold, eight-fold,

2
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,566
the Yamabuki rose blooms.

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,100
But not a single fruit it bears.

4
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:44,833
Such sadness.

5
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,944
[scream]

6
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:56,522
[scream]

7
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:00,147
-Yuki Onna, what's wrong?

8
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,772
-Aotabo!

9
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,705
Kurotabo!

10
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,672
-What the hell's going on here?

11
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,405
-Huh?

12
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,405
-Wha--?

13
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,339
-I did it.

14
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:16,272
That went totally--

15
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:17,205
-Master!

16
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,239
-You're like the
Supreme Commander.

17
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,772
Your pranks go too far.

18
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:21,972
AOTABO AND KUROTABO: Master!

19
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,843
-Hey, is somebody going
to get me down or what?

20
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:30,939
NARRATOR: Rikuo Nura, age eight.

21
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:32,305
-That's very funny.

22
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:35,472
A yokai should never let
others get the drop on them.

23
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,172
-Hey, grandpa, does that
mean I can have the title?

24
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,905
I want to be Third Heir.

25
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,672
-Hm, wait a little longer.

26
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,005
-Longer?

27
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,172
-Maybe when you're a little
older and more like a yokai.

28
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:48,939
-Really?

29
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,339
I'll do my best.

30
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:53,739
I'll work hard so I can become
a great yokai leader like you.

31
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:55,072
NURARIHYON: Ha, ha, ha.

32
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,972
That's my boy.

33
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:02,705
-You know, I wonder if
yokai are that strong.

34
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,172
The ones at our house sure
don't look that way to me.

35
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:06,839
-What are you saying to me?

36
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:08,772
Don't you know about
my younger days?

37
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,072
-Tell me again, grandpa.

38
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,572
I love hearing about it.

39
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:16,439
-I had 100 yokai under me,
and did amazing things night

40
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:17,405
after night.

41
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,372
I was feared by
humans and revered

42
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,805
by yokai as the
Supreme Commander.

43
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,405
When people talk about the Lord
of the Night, they mean me.

44
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,272
-Awesome.

45
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,405
You're the coolest grandpa ever.

46
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,905
-All right then, Rikuo.

47
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,605
I'll show you some
more of my yokai magic.

48
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,105
-Mhm.

49
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:37,739
-Huh?

50
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,372
Weren't there customers here?

51
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,739
-Hm?

52
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:41,305
WAITER: Ah!

53
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:42,005
They punked us!

54
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,872
It's a dine and dash!

55
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,605
-This is a spell that
lets you eat for free.

56
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,872
-You're so cool, grandpa.

57
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,072
-Master.

58
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:55,905
-Master Rikuo.

59
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,572
ALL: Good morning to you, sir.

60
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,305
-Morning.

61
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,572
Out of the way, guys.

62
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:00,939
I'm going to be late.

63
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:04,639
[chatter]

64
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:06,205
I'll see you guys later.

65
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,305
ALL: Have a good day.

66
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:11,905
-Please be careful
out there, Master.

67
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,139
-I've got to hand it to him.

68
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,239
He really got us good yesterday.

69
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:18,072
-He's been going overboard with
the pranks the last few days.

70
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:19,372
KUBINASHI: That's a good thing.

71
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:20,572
-Huh?

72
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,872
-You should be happy to
see him so full of energy.

73
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:26,172
-Come on, don't act like
he didn't get you good too.

74
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:26,672
-Aotabo.

75
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:31,072
-Wah!

76
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,272
-Let's not talk about that, OK?

77
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:33,805
-Hey.

78
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,305
-Hold on.

79
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:43,072
-Hey, Kana.

80
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,205
-You're late, Rikuo.

81
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,772
The bus almost left without you.

82
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,472
-Sorry, it was the guys.

83
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,239
-The guys?

84
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:54,505
-That's right.

85
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,572
You ought to stop by and
visit one of these days, Kana.

86
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:57,439
You'd like everyone.

87
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:58,839
-I don't want to.

88
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:01,372
Your place kind of looks like a
haunted house from the outside.

89
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:02,272
To me

90
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:04,505
RIKUO: Really?

91
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,439
[starting gun]

92
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,639
TEACHER: 6.9 seconds.

93
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:13,372
-No way.

94
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,505
I lost again.

95
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,072
-We all lost to Nura.

96
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,205
You really have gotten
fast lately, Nura.

97
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,072
-I don't see any
difference between us.

98
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,272
It's not fair.

99
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:23,839
-Of course there's a difference.

100
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:26,739
My grandpa's the Supreme
Commander of the yokai.

101
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:29,105
ALL: The yokai?

102
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,639
-And so that's how the handsome
onmyoji swordsman defeated

103
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:34,705
the fearsome
child-devouring yokai.

104
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,805
And the shrine
built in his honor

105
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,772
is what's known today
as the Aratama Shrine.

106
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:40,772
The end.

107
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:41,772
CLASS: Oh.

108
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:42,772
-Hold on.

109
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,272
CLASS: Huh?

110
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:47,505
-Doesn't that story sound a
little bit strange to anyone?

111
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,605
[chatter]

112
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,372
-Huh?

113
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,905
What do you mean exactly?

114
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,872
-It's just-- it's just the yokai
should have been the good guys.

115
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:57,772
-Huh?

116
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:58,305
-What?

117
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,539
-What's that?

118
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:01,939
-Sure, they can kind of
be screw ups sometimes.

119
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:04,205
But Aotabo's strong,
and Yuki Onna's

120
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,372
a good cook even though
her food's always cold.

121
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,039
-What are you
talking about, Nura?

122
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:09,939
-He gets like this.

123
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:11,839
He'll say weird
things sometimes.

124
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,305
-So you're saying
there's something

125
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,672
wrong with Kiyotsugu's
report, is that it?

126
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,272
-Yeah, there is.

127
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:18,405
I know.

128
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,805
My grandpa's the Supreme
Commander of the yokai.

129
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,572
-Rikuo.

130
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:25,005
-Oh, then I guess that
means your grandpa has

131
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,339
to be Nurarihyon.

132
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,672
-Yeah, that's him all right.

133
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,372
You really know your stuff.

134
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,005
-Of course I know about him.

135
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,905
Nurarihyon's very well known.

136
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:34,372
He likes to go
into people's homes

137
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:36,272
and eat his fill
of all their food.

138
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:37,772
And then after he's
done that, he'll

139
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,239
go out of his way to purposely
make trouble for them.

140
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:44,339
He's the pettiest yokai ever.

141
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:46,072
-Gee, sounds pretty lame to me.

142
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,972
-Unbelievable.

143
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,439
-But don't worry, everyone.

144
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:53,272
Yokai are just fairy tales that
people made up a long time ago.

145
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:54,639
They don't really exist.

146
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:55,439
Hah.

147
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:56,639
NATSUMI: Yeah, that's true.

148
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:59,139
SAORI: It'd be scary if
they really did exist.

149
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,039
-Wait, hold on a minute.

150
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,939
You know, my house is full of--

151
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,239
-What's your problem, Nura?

152
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:05,205
Just let it go.

153
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,139
-There are no such
things as yokai.

154
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:10,805
-But I'm not lying.

155
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,639
-Moving on now.

156
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,305
Does anyone have any questions?

157
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,772
I'll be more than happy to
share all the little details

158
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:16,505
about my research.

159
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,172
-Hm?

160
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:28,539
What's wrong, Master.

161
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:30,505
You look like you're
feeling kind of down.

162
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,005
-Yeah, it's nothing.

163
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,405
-There's going to be a meeting
with all the clan leaders

164
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,272
today.

165
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,372
You should cheer up.

166
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:37,172
-Huh?

167
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,739
A meeting with the leaders?

168
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,139
-The Supreme Commander
wants you to join as well.

169
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,972
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): These are
all of the top yokai in the Nura

170
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,039
Clan.

171
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:56,972
They all look so strong.

172
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:59,739
They're so cool.

173
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,339
[clears throat]

174
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,505
-I've asked all the leaders to
come here today for one reason.

175
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,672
I've decided that
it's finally time

176
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,505
to name the clan's Third Heir.

177
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,872
[gasping]

178
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,039
It's been three years.

179
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:32,105
It's about time I did this.

180
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,805
I'd like to name the Third
Heir, in other words,

181
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,772
our next Supreme Commander.

182
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:40,805
-I think that's a good idea.

183
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,572
After all, you've been out of
retirement this entire time.

184
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:45,839
It's hard, isn't it?

185
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:50,672
-There isn't a
single yokai who can

186
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:53,005
compete against
Lord Gagoze's evil.

187
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,339
-Not to mention the fact
that the Gagoze group has

188
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:58,872
been responsible for all of
the missing children this year.

189
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,239
GAGOZE: Not at all.

190
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,705
I consider sending children
to the depths of hell my duty.

191
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:04,705
It's nothing special.

192
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,139
-What did you say just now?

193
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:11,839
Missing children?

194
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:13,305
You're saying you killed them?

195
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:14,239
-That's right.

196
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,939
And quite a few too.

197
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,639
-Evil's name is Lord Gagoze.

198
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,439
-He's such a paragon
of yokai virtue.

199
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:24,372
-That's nothing.

200
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,705
I started the fire
in Aratama Town.

201
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:27,472
-No way.

202
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:28,272
No way.

203
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,672
I don't believe it.

204
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,972
[clears throat]

205
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,072
-I see.

206
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:42,272
It sounds to me like you're
as active as ever, Gagoze.

207
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:43,872
-But grandpa--

208
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:44,705
-Yes.

209
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,839
You can leave everything to me.

210
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:50,239
-Even so, you're
not right for this.

211
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:52,972
-Huh?

212
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:56,372
-I was thinking
for our Third Heir,

213
00:09:56,405 --> 00:10:00,705
that I'd name my
grandson Rikuo here.

214
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:01,505
-What's that?

215
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,205
-You're naming Master Rikuo?

216
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,339
-But he's still a child.

217
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:07,805
-He may have your
blood, but still--

218
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,805
GAGOZE (VOICEOVER): Is
he really choosing a brat

219
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,705
like that over me?

220
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,839
-What's the matter, Gagoze?

221
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,605
You don't look well.

222
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,339
-I'm just fine, I assure you.

223
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:20,939
-Hey, grandpa.

224
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:21,905
-Now what's wrong?

225
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,272
I thought you'd be happy.

226
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,072
You wanted this, didn't you?

227
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,039
-Huh?

228
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,505
-As my grandson,
you have the right.

229
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:32,472
In the end, you do take after
me, and everybody sitting here

230
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:33,905
knows it.

231
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,639
Come on, we're going
to put it to a vote.

232
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,605
Rikuo, I'm letting
you take over.

233
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,239
-No, grandpa.

234
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:48,505
-72 organizations
comprised of 10,000 yokai.

235
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,905
-I don't want--

236
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:54,539
-All of them will be under
your comman starting now.

237
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:55,372
-No!

238
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,372
[gasping]

239
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,105
I don't want this.

240
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,705
If I spend more time with
them, my friends at school

241
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,972
are going to hate me even more!

242
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:05,905
I never knew this 'til now.

243
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,839
I never knew how all the
yokai were such bad guys!

244
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:10,539
I'm not like you, grandpa!

245
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,239
I'm not like you at all!

246
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:12,805
-Huh?

247
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,939
What?

248
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,172
Wait, you Rikuo!

249
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:19,539
-Supreme Commander,
pardon my insolence,

250
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:23,505
but is Master Rikuo
really your grandson?

251
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:24,905
-Hm?

252
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:27,705
-I'm not only referring to his
appearance, but also the fact

253
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,805
that he seems to think
just like a human.

254
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,172
-It's quite a shame.

255
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,139
It seems the Young
Master would rather

256
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:37,472
be playing games like
other children his age.

wrong, yokai boy?

Aren't you getting on?

-Don't give him any ideas.

261
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,997
If he gets on, we might
get attacked by yokai.

KIYOTSUGU: True enough.

-Jeez, what the heck are
you moping around for?

If you miss that bus, it'll be
30 minutes 'til the next one.

266
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,530
Just ignore them and get on.

267
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:07,597
-I'm fine.

268
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,830
And anyway, I don't
have the right

269
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,063
to ride the bus with them.

270
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,997
-Why not?

271
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,397
-Because I'm ashamed.

272
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,130
-Ashamed of what?

273
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:22,230
-I thought yokai were a lot
cooler than they really are.

274
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:27,197
But the truth is they're always
going around doing evil things.

275
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,863
They're nothing like
heroes, none of them.

276
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:32,630
And me, I've been trying
to be like my grandpa,

277
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:35,430
and he's the one who's
in charge of them all.

278
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,963
I'm so ashamed.

279
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:39,397
-I don't really get
it, but just become

280
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,630
someone you can be proud of.

00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:42,097
-Huh?

-All you have to do is
become a good person.

283

One who can show them the way.

Let's go.

The bus is going to leave.

-That's OK.

290
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:57,830
I feel like walking home.

-You know, Rikuo, I
really don't think

292
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,830
you should say that your
grandpa's a yokai anymore.

-What?

294
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:06,263
That means you didn't
believe anything I said.

-Scares you?

-I'd believe it if
you showed me some,

299
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,797
but I'd rather not
see any at all.

RIKUO (VOICEOVER): People really
do hate yokai, don't they?

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,830
That's it.

302
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:24,730
I'll never talk
about them again.

303
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:30,697
-Honestly, I came looking
for you out of concern

304
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,697
since you were late.

305
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,830
But to think you
intended to walk back.

306
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,830
You'll have to have
escorts from now on.

307
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:41,497
-Karasu Tengu, um, that is--
do you know whether I'm a human

308
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,197
or not?

309
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,763
-What?

310
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:44,097
I suppose so.

311
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,730
After all, both your mother
and grandmother are human.

312
00:13:46,763 --> 00:13:48,163
-They are, aren't they?

313
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,063
-But at the same time,
a quarter of your blood

314
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,330
does come from the
Supreme Commander too.

315
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,697
-A-- a quarter of my blood?

316

-Oh look, the Master's back.

-Master, you're safe.

-The news.

320
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,097
Just look.

REPORTER (ON TV): We're
here live at the site

in the tunnel near Ukiyoe Town.

-Oh, Rikuo, you're home?

325
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:18,339
It's a lucky thing you
didn't take that bus.

-That bus they're
showing, is Kana on it?

-Hm?

328
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:23,506
-She needs help.

329
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,673
-Where are you going?

330
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:27,606
-The only place that matters.

331
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,173
I'm going out to save Kana.

332
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:31,873
Ao, Kuro, guys.

333
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:32,506
-Right.

334
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,106
-Just one minute.

335
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,339
I think not.

336
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:38,073
For you to leave and go
help humans is preposterous.

337
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:38,606
-What?

338
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,039
Why's that?

339
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,039
-Remember what our emblem is.

340
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,206
Our clan is about Fear.

341
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:47,406
We yokai are supposed to
inspire fear in humans.

342
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,839
Yet you wish to go help them?

343
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:51,639
It's absurd.

344
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,106
This is the home base
for this area's yokai.

345
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,639
We're the Nura Clan.

346
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:58,439
I won't allow the
Hundred Demons to be

347
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:02,306
commandeered on a human's whim.

348
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,439
-I think talking like that is
crossing the line a little,

349
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:06,206
don't you?

350
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,073
-You brute.

351
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,806
Do you have any idea who I am?

352
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,473
-Yeah, Lord Daruma,
our General Council.

353
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:11,039
-Aotabo.

354
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:12,273
-Hey, calm down.

355
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:13,473
-Aotabo, stop.

356
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:14,406
AOTABO: Shut up.

357
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,106
Didn't what he say
bother you too?

358
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,739
TSURARA: But Ao, if
you keep this up--

359
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:18,439
AOTABO: What?

360
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:19,273
What's going to happen?

361
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:20,473
TSURARA: Come on, Ao.

362
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:21,306
Would you calm down?

363
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:22,573
-How can I after that?

364
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:25,439
[arguing]

365
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:32,139
-Would you all stop it?

366
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:32,639
-Huh?

367
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:42,206
-I don't have time for this.

368
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,706
-Yes, sir.

369
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:44,706
-Master?

370
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,706
-I've never seen him like this.

371
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,539
What's going on?

372
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,806
-Listen, all of you.

373
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,439
-Master?

374
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,339
-Master's changing.

375
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,273
-I get it.

376
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:59,206
You're telling me that
being human is the problem.

377
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,406
But if I'm a yokai, you'll
follow me without question,

378
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,106
right?

379
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,873
If that's what you're
saying, then I'll

380
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:07,473
quit being human right now!

381
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,039
Something feels different.

382
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,339
My blood is boiling.

383
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:23,939
-That would be your yokai
blood, Master Rikuo.

384
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:25,406
-My yokai blood?

385
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,706
-Yes, your grandfather's.

386
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:31,539
A quarter of your blood comes
from the Supreme Commander.

387
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,539
It's not a lot,
but it means you've

388
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:35,606
got every right to
lead us, Master Rikuo.

389
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,673
-What are those guys?

390
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,106
-Could those things be yokai?

391
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,473
-That can't be.

392
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:50,206
Right, Kiyotsugu?

393
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,973
-Where is the Master?

394
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:59,173
-Well, he's undoubtedly
inside there somewhere.

395
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,773
In any case, we're going
to kill every living thing

396
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,973
down here, right
along with the Master.

397
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,139
[screaming]

398
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,073
-That's good, children.

399
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:17,206
Tremble with fear as we
devour your flesh, your skin,

400
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,673
your bones.

401
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,506
We'll feast upon it all and then
send you on your way to hell!

402
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:23,973
[screaming]

403
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:36,206
RIKUO: So killing kids
makes you a big shot?

404
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,139
-Who's there?

405
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,606
RIKUO: Gagoze, if
your whole plan

406
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:42,639
was to take over as the
Third Heir by killing me,

407
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:46,239
then I have to tell you--
you're one petty yokai.

408
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,973
-No, it can't be.

409
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,906
-Hmph.

410
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,339
-I don't believe it.

411
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,106
Kill him.

412
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,973
Kill the Master at once.

413
00:17:57,006 --> 00:18:00,806
And kill those worthless
fools in the main family too.

414
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,673
Annihilate them all!

415
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:07,073
KUBINASHI: You won't
get a step closer.

416
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,873
It'll only get tighter.

417
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:19,006
-It'll take more than
that to bring down

418
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,206
Aotabo, the Strike Team leader.

419
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:27,473
-Let me remind you that you're
not the only Strike Team

420
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,273
leader here.

421
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,639
-I-- I don't believe it.

422
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,573
My clan is down.

423
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,639
My invincible army that's
killed countless others.

424
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,239
[screaming]

425
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:04,006
-Don't come any closer
or I'll kill them all.

426
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,939
If you want them alive, then--

427
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,839
[screaming]

428
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,139
-Master!

429
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,273
-Why?

430
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,506
Why a brat like you?

431
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,839
How am I not worthy?

432
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:22,773
In the entire clan,
I'm the most feared.

433
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:25,573
RIKUO: A yokai that
devours children--

434
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,073
that's scary all right.

435
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:31,206
However, I won't let a
yokai who takes pleasure

436
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:34,206
in killing the weak ever
become the Lord of the Night.

437
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,106
Not while I'm around.

438
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,606
I'll be the one who
will lead the clan.

439
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,439
And I will become
the Third Heir.

440
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:48,206
Anyone who tries to hurt humans
is going to answer to me.

441
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,073
-Master.

442
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,073
-Master.

443
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,006
-All the world's
yokai will know this.

444
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,639
I'll become the
Lord of Pandemonium.

445
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:03,273
All yokai will fall
under my command,

446
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:06,373
in my Night Parade
of a Hundred Demons.

447
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,839
-Whoa, holy cow.

448
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,806
-So cool.

449
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,339
-Those were yokai.

450
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,973
They really do exist.

451
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,373
-I, Daruma, thought I knew this.

452
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:20,173
But have now realized what
a Lord of the Night is.

453
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:24,639
It is one who evokes
all, even among humans.

454
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,406
One who wears the
true mantle of Fear.

455
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,073
-Master!

456
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,406
Are you all right there, Master?

457
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:41,439
[scream] The Master's
turned back into a human.

458
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,239
NARRATOR: Four years later.

459
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:47,239
KARASU TENGU: All right.

460
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:48,739
Did all of you get one?

461
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:51,073
-Wow, all of them match?

462
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:53,939
AOTABO: I think this
is pretty awesome.

463
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:55,939
-They're getting
rather cocky out there,

464
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,706
the whole sorry lot of them.

465
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,139
Just because they performed
well against the Shikoku yokai.

466
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,073
-They needed something
to strengthen their bond

467
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:04,706
so they wouldn't get anxious.

468
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:08,206
It's been four years now
since he first awakened.

469
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:10,139
Even now, the Master
can only change

470
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:11,906
into a yokai for a short time.

471
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,406
-That's true.

472
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,006
A fool like that can't
possibly become the Third Heir.

473
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,673
-The most important thing for
a yokai is to gather Fear.

474
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:25,373
The Nura Clan's
influence is nothing

475
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,539
like it was long ago when
we were called the Night

476
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:29,473
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

477
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:29,973
However--

478
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:38,039
-OK, I got it, Kiyotsugu.

479
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:40,273
See you tomorrow.

480
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,173
A yokai on a samurai estate.

481
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:47,773
Sounds like it could
be interesting.

482
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,439
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): Yokai
will no longer run rampant,

483
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,639
not while I'm around to
keep an eye on things.

484
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:56,139
I will rebuild the Nura
Clan's Night Parade

485
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:57,739
of a Hundred Demons.

486
00:21:57,773 --> 00:21:59,773
I'll see for myself
whether or not

487
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,706
this new yokai has what it
takes to join my Night Parade.

488
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,839
NARRATOR: The Young
