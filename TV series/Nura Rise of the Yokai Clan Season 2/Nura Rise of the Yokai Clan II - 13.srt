[theme music]

2
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,908
YURA (VOICEOVER): My
name is Yura Keikain.

3
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:52,975
I'm a descendant
of the Keikain Clan

4
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:56,708
of onmyoji, who
hunt yokai in Kyoto.

5
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,608
As part of my training
to destroy yokai

6
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:02,775
I was sent to Ukiyoe
Town, a place known

7
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,142
for the supernatural.

8
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:09,708
But things didn't go the
way I hoped, not at all.

9
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:13,242
And worse, a guy who's the
leader of a hundred demons

10
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:17,642
saved my life, and twice too.

11
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:19,775
Saved by someone I'm
supposed to defeat.

12
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,342
It was around that time that
Ryuji Keikain, my brother,

13
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,342
showed up.

14
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,975
-What brings you this
town, big brother?

15
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,342
-Ryuji.

16
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,975
-There's only one
thing that brought us,

17
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,942
what onmyoji do-- destroy yokai.

18
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:47,475
-Look out!

19
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:50,575
Just what do you
think you're doing?

20
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:53,075
YURA (VOICEOVER): And that's
when my brother suddenly said--

21
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:55,908
RYUJI: Don't tell me that
you can't see what he is.

22
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,875
YURA (VOICEOVER): Stop.

23
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:57,708
RYUJI: He's a yokai.

24
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,075
-Garo, devour.

25
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:10,808
YURA (VOICEOVER): There's no
way Nura could've been a yokai.

26
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:15,242
Even if it was my big
brother, I didn't listen.

27
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:18,542
-What do you think
you're doing, Yura?

28
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,975
-Nura.

29
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:28,275
You-- you are a human, right?

30
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,875
-Ms. Keikain.

31
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:32,142
I am.

32
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,808
I'm human.

33
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:34,308
-Right.

34
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,808
You heard him, big brother.

35
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:42,275
Nura isn't the enemy.

36
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:45,008
We've only known each
other for a short time,

37
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,742
but he's my friend.

38
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,442
He's not an enemy.

39
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:50,342
I will not destroy him.

40
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,008
-Yura.

41
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:59,842
-Rentei Shikigami Convert
Jinshiki Synthesis!

42
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,308
Vanish into the Abyss Yura Max!

43
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:11,475
-Yura, what's up with the
name of that technique?

44
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:14,875
Garo, devour.

45
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:17,208
-Tanro!

46
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:19,175
YURA (VOICEOVER): My
brother attacked me

47
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,208
with his water shikigami, Garo.

48
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,075
He was relentless.

49
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,675
-Ms Keikain!

50
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,742
What are you doing?

51
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:39,175
[screaming]

52
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,775
-I hope you've learned.

53
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:44,575
Manipulating your words
is also a good technique.

54
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,942
I can still forgive this.

55
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,808
If you want to live,
come back to us.

56
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,775
YURA (VOICEOVER):
At that moment,

57
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:56,142
that person showed up,
and saved me again.

58
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,942
It turned out he was Nura.

59
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:03,708
But how is it possible
for him to be a yokai?

60
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:06,108
-Not just any water.

61
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,375
Gyogen Konjosui Flower!

62
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,942
Gyogen Konjosui Formation.

63
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,442
YURA (VOICEOVER): Seeing my
brother trying to destroy yokai

64
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,142
was terrifying.

65
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:36,275
-Your words are full of lies.

66
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:46,275
-Big brother!

67
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,175
-Destroy.

68
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,542
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Then there's Mamiru,

69
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,208
who had a strange power.

70
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:59,608
-What'll I do?

71
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,275
-Isn't this Nenekirimaru,
an onmyoji sword

72
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:06,342
made to cut only yokai?

73
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,375
-Enough of this.

74
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,708
-Begone into darkness.

75
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:11,742
YURA: He'll destroy Nura.

76
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,675
-I'm only warning you once.

77
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,675
YURA (VOICEOVER): That's
when they showed up

78
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:27,175
on the battlefield, the
Lord of Pandemonium's Night

79
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,608
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

80
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:33,375
Those hundred demons
surrounded that yokai,

81
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,408
who turned out to be Nura.

82
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,408
-Hey, you.

83
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:37,875
Who are you?

84
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,708
-Master of the
yokai yakuza family,

85
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:45,575
the Nura Clan, Nurarihyon's
grandson, Rikuo Nura.

86
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:46,275
-Wait a minute.

87
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:48,142
You're Nurarihyon's--

88
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,542
-His grandson!?

89
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,142
YURA (VOICEOVER):
The reason my brother

90
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:54,842
came was to tell me to go
home, and to pass on the news

91
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,208
that the Keikain Clan's
mortal enemy was back--

92
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:02,842
Hagoromo Gitsune, leader
of the Kyoto yokai.

93
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,775
-Answer me, Nura.

94
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:10,642
Are you honestly a human,
or are you a yokai?

95
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:13,775
-I'm human during the
day, but not at night.

96
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,442
I'm yokai now.

97
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:18,008
-You are the same person though?

98
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:21,175
-You don't believe me?

99
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,542
-But if it was
you, who saved me?

100
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,275
I believe you.

101
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,375
Thanks for everything
you've done.

102
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:30,308
It was kind, Nura.

103
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:32,108
YURA (VOICEOVER): Legend
has it that it all

104
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:34,308
started 400 years ago.

105
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,642
-So beautiful.

106
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,808
Who would have thought
that a mournful look could

107
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:42,675
be so attractive
in the moonlight?

108
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:46,408
-A thief?

109
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:49,208
How did--

110
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:50,442
-It was true.

111
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,975
Like they said, a
drop-dead beauty.

112
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,342
-What?

113
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,008
-I want you, Princess Yo.

114
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:58,508
-No!

115
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:07,675
-I thought that you were
fragile, but you're pretty--

116
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,742
-Huh?

117
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:09,475
-Hold on.

118
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:10,608
That's a spirit blade?

119
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,875
-It stopped.

120
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,208
-Just what are you?

121
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:25,708
-Huh?

122
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,575
-There's no need to be afraid.

123
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:36,175
Resign Yourself.

124
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:41,875
-You're here.

125
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:55,542
-A yakuza.

126
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:01,208
-Get your hands
off my woman, now!

127
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:08,242
Agh!

128
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,442
Princess Yo!

129
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,808
-Can that ayakashi you're
interested in defeat

130
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:15,708
somebody like her?

131
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:18,442
-He has one thing, and
that's room for growth.

132
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,808
-Hidemoto.

133
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,508
-Shikigami Hagun,
cleanse the evil.

134
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:21,308
-I can't move!

135
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:22,308
Damn you!

136
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,742
You'll pay for this.

137
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,975
I swear that you'll pay!

138
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:34,608
A curse on you, a
curse, Nurarihyon!

139
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:37,375
Your children,
your grandchildren,

140
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:40,942
they'll all be bound
by this fox's curse!

141
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,075
YURA (VOICEOVER): Records
left by Koremitsu Keikain

142
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:46,842
say that Hagoromo Gitsune
and the Kyoto yokai

143
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,808
were driven out
thanks to our 13th

144
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:51,608
Heir, Hidemoto, who
later created the eight

145
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:55,008
seals that protect Kyoto today.

146
00:10:55,042 --> 00:11:00,042
His records also had a peculiar
message-- do not allow ayakashi

147
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:04,408
in the house, and do not feed
them, especially Nurarihyon.

148
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:05,742
There are no exceptions.

149
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:13,842
Even as I was
heading back, Gora,

150
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,908
who was guarding the
sixth seal, was killed.

151
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:31,708
And So was Uncle Haigo,
who guarded the fifth seal.

152
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:32,675
-Oh.

153
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,442
It seems I accidentally
killed him.

154
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:37,808
-Oh.

155
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:39,108
It's so shiny.

156
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:41,942
It's been 400 years
since we've been back.

157
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:44,975
Is it just me, or does
it look a lot newer now?

158
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,642
YURA (VOICEOVER): To defeat
Hagoromo Gitsune's Night Parade

159
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:50,742
of a Hundred Demons,
our best onmyoji,

160
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:54,508
Akifusa, Masatsugu, and
Pato stepped into battle.

161
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:57,242
-On this very night
inside these walls,

162
00:11:57,275 --> 00:12:01,508
you'll plummet into the darkness
again, you wretched fox.

163
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:05,475
-What an extravagant
golden gravestone.

164
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:11,008
However, onmyoji you shall
be the ones beneath it

165
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:11,875
-Haa!

166
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:12,908
Go forth, my shikigami!

167
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:18,842
Squeeze her flat like a pancake.

168
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:22,842
Yeah.

169
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,675
Keep it up.

170
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,308
Don't let that fox get away.

171
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:27,775
-Lady Hagoromo Gitsune!

172
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,908
[laughter]

173
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:47,618
-You're one to talk!

174
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,238
Go as your own kind.

175
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,477
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Meanwhile, my friends

176
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:54,140
came to visit Kyoto as it
was being overrun by yokai.

177
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,000
To save them, I found myself
ironically fighting side

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,500
by side with Yuki Onna.

179
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,433
-Become my strength, and
vanquish the darkness

180
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,066
before me!

181
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,333
YURA (VOICEOVER): Even
though I had no choice,

182
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,200
it was still humiliating!

183
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:18,133
-Why are they attacking
humans out in the open?

184
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,333
-This isn't a good
time to be Kyoto.

185
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:28,633
-Amazing.

186
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,900
-Yura, we have a duty
to protect Kyoto.

187
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,133
you understand, Yura?

188
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,266
it is the duty of those
who possess the gift.

189
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,433
YURA (VOICEOVER): He taught me
what it means to be an onmyoji.

190
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:41,700
-They're here!

191
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,966
YURA (VOICEOVER): The most
gifted of us all, Akifusa.

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,233
It was hard for me to believe
that Akifusa would betray us.

193
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,833
If the second seal at Sokokuji
Temple falls, it's over.

194
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,100
We're finished!

195
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:54,666
-Tell me.

196
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,800
What happened?

197
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,933
It's crazy.

198
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,000
We have to stop them.

199
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,166
They're yokai, right?

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,966
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Akifusa allowed our enemy

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,266
to latch on to the darkness in
his heartm and take control.

202
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,766
To defeat that enemy,
I had to use the jutsu

203
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,766
passed down to the
Keikain's gifted one--

204
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,166
the shikigami summon, Hagun.

205
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:23,533
-That's it.

206
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:27,166
Recite the words to
cleanse the evil.

207
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,566
RYUJI: Yura's abilities--

208
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,966
-Crush the demons.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,300
Cleanse the evil.

210
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,666
RYUJI: Are amplified to
their greatest limits.

211
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,666
-Do it.

212
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,633
-Hagun, go!

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,766
YURA (VOICEOVER): One
of the previous heads

214
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,000
who was summoned was none other
than Hidemoto, the 13th Heir.

215
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,200
-That's very good, Yura.

216
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,933
-You're saying that Kyoto has
being taken over by yokai?

217
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:07,000
-Any faith that we had in
the Keikain Clan is gone now.

218
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,333
-You'll protect Nijo
Castle though, right?

219
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,700
What happened to that great
prodigy seal you touted?

220
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,166
-Prodigy?

221
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,533
Who are you referring to?

222
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,833
Could it be me that
you're speaking of?

223
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,000
YURA (VOICEOVER): Even
after the jutsu was undone,

224
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:26,500
he didn't disappear
and just stuck around.

225
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:30,766
We managed to get to Akifusa,
Masatsugu, and Pato back,

226
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,466
but we were still forced
to retreat from the battle.

227
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,600
-Yokai live for
thousands of years.

228
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:40,866
It's unthinkable that humans
could ever defeat them.

229
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,533
Just let them have that castle.

230
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,333
However, they'll go on
the defensive from there.

231
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:54,233
Hagoromo Gitsune intends to give
birth to there at Nijo castle.

232
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:58,766
She will be at her most
vulnerable during that time.

233
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,333
Two key things are necessary
for her defeat-- one

234
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:06,466
is Hagun, in other
words, Yura here.

235
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,933
You'd best hold
her in high esteem.

236
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:12,366
-So Yura is our clan's one hope?

237
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,733
-And the second
thing that's needed

238
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,833
is a certain spirit blade.

239
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:17,700
It's called--

240
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,300
-Nenekirimaru.

241
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,400
And the current
owner of that blade

242
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,633
is the grandson of Nurarihyon.

243
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,966
-His grandson?

244
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,233
Is that a fact now?

245
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:35,033
-I'll go visit the Nura Clan.

246
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,066
-That won't be necessary.

247
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,566
-Who's this?

248
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,300
-She's a nobody!

249
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,933
Don't listen to
her, big brother!

250
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,333
What's the big idea?

251
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,766
Why did you come
here, Yuki Onna?

252
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,200
-Yura dear, who is she?

253
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,000
-No one special, honest.

254
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,600
-I'm one of the
Nura Clan's members.

255
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:54,300
-Shut up.

256
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,700
-The Nura Clan?

257
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,300
-You're coming with me.

258
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,666
YURA (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

259
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,600
my big brothers were using
my room to store their junk.

260
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:05,600
I wasn't gone that long.

261
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,800
-Is this a storage room?

262
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,433
-No, this is my room!

263
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,066
YURA (VOICEOVER): I didn't
know this until then,

264
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,166
but the one who defeated
Hagoromo Gitsune 400 years ago,

265
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,966
was Nurarihyon.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,633
I learned a few moments
later, that Nura

267
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,233
had trained in Tono
Village, so that he

268
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:27,833
could be ready to face
her, and that he had just

269
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:31,033
arrived in Kyoto, bringing
many of his trusted

270
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:34,466
allies along with him.

271
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,000
The Nura Clan's first Night
Parade in Kyoto in 400 years.

272
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,333
[theme music]

273
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,566
-You know, it's funny.

274
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,233
I just don't feel like I can
lose as long as I have you

275
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:01,300
with me, my Hundred Demons.

276
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,033
Let's get this show on the road.

277
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,600
YURA (VOICEOVER):
It's the Kyoto yokai

278
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:09,333
versus the Keikain
onmyoji and the Nura Clan.

279
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:12,200
Who's going to win
this epic battle?

280
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,200
It's time to go!

281
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:20,482
[theme music]

282
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,457
-If they get caught
up in his fear,

283
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:04,524
the Night Parade will
be torn to shreds.

284
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:08,257
-Am I-- am I going to die here?

285
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,057
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I'm here
to break that fox's curse.
