1
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,357
-I'm not your enemy, Jami.

2
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:43,866
Jami here was only
trying to protect you

3
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,246
from these bastards,
because you're

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,880
a direct descendant
of the master he

5
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:49,046
served when he was human.

6
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,313
-My my shikigami.

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,113
-Scum.

8
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:13,713
Impersonating a yokai.

9
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:14,746
What a joke.

10
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:24,580
[screaming]

11
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:25,813
Jami.

12
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:30,013
I could really use a
yokai like you around.

13
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:33,446
I will be the Lord
of Pandemonium.

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,180
I'm gathering my Night
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

15
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:38,680
-Lord of Pandemonium.

16
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:58,880
[theme music]

17
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:40,678
[sigh]

18
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,644
-We didn't get to
see a yokai again.

19
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:45,111
-Yokai or not, Shinako
still seemed grateful.

20
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:47,544
-And a lot more upbeat
than before too.

21
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:51,144
-She sure gave us a lot of
crabs to take back home.

22
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:54,478
-Shima, the legs are poking out.

23
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,511
-When the Kiyojuji
Paranormal Patrol shows up,

24
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:59,511
yokai know well
enough to steer clear.

25
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:00,711
-Steer clear, huh?

26
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:04,278
-All you did was
sleep in the hallway.

27
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,311
-Well, my eyes just
wouldn't stay open.

28
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:09,044
KANA (VOICEOVER): Kiyotsugu too?

29
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:11,078
I remember it got
cold last night

30
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,278
and then I just fell asleep.

31
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,011
Could that have been
the work of some yokai?

32
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:16,411
[giggle]

33
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:17,311
-Hold on.

34
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,911
What did you do to
them last night?

35
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:20,378
-You know, I've
been wondering why

36
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,044
Yura didn't tag along this time.

37
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:25,378
-Yeah, she is our lovely
neighborhood onmyoji.

38
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:27,978
-I wasn't able to get
in touch with her,

39
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:30,178
and she hasn't been
to school lately.

40
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:30,811
-Really?

41
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:31,444
I hadn't noticed.

42
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,511
-Jinchiki Synthesis!

43
00:04:58,311 --> 00:04:59,378
-Hey, Kuro.

44
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:01,478
Let's hit one more bar.

45
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,544
-Sure, we can do one more.

46
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,811
-Just two for tonight?

47
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,011
-Yep.

48
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,878
-But I'll have to warn
you that all our girls are

49
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,344
too busy right now to
keep you two company.

50
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:12,844
-Huh?

51
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,244
Too busy?

52
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:17,278
-Yeah, we have some big shots
from the Nura Clan Strike Team

53
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:17,911
here today.

54
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:18,911
-Did you just say--

55
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,678
-The Nura Clan Strike Team?

56
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,911
-Yo, bring on the sake!

57
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:27,211
-Hey, hey.

58
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,211
I'm the famous Aotabo, and
I want to squeeze your jugs.

59
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:31,378
-No!

60
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,278
Well, OK.

61
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:34,211
-Kurotabo, at your service.

62
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,844
-You're cool, just like
all the rumors said.

63
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,178
Could you sign my chest?

64
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:38,944
-Be happy to.

65
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:40,111
[grumble]

66
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:40,811
-No way.

67
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,411
Are those two really--?

68
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,344
-Yep, it's Aotabo and Kurotabo.

69
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,044
GIRL 1: They say Aotabo is
the most powerful member

70
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,511
of the Nura Clan.

71
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:52,411
GIRL 2: I've heard Kurotabo's
one of the best-looking yokai

72
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,844
around, if not the best.

73
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,844
-I can't believe that
they're both here

74
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:58,811
and we get to entertain them.

75
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,778
-This is a once in
a lifetime chance.

76
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,744
-The power of the
Nura Clan's name--

77
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,411
-Is awesome.

78
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:09,144
BOTH: We're so lucky that
we look like those two guys.

79
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:11,044
AOTABO: Hey, Aotabo.

80
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:12,411
I've heard people
say that you've

81
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:15,444
slaughtered 1,000 yokai already.

82
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,578
-Huh?

83
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:17,978
-Why don't you show me
what you've got then?

84
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,744
Let's see how good you are.

85
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:22,378
-Ow, ow, what are you doing?

86
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:24,611
Stop it.

87
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:29,011
-How dare you deceive
people using my name, idiot?

88
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:29,544
-What?

89
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:31,078
It can't be.

90
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:31,811
The real ones?

91
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:32,778
-Huh?

92
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,678
You're fakes?

93
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,278
-Now that I see the real deal--

94
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,511
-They do look like knock-offs.

95
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:41,711
-We're sorry.

96
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,044
-I swear.

97
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:44,311
-Yeah.

98
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:46,178
Though I suppose it's
concrete evidence

99
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,811
that the Nura Clan's sphere
of influence has grown.

100
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:52,978
And it's all thanks
to Master Rikuo.

101
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,444
-Damn it all.

102
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,044
Things were going so good too.

103
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:58,411
-Who would've thought the
real ones would walk in.

104
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:01,878
-The yokai heroes of the Nura
Clan sure are something else.

105
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,844
-Clanless yokai
like us have to do

106
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,944
whatever we can just to get by.

107
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,644
It wouldn't hurt them to just
let us have a little more fun.

108
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,911
-Yep, totally with
you on that one.

109
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:23,511
-You aren't yokai by
any chance, are you?

110
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:27,444
-So that's the real Lord Aotabo
who's sitting in front of us.

111
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,744
-He's definitely big
and strong all right.

112
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:32,344
-I hope he doesn't
break anything.

113
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,044
-And Lord Kurotabo.

114
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,344
-He's so handsome in person.

115
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:37,911
-The local businesses
are all running again.

116
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:41,744
It's thanks to Master Rikuo
because he took Kyuso down.

117
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,111
-Hey, Aotabo.

118
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,511
What's your honest
opinion of Master Rikuo

119
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:49,044
and the future of the Nura Clan?

120
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,444
-Well, in the beginning,
I thought of him

121
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:58,644
as just the Supreme
Commander's cute grandson.

122
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:08,878
But then, he was
amazing that time.

123
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,511
I knew then that exchanging
Cups of Loyalty with him

124
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,311
wasn't a mistake.

125
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,711
Also he's still got room to
grow up and get stronger.

126
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:20,744
-But one flaw is that he can
only become a yokai at night.

127
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:23,278
And as a child, his
mind isn't that strong.

128
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,711
-Yeah, that's true.

129
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:27,644
That's exactly why we've got
to give him all of our support

130
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:30,544
so that he can become
a great leader.

131
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,511
-You're right.

132
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,778
Without a doubt.

133
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:34,278
-Yeah.

134
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,911
-Hey, is work all
you guys talk about?

135
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,711
-You're here now, so you
should be talking to us too.

136
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:42,644
-Butt out, ladies.

137
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:43,911
Go away.

138
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,611
-Lord Kurotabo, we'd like
to get to know you better.

139
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:49,311
-You're as manly
as the rumors say.

140
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:49,811
-Huh?

141
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:50,778
Hold on.

142
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,311
-Please don't interrupt.

143
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,044
This is very important for us.

144
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:55,044
-Do it later.

145
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,344
You're ours for
tonight, Lord Kuro.

146
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:01,111
-Or are you trying to say
that we're not important?

147
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:02,711
-I guess I really
don't have a choice.

148
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:05,078
-Why aren't any of the
ladies flocking to me?!

149
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:05,811
[screaming]

150
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,378
Die, Kurotabo!

151
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:10,644
KUROTABO: Hey, don't
destroy the place.

152
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:12,111
-Man, I'm pissed.

153
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,778
Why is he so popular
with the girls anyway?

154
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,811
I'm a Strike Team leader
too, just like him.

155
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,544
AOTABO IMPOSTER: Help me.

156
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,444
-You're that imposter.

157
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,211
-Please, help me.

158
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,511
-Well now, it's another one.

159
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:33,411
-Who are you?

160
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:34,511
What did you do?

161
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:43,878
-Destroy.

162
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,344

-Something exploded.

-Let's go.

165
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,144
We can't waste time here.

-What?

00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,944
-Hey, who are you guys?

What the hell?

00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:09,478
-Heh, you're a tough one.

170
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,711
Garo, devour.

171
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:17,711
-Hey, didn't you hear me?

172
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:19,644
I asked who the
hell are you guys?

173
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:25,478
Was that monster water?

-Mamiru, it looks
like lightning alone

175

isn't enough to finish this.

176

You're going to
need my water too.

Learn from your actual battles.

-What are you doing, Aotabo?

183
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:15,544
You let your guard down?

-My guard?

185
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,278
-I have no idea who
did this to you,

186
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,978
but you need to live up to your
name as a Strike Team leader.

Humans?

00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:25,344
Funny.

191
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:27,111
Being drunk is no excuse.

192
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,844
-No, it wasn't the liquor.

193
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:33,278
Even sober, I still
would've lost.

They were so
powerful that I even

195
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,711
thought about taking
off my skull beads.

196
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,978
-I find that hard to believe.

197
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:42,944
If they had power equal
to that of a yokai,

you're sure to find--

I'm worthless, worthless.

No, I shouldn't call
myself worthless.

I thought you weren't

get in touch with you.

that I respect it.

That's your brother?

-I followed the traces
of your shikigami.

I told you to keep in
touch with us, didn't I?

Oh, you're training.

doing it here for?

-You could've just
walked on into town

00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,180
and you would've run
into yokai everywhere.

280
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,214
So why train here?

this town, big brother?

thing that brought us.

Come on, go.

302
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,380
What do we do to yokai?

303
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:18,680
Yokai are absolute evil.

304
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:21,480
So you know what
to do, don't you?

305

-You should join in.

308
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,747
There's one thing I've
always taught you--

309
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,747
all yokai are evil.

310
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,614
You should destroy
them on sight.

312
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:49,114
Now she does too.

00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:51,514
It's all out.

314

-Still don't want to show
your true colors yet?

315
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,480
You're a yokai who took human
form to trick my sister.

316
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:03,447
It hurts me to do this when
you're still in human form.

317
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,514
But we must annihilate all evil.

-Hey, the sun's almost down.

319
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:24,014
-I think we'd better
head back now.

320
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,480
-Just a little longer?

TSURARA (VOICEOVER): Master.

322

Something's happened.

323

-Oikawa?

324
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,514
-Miss Keikain?

325
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:45,747
-What do you think
you're doing, Yura?

326
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:56,447
-Nura, you-- you
are a human, right?

327
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,214
-Miss Keikain.

328
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
I am.

329
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:06,847
I'm human.

330
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,347
-Right.

331
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,680
You heard him, big brother.

332
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:16,580
Nura isn't the enemy.

333
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:20,547
-Do you understand what
you just did, Yura?

334
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,380
Protecting a yokai is
against Keikain law.

335
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:26,614
You don't believe
your own brother?

336
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,947
-I believe Nura's
telling the truth.

337
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,414
We've only known each
other for a short time,

338
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,947
but he's my friend.

339
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,614
He's not an enemy.

340
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,380
I will not destroy him.

341
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:39,580
-Yura.

342
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:43,347
-If you hurt him, brother
or not, you'll face me.

343
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,814
-Face you?

344
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:49,414
Yura, take responsibility
for what you say.

345
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:49,914
Rentei!

346
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,747
Shikigami Convert.

347
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,680
Jinchiki Synthesis!

348
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:02,180
-Heh.

349
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:09,547
-Banish into the
Abyss, Yura Max!

350
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:20,280
-Yura, what's up with the
name of that technique?

351
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,314
Did you think of it yourself?

352
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:23,280
-Shut up.

353
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:25,147
It's my choice.

354
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,547
-Names are an important thing.

355
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,680
Garo, devour.

356
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,380
-Tanro!

357
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:41,580
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): The power
of the Keikain's is incredible.

358
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:45,347
-As always, your ability to
control multiple shikigami

359
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,347
at any given time is
an impressive thing.

360
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,847
You're right up
there with Mamiru

361
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,447
as far as your talent goes.

362
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,880
And that's a good thing for
you, for all Keikain's really.

363
00:19:56,914 --> 00:20:01,114
However, even so,
you're too green.

364
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,514
YURA (VOICEOVER):
He released two?

365
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:03,947
-Those two are diversions?

366
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,014
-Huh?

367
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,980
-Can you see the real
one to your right?

368
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,680
[scream]

369
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:13,247
What's wrong, Yura?

370
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,014
There's another
one on your left.

371
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,280
YURA (VOICEOVER): There isn't.

372
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:20,114
It's to the right?

373
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:25,080
-It's too easy to mislead
you with a few lies.

374
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,180
-Miss Keikain!

375
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:26,847
Stop!

376
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,314
What are you doing?

377
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,414
You're her brother, aren't you?

378
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,280
-Quit acting so noble.

379
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,847
You're just a yokai.

380
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,647
YURA: Nura, I'm all right.

381
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,747
I won't lose to his shikigami.

382
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,147
And I won't lose to Garo.

383
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,047
What's going on here?

384
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,880
-Yura, you're letting words
influence you too much.

385
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:52,680
When my enemies
hear the name Garo,

386
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:55,680
they always expect an
aggressive shikigami.

387
00:20:55,714 --> 00:21:00,114
But my shikigami's
real name is Gengen.

388
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:04,480
It's ultimate goal is to slip
inside my opponents' bodies.

389
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,980
Gengen, run.

390
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:16,314
[screaming]

391
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:18,647
There's more to the
onmyoji arts than just

392
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,414
using as many
shikigami as you can.

393
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,147
I hope you've learned that.

394
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,580
Manipulating your words
is also a good technique.

395
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:31,147
I can still forgive this.

396
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,580
If you want to live,
come back to us.

397
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:42,347
Bastard.

398
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,880
-I'm sorry, Miss Keikain.

399
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:47,414
I couldn't stand this.

400
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:50,614
-Is that you, Nura?

401
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:54,614
-I don't care if you're
an onmyoji or a Keikain.

402
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,980
I can't sit back and watch
someone harm my friend.

403
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,314
-So you've shown your
true colors, yokai.

404
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,680
It's over.

405
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:09,247
I'm the only one here who's
allowed to trick Yura.

406
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,347
[theme music]

407
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:01,710
RYUJI (VOICEOVER): Unnatural
beings, fade into darkness.

408
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:04,543
YURA (VOICEOVER): He
really is a yokai.

409
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,976
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
Hagoromo Gitsune,

410
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,648
something about
this troubles me.

411
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,481
MAMIRU (VOICEOVER): Be
gone, into darkness.
