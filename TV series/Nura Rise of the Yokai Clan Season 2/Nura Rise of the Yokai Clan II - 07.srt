this how I bring out fear?

I guess so.

undetected and strike!

-To cut through fear
means to destroy fear.

34
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,503
To achieve that, you
must channel your fear,

35
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:28,769
which begins as no more
than a threatening presence,

36
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,703
into a physical attack.

37
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:32,103
-Physical attack?

38
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,603
ITAKU: Destroy fear with fear.

39
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:36,936
It was inevitable that
the course of history

40
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:40,469
led to this technique
of fighting other yokai.

41
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:43,336
And that is what
we call possession.

42
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:47,103
-So that's what
Gramps was doing.

43
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:50,569
The next level for ayakashi.

44
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:52,769
Teach me.

45
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,803
I need to learn that technique.

46
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,603
-You have to be willing
to die trying to.

47
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,703
I won't give you
any breaks either.

48
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:03,903
-If that's what it
takes to go to Kyoto,

49
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:08,036
if it will make me
stronger, my life is yours.

50
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,803
-Kyoto?

51
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:12,269
Huh.

52

You'll be sparring
day and night.

Are you cut out for this?

is that easy to learn.

So shut up.

81
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:58,349
I caught on when I was
about five years old.

-Huh?

83
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,849
-Seriously, we're all yokai,
so it should come naturally.

84
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:03,749
-Yeah.

85
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:05,549
-Is that right?

00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:09,982
-Hey, why are you so keen on
going to Kyoto anyway, hm?

87
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,615
Speaking of which, we've heard
some strange rumors about Kyoto

88
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,949
even in Tono.

89
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,615
Something about a
nasty yokai's return.

90
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,115
Sounds dicey.

91
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:20,915
-Yeah.

92
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,249
It probably will be for her.

93
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,449
BOTH: Huh?

94
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,915
-Hey, we talking girls?

95
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,815
-You're going to go rescue her?

96
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:30,782
She pretty?

97
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,415
-She's so-so.

-So-so, huh?

00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:36,515
-Nah, his body language
says she's hot.

100
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:39,949
-Abandoning her is something
I don't want to do.

101
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:44,382
And I have other reasons,
too, like yokai chivalry.

102
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:47,315
-Aah, that's yakuza for you.

103

BOTH: Huh?

105
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,415
-You know, I don't
like them either.

106
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:58,682
Our territory is cold and
definitely not plentiful.

107
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:04,715
That's why the yokai here became
strong in order to survive.

108
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:07,715
As the overseer of
all militant factions,

109
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,949
we've sent skilled fighters
to many organizations,

110
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,582
but we're allied with no one.

111
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:17,215
And that's a fact that
we Tono yokai ninja are

112
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,682
extremely proud of.

113
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:23,015
Those Kyoto yokai look
down on us, though,

114
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,315
and try to take advantage of us.

115

-Yeah, they're so full
of themselves there.

Real high and mighty.

118

demanding soldiers,

119

like we're their
servants or something.

-As if we want to work
for yokai like them!

121

-Well, I sure wouldn't.

I welcome you here, Lord

-That's enough, Akagappa.

Lady Hagoromo
Gitsune has returned.

Those foul seals in Kyoto will
all be broken in a week or two.

I need soldiers right away.

I want to buy 20 or

-That is impossible.

Besides, let me remind you that
we owe no obligation to Kyoto.

I promise you that.

168
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,515
I'll come back.

169
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,482
I expect good news.

170
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:54,482
-I hope you'll make it out.

171
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,349
GYURIKI: Damn that old man!

172
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,349
DANKI: Should we make
an example of a few?

173
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:00,715
-It won't work.

174
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,249
Not on them, at least.

175
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:03,815
Huh?

176
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:04,815
Wait a minute.

177
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,449
Look over there.

-[gasping]

179
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:09,015
-So what?

180
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,515
It's just a kid
doing his chores.

181
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,049
KIDOMARU: No.

182
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,215
-Huh?

183
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,549
-That boy and that face.

KIDOMARU: A face I couldn't
forget if I wanted to.

187
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:24,749
-Uh?

188

-Stay sharp.

00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:48,815
-Huh?

197
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,149
-Hah, so it is him.

198
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:54,249
The fear to erase
his presence and used

199
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:56,982
on Lady Hagoromo Gitsune.

200
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,482
Nurarihyon's power.

201
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,915
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
That was close.

202
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,115
They almost killed me.

203
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,582
Who are those guys?

204
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,382
They just attacked me.

205
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,115
But they can't see me.

206
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,582
But I'm not armed either.

207
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:10,549
I'd better retreat.

208
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,249
-[gasps]

209
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:15,749
-Hrm!

210
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:26,782
-Uh!

211
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:31,049
-He would never allow his fear
to be destroyed so easily.

212
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,882
You aren't him.

213
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,612
I am Kidomaru.

214
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:38,045
Now, I must insist on your name.

215
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,497
I must insist on your name.

216
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,530
Are you his child?

217
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:52,797
You're not.

218
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,430
You don't seem like one who's
lived through 400 years.

219
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:57,697
-Uh.

220
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,397
-Hm, it's been that long.

221
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,997
So you're his grandchild then.

222
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,830
That time when
Nurarihyon's blade

223
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:13,281
took Lady Hagoromo Gitsune
from us, our time stopped.

224
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:18,330
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): He's
with Hagoromo Gitsune?

225
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:22,197
-We hate the Nura Clan.

226
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,764
Nurarihyon.

227
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:24,264
-Uh!

228
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:31,930
Huh.

229
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,964
-But our hope has been renewed.

230
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:42,430
We shall retake Kyoto and
annihilate the Nura Clan.

231
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:47,530
And I'll take your head as a
gift to Lady Hagoromo Gitsune.

232
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:50,264
Your body will go
to your grandfather

233
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,797
along with our formal
declaration of war.

234
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,364
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
This guy is dangerous.

235
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:01,064
I'm dead at this rate.

236
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,897
ITAKU (VOICEOVER):
Not even close.

237
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,964
-Everyone's fear is different.

238
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:08,697
And making a technique means
expressing your yokai traits

239
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,164
in a physical way.

240
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,230
-Traits?

241
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,297
-A Kappa would have
water technique.

242
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,497
AWASHIMA: What the hell?

243
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,130
ITAKU: A Yuki Onna would
probably have an ice one.

244
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,930
-Right, I get it.

245
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,730
And yours is a sickle.

246
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:22,497
-Obviously.

247
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,297
REIRA: Let's take a break.

248
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,597
-Hey, what can Nurarihyon do?

249
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,497
-Huh?

250
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,997
-Nurarihyon?

251
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,030
-They stroll into people's homes
and sip tea without a care.

252
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,430
And they lead yokai.

253
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,264
-I think that's kind of vague.

254
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:40,097
Ka-- [coughs]

255
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,397
-You weren't being
specific enough there.

256
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,297
Get serious!

257
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,764
-It's not my fault, you know.

258
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:46,897
It's the truth!

259
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,397
-That's why the feeling
isn't sinking in.

260
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,530
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I definitely
get the Meikyo Shisui.

261
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,964
What I'm not getting
is this yokai thing.

262
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:59,164
-Come on, you can't think
clearly on an empty stomach.

263
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:01,597
Have some frozen
honey lemon slices.

264
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,297
Why not start by trying
to understand yourself?

265
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,497
If you do that, the
technique will definitely

266
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,530
come to you naturally.

267
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,530
-She's right, you know.

268
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:12,864
-You think?

269
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:15,330
-To tell you the truth, I
couldn't stand my yokai trait

270
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:16,597
at first.

271
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,697
But I've really refined it now.

272
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,764
-Refined?

273
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:21,130
REIRA: It's quite impressive.

-You want me to use it on you?

277
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:29,830
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
Refined to another level?

278
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:33,164
What did he do back then?

279
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,097
Focus.

280
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,830
I must have seen something.

00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:36,330
-Heyah!

00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,064

You think you can
cause a scene here?

-Who are you?

Are you looking to
get eaten alive?

I'll handle this guy.

-Hah.

294
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,397
-I got it now.

Kyoka Suigetsu.

ITAKU (VOICEOVER): What?

297
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:22,683
KIDOMARU (VOICEOVER):
This is completely

298
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:25,316
unlike his earlier fear.

299
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,959
ITAKU (VOICEOVER): Invoke?

300
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:28,226
No, wait.

301
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,193
As I recall, when
Rikuo invokes his fear,

302
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:34,393
he becomes undetectable.

303
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,626
That's not an invoke.

-Give it up, kid!

305

through your fear!

I sense him.

-Yeah, same here.

316
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,159
He's right there.

317
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:12,493
But I can't touch him.

318

00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,393
-Kyoka Suigetsu.

335
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:50,459
We're yokai that personifies
dreams and illusions.

336
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:51,393
-Look, Grandpa.

337
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:54,193
It's daytime but the moon is up.

338
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:55,226
-You're right.

339
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,593
It's unusual.

340
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,359
But look down at the pond.

341
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,426
-Huh?

342
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,126
NURARIHYON: The moon
is reflected there.

343
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,059
So it's not an illusion.

344
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,093
YOUNG RIKUO: You're right!

345
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,826
The moon is in the pond.

346
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,126
Oh, it vanished.

Meikyo Shisui.

350
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:15,959
Just a single ripple
can shatter the water's

351
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:20,359
mirror-like surface,
but not Kyoka Suigetsu.

352
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:24,626
Ripples on the water will
make the moon unreachable.

353
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,326
It can slip through reality,
just like us Nurarihyon.

354
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,293
-So then you personify
fantasy and visions.

355
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,393
-Kyoka Suigetsu.

356
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:39,793
You're aware of him,
but he's not there.

357
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:42,526
Making you even more
aware of his presence.

358
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,093
Hm.

KIDOMARU (VOICEOVER): It's
deadlier than I thought.

360
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,493
The yokai Nurarihyon can distort
awareness and cut through fear.

REIRA: I was wondering
where you both were.

Itaku, aren't you in
charge of Rikuo's training?

371
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,393
You need to stay more focused.

372
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,593
You won't be able to escape
this ice fortress, mister.

Look forward to
freezing to death.

If you'd prefer not to,
then apologize right now

for going on a rampage
here in Tono Village.

-Itaku, are they from Kyoto?

Out with it.

What's going on here?

-Huh.

381
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:40,859
My purpose for coming
to Tono Village today

382
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,026
wasn't to destroy it.

383

00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:46,226
-No.

helped Nurarihyon's grandson.

Hagoromo Gitsune hands.

-Oh, mistress.

00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,759
-Have you prepared
dinner as I requested?

406
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:09,593
-Yes.

407
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,826
-Good.

408
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,526
As usual, allow no one in.

409
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,393
-Oh, right.

410
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,126
MINAGOROSHI: They
have done well.

411
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,693
Not too much liquid
and cooked rare.

412

Human livers lose
their power otherwise.

413
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,693
Now, as I was saying,
the fifth seal

414
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,026
will be removed later on today.

not destroy them all?

That'll be easier,
Minagoroshi Jizo.

418

-Agreed.

419
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:45,993
Let's not delay retaking Kyoto.

420
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:47,893
It is our dearest wish.

421
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:49,193
-It is.

422
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:50,059
-Let's do it.

-I'm itching to fight.

424
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,493
-We've had to wait 400 bitter
years for this day to come--

425
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:57,693
---since the onmyoji
sealed us all.

426
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:58,859
-You scared?

427
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:00,126
Maybe that's it.

428
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,459
Let us, please?

429
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,193
-Maybe we should curse
you to death first.

-[snickers]

431
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:07,626
I can sympathize.

432
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,726
However, we cannot launch
a full-scale assault due

433
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,026
to the power of
Hidemoto, the 13th Heir.

434
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,493
Fushimi Inari Shrine, Hashira
Villa, Ryoanji Temple,

435
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:24,759
Seieiji Temple, Nichi Hoganji
Temple, Rokukinji Temple,

436
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:29,059
Shokokuji Temple,
and Nijo Castle.

437
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,426
These eight temples and
castles are beautifully

438
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,859
linked to the streets of Kyoto.

439
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,759
And they take the
form of a spiral--

440
00:20:36,793 --> 00:20:40,693
the same spiral shape of the
seal created by Master Tenkai

441
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:44,459
during the construction
of Edo's ancient castle.

442
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:49,159
The Edo shogun have secured
300 years of peace with it.

443
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:51,993
It's been 400 years for Kyoto.

444
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:55,326
That is the genius and power
of Hidemoto, the 13th Heir,

445
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,359
who surpasses even
Master Tenkai.

446
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:03,793
Each of these eight sites is
surrounded by a powerful seal.

447
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:08,826
We must destroy them one by
one in the order of the spiral.

448
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:09,959
-Wait.

449
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:12,459
We have to follow the
path they laid out even

450
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:13,759
to destroy the seals?

onmyoji after all. [cackles]

-That ought to pass
the time nicely.

455
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,526
Although when it's
over, our castle

456
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,059
will stand on the first seal.

457
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:35,123
From the walls of
the new Nijo Castle,

458
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:37,454
we shall fill Kyoto with yokai.

459
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:39,954
-Well said, Lady
Hagoromo Gitsune.

I wouldn't expect
anything less from you.

-No, I'll take it on.

463
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,854
After all, I am--

464
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,488
-I leave it all to you.

465
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:49,421
Do what you will.

466
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:55,488
We'll turn this world
into a dark paradise.

467
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:59,888
We'll engulf it in darkness,
one human at a time.

468

Come, yokai, with
me, Hagoromo Gitsume.
