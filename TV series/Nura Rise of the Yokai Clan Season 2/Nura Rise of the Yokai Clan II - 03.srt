[theme music]

2
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:55,266
-You've finally shown
your true colors.

3
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,532
You've been deceiving Yura.

4
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,199
Damn yokai.

5
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,366
YURA (VOICEOVER):
It's him again.

6
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,966
He came to my rescue.

7
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,366
So all this time,
it was you, Nura?

8
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,399
-Wait, Mamiru.

9
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,666
I'll take care of this one.

10
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,532
Shikigami Fusion, Gyogen.

11
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,332
-Wh-- what are those?

12
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,699
Flowers made of water?

13
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,932
-Yes, but not just any water.

14
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:00,532
Now Gyogen, take root and
sprout your enchanting flower.

15
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,399
-It melted.

16
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,099
-What kind of
shikigami are they?

17
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:19,699
-Anything these flowers touch
will melt away instantly,

18
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,566
even a yokai.

19
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,232
Nobody has ever lasted
more than three minutes

20
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,966
against my Gyogen.

21
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,599
That's how unstoppable it is.

22
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:30,832
-Just three?

23
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:35,366
RYUJI: Yes, that's the limit
for both you and Gyogen.

24
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:39,466
Unfortunately, I don't have
your and Mamiru's talent.

25
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,766
I can only maintain
a powerful shikigami

26
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,866
like this one for
a little while.

27
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:48,132
And three minutes
is about my limit.

28
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,266
In other words, if you can last
three minutes against Gyogen,

29
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,232
you win.

30
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,532
If you can't, I win.

31
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,299
That's about the size of it.

32
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:57,766
It's all or nothing.

33
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,699
Kill or be killed.

34
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,699
Now witness my
greatest technique.

35
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:03,599
Gyogen, Konjosui Flower!

36
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:16,032
-Nura!

37
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:21,532
-They're going to
keep coming after you.

38
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,332
This time from up
and to the right.

39
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,199
You're a stubborn one, yokai.

40
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:40,299
That sword you have there,
is that a Spirit Blade?

41
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:45,099
If you didn't have that,
this would already be over.

42
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,966
YURA (VOICEOVER): The number
of Gyogen is dropping.

43
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,399
If he can last a little longer.

44
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,432
-Here it comes.

45
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,599
This is the end!

46
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,066
YURA (VOICEOVER): He did it.

47
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,566
Nura won.

48
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,532
-Congratulations on
the three minutes.

49
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,699
-That's a Trigram Field.

50
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:24,432
-Unnatural beings,
fade into darkness.

51
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,332
Gyogen, Konjosui Formation.

52
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,366
-Nura, no!

53
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,132
It can't be.

54
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,432
It just can't.

55
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,032
-See, I'm not really
that talented,

56
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:48,766
so it takes me a little
bit of time to make those.

57
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,299
About three minutes.

58
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:53,432
-This is what you
wanted all along.

59
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,799
You planned this out.

60
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:58,299
-You've got to learn,
you can't face yokai

61
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,666
with just techniques.

62
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,799
To fight their evil, you have
to set traps on top of traps.

63
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:09,532
-Nura.

64
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:13,732
-It's a shame.

65
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,999
Karasu Tengu and the
others stayed up late

66
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:19,399
making that haori there,
and you ruined it.

67
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:21,599
-How'd you know it was a trap?

68
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,066
-Your words are full of lies.

69
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,999
I couldn't imagine
someone like that

70
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:30,166
using a straight-forward
attack to finish his opponent.

71
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,332
Besides, you've got this
whole bad guy thing going.

72
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:35,199
Who could believe you?

73
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,510
Aside from your sister.

74
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:38,010
-What?

75
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:50,955
-Big brother!

76
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:58,787
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Nura cut my brother.

77
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:08,053
This person is different
from the human Nura.

78
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,953
He really is a yokai.

79
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:17,720
-Destroy.

80
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,220
-Nura, no!

81
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:26,453
YURA (VOICEOVER): Nura's down.

82
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,153
What'll I do?

83
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:29,887
What was that?

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,753
Onmyojutsu?

85
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:36,287
It feels like I saw
something almost alien.

86
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,387
-Learn this, Mamiru.

87
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,153
Yokai are the darkness,
and we are the light.

88
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:44,887
-Do I know you?

89
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,853
Who are you?

90
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:48,820
What in the world are you?

91
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,720
RYUJI: What are
you saying, Yura?

92
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,520
It's Mamiru.

93
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,120
YURA: Big brother, you're OK.

94
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:59,187
-The two of you used to
play together all the time.

95
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,887
And now, you can consider
him your new big brother.

96
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,687
-What?

97
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,120
What are you talking about?

98
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,487
He's nothing at all like the
Mamiru that I used to know.

99
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,487
-The main family accepts
talented people--

100
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,687
that's the way of the Keikain--
and Mamiru's talent finally

101
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,953
bloomed.

102
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:18,387
[coughing]

103
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,787
-Big brother.

104
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,687
-Onmyoji aren't supposed
to lose to yokai,

105
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,787
let alone allow them to escape.

106
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,853
-You mean you really
intend to finish Nura off?

107
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:30,987
-Of course.

108
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,287
You saw it, right?

109
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,453
He used this sword
to cut me down.

110
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:40,253
Isn't this Nenekirimaru,
an onmyoji sword

111
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,753
made to cut only yokai?

112
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,053
So why does he have it?

113
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,153
Enough of this.

114
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:53,553
Hurry up and finish
him off already.

115
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:55,520
-No, don't!

116
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:57,487
-Be gone, into darkness.

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
-Huh?

118
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:09,353
-I'm only going
to warn you once.

119
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:13,420
Stand down or else
there'll be hell to pay.

120
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,387
-What's this?

121
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,920
There's another yokai here?

122
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:20,120
-Lord Gyuki, what are they?

123
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:22,887
-Those are onmyoji--
individuals with the power

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,453
to protect humans from us yokai.

125
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,453
Don't forget.

126
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:27,453
-I won't.

127
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:29,653
-Are onmyoji supposed
to be strong?

128
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:32,253
-Gozumaru, stand down now.

129
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,020
-You mean they're over here too?

130
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,720
[murmuring]

131
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:53,920
-Damn, I'm sensing
even more yokai aura.

132
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,887
What the hell?

133
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,653
I don't believe this.

134
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,220
It's getting ridiculous here.

135
00:10:16,253 --> 00:10:18,653
-It's the Night Parade
of a Hundred Demons.

136
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,687
-The Night Parade?

137
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,087
Quite kidding around.

138
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,720
That would mean that one of
them has to be--

139
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:34,557
Hey you,

140
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,957
who are you?

141
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:40,691
-The Master of the yokai yakuza
family, called the Nura Clan.

142
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,691
Nurarihyon's
grandson, Rikuo Nura.

143
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,557
-Wait a minute,
you're Nurarihyon's--

144
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,757
-His grandson?

145
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,994
-Nurarihyon's grandson?

146
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:05,960
-Hey, you guys.

147
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:06,960
Wait for me.

148
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,394
I can't believe
you left me behind.

149
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,827
Wah!

150
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,294
What was a booby
trap doing there?

151
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,227
-Yuki Onna, you're still in
your human form, you know.

152
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,960
-Wait, is that Oikawa?

153
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,560
-Ah, the onmyoji girl?

154
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:25,494
What are you doing here?

155
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,060
YURA (VOICEOVER): So
Tsurara Oikawa is a yokai.

156
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:31,394
I thought she just
liked Nura a lot.

157
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:37,627
Wait, if Nura is his grandson,
that means he was Nurarihyon.

158
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,527
-What is he doing?

159
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,694
-Destroy the yokai Nurarihyon.

160
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:57,960
-We've got a score.

161
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,894
You want to settle it?

162
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,094
-Stop it, Mamiru.

163
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,360
That's far enough.

164
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,294
-I won't.

165
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:06,027
No yokai escapes.

166
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,360
RYUJI: Calm down.

167
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,660
Do you really think
you can beat them all?

168
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:10,160
-I do.

169
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,460
-I did tell you to stop this.

170
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:18,794
There's too many of them.

171
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:24,927
Besides, don't forget, we came
here to tell Yura something.

172
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,060
Bad news, Yura.

173
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,127
-Bad news?

174
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,427
RYUJI: Shuji and
Koreto are dead.

175
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,427
-Dead?

176
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,527
Our brother Shuji and Koreto?

177
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,860
But how could that be?

178
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:41,694
-They finally made their move.

179
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,294
-When you say they,
you don't mean--

180
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:48,927
RYUJI: Yeah, the Keikain
Clan's mortal enemy,

181
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,160
the Kyoto yokai and its
leader, Hagoromo Gitsune.

182
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,894
-Did he say Hagoromo Gitsune?

183
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:02,194
-Her yokai have broken
some of the barriers

184
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:05,360
we maintain in Kyoto,
two of the eight.

185
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:08,060
-No way.

186
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:09,994
RYUJI: Our leader,
Hidemoto Keikain,

187
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,727
inducted Mamiru to
the main family.

188
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,760
He's also ordered you to
return home from your training.

189
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:19,794
Yura, come back to Kyoto.

190
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,527
RIKUO: Hagoromo Gitsune.

191
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,894
Why do I feel like
I know that name?

192
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,694
-Pass this along to Nurarihyon.

193
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:35,660
It's a message we've wanted to
tell him for a few generations.

194
00:13:35,694 --> 00:13:37,360
-Huh?

195
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:39,494
-Don't ever visit us again.

196
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,894
We won't feed you if you do.

197
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,427
-What?

198
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,560
-That's all.

199
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,560
Oh, also, that sword there?

200
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,427
Take care of it.

201
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,860
-You're so high and mighty.

202
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:58,894
-You do realize that you're
surrounded, don't you?

203
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:00,727
-Gyogen, we're done for today.

204
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:08,060
-What-- what is this stuff?

205
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,027
RYUJI (VOICEOVER):
Nenekirimaru is

206
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,660
only effective against yokai.

207
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,027
Does that mean he pitied me?

208
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,894
And he's just a yokai.

209
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:26,460
-Ryuji

210
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:27,794
-Yeah?

211
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:30,727
-You had two active
kekkai barriers there.

212
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,227
Why didn't you
destroy the yokai?

213
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,627
-Mind your own business.

214
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,294
RYUJI (VOICEOVER):
This is the last time

215
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:41,094
I shall respect your human
blood, grandson of Nurarihyon.

216
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:45,494
I don't accept you or
your gray existence.

217
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,527
-Who were those two?

218
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,594
-Professional liars.

219
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:53,694
-Big brother.

220
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,527
-She's an onmyoji too?

221
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,327
-Yeah.

222
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,894
She came over the other day.

223
00:14:57,927 --> 00:15:00,194
-To think this
shrimp is an onmyoji.

224
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:02,127
-Hey, you're one to talk.

225
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,194
-Tsurara.

226
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:08,627
-Yes?

227
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,060
-Tend to her at home.

228
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:13,194
-But I'd have to take
her there to do that.

229
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:13,760
BOTH: What?

230
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,627
YURA: No!

231
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,127
No!

232
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,460
TSURARA: Simmer down, will you?

233
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:26,427
YURA: No!

234
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,360
Why does a yokai
have to tend to me?

235
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,960
-Like I want to.

236
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:31,394
But I have no choice.

237
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:32,760
The Master gave me an order.

238
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,127
-Master my foot.

239
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,027
I can't believe a yokai like
you just strolled into school.

240
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,260
-Just be quiet, you.

241
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:43,960
Honestly, how did you get
all beaten up like this?

242
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,560
-Just leave me alone!

243
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,027
You've done enough!

244
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,960
TSURARA: Come back!

245
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,027
-She didn't listen to
a single word I said.

246
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,560
And this whole mansion
is full of yokai too.

247
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,827
[rustling]

248
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,327
-Hm?

249
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,127
Careful.

250
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,427
You could fall off.

251
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,160
-If I don't believe what
you say, I'll shoot.

252
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,627
Answer me, Nura.

253
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,927
Are you honestly a human
or are you a yokai?

254
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:50,127
-I'm human during the
day, but not at night.

255
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,627
I'm yokai now.

256
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,160
-You are the same person though?

257
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:56,660
-You don't believe me?

258
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:59,560
I guess I do seem different.

259
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:00,894
-I do.

260
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,660
Now it all makes sense.

261
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:06,260
For the longest time,
I couldn't figure out

262
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:09,760
why a yokai was saving me.

263
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:16,527
But if it was you who saved
me, it all fits together.

264
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,260
Yokai are yokai
because they do evil.

265
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:22,760
But it's a different
story if it's you.

266
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,827
Thanks for everything
you've done.

267
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,060
It was kind, Nura.

268
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,027
[scream]

269
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,460
Hey, what was that for?

270
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:38,727
-Hmph.

271
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,560
-You're the worst, Nura.

272
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,427
The absolute worst!

273
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,327
-If you can yell like
that, I guess you're OK.

274
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,227
Hurry up and go home to Kyoto.

275
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:59,794
-That was evil of you.

276
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:03,160
I swear, when I'm
back, I'll get you.

277
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:03,994
-Really?

278
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:05,927
Well, I'll look forward to that.

279
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:09,060
-Huh?

280
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:09,594
-Hmph.

281
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:10,627
-What the--?

282
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,994
Wha--?

283
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:13,527
RIKUO: Hey.

284
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,060
-What?

285
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,760
RIKUO: Want me along?

286
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,527
To Kyoto, I mean.

287
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:18,994
-Huh?

288
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,827
No, why would I?

289
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,694
This has nothing to
do with you, Nura.

290
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:35,360
-Nothing at all, huh?

291
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:39,694
-Gyuki.

292
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,127
-Yes?

293
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,594
-Did those onmyoji fellows
you saw really say that?

294
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:50,527
Hagoromo Gitsune is on the move?

295
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,160
-There's no mistake.

296
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:55,827
-I can't believe I'm
hearing that name.

297
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,427
After 400 years.

298
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,327
400 years.

299
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:16,060
[panting]

300
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,994
-I need help!

301
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:22,494
Anyone!

302
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:28,827
What?

303
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,027
What's this?

304
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,760
I definitely ran into something.

305
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,294
Is this some sort of wall?

306
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,808
It's solid.

307
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:47,174
There's no way out.

308
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,141
Oh no, oh no.

309
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,008
No!

310
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,974
-Very well done,
Nurikame, Sanzuo.

311
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,308
They say eating a baby's
liver will give you

312
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,941
the strength of 100 ayakashi.

313
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:14,674
-Please, I'm begging,
spare this child.

314
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,908
-You should be happy, woman.

315
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:21,174
Your child is going to
become part of my strength.

316
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,874
[scream]

317
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:32,274
-Who's there?

318
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:46,441
-Aren't those guys?

319
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:48,241
-It's the Nura Clan.

320
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,374
-The Nura Clan is here.

321
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:52,974
-All right, you guys ready?

322
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:55,274
It's going to be
another busy night.

323
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:56,674
Let's hunt ayakashi.

324
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,974
-Spare us, I beg you.

325
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:14,474
-Go.

326
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,808
I'm not interested
in human liver.

327
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,841
Especially not a baby's
liver that stinks of urine.

328
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:28,608
I'm going to be the
