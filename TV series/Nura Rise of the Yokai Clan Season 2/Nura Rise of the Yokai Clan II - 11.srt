00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,514
-But why?

169
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,314
-Name yourselves.

170
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:06,147
We will not attack
until we have heard.

171
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,181
-Is he for real?

172
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:09,247
-Wow.

173
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:12,481
-Are they really that
naive here in Kyoto?

174
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:16,881
HAKUZOZU: Are you foes
of us or our allies?

175
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:20,681
Or are you offering to
serve Lady Hagoromo Gitsune?

176
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:21,481
-You idiot!

177
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,281
Like we've come to do that!

178
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:26,114
Can't you see our emblem
of fear right here?

179
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:29,181
-No, easy now.

180
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,114
HAKUZOZU: That emblem.

181
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,114
No way!

182
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:31,681
Nurarihyon?

183
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,047
They can't be!

184
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:33,647
The Nura Clan?

185
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:34,481
-That's us.

186
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,281
Are you scared now?

187
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:37,581
-Those are the guys--

188
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:40,381
---who beat Lady
Hagoromo Gitsune before.

189
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:41,381
-Ngeeh!

190
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,381
-They've got some
nerve coming here.

191
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:45,047
-We'll grind them to dust!

192
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:56,982
-Watch out!

193
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:06,915
-Master Hakuzozu!

194
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:11,882
KUBINASHI: What power!

195
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:15,348
-It makes no difference
if you are the Nura Clan.

196
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,715
It's customary for leaders
to state their names

197
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,482
before a battle commences.

198
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:20,148
-Huh?

199
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:21,215
But Master Hakuzozu?

200
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,548
-Silence.

201
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,782
Those who cannot follow
form should leave.

202
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,248
-Yes, sir.

203
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:28,582
-What's he thinking?

204
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,715
-He stopped his men.

205
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:33,515
-Supreme Commander
of the Nura Clan,

206
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:36,215
you should step forth
and name yourself.

207
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,182
Refuse and you
leave me no choice.

208
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,115
We'll attack in full
force and sink your ship.

209
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,648
-Don't do it, master.

210
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:44,148
-We would never allow our
precious heir to do that.

211
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:45,615
-Hold on a second.

212
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,582
There's no need to
do what he's asking.

213
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,548
But still, he's strong.

214
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:53,615
His every pore radiates fear.

215
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,148
ZEN: So he's Kyoto's
gatekeeper, huh?

216
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,548
KUROTABO: It could be a trap.

217
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:00,848
KEJORO: But the way he's acting
makes absolutely no sense.

218
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:04,215
KUBINASHI: Even so, I'm grateful
he stopped the surprise attack.

219
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:05,582
I'll step forward.

220
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,948
Our commander doesn't need to.

221
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:10,482
Please protect him, Tono group.

222
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:13,415
-You should be keeping a
better eye on your commander.

223
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,348
-Hm?

224
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:17,048
Uh!

225
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:17,648
Rikuo?

226
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:18,382
-How did he--

227
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,448
-Stop, master.

228
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,682
Don't be so reckless.

229
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:28,048
With all respect,
you aren't ready to--

230
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:31,215
-Kubinashi, if I'm too scared
to give some guy my name

231
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:33,782
at this point, I'll
never be able to take

232
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:36,382
on Hagoromo Gitsune herself.

233
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:38,415
-Just let Rikuo do it.

234
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,948
I told you that he'd
never get stronger,

235
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:43,648
not with overprotective
aides like you around.

236
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:44,148
-Uh!

237
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,815
-I'm the commander.

238
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:53,515
We're taking Hagoromo
Gitsune down.

239
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:55,148
So we'll be on our way.

240
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:59,382
-You're a rather young leader
and not Nurarihyon, I presume.

241
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:01,415
So be it then.

242
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,848
I, Hakuzozu, shall face you.

243
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:07,582
Show me the fighting spirit
of a yokai from the East.

244
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,782
But first, state your name.

245
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:17,482
-The Nura Clan's young
master, Rikuo Nura.

246
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:21,215
-[pants]

247
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:22,148
Huh?

248
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:22,648
Huh?

249
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:30,848
The sky to the east,
it's getting brighter.

250
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:32,948
Things are still bad, though.

251
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:34,682
I can't see a
thing in this town.

252
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:43,448
-I am curious, why
did you step forward?

253
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:44,382
Huh?

254
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:46,548
HAKUZOZU: While
I did request it,

255
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:50,382
few would dare do so
after witnessing my power.

256
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:53,015
And those few are
fools who overestimate

257
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,115
their own strength.

258
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:56,682
Does the young master
of the Nura Clan not

259
00:13:56,715 --> 00:14:00,548
see the difference between us?

260
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:02,048
-A fool?

261
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,682
Isn't that you?

262
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:04,682
-Hm?

263
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:05,682
-You had us.

264
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:07,415
You should have
destroyed the ship.

265
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,648
So I just figured that
your foolish actions

266
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,715
deserved a foolish response.

267
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:15,982
And also, if you're
in the way, I

268
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:17,948
figured that I
could just kill you.

269
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,148
-I see.

270
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:23,248
You show good form for a
presumptuous little brat!

271
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:25,715
Haah!

272
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,148
[growls]

273
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,615
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): A whole boat?

274
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,148
How strong is he?

275
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,915
-[growls]

276
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,482
Even in fair combat,
my spear's power

277
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:40,882
makes things seem one-sided.

278
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,682
Such is its terrible might!

279
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:44,648
-Uh!

280
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:45,648
-What's the matter?

281
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:48,048
Did your heart
stop from the fear?

282
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:52,282
This is over your head, boy.

283
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,715
[yokai gasping]

284
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:55,182
-Master Rikuo!

285
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:55,982
-Hah!

286
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:57,915
I only need a single thrust.

287
00:14:57,948 --> 00:14:59,682
That is my spear.

288
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,348
Dakini!

289
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,782
HAKUZOZU (VOICEOVER): Hm?

290
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,182
No, wait.

291
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,982
That was an illusion.

292
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,682
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I get it now.

293
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:15,015
So this is what it's like to
have a battle of fear, huh?

294
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,382
-[gasps]

295
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,048
Master Rikuo.

296
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:21,348
-Youkai shouldn't get scared.

297
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,515
That's what Gramps used to say.

298
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,482
I get what he really meant now.

299
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:28,448
-Uh, what's going on?

300
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,815
And before, he slipped
right through my hand

301
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,148
when I grabbed him.

302
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,682
--[snickers] OK,
Stringer of Joshu,

303
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:37,582
let me tell you all
about Rikuo's fear.

304
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,882
That technique is
called Kyoka Suigetsu.

305
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,948
It let's him distort
his presence even

306
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,948
when he's still there.

307
00:15:43,982 --> 00:15:46,215
Hey, can I get your autograph?

308
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:48,882
KUBINASHI (VOICEOVER):
Distort his presence?

309
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,648
That's just like
the Second Heir.

310
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,282
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): This
is a battle of deception,

311
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:57,948
like scaring each other
in a haunted house.

312
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:00,315
-What is all this?

313
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,182
Tell me.

314
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:03,248
What are you doing?

315
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:08,082
-Somehow, I'm finding it hard
right now to be afraid of you.

316
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,748
You win by cutting through fear.

317
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:11,748
-Aargh!

318
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:13,448
-Once it's done, a
spear like your--

319
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,415
-Ugh, ugh!

320
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:23,982
---can be destroyed like that.

321
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,682
KUBINASHI (VOICEOVER):
Second Heir,

322
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:28,515
until now, I thought
I had faithfully

323
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:31,348
carried out your wishes.

324
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:36,615
-Kubinashi, I want my son
to make his own choice--

325
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:39,548
to be human or ayakashi.

326
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,115
KUBINASHI (VOICEOVER):
Second Heir?

327
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:45,882
-If he enters this world of
ours, he can never go back.

328
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:49,082
I'm half-yokai, and that's
the world I've chosen.

329
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:54,215
But my son, just a fourth
of his blood is ayakashi.

330
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,915
He'll have to make up his own
mind about his life's path.

331
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:00,982
-But, master, if
anything happens--

332
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:03,382
SECOND HEIR: You're a
serious guy for someone

333
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:07,415
who taught Rikuo another
cat's cradle move today.

334
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:11,015
This is isn't the era of the
shogun or the imperial capital.

335
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,582
It's Tokyo.

336
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,715
And the darkness
has gotten thinner.

337
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:19,382
It's just like Rikuo's
ayakashi blood.

338
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:23,215
Yup, he's like a symbol
of it-- of the future

339
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:25,615
of humans and yokai.

340
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:29,648
So don't go around talking about
ayakashi stuff in front of him.

341
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,982
And tell my old
man not to either.

342
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,515
[chuckles]

343
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:37,082
If he chooses it
for himself, that's

344
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:40,882
when you can show him
our world, right, Rikuo?

345
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:42,782
-Hey, you're hurting me.

Second Heir.

Huh!

350
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:56,748
You broke Dakini.

351

That must be the
famed Nenekirimaru.

of my strength lost so easily.

Hm.

You are indeed the
leader of the Nura Clan.

Take my head!

358

and march honorably into Kyoto!

361

Why the delay?

362
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,015
Do it now!

363
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:31,148
-Uh, what's he talking about?

364
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:33,248
-Seriously?

365
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:34,048
-Uh.

-Wait!

367

One moment.

368
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,148
I just thought of
a wonderful elegy.

369
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:45,115
"I suffered defeat and
faded into Kyoto's sky.

370

The soul of a Kyoto
yokai still remains

371
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,748
with Lady Hagoromo Gitsune."

That's too long!

-Way too long.

-Hey, so what is it
you're going to do?

380
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,648
Will you kill him?

381
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:07,282
-All right.

You would deign to
mock me, even now?

-Don't get the wrong idea here.

392
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:27,748
It's just that I
kind of like you.

You're weird but interesting.

yakuza, not samurai.

How can they do that when
their leader's on board?

411

-Easily, because he's
no longer our leader.

We should have just
destroyed your ships

in if we need to.
