WELL FOR HIMSELF.

516
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,433
>> IT’S ALL DIRTY MONEY.

517
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,766
HE HAS TO EXPLOIT PEOPLE

518
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,500
TO RUN HIS BUSINESS.

519
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,533
SOMEONE HAS

520
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,800
TO JUDGE THE SINNERS.

521
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,873
>> MOST WOULD CONSIDER

522
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:14,506
YOU A SINNER, TOO.

523
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,673
THEY’LL BEHEAD YOU SOMEDAY.

524
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:18,106
JUST THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT

525
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,373
MAKES ME SHUDDER.

526
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:21,173
>> DON’T GET WORKED UP.

527
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:22,906
IF I AM CAUGHT, I’VE STILL

528
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:24,740
DISPENSED JUSTICE.

529
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,940
BEING JUDGED DOESN’T SCARE ME.

530
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,306
OH, IT’S BEEN A WHILE SINCE

531
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:33,906
I’VE SEEN YOU, LITTLE ONE.

532
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:36,373
>> I’M NOT LITTLE ANYMORE!

533
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,506
I’M ALREADY NINE YEARS OLD!

534
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:39,506
[ LAUGHS ]

535
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:41,073
>> ’TIL NEXT TIME.

536
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:42,306
>> KINO, COME IN NOW.

537
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:43,506
DON’T JUST STAND THERE.

538
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,006
>> COMING.

539
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,540
>> THE END.

540
00:24:58,513 --> 00:24:59,580
>> I’M GOING TO DESTROY

541
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
ALL KYOTO YOKAI!

542
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,680
>> WE MUST FIGHT TOGETHER

543
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,580
AS WE DID IN THE PAST.

544
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,746
>> RIKUO, I WANT TO FIGHT

545
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:08,313
FOR YOU, TOO.

546
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:09,580
>> I WANT STRENGTH

547
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,246
FOR EVERYONE’S SAKE!
