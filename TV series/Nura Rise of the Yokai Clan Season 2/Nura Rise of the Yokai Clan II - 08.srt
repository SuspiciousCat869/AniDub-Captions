00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:14,851
[laughter]

169
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:15,651
VOICES: Oh!

170
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:16,451
It's so shiny!

171
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:18,451
It's been 400 years!

172
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:21,684
Is it just me, or does it
look a lot of newer now?

173
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:26,151
[laughing]

174
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:27,651
[laughing]

175
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:31,117
-My Lady, it's so
bright down there!

176
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:35,584
I've heard that Kyoto was an
amazing city, and it really is!

177
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,084
-Do you like it?

178
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,117
-I do!

179
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,551
I can see now why you're
after it, My Lady.

180
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,817
-Oh?

181
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:48,717
-If humans weren't here,
Kyoto would be more beautiful.

182
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,717
-Agreed.

183
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,184
[laughter]

184
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,684
-Well then.

185
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,551
Tonight, I hope that
we give a performance

186
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,917
worthy of this temple.

187
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,417
[explosion]

188
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,351
[screaming]

189
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,351
[crashing]

190
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:10,851
-Where's our lady?

191
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:29,351
MASATSUGU: Hagoromo
Gitsume, you're alone.

192
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:31,451
This is it.

193
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:34,251
You'll never get out of here.

194
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:37,217
No one's coming to your rescue.

195
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:41,284
For you've been imprisoned
within our ultimate Keikai

196
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:43,684
barrier.

197
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:46,917
On this very night
inside these walls,

198
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:51,151
you'll plummet into the darkness
again, you wretched fox.

199
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,851
HAGOROMO: What an extravagant
golden grave stone.

200
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:59,584
However, onmyoji, you shall
be the ones beneath it.

201
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,594
[chanting]

202
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:11,427
[laughing]

203
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:17,127
-Fukuju style barrier jutsu.

204
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,127
Panoramic wall of gold.

205
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,227
There's no escape from here.

206
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,027
And no entry.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,627
-Well done.

208
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,727
It's quite lovely.

209
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,127
It even covers the sky.

210
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,460
-(YELLING) Go
forth, my shikigami!

211
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:39,827
[growling]

212
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:44,735
-Stop that.

213
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:46,135
You're in the way.

214
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:51,635
-Yeah!

215
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:54,568
We got her!

216
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:56,568
Squeeze her flat like a pancake!

217
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:06,001
[laughing]

218
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:06,535
-Yeah!

219
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:07,468
Keep it up!

220
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:10,868
Don't let that fox get away!

221
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,701
[gasping]

222
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,201
-Yokai mistress.

223
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,868
Your schemes will not go
any further than this.

224
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,435
Nor will you.

225
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:24,035
400 years ago, we of the
Keikain sealed you away.

226
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:29,301
With the skigami Hagun and
the spirit blade Nenekirimaru.

227
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:33,401
Unfortunately, no one
among us can use Hagun now.

228
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:39,035
But 400 years of devoted study
has made us far, far superior.

229
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:43,101
You've been cut off by Masatsugu
Keikain's ultimate Fukuju style

230
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,535
barrier.

231
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:48,101
And immobilized by Pato
Keikain's ultimate Aiko style

232
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,868
shikigami.

233
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,168
And now, with my Yaso style's
ultimate spirit blade,

234
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:57,635
the spirit lance Kyoku, I
will completely destroy you.

235
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:59,968
When it comes to
creating spirit blades,

236
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:04,068
I'm proud to say that mine
surpasses the 13th heirs.

237
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,035
-Truly?

238
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,435
I'd certainly love to see that.

239
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:08,868
-What?

240
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:11,235
[whipping]

241
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:12,201
-So.

242
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:15,001
Is it lovelier than
this gold wand?

243
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:17,435
Then why not show me then?

244
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:20,068
The ultimate barrier?

245
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:21,635
And the ultimate shikigami.

246
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,501
-I await it.

247
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:28,535
[yelling]

248
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,535
GASHADOKURO: Lady
Hagoromo Gitsume!

249
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:31,535
Are you here?

250
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,535
Where are you?

251
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:36,001
I'm coming to your rescue!

252
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,035
-Just a moment.

253
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,501
This is the climax, Gashadokuro.

254
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:42,768
[laughing]

255
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,968
-So this is where you are,
Lady Hagoromo Gitsume!

256
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:54,801
[laughing]

257
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,201
-Just look.

258
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,701
You were too slow with this.

259
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:05,935
So Gashadokuro-- who was sealed
away for 400 years, mind you--

260
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,868
destroyed your wall.

261
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,401
Show me it now.

262
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:11,535
That ultimate nonsense.

263
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,001
PATO: What now, Akifusa?

264
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:15,501
AKIFUSA: Don't panic.

265
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,135
I'll attack her.

266
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:19,935
You two, cover me.

267
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:20,601
PATO: All right.

268
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:27,335
[grunting]

269
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,468
[chanting]

270
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,768
-My spirit lance
Kyoku is invincible,

271
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:39,182
even without the Hagun we
can still win this war.

272
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,101
-What's this?

273
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,201
I thought you were a human.

274
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:51,168
-Keikan [inaudible] jutsu
demonic possession lance.

275
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:51,735
Masatsugu.

276
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:54,435
Pato Let's go.

277
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:55,135
Follow me.

278
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,968
[groaning]

279
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:00,868
-That's it.

280
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,535
Keep invoking.

281
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,568
Never undo it while
you're in battle.

282
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,535
His fear is interesting.

283
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,435
It's pretty versatile.

284
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,935
[whistling]

285
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:13,901
-Nice one, Rikuo.

286
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:14,601
AWASHIMA: Rikuo!

287
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:15,535
I've got some bad news!

288
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:16,668
-Awashima.

289
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:19,568
-We just got word from
some Tono guys in Kyoto.

290
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,168
The onmyoji are losing!

291
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:25,535
Their top members
are already dead.

292
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:28,468
Hagoromo Gitsume
is taking the city.

293
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,435
You have a friend
in Kyoto, right?

294
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,735
You should go save
her right now.

295
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,435
-Rikuo.

296
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,101
-You're already strong enough to
cut through the village's fear,

297
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:37,668
you know!

298
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:45,568
[sighing]

299
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,501
[talking]

300
00:15:57,968 --> 00:15:59,568
-Kyoto, huh?

301
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:03,801
Kiromaru, His strength
was beyond expectations.

302
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:07,101
And there are more
guys like him in Kyoto.

303
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:10,401
Is there anyone in the Nura
clan capable of facing them?

304
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,601
-Sorry to interrupt.

305
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:17,668
-What the--

306
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,868
-How'd he get in?

307
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:20,268
-Rikuo?

308
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,768
-Why is that idiot
still hanging around?

309
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,935
He should have left
and not looked back.

310
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:26,501
-Just keep it down.

311
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,968
-I thought you would have
given up and left us by now.

312
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,168
Since you're not
dead yet, I assume

313
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,068
you've gotten a bit stronger.

314
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:36,735
RIKUO: At least a little.

315
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:40,435
My time here was short, but
I want to thank all of you

316
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:43,568
for training someone
as green as I am.

317
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,401
I'm very grateful to you.

318
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,501
To all of Tono village.

319
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:49,301
[gasps]

320
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,935
-You showed some
sincere graciousness.

321
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:53,868
Did someone teach
him good manners

322
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:57,768
so he could be on
friendly terms with us?

323
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:01,535
-He grew up hearing the heroic
tales about his grandfather.

324
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:04,435
The reality is that after
losing the previous head,

325
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:07,968
the Nuro clan has
been going downhill.

326
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,168
-Were you unaware of all that?

327
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:13,168
[laughing]

328
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:17,368
-Eight years ago, I was there
when my father was killed.

329
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,001
And I think I met
Hagoromo Gitsume.

330
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,701
[gasping]

331
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:25,735
-From that point on,
the Nura clan grew weak.

332

If that was Hagoromo Gitsume's
doing, it all connects.

That's why I'll be going
to Kyoto to see her again.

335

To end this deep rooted destiny.

super hot friend of his?

-What's that?

346
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:05,101
So you're saying that there
isn't anyone in this room that

347
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:08,868
wants front row seats for when I
become the Lord of Pandemonium?

Does anyone have the
guts to come with me?

That's all I'm asking of you.

you never get to Kyoto!

-Thank you for all you've done.

364
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,101
I'll be leaving now.

-He's just like him, huh?

The one who showed up grew
stronger almost overnight.

And left with some of
our guys just like.

Want to come, too, Akagappa?

-Nenekirimaru?

-We were told to return
it when you leave here.

-We completely forgot
about it, though.

are really strong.

I'll need lots of
help to do this.

-It's settled.

We all agreed to go if
he asked us to, right?

Why is he giving us orders?

my make-up with me.

And you're not
using Nenekirimaru?

for cutting bigger ayakashi.
