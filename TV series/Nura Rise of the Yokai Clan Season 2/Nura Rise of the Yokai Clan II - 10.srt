00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,361
But even so--

171
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,228
-Huh?

172
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,494
Mamiru.

173
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:39,628
-Ryuji, you're injured.

174
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:43,028
Yura said to come save you.

175
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,228
-Yura!

176
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,961
I managed to poison Akifusa.

177
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:50,694
He'll die if he doesn't take
the antidote within a minute.

178
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,661
Rip that yokai off!

179
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,494
[laughing]

180
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,194
[coughing]

181
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,261
-I've got it!

182
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,094
Let's go!

183
00:10:58,128 --> 00:10:59,094
Hagun attack!

184
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:04,961
-Huh?

185
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,428
-What's wrong?

186
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,794
You can't use it?

187
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:09,194
-Look, Ryuji.

188
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,361
She's better?

189
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:11,628
What a laugh.

190
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:14,294
-I thought the darkness in
his heart was big already,

191
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,261
but it's gotten larger.

192
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,661
-What's wrong?

193
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,928
Why aren't you doing anything?

194
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,161
[groaning]

195
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:24,094
-Move!

196
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:26,461
Come on, Hagun!

197
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,128
Why aren't you carrying
out my commands?

198
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,994
HAGUN: All the pleading in the
world wouldn't make us move.

199
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,261
-Huh?

200
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:36,961
-Hagun is unlike any
ordinary shikigami.

201
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,128
YURA: It talks?

202
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,961
-Just compose your
mind, oh gifted one.

203
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:43,628
And pray that those
gifts you possess

204
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,861
grow even more powerful.

205
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:53,661
-That's-- Hagun isn't just a
jutsu that summons the past

206
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,661
heads of the clan.

207
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:57,161
HAGUN: That's it.

208
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:01,728
Recite the words to
cleanse the evil.

209
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:04,261
RYUJI: By borrowing
the spiritual power

210
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:07,228
of our predecessors,
Yura's abilities--

211
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,028
YURA: Crush the demons.

212
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,061
Cleanse the evil.

213
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:17,728
RYUJI: Are amplified to
their greatest limits!

214
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:18,694
-Do it!

215
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:22,161
-Hagun, go!

216
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:24,128
[yelling]

217
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,796
-Hagun, go!

218
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,763

00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:44,263

00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,230
[groaning]

222
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,930
-Yura did it.

223
00:12:57,963 --> 00:12:59,896
[groaning]

224
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:06,530
-Akifusa.

225
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:10,263
-Ryuji.

226
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,230
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:13,096
-It's all right.

228
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,596
-That's very good, Yura.

229
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,130
-I've not forgotten
that face of yours.

230
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:23,730
[gasping]

231
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,563
-Not for a second.

232
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,263
In all of these 400 years.

233
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:29,863
-So we meet again.

234
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,563
It's been ages.

235
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,630
That's a lovely
host you've chosen.

236
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,396
-Hmph.

237
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,863
-Let's see now.

238
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,896
There's much to catch up on.

239
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,996
What do you say we
go out for a drink

240
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,563
and celebrate this
400 year reunion

241
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:45,696
between human and yokai?

242
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,630
No?

243
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,863
I thought not.

244
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,196
-What trick is this?

245
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,630
Humans live 80 years or so.

246
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:57,696
To be able to meet like this
after 400 years is impossible.

247
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,596
-Hm.

248
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,063
-I see.

249
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,863
This is some sort of jutsu.

250
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:09,230
Like the one you used
to ensnare me years ago.

251
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:09,696
-Yes.

252
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,763
It is.

253
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:13,363
This is the shikigami Hagun.

254
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,430
The onyo jutsu that
spelled your doom.

255
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:18,163
-Is it now?

256
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:23,496
And the one using this jutsu
is that young girl there?

257
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,063
-Why is that Hagun the
only one made of flesh?

258
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:28,796
-So what's with the interest?

259
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,796
I guess it has to do with
this level of spiritual power.

260
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,596
Which means that he must
be the famous 13th heir.

261
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,630
-What's he planning?

262
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:40,230
-Young lady.

263
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:43,430
Recite this spell when
I give the signal.

264
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:44,363
Don't look at me.

265
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:47,196
She'll notice.

266
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,663
-This is it.

267
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:51,430
-What do you hope to
do by overstepping

268
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,630
the boundaries of a yokai?

269
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:58,363
-There's no need for
you to know that.

270
00:14:58,396 --> 00:14:59,463
Ibaraki Doji.

271
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:00,630
Shokera.

272
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:03,430
Dispose of all of them.

273
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,763
-Now, Yura.

274
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,996
-Fog of confusion,
shroud all the humans!

275
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:18,696
-What's going on?

276
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,663
-We don't stand a chance now.

277
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:24,830
We'll retreat for the
night, little fox.

278
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:25,763
-Huh?

279
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:29,230
What do you think you're doing?

280
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,530
-Do you actually think
you can win this?

281
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,963
If you can't see the
difference in strength,

282
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:36,530
that makes you
nothing but a fool.

283
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:39,463
Descendants of the
Keikain, retreat now.

284
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:41,096
You cannot win.

285
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,030
[coughing]

286
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,463
-But the temple!

287
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:46,896
-What will happen to Kyoto?

288
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,263
[coughing]

289
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:51,296
-I remember.

290
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,196
Leave them.

291
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,230
They're not yours.

292
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:57,230
[music playing]

293
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:09,630
[wind blowing]

294
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:19,196
-This is really something else.

295
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,830
I wish that gramps would have
told me about this ship sooner.

296
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,063
-Master Rikuo.

297
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:24,896
It's time now.

298
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,096
-Right.

299
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,796
[laughing]

300
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,463
MALE SPEAKER: Drink up!

301
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,363
[laughing]

302
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:33,696
-Oh, oh, more.

303
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,630
-Oops.

304
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,430
Looks like we just
ran out of sake.

305
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,730
-Aw.

306
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,563
I thought for sure we had
enough to last until Kyoto.

307
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:42,930
-And Kyoto's still
pretty far away.

308
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,263
-Maybe this ship is just slow.

309
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,096
-All right.

310
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,196
Let's go complain about that.

311
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,463
And running out of sake, too.

312
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:52,330
-Yeah!

313
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,263
[talking]

314
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,230
-It's comfortable on this ship.

315
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,796
There's so much space.

316
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,896
-If an intruder got on
board, we'd never know.

317
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,630
-The ship's too slow.

318
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,530
That's not my problem.

319
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:06,763
-Yeah, yeah.

320
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:08,630
So how long until
we're in Kyoto?

321
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,563
-Well, I'd say long enough
for you little yokai

322
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,530
to play all night.

323
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,896
-Little yokai?

324
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,596
Hey, we may be a bit small,
but we're all yakos at heart.

325
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,596
-And we're yoaki to the end.

326
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,596
We're going to lead
the charge in to Kyoto.

327
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,463
-Is that so?

328
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:24,230
I take it back then.

329
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:27,396
I guess I struck a nerve there.

330

[yelling]

00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,596
-Was that just a rat
skittering around?

332
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,230
Can one of you go
and check things out?

333
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,630
-(LAUGHING) You act mature,
but you're still a girl.

334
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:39,696
-Hm?

335
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,196
-Huh?

336
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,696
-Huh!

337
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,863
-It's a Tono yokai.

338
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:46,563
-Hey.

339
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,796
Someone go talk to him.

340
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,696
[screaming]

341
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,596
[laughing]

342
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,063
-Hey!

343
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,230
Yukari!

344
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:56,896
[eating]

345
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,196
-Yeah.

346
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,796
I can fine even if
it's dark outside.

347
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,330
Want to know where we are, huh?

348
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:06,263
Hm.

349
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,230
-Well?

350
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,663
[laughing]

351
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:10,730
-Well.

352
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:12,496
Never been outside
Tono, so I have no idea.

353
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,996
[laughing]

354
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,330
-Huh?

355
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,296
-Oh.

356
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,930
I'm keen on the
outside world, though.

357
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:22,263
I know all about
the ayakashi side.

358
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:23,530
-He's no help.

359
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:26,196
-How much longer is
this trip going to take?

360
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,996
-Are there any other
yokai who know the area?

361
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,930
-Huh?

362
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:31,696
[yelling]

363
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,363
-Oh.

364
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,830
It's just you, Jami.

365
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,196
-I doubt he knows.

366
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,896
-Master Rikuo sure has a
mixed bag of friends, huh?

367
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,863
[giggling]

368
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:41,196
-Huh?

369
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,730
All right, I'm really going
to give you a taste of hell

370
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:44,296
this time!

371
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,030
Come back here!

372
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:45,663
-You're stinky!

373
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,096
-Get back here!

374
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,463
-Us, Jami, and the Tono.

375
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,663
It's great we're all going,
but is this going to work out?

376
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:55,463
-And we're up against
the infamous Kyoto yokai.

377
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:57,863
[groaning]

378
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,096
[clearing throat]

379
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,096
-Listen up, Tono group.

380
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,596
In the upcoming
engagement, Lord Shoei

381
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,763
of the Hihi Clan,
the great ape group,

382
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:08,263
will serve as our kashimoto.

383
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:11,030
Since he's still
inexperienced, I, Kurotabou,

384
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,830
will serve as chief strategist.

385
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,596
Does that meet your
approval, Master Rikuo?

386
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,330
-That sounds fine.

387
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:19,463
-It's settled then.

388
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:22,196
The main family will be
acting under my orders.

389
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,263
As for the Tono group, your
job once we're in Kyoto

390
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:25,930
will be to--

391
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,063
-Hold on there.

392
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:29,830
Why are you ordering all
of us Tono yokai around

393
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:32,796
like we're your subordinates?

394
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,963
-Didn't you exchange
cups of loyalty?

395
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:37,696
-Loyalty?

396
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,830
You've got to be kidding!

397
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:41,063
We Tono don't pledge
allegiance to anyone!

398
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,096
-Then why did you leave Tono?

399
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,463
-Why?

400
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:46,096
It's because-- uh.

401
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,096
The reason was--

402
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,663
-Rikuo asked us.

403
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,830
His invocation and
possession aren't there yet.

404
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:57,330
He wouldn't last too long
without our help, right?

405
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,563
-I see.

406
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,263
I thank you for that.

407
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:02,830
But don't speak like
you're on equal terms.

408
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,663
[sighing]

409
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:10,630
-(LAUGHING) I can see now
that the Nura clan really is

410
00:20:10,663 --> 00:20:11,596
in decline.

411
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,263
With aides like
you around, there's

412
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,063
no way that Rikuo will
ever get any stronger.

413
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:19,130
-I've had just about enough
of all this disrespect!

414
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,430
-Women ought to shut up!

415
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,263
-Well!

416
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:22,963
Wouldn't that apply to you, too?

417
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:23,830
-Of course not!

418
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:25,830
It's not like I'm
always a woman!

419
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:26,663
-Get along, guys.

420
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:27,330
-Enough.

421
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:28,430
-Huh?

422
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,996
-You should watch your
mouths, all of you.

423
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,863
Master Rikuo, may
I ask you to leave

424
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:33,963
the room for just a second?

425
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:34,796
-Huh

426
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,963
-What's up?

427
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:36,463
-Huh?

428
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:36,963
-Go on.

429
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:37,596
It's OK.

430
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,730
-What was that all about?

431
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:46,363
Is there something that he
just doesn't want me to hear?

432
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,696
-Listen closely.

433
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,596
There's no doubt
that the Nora clan

434
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,496
was at the height of its
power during the Edo period.

435
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,963
Master Rikuo's
father led us then.

436
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:58,330
Reigned in the
lawless Kanto yokai

437
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:01,063
and was called the greatest
in the Ayakashi world.

438
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:01,630
-Huh?

439
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:02,430
He's changed.

440
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:03,996
-What the-- what's with him?

441
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,196
-He was a different
person was Rikuo.

442
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,763
-Yeah.

443
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:07,696
What about it?

444
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,763
It's in the past.

445
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,096
It doesn't matter.

446
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,430
Only the present matters.

447
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:15,763
And I'm worried now that you
guys are going to hold us back.

448
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:18,563
The young master
of a yokai yakuza

449
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:21,430
didn't know how to
invoke or possess.

450
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,796
Why didn't anyone teach him?

451
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,496
The answer-- no one knew how.

452
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,463
And we're supposed to
follow your orders?

453
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,230
It makes me sick.

454
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:32,363
-Hm.

455
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:34,630
Living in ignorance
isn't a good thing.

456
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:39,196
Didn't you learn that in
your hometown of Tono?

457
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,763
You with the sickles, allow
me to teach you manners.

458
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:43,963
Step outside.

459
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:45,763
-Don't be foolish, Kubinashi.

460
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:47,430
Keep your temper in check.

461
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:50,363
Reign it in like we are.

462
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:51,830
-What the heck?

463
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,830
[wind blowing]

464
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:57,830
-We're better than you.

465
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:01,463
If you don't think so, try me.

466
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:04,896
[laughing]

467
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,396
[banging]

468
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:06,963
-What?

469
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:09,063
What's going on?

470
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:11,030
-He's lost his mind!

471
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,463
-Itaku, just let it go!

472
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,213
[music playing]

473
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:03,134
-Apologize for
belittling the Nura clan.

474
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:05,668
-It's been quite a
while, Tsuchigumo.

475
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,434
-The Tono bow to no one!

476
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:11,434
-So this is what it's like to
have a battle of fear, huh?
