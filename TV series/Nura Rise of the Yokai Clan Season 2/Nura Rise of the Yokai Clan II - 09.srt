[theme music]

2
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:56,111
-Hey, quit dragging
your feet there, Rikuo.

3
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,283
-Hey, could you guys
slow down a little?

4
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,249
-In your dreams.

5
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:03,449
You know what?

6
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:06,216
You're really useless when
you turn into a human.

7
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,916
-I'm doing My best.

8
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:10,183
Maybe we should have just
taken the train back.

9
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:11,549
AWASHIMA: You moron.

10
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,416
Like yokai could ride the train.

11
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,749
Just pick up the pace.

12
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,116
-Awashima, wait.

13
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,116
Huh?

14
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:18,583
Whoa.

15
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,049
-It's faster this way.

16
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,516
RIKUO: Hey, wait.

17
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:22,983
Quit it, Itaku.

18
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:23,949
This is embarrassing.

19
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:34,616
-Hey, are we getting attacked?

20
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:36,249
-Huh?

21
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,383
-So this is the Nura
Clan's base, huh?

22
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,849
-It's a lot bigger
than I pictured.

23
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:41,583
-We finally made it.

24
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,416
-Good All this sweat's
melting me way.

25
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:45,783
-It's Master Rikuo.

26
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:46,583
-You're right.

27
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:47,716
It is master.

28
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,183
-He's back home!

29
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,083
-Anyway, we're in
the right place.

30
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,649
-It was a long trip.

31
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:53,883
-Is there a swamp here?

32
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,016
-Hey, Rikuo.

33
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,316
It's nighttime
now, thanks to you.

34
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,016
-He couldn't help that.

35
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,183
He's human during
the day after all.

36
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,316
-Even so--

37
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,383
-And you turn into a weasel.

38
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,016
-They were really cute together.

39
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,249
-Who the hell are they?

40
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:10,516
-They're awfully casual there.

41
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,249
-Welcome home, Master Rikuo.

42
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:14,449
-Who might you be?

43
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,116
Only members of
the Nura Clan are

44
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,816
permitted into the main house.

45
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:18,649
-Wow.

46
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,316
They actually call him master.

47
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,949
-They really spoil him here.

48
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,483
You got a problem, monk?

49
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:26,483
We're not looking for a sermon.

50
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:29,583
-How dare you mock the Nura
Clan strike team leader.

51
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:30,349
-Hey.

52
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:31,583
I don't care who you are.

53
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:33,216
But don't treat me
like some woman!

54
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:33,949
You got that?

55
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:35,083
-Woman?

56
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,149
Sorry I-- I didn't
realize you were a lady.

57
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:38,983
-For now.

58
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:39,616
-Huh?

59
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,116
-Hands off, perv!

60
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:42,749
-What was that for?

61
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:43,816
-Ha.

62
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,683
You oversee the Kanto
region from here?

63
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:48,383
So where do you guys
usually go to train?

64
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,183
-Hey!

65
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,149
Off the cherry blossom tree,

66
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:53,716
-You know, you smell bad.

67
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,049
-You don't sugarcoat
things, do you?

68
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,949
I'm gonna give you a
little taste of hell!

69
00:03:58,983 --> 00:03:59,449
-You stink!

70
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:07,416
-Aw, hey.

71
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,216
This isn't a swamp.

72
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:11,716
Who are you?

73
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,383
I'm a numakappa.

74
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,316
Name's Amezo.

75
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:14,983
-Huh?

76
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:15,949
Me?

77
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:17,283
I'm a kappa too.

78
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:20,649
My name's uh-- I've
never thought about it.

79
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,949
-You know, this rock is
pretty good for training.

80
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,716
-Wha?

81
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:28,183
Who in the world are they?

82
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,949
-And what do they
think they're doing?

83
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:32,216
-Master Rikuo?

84
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,349
-What's the meaning of all this?

85
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:35,983
-They're my friends.

86
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,549
I'm gonna go tell Gramps
that I'm back now.

87
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,483
Look after them for me.

88
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:42,416
-Are they yokai from Tono?

89
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,416
-Master, you're going to Kyoto?

90
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,683
-Of course.

91
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,283
Those who've swore their
loyalty should get ready to go.

92
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:55,549
-Rikuo, so you're back now.

93
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,716
-Yeah.

94
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:00,683
-Did you learn anything?

95
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,383
-Hard to say.

96
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:06,416
Well I get what a
Nurarihyon is now.

97
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,516
That's something.

98
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,683
-I see.

99
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:11,016
So--

100
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,549
-Let's right.

101
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,783
I'm leaving for Kyoto.

102
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:20,016
-Hm?

103
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:29,116
-Not bad at all, Rikuo.

104
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:32,549
I guess you can do
what you want then,

105
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,083
just bring back some
yatsuhashi treats.

106
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,549
-So you're not
against it anymore?

107
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,283
-Go, and cut out
threads of fate.

108
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:45,649
When you get back,
you'll be the Third Heir.

109
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,183
Oh, right.

110
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,383
When you get there, you
should see Hidemoto.

111
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,849
-Hidemoto?

112
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:53,916
And who's that, Gramps?

113
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,549
-You should ask
that onmyoji girl.

114
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,049
-Plan a victory banquet.

115
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,416
I'll be back.

116
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,483
What's all this?

117
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,716
Looks like you guys
are getting along now.

118
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:09,283
-He's back.

119
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:10,116
-That was fast.

120
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,949
-Should we get going now?

121
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:13,949
-Of course.

122
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,516
We're hitting the road.

123
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:17,916
-Hold on.

124
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:18,683
-Really?

125
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:19,849
What is it?

126
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:21,349
We're trying to leave here.

127
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:24,249
-I want to show you
something special first.

128
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,216
It won't take long.

129
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,016
They came the minute
I called them.

130
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:34,416
-What?

131
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,449
-What?

132
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,849
What is that?!

133
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:45,249
-Allow me to present
our strategic yokai

134
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:49,216
airbase, the Treasure Ship,
and our [inaudible] house boats

135
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,649
too.

136
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:52,549
For centuries
they've been pretty

137
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,016
handy to have on long journeys.

138
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,949
Rikuo, Kyoto really is
something else, especially when

139
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,283
you have a chance to see
it from up in the skies.

140
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:03,183
-Wow.

141
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,616
-Man, I'm impressed.

142
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,783
They sure don't look weak to me.

143
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:07,949
-Hey, Gramps.

144
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:09,683
I never knew about this.

145
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,949
-We're here!

146
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:16,949
Look, Shima.

147
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,383
The signs white,
not the usual red!

148
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,216
And Nowson's is black on white!

149
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:22,516
That's Kyoto for you.

150
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:24,449
They've got an eye for style!

151
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:27,416
We're finally in
the old capital!

152
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,349
Everyone, welcome to Kyoto!

153
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,783
-Someone's peppy.

154
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,649
-I wanna be a Mito girl.

155
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:33,749
-We made it.

156
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:35,716
-We're short a few,
but isn't it exciting?

157
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,583
I can't wait to get started.

158
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:38,549
-You mean Rikuo?

159
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,049
Forget him.

160
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,416
KIYOTSUGU: DOn't you worry.

161
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:43,816
I'm sure Nura will
catch up later.

162
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,083
-You think so?

163
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,549
By the way, why are we starting
off this trip at night?

164
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,716
-It's a yokai tour, Ienaga.

165
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,249
-A yokai tour?

166
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,416
KIYOTSUGU: There's no point
in investigating temples

167
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,583
and shrines when it's crowded.

168
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,316
IENAGA: I shouldn't have come.

169
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,016
-It's creepy wherever you look.

170
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,549
Can't you just feel
all the yokai aura?

171
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,783
-I think so.

172
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:10,149
It's so cool here.

173
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:12,916
-I've done a lot of
research about Kyoto.

174
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,283
Records show that 234 people
jumped off [inaudible] Temple!

175
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:19,183
And 85% of them survived.

176
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,116
-Wow.

177
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:21,049
KIYOTSUGU: 85%, Shima.

178
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,949
SHIMA: That's amazing.

179
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,049
-Hold on.

180
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,216
Where did Tori and Maki go?

181
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:26,383
They're not here.

182
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,016
-Huh?

183
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:27,683
The restroom maybe?

184
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,449
[chuckling]

185
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,383
-We're in the luck, brother.

186
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,016
-Fresh, human livers
on the menu again.

187
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,616
New Kyoto's a fun place.

188
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,016
[laughter]

189
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,749
-Huh?

190
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,649
-What?

191
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:56,616
-Hey.

192
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,549
That lantern there,
it's still lit.

193
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,283
-What was that?

194
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:03,849
Ienaga, that's a--
a Tadamori Lanter.

195
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,949
-Tadamori Lantern?

196
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,416
What's that?

197
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:11,449
-Well it's a legend
here at Kusaka Shrine.

198
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,583
Tadamori saw a lantern, and went
to dispatch the yokai holding

199
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:16,449
it, but it was
really a watchman.

200
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:17,749
-Oh.

201
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:20,083
-Doesn't that sound like
a suspicious lantern?

202
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,616
Let's go check it out.

203
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:22,383
-Hold on there.

204
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,683
It's the opposite of that.

205
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:24,749
-Huh?

206
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:26,716
-He's just jumped
to conclusions.

207
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:30,049
There's actually no yokai
in the legend, is there?

208
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,483
-You're absolutely right!

209
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:33,083
What a huge mistake.

210
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,549
There's no reason for
us to be here then!

211
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,716
-Kiyotsugu.

212
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,216
-Dummy.

213
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:39,383
-Shima, call her.

214
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,683
-Huh?

215
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:43,183
-Call Yura, and ask her to
come pick us up right away.

216
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,449
-Are you saying that you
didn't book any rooms for us?

217
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:46,516
KIYOTSUGU: Of course not.

218
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:47,983
He family's here.

219
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,816
-Hey, we're done here, right?

220
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:51,330
Let's--

221
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,497
It's glowing.

222
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,291
I'm scared. It's like I'm
going to be swallowed up

223
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:00,957
by the darkness.

224
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,391
-There's another one around,
just like our brother said.

225
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:14,905
-Yeah.

226
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:19,205
It's been a good night for
us, one feast after another.

227
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:21,838
-Yokai!

228
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,871
-Not so fast.

229
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,838
You're the main entree.

230
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:25,771
-You should be honored.

231
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:26,271
[chuckling]

232
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:26,771
-Get down!

233
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,305
-Ayakashi infesting
Kyoto, sink into darkness!

234
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,305
Explode!

235
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:38,805
[screaming]

236
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:45,571
-Run for it!

237
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:46,771
What were you doing?

238
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:49,205
We sent out a warning to
not walk around at night!

239
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:50,171
-Wait.

240
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,671
I know that voice.

241
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,638
Yura?

242
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,471
-You're so slow.

243
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:55,271
Ow.

244
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:56,271
I oughtta leave you behind.

245
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,238
-I'm coming.

246
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,338
Don't get so worked up.

247
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:02,105
The map said Kusaka
Shrine, right?

248
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,138
-Worked up?

249
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:04,738
If something happens
to them, we won't

250
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,738
be able to face Master Rikuo.

251
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:10,838
-I guess it does feel kind
of dangerous around here.

252
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:13,605
-The ayakashi invasion of
Kyoto is getting so bad

253
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,005
that it's beyond the
onmyoji's control.

254
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:19,871
I should have stopped them,
or gone along with them.

255
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,071
-Is that Yuki Onna?

256
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:22,771
-Look.

257
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:23,938
It's the onmyoji girl.

258
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:24,838
She's all yours!

259
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,071
-What's going on here?

260
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:27,771
-Kurata?

261
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,307
-Why'd you come, yokai?

262
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,640
-We had to, for Master Rikuo.

263
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:34,207
-How could you onmyoji
let Kyoto get this bad?

264
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,640
-You're one to talk.

265
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:38,007
Go ask your own kind, yokai.

266
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,707
-Tori, Maki!

267
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,007
-Gather all around
and freeze, my minons.

268
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
A cold greeting for our guests.

269
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:47,807
-Shikigami Rentei,
become my strength,

270
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,240
and vanquish the
darkness before me!

271
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,707
[chuckling]

272
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,173
-We'll devour you all!

273
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,107
-We're Kyoto yokai!

274
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:07,740
-Whoa.

275
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,473
That was close.

276
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:10,973
What's going on here?

277
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:13,740
Why are they attacking
humans out in the open?

278
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:17,107
I heard the rumors about
Kyoto, onmyoji girl.

279
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,240
Have things really
gotten this out of hand?

280
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,707
-Yura?

281
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,273
Is that Oikawa with you?

282
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,207
-Maybe.

283
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,040
-You OK?

284
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:28,040
-Yura?

285
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:30,040
What perfect timing.

286
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:34,640
We were just about to head
on over to your place.

287
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:37,207
-Hey, where's the restroom?

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,273
-Why are you all here?

289
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:42,740
This isn't a good
time to be in Kyoto.

290
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:43,373
-Huh?

291
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,373
What do you mean?

292
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,407
-Kyoto is about to the
overrun by ayakashi.

293
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,441
-Is that true?

294
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:04,774
Your brothers, Keikain Clan's
top three onmyoji are all dead?

295
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,241
-I don't know.

296
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:08,641
It all happened
inside a barrier.

297
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:12,507
But we can't find them, and
the Third Seal's broken.

298
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,741
ayakashi are now able to
enter the city as they please.

299
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,707
It's not safe.

300
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,274
-What exactly does
this all mean?

301
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:24,707
-Right now, the ayakashi
are only active at night,

302
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:28,207
so the Keikain Clan has issued
a general warning to stay away

303
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,441
from shrines and
temples after dark.

304
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:35,774
-And we headed
straight for one too.

305
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:39,307
-But it the two remaining
seals really do get broken,

306
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:42,507
and they enter into
new Nijo Castle,

307
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,074
then that's the
point of no return.

308
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:48,674
That's just what I predict.

309
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:52,474
The entire city will be
swallowed by darkness.

310
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:57,274
If that happens, ayakashi could
run rampant through Kyoto, no.

311
00:13:57,307 --> 00:14:00,407
Through all of Japan!

312
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:03,541
-I-- I didn't know
how bad it was.

313
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:06,107
I should cancel the yokai tour.

314
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:09,841
YURA: It's a good thing I was
training in Madoyama park.

315
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:10,807
-Training?

316
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,041
-Mhm.

317
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:15,174
Although I can't say I've
completely mastered it.

318
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:19,307
But this isn't the time
for second thoughts.

319
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,874
In any case, you
should be safe here.

320
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,574
-Hey, where are you going?

321
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,141
-Don't tell me.

322
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,107
-To Sokokuji Temple.

323
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,641
They'll be there tonight.

324
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,341
-You don't have to go.

325
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:31,174
-I'm with her.

326
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,241
You're still just a kid, Yura.

327
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,474
-Some of us haven't fought.

328
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,274
Some chose to save
their own lives.

329
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:42,941
Still, we are onmyoji
of the Keikain Clan.

330
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:48,474
We face our enemies,
and we don't run away.

331
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:51,174
-But Yura--

332
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:52,674
-Oh no.

333
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,474
You know, now that
I think about it,

334
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:56,607
we're stuck here
in onmyoji central.

335
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:57,241
-Oh shit.

336
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,241
You're right.

337
00:14:59,274 --> 00:14:59,907
-I mean--

338
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,074
-Don't mind us.

339
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:06,741
We're just-- Master Rikuo,
please come quickly.

340
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:12,141
-Amazing.

341
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:18,774
-Yura, we have a duty
to protect Kyoto.

342
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,141
Do you understand, Yura?

343
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:24,874
It is the duty of those
who possess the gift.

344
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,341
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Akifusa, He taught me

345
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,907
what it means to be an onmyoji.

346
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:31,941
He's the most gifted of us all.

347
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,941
I still can't believe
he was defeated.

348
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,541
I hope he's alive somewhere.

349
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:37,307
-It's them!

350
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:39,041
They're here!

351
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,874
A barrier has them.

352
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:41,441
-All right.

353
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,807
Stay focused.

354
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:44,507
-Damn this thing.

355
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,941
I can't get through.

356
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,307
What's going on!?

357
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:52,041
-This is a Fukuju Style
Barrier created by 30 men.

358
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:55,974
it won't break so easily,
unless my weapon is what's used.

359
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,241
-Stand strong!

360
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:01,707
Remember what
happened to Masatsugu!

361
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,807
MAN: They broke
through the barrier!

362
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:13,274
-But that's impossible.

363
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,274
-Well, well.

364
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:15,941
it's Yura.

365
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:24,207
-Masatsugu, my son
is still alive.

366
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,541
-Masatsugu!

367
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:27,907
Pato!

368
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:31,641
Are those-- you're kidding me!

369
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:32,741
-Hey, look.

370
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,315
The onmyoji are scared
out of their minds.

371
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,540
-Let's just get on with this.

372
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,807
I can't wait!

373
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,773
-We're gonna skewer every
single one of you onmyoji.

374
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:43,040
-Their barrier is gone.

375
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:43,840
Go.

376
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:45,607
Kill them all.

377
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,607
-Akifusa?

378
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,907
-Why is he helping
out the ayakashi?

379
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,040
-Our joint barrier
has collapsed!

380
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:55,473
-Switch to individual ones!

381
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:58,407
-There's no time!

382
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,873
-How did you?

383
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:00,840
-It went right through.

384
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:02,040
Look at that.

385
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:03,007
This is awesome.

386
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,673
Their Kekkai Barrier
is like paper.

387
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:09,607
This is gonna be so easy.

388
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,707
YURA: Shikigami Tanro,
Shikigami Rokuson, Bukyoku.

389
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,640
Stay back!

390
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:20,773
-No way.

391
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,440
She summoned all those
Shikigami on her own?

392
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:24,573
-Are you serious?

393
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:25,807
-That's amazing.

394
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,507
-They're coming!

395
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,807
-What is that?!

396
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,273
-An elephant?

397
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:35,207
-An elephant Shikigami?

398
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,873
YURA: Hyoman, keep going!

399
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:43,807
-Impressive as always.

400
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,040
You're able to summon so
many at one given time.

401
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:51,140
You're indeed a prodigy.

402
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,140
-Akifusa, tell me.

403
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,307
What happened?

404
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,073
It's crazy.

405
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,907
We have to stop them.

406
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,707
They're yokai, right?

407
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,607
Fukuku Style's about defense.

408
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,907
They're helpless
without their barriers.

409
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,573
-The yokai received
weapons that grow in power

410
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:11,773
the more they use them, from me.

411
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:15,740
-How could an onmyoji like
you lend his power to yokai?

412
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,107
Snap out of it, Akifusa!

413
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,807
-Yokai are darkness,
and we are light, Yura.

414
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,007
-You're the one who
taught me that one truth!

415
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,173
-You're wide open.

416
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:30,173
-He got me.

417
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,107
I'm finished.

418
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,607
-Gengen.

419
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:43,807
You overdid it.

420
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,407
You don't stand a
chance against him

421
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,640
if you divide your strength.

422
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:48,573
-Big brother.

423
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,573
-He's the worst one who
could have turned against us.

424
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:01,173
We can't hold out until
sunrise 27th Heir.

425
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,673
How long can you
maintain those Shikigami?

426
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:07,840
-If it's just three or
so, until morning time.

427
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:10,840
-Your willpower's
ridiculous, as always.

428
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,607
In any case, protect our allies.

429
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,573
RYUJI (VOICEOVER): I'm
probably a better choice

430
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:18,073
for this fight anyway.

431
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:19,007
-Big brother?

432
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,307
-Yura, Mamiru's
at the rear gate,

433
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,440
but he should be here soon.

434
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:26,914
Tell him this--
find the mastermind.

435
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,814
He must be watching
from the darkness.

436
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:33,481
He's the one who
corrupted Akifusa.

437
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,081
YURA: I knew it.

438
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,214
So that means one
of the ayakashi

439
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:38,881
is controlling Akifusa.

440
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:41,081
-Not quite.

441
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,181
It's thanks to the Yaso Style.

442
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,914
Its nature was like
that from the start.

443
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:47,414
It's a gray one.

444
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:49,014
-A gray one?

445
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,048
-He's coming.

446
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:50,581
Go, Yura.

447
00:19:56,948 --> 00:19:58,314
-Ryuji.

448
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:02,648
I never thought that
you'd protect Yura.

449
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:06,214
-Well the thing is,
it's about talent.

450
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,414
You're really good,
but she's better.

451
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:26,214
-Ryuji, you've always
disapproved of me, of the way

452
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:30,214
I do things, of my
passion as an onmyoji!

453
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:33,448
And you know, I've always
longed to stand face

454
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:36,148
to face against you.

455
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,681
-So you've completely
given into it.

456
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:43,114
Will everyone who's
gifted suffer this fate?

457
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:48,481
If they do, the tragedy's
too much, Akifusa.

458
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,681
We've known each
other our whole lives.

459
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:56,414
I thought we were
family, or, maybe not.

462
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:05,114
-So the blood and
tears were fake.

463
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,914
I should have known.

464
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,081
-You should have.

465
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,381
I'm a liar after all.

466
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:13,448
To think that I have to
kill you with my own hands.

467
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,914
I'm overwhelmed with sadness.

NARRATOR: Kana the Reader Model.

470
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:53,701
-Hey, Kana.

471
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:54,868
We saw it.

472
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:57,401
-Hey, I heard that Ienaga
was a reader model.

473
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:58,201
-For real?

474
00:22:58,234 --> 00:22:59,467
-She's cute!

475
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:02,067
-And she's one of the top
three cutest in our grade!

476
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,867
IENAGA (VOICEOVER):
Oh, what am I gonna do?

477
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:06,334
I'm in the spotlight
all of sudden.

478
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,801
It's kind of embarrassing.

479
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,267
Don't let it bother you.

480
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,667
Blushing over it is stupid.

481
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:13,667
Just act naturally.

482
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:14,567
-Kana?

483
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,534
-Rikuo.

484
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,734
IENAGA (VOICEOVER):
Did he see it?

485
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,601
I wonder if he did.

486
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:19,167
Wait.

487
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,901
Am I blushing?

00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:24,334
But I see him every day!

-Kana, there's no
club activities today,

490
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,401
so I'm heading on home.

00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:30,267
You wanna go together?

Sure.

00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,534
