[theme music]

2
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:00,607
-It's Gyuki.

3
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,821
-It's Mt. Nejireme's Gyuki.

4
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:07,440
-Who is your leader?

5
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:10,874
Because I, Gyuki,
will take him on.

6
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:14,407
-I always figured you
were the overeager type.

7
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,740
-Commander.

8
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:16,874
-The wolf.

9
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,840
I'd like a scarf.

10
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:20,574
-I'm honored I could help.

11
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:31,574
-Fall back!

12
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,574
Fall back!

13
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,040
-Get him.

14
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:45,140
-Take this.

15
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:48,007
-Show him not to mess
with the Nura Clan.

16
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,407
-Glorious.

17
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,807
-It is, Yuki Onna.

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,240
I mean, after all,
it is my clan.

19
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:56,307
-No.

20
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,607
I was referring to
you, Lord Nurarihyon,

21
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,274
my dear Supreme Commander.

22
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,340
-Now stop it.

23
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:04,774
Are you trying to kill me?

24
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:08,174
-Oh, one time isn't going
to be the end of the world.

25
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,974
Just one kiss.

26
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,574
-Another time.

27
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,007
It looks like things are over.

28
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,374
Excellent work, guys.

29
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,840
We beat them all.

30
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:27,474
-Yeah!

31
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,807
NARRATOR: During the Keicho
era, many ambitious yokai,

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
far and wide,
traveled to Kyoto--

33
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:36,874
which was known as a center
for yokai since ancient times--

34
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:38,840
to see who could reign supreme.

35
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,574
-That was a powerful group.

36
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,474
-So they're the Nura Clan.

37
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:49,107
-Yokai from all over Japan,
from the north to the south,

38
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,940
are gathering here.

39
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,774
We need to become stronger.

40
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,407
We need a greater power.

41
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,374
MAN: I beg you, Princess Yo.

42
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,340
Please save my son.

43
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,940
Princess Yo.

44
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:06,240
-It hurts.

45
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,807
It hurts.

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,507
It hurts.

47
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,174
-You'll be fine.

48
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:11,907
I promise.

49
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,274
The pain will fade soon.

50
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:31,540
-My goodness.

51
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:32,440
-Father.

52
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:33,774
-It's a miracle.

53
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,307
And all the doctors said
he wouldn't make it.

54
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,707
Princess, you are a
child of the gods.

55
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:45,607
Thank you so much.

56
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,707
Thank you so much.

57
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,807
Please accept this.

58
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,307
GUARD: Stop right there.

59
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,440
-Please, sir.

60
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:05,107
Please ask the Princess
to cure this child.

61
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,074
I beg you.

62
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,540
He'll die if she doesn't.

63
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,740
-No.

64
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,107
What point is there in
curing peasants like you?

65
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,507
-What point?

66
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,474
-Princess Yo, if
only she'd come.

67
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:19,974
-Her father will never agree
to help us, not without money.

68
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,907
-I have money for you.

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
-And who are you?

70
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:26,874
-If it's money you
want, I have some.

71
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:30,374
I'll happily give it to you in
exchange for something else.

72
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:37,374
-What is this?

73
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,107
-I want a liver.

74
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,940
[scream]

75
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,207
-Are you unhurt, my dear?

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,374
You're my treasure.

77
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,774
If you were to be
injured or die, I'd--

78
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,607
-I'm all right, father.

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,574
-I'm paying you a
fortune here so keep

80
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,407
those fiends out of the estate.

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,740
Is that clear, Lord Keikain?

82
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,974
-Perfectly clear.

83
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,474
I'll call my most skilled--

84
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:28,807
KOREMITSU (VOICEOVER): The
yokai glorifying human livers.

85
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,540
There are ancient tales in China
of yokai seeking Genjo Sanzo's

86
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:35,507
organs so they could
attain immortality.

87
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,274
Infants, priestesses,
princesses--

88
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,174
ayakashi believe that the
more precious the life,

89
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,640
the stronger it will
make their powers.

90
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,340
So that's what they pursue.

91
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:50,107
More ayakashi are looking
for human livers by the day.

92
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,607
I wonder if that
rumor is tied to it,

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,840
the one about the Lord of
Pandemonium nesting in Osaka.

94
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:01,107
PRINCESS YO: Poor thing.

95
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,040
FATHER: Increase the
number of patrols at once.

96
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:07,040
GUARD: Yes, my Lord.

97
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:09,740
-Princess Yo, the one
residing in that estate,

98
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:12,840
they say she has the power
to cure the incurable.

99
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:15,807
I hear that her beauty
is without equal.

100
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,974
And if you can manage to eat
a liver of a woman like that,

101
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,774
the power you'll gain
will be tremendous.

102
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:22,674
-Her liver.

103
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:23,874
Her liver.

104
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,307
-That human's liver will
help us conquer the world.

105
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,507
-Princess Yo, huh?

106
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,374
PRINCESS YO: Exorcist Blade?

107
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,207
-The sword imbued
with onmyoji power.

108
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,874
Every time the sword cuts
a yokai, it grows stronger.

109
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,907
The number of those
that desire your power

110
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,674
grows daily, Princess.

111
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:56,107
Please, carry this just in case.

112
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,740
-Very well.

113
00:07:58,774 --> 00:07:59,640
-If you'll excuse me.

114
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,174
-How did it all come to this?

115
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:14,474
Father has changed as well.

116
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:15,940
All because of my power.

117
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,340
-So beautiful.

118
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:23,840
Who would've thought that
a mournful look could

119
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,474
be so attractive
in the moonlight.

120
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,174
-A thief?

121
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:32,574
How did--

122
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:33,907
-It was true.

123
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,774
Like they said, a
drop-dead beauty.

124
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,007
-What?

125
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,440
-I want you, Princess Yo.

126
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:44,640
PRINCESS YO: No, let me go.

127
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:49,207
What-- what are you doing?

128
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,140
-Karasu Tengu was right.

129
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:52,607
You're a gorgeous woman.

130
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,307
PRINCESS YO (VOICEOVER):
An ayakashi?

131
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,540
Is he after my liver?

132
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,207
This can't be.

133
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,707
-No!

134
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,674
-I thought that
you were fragile,

135
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:07,048
but you're pretty--

136
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:15,039
Hold
on, that's a Spirit Blade?

137
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:27,359
-Good.

138
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,793
It stopped.

139
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:30,726
-Just what are you?

140
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,159
KOREMITSU (VOICEOVER):
Yokai aura.

141
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,459
It can't be.

142
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:44,459
KOREMITSU: Princess,
are you all right?

143
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:45,793
-Nurarihyon.

144
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,493
-What?

145
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:51,459
-That's what everybody calls me.

146
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:54,093
Princess, you're not boring.

147
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:54,759
I'll be back.

148
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,259
KOREMITSU: Did something happen?

149
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,559
Princess.

150
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,859
-N--nothing at
all, Lord Keikain.

151
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:06,859
I'm fine.

152
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,726
Thank you though.

153
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,126
KOREMITSU (VOICEOVER):
Did I imagine it?

154
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,100
But still--

155
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:18,933
-Princess Yo.

156
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,489
-So that's the situation.

157
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:32,989
The streets are teeming
with lawless ronin gangs.

158
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:36,055
There are muggers
and kidnappers.

159
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,655
And on top of that,
it's said that they

160
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:43,622
have been eviscerating
infants as well.

161
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,822
HAGOROMO: There's no need
to report such details.

162
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,389
-Of course.

163
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,822
-We, the Toyotomi family, are
facing grave circumstances

164
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,589
at this time.

165
00:10:53,622 --> 00:11:00,222
Our plan to fight the
Tokugawa-- it's ready, yes?

166
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:04,822
-Lady Yodo, Osaka Castle is
rumored to-- [clears throat]

167
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,422
There are reports of
yokai coming and going.

168
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:08,722
-What?

169
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,855
-This may have an impact
on our family's reputation.

170
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:18,255
-Don't tell me you actually
believe in such nonsense.

171
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:19,689
-No.

172
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,689
I'm certain that it is
merely wild speculation.

173
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:23,455
-It must be.

174
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:35,622
To think, with
Hideyoshi dead now,

175
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:39,455
the Toyotomi already find
themselves on the road to ruin.

176
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:42,289
His successor
Hideyori is so inept,

177
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:45,189
we've no hope of
ruling this country.

178
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:49,122
As it stands now,
our plain will fail.

179
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:50,622
We need more power.

180
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:58,189
If the Tokugawa rules Japan,
then yokai will suffer.

181
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:00,322
That much is certain.

182
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:02,189
-Lady Yodo.

183
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,043
-Yes, that's the answer.

184
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:20,322
For the sake of this unborn
child, I need a greater power.

185
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,989
Search for it, and
bring it here-- a liver

186
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:26,789
from a nobler human.

187
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:30,222
One worthy for me,
Hagoromo Gitsune.

188
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,989
KOREMITSU: Princess, is
everything all right?

189
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,922
PRINCESS YO: Yes, it is.

190
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,122
I am fine.

191
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:44,989
-If anything happens,
please summon me at once.

192
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:45,655
-I will.

193
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,689
Thank you.

194
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,622
KOREMITSU (VOICEOVER):
It's a minuscule amount,

195
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:53,222
but I sense some yokai
aura around the Princess.

196
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,189
No.

197
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,855
There exists no
yokai who can break

198
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:58,989
though our reinforced barrier.

199
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,155
Unless it's--

200
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,222
-Every day is stifling.

201
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:14,222
-The onmyoji are working
hard, just like last night.

202
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:22,955
-How is it you're getting in?

203
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:27,255
Where did you get my
father's pipe from?

204
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,222
-It's nice.

205
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:30,022
And I assume it
cost a lot of money

206
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:33,855
too, which his caged
bird earned him, right?

207
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,722
-Don't talk like that.

208
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:39,055
It can't be helped.

209
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,522
It is my destiny after all.

210
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:50,022
-Hey, you want to go out?

211
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,889
-Huh?

212
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,055
-You do.

213
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:54,689
You're suffocating here, right?

214
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:56,222
-I can't.

215
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,216
It would trouble others.

216
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:01,149
I couldn't possibly
go outside the estate.

217
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:05,403
I must stay here, for
the sake of my family,

218
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:07,670
as well as for my father.

219
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:09,870
Besides, there are
guards outside.

220
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:12,970
-Ow, the arm that
you cut is acting up.

221
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:15,203
-What?

222
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:17,136
-It looks like I've got you.

223
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,070
-You tricked me, you ayakashi.

224
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:21,936
-Hey, calm down.

225
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,270
I'm just going to borrow
you for one night.

226
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:25,436
Be back by morning.

227
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,503
-But--

228
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:28,070
-Don't struggle, Princess.

229
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:29,970
If anything, you're
going to enjoy this.

230
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:38,303
-Father?

231
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:43,170
My father and all the
guards, they don't notice us.

232
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:45,136
-That's because they're
dealing with Nurarihyon.

233
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,770
-Even in the street.

234
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:56,636
-Yeah, no one's
going to notice us.

235
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,570
Don't worry, you can just relax.

236
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:00,836
Trust Nurarihyon.

237
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,170
-Nurarihyon?

238
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,170
-Yes.

239
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,270
It's a free yokai's name.

240
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:07,036
Why don't you live
the way you want?

241
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:12,036
YOKAI: Whoa.

242
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,303
-So that's her.

243
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:16,070
-The one the Supreme Commander
went to try and seduce?

244
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,603
-The number one beauty in Kyoto.

245
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,203
-Well, what do you think?

246
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,403
-I'm at a loss.

247
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:25,736
She's even more
beautiful than they say.

248
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,736
-Are you jealous, Yuki Onna?

249
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,503
-Jealous?

250
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,803
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:34,436
-Uh, they're ayakashi,
isn't that so?

252
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,036
-Don't worry about them.

253
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,903
They all work for me.

254
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:39,870
-Hey, you.

255
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,770
I hear you're a
real sheltered girl.

256
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:44,136
-I'll show you a
good time, Princess.

257
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,003
-Hold on, Lord Ayakashi, wait.

258
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,770
Don't go.

259
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:50,703
Whoa, nice one.

260
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,736
Is this your first time?

261
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,170
-50 points.

262
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,570
You're winning this game.

263
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,070
-You're amazing, Princess.

264
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:59,036
-Oh, no.

265
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,436
It was purely by luck.

266
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,870
-OK, I'm up next.

267
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,403
-Hey, it's my turn next.

268
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,203
-My money's on Princess Yo.

269
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:06,703
-Heave ho.

270
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:07,203
Heave ho.

271
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,903
-I swear, just what is the
Supreme Commander thinking?

272
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:18,070
-Bringing a human woman
to a yokai gathering.

273
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:18,936
It's unheard of.

274
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,070
-Does he plan to eat her liver?

275
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,403
-Who knows?

276
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,770
It's anyone's guess.

277
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:26,770
-That's funn.y

278
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,870
-Oh, come on, Lord Nurarihyon.

279
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:33,603
Why don't you and I have a drink
over there, just the two of us?

280
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,170
Huh?

281
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,703
Wait, hold on.

282
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,070
-Having a good time?

283
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,836
-Oh, I guess.

284
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,070
It's nice being out like this.

285
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,436
-Princess Yo.

286
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,303
-Yes?

287
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:50,036
-Let's become man and wife.

288
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,536
-Hold it right there for just
one minute, Supreme Commander.

289
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,070
What did you just say?

290
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,403
This woman is a human.

291
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:59,370
Do you mean to tell us that
you intend to marry a human?

292
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:00,536
-Nurarihyon.

293
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,170
Just what do you
see in this woman?

294
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,203
-That isn't the issue
at hand, you know?

295
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:06,403
-Setsura.

296
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:08,136
[gasp]

297
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,903
-Princess Yo is actually
a much better person

298
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:12,536
than you think she is.

299
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,270
-Don't-- don't use my given name
like we're all intimate now.

300
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,470
You're a pervert.

301
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,403
-Yuki Onna, you can't go
around saying that-- ah!

302
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:21,770
-I'm going to kill you!

303
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:22,270
[screaming]

304
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:23,670
You dummy!

305
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:27,403
You can just die!

306
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:28,603
NURARIHYON: Princess.

307
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:29,370
-What?

308
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:30,436
Yes?

309
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,470
-You've got a special
place in my heart.

310
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:36,170
I've watched you
for a long time now,

311
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,736
and my feelings have
only become stronger.

312
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,803
-But I--

313
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:44,470
-To put it bluntly, I've
fallen hard for you.

314
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:46,803
Princess Yo, become my woman.

315
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,536
-Wha-- what?

316
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,836
What was that?

317
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:57,970
I thank you for tonight.

318
00:17:58,003 --> 00:17:58,470
-Hm.

319
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:05,436
-I thought you might
not bring me back here.

320
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,536
-Well, I keep my promises.

321
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,670
I'm not one of those
yokai who lies.

322
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:13,603
-I guess not.

323
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:16,036
If anything, you're
actually brutally honest.

324
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:20,836
-Come on.

325
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,436
Be with me.

326
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,470
I'm going to rule the world
one day, and to do it,

327
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:28,503
I need you there.

328
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:30,103
-Lord Ayakashi.

329
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:32,170
-How about it, Princess Yo?

330
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:33,203
-I'm sorry.

331
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:36,236
I'm not the person
that you think I am.

332
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,603
I have never helped
anybody unconditionally.

333
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,503
I ask you, if you want my
power, then please just go now.

334
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:50,170
-It's not your
power that I want.

335
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,870
I'm saying that I
want you near me.

336
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:57,036
I'll be back tomorrow.

337
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,536
-No, don't bother.

338
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,303
[coughing]

339
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:09,103
-So how are you doing now?

340
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:10,303
-Damn her.

341
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:13,270
Even my lungs are frozen.

342
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,736
I just can't believe the
Supreme Commander either.

343
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,803
Wanting to marry a human.

344
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,636
It's unheard of.

345
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,636
-It's exactly for that reason
that we all follow him.

346
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,636
KARASU TENGU: True,
he's unconventional.

347
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,336
He could become the
Lord of Pandemonium.

348
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,203
GYUKI: That's the
Nura Clan all right.

349
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,003
We've grown large enough to be
the Night Parade of a Hundred

350
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:33,003
Demons.

351
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:37,036
-But even so, I
didn't think we would

352
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,503
get to Kyoto this quickly.

353
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:43,836
GYUKI: If she felt like it,
she could easily come this way.

354
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,603
-Yes, Hagoromo Gitsune,
the great yokai

355
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:50,770
among yokai in Osaka Castle.

356
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:53,836
I hope the Nura Clan hasn't
reached its pinnacle too soon.

357
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,603
-So at this time, we would
like Princess Yo as a concubine

358
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,370
to Lord Hideyori Toyotomi.

359
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,836
FATHER: What a
large sum of money.

360
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,936
The Toyotomi family- it's
beyond what I'd hoped.

361
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,936
Well done, daughter.

362
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,670
-Your thoughts, sir?

363
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:21,503
FATHER: Wait, I spent so
much time raising her,

364
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,770
and she possesses
supernatural powers.

365
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:27,736
I'll hold out for more money.

366
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,736
-This is quite an honor.

367
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:36,336
It's just that being a mere
concubine would be such a pity.

368
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,703
SATORI: Oni
Hitokuchi, he intends

369
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,136
to milk us for everything.

370
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,536
-I see.

371
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,736
It isn't good to be
too greedy, you know?

372
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,736
Fine then.

373
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,703
Just take it.

374
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,585
There's your precious money.

375
00:20:57,618 --> 00:21:01,152
-If you weren't so greedy,
you would still be alive.

376
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:01,652
-Sir.

377
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,518
-What?

378
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,418
Yokai?

379
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,152
-How?

380
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:08,285
You broke our barrier?

381
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:09,119
-What's that?

382
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:10,619
Are you talking about this rope?

383
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,352
-Please forgive us for failing.

384
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:26,452
We just couldn't hold on.

385
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,386
-No, even if I
wasn't here myself,

386
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,752
the main family's
onmyoji should have--

387
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:32,919
NURARIHYON: What's all this?

388
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:38,452
-You're Nurarihyon.

389
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:42,252
So the slight yokai aura
I was sensing was yours.

390
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:43,986
-Never mind that now.

391
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,952
Where's the princess?

392
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:48,486
-If they weren't acting
under your orders,

393
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,152
then it was other ayakashi.

394
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:52,519
-And they were
after Princess Yo.

395
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,652
Some human liver worshipers?

396
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:55,919
Where the hell did they go?

397
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:58,912
-They're at Osaka Castle.

398
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,419
-If she's there, then--

399
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,819
-Hagoromo Gitsune.
