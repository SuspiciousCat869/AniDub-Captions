If Kyoto became yours to rule,
then how would you remake it?

-Well, I think that Kyoto
is a very beautiful city.

I would destroy all of
the modern buildings

and just leave the
cultural ones around.

And too many humans live here.

I'd get rid of all
those worthless humans

82
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:46,294
and change the city
into a place for yokai.

definitely be a fun one.

-And why should we do that?

144
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:56,727
Rikuo came here because
he's got a friend to save.

He's got no time for detours.

It is what you would call

you believe me or not.

With that, I shall
take my leave.

you are no match for her!

out at this city--

Th-- this is a good spot.

-It sure is.

165
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:36,927
And the Treasure

It can do that?

got good food here.

00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:40,861
-He's right.

170
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:41,761
There's no rush.

171
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:42,627
KO-ONI: Yeah, yeah.

172
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,494
-Huh?

already knows we're here!

175
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:54,961
-Right.

176
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,361
-Yeah, um.

177
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:57,994
-Daah!

178
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:00,794
M-- Master Rikuo!

179
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,361
-No panicking.

180
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,761
[group gasping]

181
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:05,961
That's what the
enemy wants from us.

182
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:06,794
-Right!

183
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:08,027
-Hmm.

184
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,561
-We haven't been here
in quite a while.

185
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:13,294
Our first foot forward
has to be firm.

186
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,827
KARASU: How's the
Supreme Commander doing?

187
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,494
-I'd like to know that myself.

188
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,461
He's been like that
since receiving

189
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:29,327
word of Hagoromo
Gitsune's return.

190
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:31,394
KARASU: He must feel troubled.

191
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:33,261
I can't blame him.

192
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:36,027
-If the Kyoto yokai
stay the course,

193
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,961
their vengeance will undoubtedly
turn toward us someday.

194
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:43,627
Given that, we will have to
bolster our combat forces soon.

195
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,127
We should have stopped him.

196
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,827
Was it even necessary
for him to go to Kyoto?

197
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,794
Master Rikuo was
still in training.

198
00:10:56,694 --> 00:11:00,061
Going there to save
a young onmyoji girl.

199
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,927
His human blood
must be to blame.

200
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,027
-Stop being so pessimistic.

201
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,327
Nothing's written in stone.

202
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,761
-But, Supreme Commander--

203
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,961
-Aren't you two curious to
see just how far Rikuo can go?

204
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:15,894
It's the first
time that he's ever

205
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,794
wanted to go take
someone down a notch.

206
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,394
We should all
respect his wishes.

207
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,294
-Honestly.

208
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,594
But wasn't it too soon?

209
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:31,594
Master Rikuo has a weakness--
the young master's human blood.

210
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:35,394
NARURIHYON: At my age, I
can't beat Hagoromo Gitsune.

211
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,561
But maybe Rikuo can.

212
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:39,127
-Wha--

213
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:43,061
-His human blood might not
be a weakness in this case.

214
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:45,194
At least, that's what
I've chosen to believe.

215
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:55,348
MAN: What's going on?

216
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,615
How could this happen?

217
00:11:57,648 --> 00:12:00,882
You're saying that Kyoto has
been taken over by yokai?

218
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,415
That's what we're
supposed to tell people?

219
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:06,415
-Any faith that we had in
the Keikain Clan is gone now.

220
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,715
-You'll protect Nijo
Castle though, right?

221
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:12,282
What happened to that great
prodigy's seal you touted?

222
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,282
MAN: Prodigy?

223
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,315
Who are you referring to?

224
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,615
Could it be me that
you're speaking of?

225
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:19,815
-Huh?

226
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:22,682
-Everyone is doing their
best, I'll have you know.

227
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:26,948
But my seals are now at
their limit after 400 years.

228
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,282
-Your seals?

229
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,115
Just who are you?

230
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:31,948
-I am Hidemoto.

231
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,482
-Was that a joke?

232
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,015
-Hidemoto's right here.

233
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:36,482
-I wasn't finished.

234
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:41,015
I'm Hidemoto, the 13th Heir.

235
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:44,615
You see, Yura here summoned me
and brought me to this era--

236
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:47,148
well, as a shikigami anyway.

237
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:50,048
So I can only speak,
thanks to her power.

238
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,215
Right, Yura, my dear?

239
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,415
-That's fine and
everything, but why

240
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:57,115
are you still sticking around?

241
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:58,615
-That's really the 13th Heir?

242
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:00,048
-Yura summoned him?

243
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:02,048
So she really is gifted.

244
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,815
-All right, it looks
like everyone's here now.

245
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:07,615
-He's the best we've
ever had, right?

246
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:10,015
-You've heard all of the
legends, haven't y you?

247
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,815
-He sealed Hagoromo
Gitsune away 400 years ago.

248
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,982
So I'm sure that
he's got a plan.

249
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,315
-Ah!

250
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,482
Let me start with this first.

251
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,482
They're going to break the
last seal at Nijo Castle.

252
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,315
[crowd gasping]

253
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:27,715
HIDEMOTO: That vixen
is really quite strong.

254
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,082
And the followers who's
taken up her cause

255
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:32,182
are nothing to
gloss over either.

256
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:33,648
-My god!

257
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:37,315
-To be fair, yokai live
for thousands of years.

258
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:40,148
It's unthinkable that humans
could ever defeat them.

259
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,315
[laughs]

260
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:41,882
-What?

261
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:43,682
What was that?

262
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,748
-Just let them have that castle.

263
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:48,415
[chuckles]

264
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:53,248
However, they'll go on
the defensive from there.

265
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:58,048
Just like 400 years
ago, Hagoromo Gitsune

266
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,948
intends to give birth
there at Nijo Castle.

267
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:02,782
-To-- to give birth?

268
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,415
-Give birth to what exactly?

269
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:05,182
-Hm.

270
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,815
I'm not certain.

271
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,815
But I do have an inkling.

272
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:14,148
It will be something terrible
for both humans and ayakashi.

273
00:14:14,182 --> 00:14:16,348
-Something terrible?

274
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,748
HIDEMOTO (VOICEOVER): The
being that Hagoromo Gitsune

275
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:22,115
will bear is their
longstanding wish.

276
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,615
As such, once she
takes the castle,

277
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:27,948
she'll need several weeks
to prepare for its birth.

278
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:31,415
That is our only
window for victory.

279
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:35,782
The Kyoto yokai have
united for that one wish.

280
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:39,215
If we can defeat their
mistress before the birth,

281
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,748
they will lose their
purpose and scatter.

282
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:45,182
Hagoromo Gitsune is
our greatest foe,

283
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:48,548
but she also happens to be
their greatest weakness.

284

-[gasps]

285
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,048
-So we'll wait until
then to make our move!

286
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:56,082
-I see, if we can carry
that out successfully.

287
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:59,115
-Two key things are
necessary for her defeat.

288
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,815
One is Hagun In other
words, Yura here.

289
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:03,948
-[gasping]

290
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:06,282
HIDEMOTO: You best hold
her in high esteem.

291
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:09,882
-So Yura is our clan's one hope?

292
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:13,448
-A girl who's only eaten tamago
kake gohan since coming back?

293
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:16,448
-And what does the food
I eat have to do with it?

294
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,682
-You should eat silky
eggs from now on.

295
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:19,715
-Well, someone's popular.

296
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:20,748
-But that's so expensive!

297
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,048
-Good for her.

298
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:24,282
And the second
thing that's needed

299
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,348
is a certain spirit blade.

300
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:27,582
It's called--

That's correct.

What's this?

305
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:36,748
It would seem someone
has done his research.

306
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,082
-I'm the current
owner of that blade

307
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:42,015
as the grandson of Nurarihyon.

-His grandson?

00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:47,448
Is that a fact now?

311
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:49,748
-I'll go visit the Nura Clan.

-Uh, she's a nobody!

330
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:40,448
Oh, don't listen
to her big brother!

331
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,915
What's the big idea?

332
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,915
Why did you come
here, Yuki Onna?

333
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:46,348
-I was out in the hallway
and overheard stuff.

334
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:48,982
-Just mentioning the fact that
I brought a yokai here could get

335
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,315
me kicked out!

336
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:52,315
-Yura, dear, who is she?

337
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:53,582
-Uh, no one special.

338
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:54,548
Honest!

339
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,248
-I'm one of the
Nura Clan's members.

340
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,082
-Shut up!

341
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,048
-The Nura Clan?

342
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,982
-You're coming with me!

343
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:01,415
Just a sec, big brother.

344
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,882
Nothing weird here.

[gasping]

346
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:11,382
-Wow!

347
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:13,415
-This should be enough
distance between us and them.

348
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,315
-Is this a storage room?

349
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,182
-No, this is my room!

350
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:20,482
-Yura, dear, this
girl is a yokai, now?

351
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:21,015
-Uhh.

352
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:22,348
-Excuse me.

353
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,815
Getting back to
what I was saying,

354
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:27,648
you want Master Rikuo
in Kyoto, right?

355
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:28,782
Don't worry.

356
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,748
He's finishing up the
rest of his training.

357
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:33,248
He'll come here as
soon as it's done.

358
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:35,648
-Yuki Onna.

359
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:38,682
Sorry, but his sword
is all we want.

360
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:41,482
-Well, that's not
necessarily true.

361
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:42,482
-Huh?

362
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,815
-We do need the
Nenekirimaru, of course.

363
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:49,748
But truthfully, the one
who defeated that fox then

364
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,448
was Nurarihyon.

365
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:52,682
-Uh.

366
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,415
-Would you happen to
be Setsura's daughter

367
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,515
or her granddaughter?

368
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:58,315
-Huh?

369
00:17:58,348 --> 00:17:59,148
How'd you know?

370
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:00,482
She's my mother!

371
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:03,115
My name's Tsurara.

372
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,182
YURA (VOICEOVER):
What did he say?

373
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,048
-Now, then, about your leader.

374
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,948
You mentioned that
he was training.

375
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:11,348
Would you consider him strong?

376
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,782
Our foe's power grows
with every reincarnation.

377
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:20,548
Knowing that, do you
still believe he'll come?

378
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:21,915
-There was something
that I heard

379
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,182
Master Rikuo say one time.

380
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:26,115
-Huh?

381
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:29,182
-"Anyone who goes around trying
to hurt humans is going to have

382
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:30,882
to answer to me."

383
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:31,748
-Uh.

384
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:32,248
-Uhh.

385
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,048
-Master Rikuo's life is very
unusual, to say the least.

386
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:40,948
So he's made a lot of enemies.

387
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:42,948
But his beliefs are firm.

388
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:45,015
And he's always relied
on his own power

389
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,582
to forge his path in life.

390
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:49,982
That's why I'll always
believe in him, too.

391
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,515
-Well put, Tsurara, my dear.

392
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:58,648
If that's the kind
of fellow he is, then

393
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:01,082
I'll have to warn
him about the seals.

394
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:07,148
Yura dear, do you see it now?

395
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,148
-Uh?

396
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:11,948
-Those pillars of
hate haunt Kyoto.

397
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:14,948
They are the source
of the yokai's power.

398
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:20,348
Step into them blindly and
you'll lose your footing.

It's the middle of
the day right now.

-It sure is.

403
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:39,248
But the place is crawling
with Kyoto yokai.

404
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,948
-Don't let them get to you.

405

Did you already forget
what the master just said?

406

-That's right.

Parade of 100 Demons as well.

Master Rikuo, I died.

had to protect
