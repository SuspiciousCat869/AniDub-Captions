3
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:16,205
-Who's there?

4
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,605
A Yokai?

5
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,472
-Oh.

6
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,405
Good.

7
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,039
It looks like I scared you.

8
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:28,305
You've lost if you've
shown fear to a Yokai.

9
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:31,672
The price of that is your eye.

10
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,539
-She's gone.

11
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,939
What the hell just happened?

12
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,172
I can't see things to my right.

13
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:42,539
That's because your eyeball
is in this world now.

14
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,539
-Don't you mess with me!

-Welcome to the
world of the dead.

17
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,672
Oh, my lady.

18
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:07,439
Just look.

19
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:08,939
It'll be your sixth liver.

20
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:10,839
And it's an onmyoji's too.

21
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:12,339
-It seems you have
even more promise

22
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,939
than your father,
daughter of Kiyokotsu.

23
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,205
-Lady Yura.

24
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,105
-What brought you back home?

25
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,772
Did something happen to you?

26
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,439
-Where's my stupid brother?

27
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,772
It took me forever getting
back here thanks to him.

28
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,672
-Huh?

29
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,505
-I mean, he could've
at least bought me

30
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,172
a ticket for the bullet train.

31
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,705
Doesn't he know that I
don't have any money?

32
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,839
Just thinking about
it makes me angry.

33
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:59,372
-Maybe it have something to
do with masters Koreto, Shuji,

34
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,005
and Gora.

35
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,905
-Is she our next leader?

36
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,572
-It's Yura.

37
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:08,005
I have just returned as ordered.

38
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,105
What's this?

39
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,739
Big brother, everyone's here.

40
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,139
-Oh, it's Yura.

41
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,639
-Grandpa, how have you been?

42
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,905
-Yura.

43
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,172
listen to me.

44
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,972
Starting now, your
new assignment

45
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:29,705
is to be a substitute
guardian of the Keicho Seal.

46
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,572
in the meantime, we'll
search for Hagoromo Gitsune's

47
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,072
current incarnation.

48
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,972
We'll use all of our
straight to ensure

49
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,605
that she's destroyed
once and for all.

50
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,339
-Who are you, lady?

51
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,972
-Again.

52
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,339
My mind wandered there.

53
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,872
-This is nice.

54
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,605
I wanna stay like
this and float away.

55
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,672
Are you worried
about your friend?

56
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,305
The one who went to Kyoto.

57
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:15,739
-Huh?

58
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:16,572
Yeah.

59
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:17,205
I guess.

made their move.

62

65

The guys back at your
house said you'd be here.

66
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,639
-Kiyotsugu.

67
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:46,672
-I heard that Yura
went home to Kyoto.

68
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:47,172
-Huh?

69
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:47,805
Yeah.

70
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,605
It seems so.

71
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,139
-So she left us to go home
to Kyoto for the summer, huh?

72
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,739
Boy, that Yura.

73
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,905
-She can't helpt it.

74
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,105
Her family's there.

75
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:58,939
-OK.

76
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,372
All of us are here now.

77
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:00,939
So what's up?

78
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,272
-Right.

79
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,272
Yura's in Kyoto.

80
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:07,505
And Kyoto's full of
history and Yokai.

81
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,339
And summer break means
independent study.

82
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,739
Let's go there.

83
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,305
To Kyoto!

84
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,172
-That really sounded rehearsed.

85
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,939
-I figured that
this would happen.

86
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,572
-You're always pushing
your plans on us.

87
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,339
-But ladies, summer break,
independent study, and Kyoto!

88
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,939
Don't tell me you're
passing up this opportunity!

89
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,039
You can't!

90
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:33,839
You will go, right?

91
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,272
[moaning]

92
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,339
-Hey, stop it.

93
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:37,805
I know you want to.

94
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,172
Isn't that right, Nura?

95
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,405
-Rikuo?

96
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,472
-Oh.

97
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:50,139
I-- uh-- I'll have
to ask grandpa first.

98
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,972
Well, see you.

99
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,105
-Ask him for what?

100
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,072
-Money to go?

101
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,005
-Well, well.

102
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,339
I finally found it.

103
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,039
-Grandpa?

104
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:06,105
-Rikuo, what do we need?

105
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,105
-Grandpa, I'm uh-- thinking
about going to Kyoto.

106
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,739
You know about Ms.
Keikain, right?

107
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:15,672
So--

108
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:18,205
-Do you have a
death wish, Rikuo?

109
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:22,572
-Huh?

110
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,505
Grandpa?

111
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,172
-Ha.

112
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,105
He's scared already.

113
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,005
You fool.

114
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,505
Can't even dodge
an old man's kick.

115
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,605
The Shikoku Yokai were nothing.

116
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,572
Even the flunkies over in
Kyoto could take you out.

117
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:46,939
-What the hell?

118
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:48,805
You damn geezer!

119
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,305
-Rikuo, if you insist
on going to Kyoto,

120
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,405
then draw your sword right now.

121
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:02,172
-Ahhh, that was nice.

122
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,105
Huh?

123
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,805
Master Rikuo, Supreme Commander,
what do you think you're doing?

124
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,005
-Here I come, Rikuo.

125
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,705
Will you be able to see me?

126
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:20,672
-You bastard.

127
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:24,905
-When two Ayakashi fight,
it is a competition of fear.

128
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,005
You'll get the edge
on that, and that's

129
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,772
when your total
victory is assured.

130
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:32,372
It is the first level
in an Ayakashi battle.

131
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,005
Nope.

132
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,172
Over here, Rikuo.

133
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:47,705
It looks like you can at
least learn by example.

134
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:52,339
But you can't just rely on that.

135
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:55,005
Seasoned Ayakashi would
go to the next level.

136
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,805
-Supreme Commander!

137
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,139
-If you went to Kyoto
now, you'd be helpless.

138
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:12,005
-Supreme Commander.

139
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,205
-We're done here.

140
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,972
-If I learn that trick,
can I go to Kyoto then?

141
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:22,572
-Why do you want to
go there so badly?

142
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,072
-Because there's someone
there I have to see.

143
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:31,572
She's there, right,
Hagoromo Gitsune?

144
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,872
Answer me, geezer!

145
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:43,072
-Aren't you being
too harsh on him?

146
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:45,772
Throwing your blade
against your own grandson--

147
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:47,539
You went overboard.

148
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,172
-That brat.

149
00:09:56,905 --> 00:10:01,705
-Rikuo, you're better
off not knowing.

150
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:05,839
I couldn't bear it
if I lost you too.

151
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:06,939
No.

152
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:09,405
I think that I've been
too over-protective.

153
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,472
-Huh?

154
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:13,639
-Karasu Tengu, go
and call them all in.

155
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,972
-What was that?

156
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,439
You're sending
Master Rikuo there?

157
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:18,439
You can't!

158
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:19,239
They'll kill him.

159
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,139
GRANDPA: Quiet.

160
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,205
I don't want to here it.

161
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,539
KARASU TENGU: Supreme Commander!

162
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:30,305
-It's been a long
time, Lord Nurarihyon.

163
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,505
Are you certain?

164
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,205
There is a chance
that you may end up

165
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,639
losing your precious heir.

166
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:37,039
-That's fine.

167
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:42,105
Whatever it's going to take,
this is something he wants.

168
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,905
-He isn't up yet?

169
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,105
-It's been two days.

170
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,239
It could be that
he'll never wake up.

171
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,039
What'll be do then?

172
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:53,039
-By the way, the Kiyojuji
Paranormal Patrol was here.

173
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:55,339
They said they're going
to Kyoto in a week.

174
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,272
TSURARA: Focus on Master Rikuo.

175
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:59,972
And just what was the
Supreme Commander thinking?

176
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:02,372
Treating his own
grandson this way!

177
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,105
I mean, don't you
think it's too cruel?

178
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,405
-Hey, ladies.

179
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,972
Hide the master now.

180
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:07,505
-Why?

181
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,305
What's going?

182
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,605
-Just hurry.

183
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,072
We've got monsters on the way.

184
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,905
-Is there a weak child in here?

185
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,872
Is there a weak child in here?

186
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:20,205
-Sniff, sniff, Sniff.

187
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,205
It stinks of humans here.

188
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,072
-Sniff, sniff.

189
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:23,905
Whoa.

190
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,172
-He's the one.

191
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:28,772
-He's the one who smells
like a weak human.

192
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,439
-Let's take him home.

193
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:32,972
-Let him go!

194
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:36,472
-Stop trying to get in our
way, you naughty child!

195
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,139
-Hey, who are these guys?

196
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:43,605
-Master!

197
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,605
-Stop it.

198
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,972
The Supreme Commander
ordered this.

199
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,972
-Well then, it
looks like we'll be

200
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:53,139
holding onto your
grandson for a while.

201
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,405
We of the Oshu-Tono Clan.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,033
TSURARA: Dear Master
Rikuo, how are you doing?

203
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:15,901
What a shock it must have been
to be taken away in your sleep

204
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,567
to some strange place.

205
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:22,834
But the Tohoku region is the
first place of many Yokai.

206
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,634
It's considered the homeland
of a wide variety of Ayakashi,

207
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,234
including my own ancestors.

208
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,901
Because of that, I believe
there's a thing or two

209
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,601
you can learn
there, Master Rikuo.

210
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:39,401
Please take good
care of yourself.

211
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,701
I've heard that
Tono is super cold,

212
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:46,434
and that its Yokai are super
cruel and super strong.

213
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:50,367
But I'll always be on
your side, Master Rikuo.

214
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,334
Hang in there.

215
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,001
-Hey, Tsurara.

216
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,667
I left the laundry over there.

217
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:01,601
-Huh?

218
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:02,667
You're awake.

219
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,201
-And there was some
talk of eating you,

220
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:07,367
if you didn't wake
up in an hour too.

221
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:08,567
-Huh?

222
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:11,634
-Is he really the heir to
the Nura Clan in Kanto?

223
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,767
-He's freaky.

224
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,434
His hair grew out right
after it turned dark.

225
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:18,201
-The rumors say that he's
got human blood in him.

226
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:19,867
He's only half Yokai.

227
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,434
-No.

228
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,534
Not even half.

229
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,834
I heard he's more like
a quarter Ayakashi.

230
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:24,701
-Yeah?

231
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:27,367
No wonder he's so weak.

232
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,501
-What the hell is this place?

233
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,201
-Finally awake, huh?

234
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,534
What a troublesome apprentice.

235
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,201
Go give Lord Akagappa
a proper greeting!

236
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:41,034
-So you're the grandson.

237
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,801
You look like him.

238
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,201
It's like his younger
self was reborn.

239
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:46,534
-What's that?

240
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:50,234
-He came here, and took all
our gifted Yokai with him.

241
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,867
And it weakened us.

242
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,501
I hate him.

243
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,567
You have a hateful face too.

244
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:57,767
-So who are you?

245
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,401
You know my old geezer?

246
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,267
And where am I?

247
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,434
-Hey!

248
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,067
You've shouldn't be so
cheeky with Lord Akagappa.

249
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:09,067
-Tono Village in
the Tohoku region,

250
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,067
this is an ancient
hidden village,

251
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,567
and the home of the Ayakashi.

252
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,334
Tono?

253
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,701
Hidden village?

254
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:18,234
-Hang in there and do your best.

255
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,367
All right.

256
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,634
Take him and put him to
work as an apprentice.

257
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:23,334
-Apprentice?

258
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,034
For Tohoku?

259
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,401
You're kidding, right?

260
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:28,667
I have to get to Kyoto
as soon as I can.

261
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,234
-To Kyoto?

262
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:31,967
Seriously?

263
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:32,934
-Nice one.

264
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,301
-Going there is like
death for someone who

265
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,867
can only bring fear,

266
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:41,767
-Oh?

267
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,501
Is that right?

268
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,934
He's trying to run!

269
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,434
-It's not that easy to escape.

270
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,401
Nice try though.

271
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,301
-A dog?

272
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:58,734
[laughter]

273
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,434
-A dog beat him.

274
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,534
-What a weakling.

275
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,501
The Nura Clan's next
head is less than a dog!

276
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,801
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
It's like with Gramps.

277
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,034
What just happened?

278
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,167
What is this place?

279
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,701
-That hurt.

280
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:29,367
Oh great.

281
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,034
I just washed these.

282
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,201
-Hey, noobie!

283
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,067
I've got more laundry.

284
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,801
Make sure to wash it all.

285
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:39,867
Hey!

286
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,667
You haven't chopped
any firewood at all!

287
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,401
You're such hopeless child.

288
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:46,534
You can't even handle odd jobs!

289
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:47,967
-Hey.

290
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,567
What's the point of forcing
me to do this stuff?

291
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,167
What the hell am I here for?

292
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,434
-Your grandfather
sent you off to us,

293
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,934
and said the following--
it's fine if he dies.

294
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,401
Just train my fool
of a grandson for me.

295
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,001
-What?

296
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,901
He did?

297
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,934
-So get to work, noobie!

298
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:04,501
-Hey.

299
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:05,801
Hold on there.

300
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:08,567
Why do I have to walk so far
to hang all these clothes?

301
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,267
-Well not many spots in
this village get sunlight.

302
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,167
It's usually just Yokai aura.

303
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,501
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): That's right.

304
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,334
I'm still in my Yokai form.

305
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:22,101
-Don't slack off there, noobie!

306
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:23,567
-Damn it.

307
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,234
-Even the flunkies over in
Kyoto could take you out.

308
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,734
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
That damn geezer.

309
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,634
What am I supposed to do here?

310
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:40,734
Doing laundry, huh?

311
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,034
It's kinda hard.

312
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,034
-Master Rikuo, just
bring it over here.

313
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,901
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
Tsurara made it look easy.

314
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,134
All right.

315
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,901
I'm getting out of here.

316
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,134
Who needs this?

317
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,767
Besides, no one's watching.

318
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:12,667
A bridge.

319
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:18,367
Damn!

320
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:18,834
An illusion?

321
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,267
-Are you stupid?

322
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:36,267
You really don't know
about Tono Village, do you?

323
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,834
This is a hidden village.

324
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:39,567
You could say the
whole place is a Yokai.

325
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,234
Without the power
to cut through fear,

326
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,801
you're stuck here until you die.

327
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,501
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
Cut through fear?

328
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:53,834
-Seasoned Ayakashi would
go to the next level.

329
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,701
-Hey, you.

330
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,234
-Itaku.

331
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,934
I'm a kamaitachi.

332
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,201
-What were you saying?

333
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:04,101
Cutting through fear.

334
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:06,501
The power to cut
through fear, huh?

335
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,834
That old geezer.

336
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,467
So that's why I'm
stuck in this village.

337
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,134
-Hurry on back and
do the laundry.

338
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,967
-Hey, kamaitachi.

339
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,601
Hold on a minute!

340
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:18,701
Wait!

341
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:19,667
Teach it to me.

342
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:28,601
What's that?

343
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,034
Hey.

344
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,067
What is all this?

345
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,301
-It's practice.

346
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,834
-Practice?

347
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,067
This?

348
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:46,634
They look serious.

349
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,101
-This is one of
our largest grounds

350
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:53,367
for combat training, a
special part of Tono.

351
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:53,867
Watch.

352
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:02,067
Don't let it
overwhelm you, stupid.

353
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,767
That was his fear.

354
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:07,234
It's really too much trouble
to put it into words.

355
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,434
When you bring out fear, it's
all about causing terrifying

356
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,634
by increasing everyone else's
awareness of your Yokai

357
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,367
presence.

358
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,001
-Right.

359
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,634
Yeah.

360
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:20,801
-But Ayakashi eventually
began fighting over territory,

361
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:25,834
and it then became necessary to
create ways to fight Ayakashi.

362
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,401
That proved to be
the next level.

363
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,334
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
The next level?

364
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,834
-Who's this, Itaku?

365
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:33,934
Never seen him before.

366
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:34,401
-Oh.

367
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,767
It's him.

368
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,034
This is the boy that Itaku
got put in charge of training.

369
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:38,867
-Hey!

370
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:41,267
You spoiled it.

371
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,567
-I'm Amezo, a numakappa.

372
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:47,434
I hear you took over my
bathtub cleaning duties.

373
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,934
-And my firewood.

374
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,501
That's the hardest chore to do.

375
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:54,301
Awashima, the amanojaku.

376
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,601
-Heating bathwater
is a lot harder.

377
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:58,701
I'm Reira, the Yuki Onna.

378
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:01,734
She's Yukari, a zashiki-warashi.

379
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,067
-Cleaning and washing
are the basics.

380
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,734
Dohiko, the futachi.

381
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,134
-Nice to meet you.

382
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,134
-Likewise.

383
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,267
-You're from the Nura
Clan, aren't you?

384
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:15,134
-And he's Nurarihyon's
grandson too.

385
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:18,501
-Even so, he's got no
idea how do use fear.

386
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:19,701
-Really?

387
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:22,534
-And he's scared heir
to the Nura Clan?

388
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,301
-A Yokai who can't use fear?

389
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,634
-Was he spoiled?

390
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,567
-If it's just bringing
out fear, I can.

391
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:29,501
-Huh?

392
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,567
-Huh?

393
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,134
-Really?

394
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,667
You know how?

395
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:35,067
Show us.

396
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:35,567
-Sure.

397
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:44,334
-Whenever you're ready then.

398
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,101
-What's with that getup?

399
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:49,601
-He was just in pajamas,
so I let him borrow it.

400
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,534
-It's not bad.

401
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:54,001
-They say he took down
the Shikoku Yokai.

402
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:55,401
-The Shikoku?

403
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,301
I thought they were long gone.

404
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,934
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): OK.

405
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,534
So how exactly am I
supposed to bring fear?

406
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,467
-Just calm your mind.

407
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:08,234
I call this technique
Meikyo Shisui.

408
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,634
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
-Gramps, Like this?

409
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,434
-He vanished.

410
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,734
-So this is a Nurarihyon's fear?

411
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:23,834
-No way.

412
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,134
He actually brought
fear to everybody here?

413
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:30,301
-Stay back.

414
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:32,834
I'm the only one who
will be fighting him.

415
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:36,234
If anybody's cutting
is fear, it'll be me.

416

Yura Keikain's Train Splash

418
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,243
BIG BROTHER (VOICEOVER): Sorry
I can't go back with you,

419
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,443
but here's something
to help you relax.

420
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:24,343
The next time you
drink Cola, you

421
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:26,409
should add peppermint
candy to it.

422
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:30,118
It'll blow you away,
and it'll help you grow.

423
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:32,151
-Big brother, he does
have a kind side.

424
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,585
Huh?

425
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:38,585
What the?

426
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,018
Is it a Yokai?

427
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,018
I'm so sorry.

428
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,485
I'll clean it up right away!

429
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:43,885
-She won't fall for that.

430
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:44,718
-Nope.

431
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,151
I just know that she'll try it.

432
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:47,618
-The end.

-You think you can
cause a scene here?

435
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,685
I'll kill you.

436
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:06,485
-And I'll take your head as a
gift to Lady Hagoromo Gitsune.

437
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:09,718
-Because I can't go to
Kyoto as a weakling.

00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:11,551
-How interesting.
