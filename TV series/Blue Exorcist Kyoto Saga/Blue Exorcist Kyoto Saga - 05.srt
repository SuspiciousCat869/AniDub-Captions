‐Juzo.
‐Dad! Those flames.

00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,625
Don't worry about that now.
Our priority is to find
the Right Eye.

4
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,493
Listen, I want you
to tail the Master.

5
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,296
Stay close,
but stay out of sight.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,765
[Juzo] The Master?

[Yaozo coughs]

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,838
[Tatsuma] Rin's lucky to have
a guardian like you,
Ms. Kirigakure.

9
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,172
I'll say.

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,909
Yeah. That's one fine tushy.

Shura here.

18
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,972
Oh, hey, Yukio.
How's the hunt
for the Left Eye?

19
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,007
Are things going OK
over there?

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,510
Huh? Over here?

21
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,813
Um... We had a thing happen.

22
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,481
Huh?!

[Shura] Yukio.

25
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,312
Hi, Shura.

26
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,015
Hey, what's going on?

27
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,952
‐I'm sorry I couldn't
get through to you sooner.
‐Yeah, why didn't you?

28
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,122
Our calls were being jammed,
so we decided to stop by.

29
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,159
Anyway, you said
something happened.
What's up?

30
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,997
Yeah. Well, you see, um...

31
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,801
I'm Yaozo Shima,
director of this field office.

32
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,071
You must be the teen that was
sent to retrieve the Left Eye.

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,707
I welcome you to Kyoto.

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,810
Since we have
all the senior staff present,

35
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,312
we should talk about
the recent developments.

36
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,247
This way, please.

37
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,284

‐Are you going to be OK?
‐[panting]

42
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,872
I hope the strain
of this responsibility
isn't too much for you.

43
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,208
No. I'm fine.
I can keep going.

44
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,378
I couldn't forgive myself
if anything happened to you.

45
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,915
But I'm just not strong enough
to handle both the eyes
on my own.

46
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,652
‐Maybe we should take a break.
‐I'm fine!

47
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,655
[panting]
I'm fine.

48
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,991
We can rest after
we get these vile things
somewhere safe.

49
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,960
[panting]

50
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,263
[Yaozo] The Right Eye was stolen
from our field office,

51
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,668
and I'm embarrassed to say
the thief is one of our own.

52
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,836
She was behind
the earlier attempt.

53
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,574
At least that's the assumption
we're going on.

54
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,709
[Uwabami] Her name
is Mamushi Hojo,

55
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,311
intermediate exorcist
first class

56
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,046
and leader
of the Keep security.

57
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,715
We thought we had her trapped,

58
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,918
but she managed to escape
with Todo's assistance.

59
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,088
I'm sorry. I wish we could
have got here faster.

60
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:53,193
If they're together, then Todo
has both the left and right eyes
in his possession now.

61
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,862
Dammit. I was afraid of that.

62
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,765
The car we were tracking
was just a decoy.

63
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,637
We searched it and found
two dead exorcists inside.

64
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,839
And then,
when we tried reporting it,

65
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,109
we found out someone
was jamming our cell phones.

66
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,411
It was all a ploy to buy time.

67
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,548
This is terrible!
If he has both eyes, then...

68
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,884
‐[coughing]
‐Take it easy.

69
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,857
What's gonna happen
if he has both eyes?
Could you explain?

70
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,796
The Myoda,
for better or for worse,

71
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,434
has kept secrets within secrets
for the past 150 years.

72
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,003
And what exactly does that mean?

73
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,941
It means there are many things
us elders don't even know about.

74
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,376
But our high priest,
Tatsuma Suguro,

75
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,411
knows all our secrets.

76
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,281
There is, however, one secret

77
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,886
‐that is made known only
to the elders.
‐Which is?

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,322
[Yaozo] According to the legend
of the Impure King,

79
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,259
a story passed down among
the upper ranks of priests,

80
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,395
when his left and right eyes
are brought together,

81
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,533
a new and more potent miasma
will be unleashed upon
the world.

82
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,003
Todo wants to gas everyone?

83
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,839
No way. There has to be
more to it.

84
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,578
The miasma from one eye
was bad enough.

85
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,513
It'll be even worse
from both.

86
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,414
And if it comes to that,
it might be more

87
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,049
than the Knights
of the True Cross can handle.

88
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,186
I would say our priority's
pretty clear here:

89
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,854
find Todo and Mamushi stat.

90
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,757
[Yaozo] We have our people
searching all the places

91
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,492
we think they'd be
likely to hide.

92
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,460
But since they vanished
into thin air,

93
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,563
they didn't leave us
a trail to follow.

94
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,132
We need doctors
and meisters here, right now.

95
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,002
With them on the loose,
we should prepare ourselves

96
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,937
for the worst outcome.

97
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,207
[Yukio] <i>Why would he wait</i>
<i>to release the miasma?</i>

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,544
<i>Why didn't he do it</i>
<i>when he got the Right Eye?</i>

99
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,780
<i>Maybe ground zero</i>
<i>is somewhere else.</i>

100
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,517
<i>Or maybe he's got other plans.</i>

101
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,619
‐[Yukio groaning]
‐[Todo] Believe it or not,

102
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,887
when I was your age,
I was a lot like you.

103
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,425
My family decided what course
my life would take
since the day I was born.

104
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,961
They didn't care I had
my own dreams
and I never complained.

105
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,933
And like a dog, I did
whatever they said and worked
for the good of the Order.

106
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:18,038
So now, after a life like that,
do you know what I have
to show for it?

107
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:23,209
Nothing. If what I said
doesn't make sense now,
give it time.

108
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,178
You'll understand eventually.

109
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,614
When you do,
I'll welcome you with open arms,

110

‐Um, yes.
‐We gotta talk.

116
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,431
It's about that thing
I mentioned on the phone
earlier.

117
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,033
Huh?

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,872
So what is it?

119
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,473
Hmm. Yeah.

120
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,143
‐So, um...
‐It's about Rin, isn't it?

121
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,346
Oh! Damn, you're just
as sharp as ever.

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,816
What did he do this time?

123
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,520
Well, he sort of flared up
in front of everyone.

124

[Yukio groans]

125

He's such an idiot!

All right.
Where is my brother now?

127
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,722
[Shiro] The Koma Sword.

128

Also known as Kurikara.

129
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,259
An ancient and legendary
demon‐slaying sword.

130
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,796
Many years ago,
I transferred your demonic
powers to this sword

131
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,565
and sealed the scabbard.

132
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,134
Once drawn, your demonic powers
will be awakened

133
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,538
and you can never go back
to being human.

[Rin] Shut up!

All this dumb talk about me's
starting to piss me off!

142
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,048
You sit there
sticking labels on people!

143
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:46,286
I ain't a weapon or a demon king
or a savior!

144
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,021
I'm Rin Okumura!

145
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,924
One day, I'll be the most
powerful exorcist ever,

146
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,027
and don't you bastards
forget it!

147
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,510
[Yukio]
It was crazy to think he could
pass the exam in six months.

148
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,978
Now his life is hanging
by a thread.

149
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,214
They'll execute him
for sure after this.

150
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,317
Yeah, it totally sucks.
What do we do now?

151
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,485
Never had to deal
with crap like this before.

152
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,387
Don't be so glib.

153
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:25,191
I swore on my father's grave
I'd protect Rin, no matter what.

154
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,664
[Shura] On that note,
you know what it takes
to be a good exorcist?

155
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,966
[Yukio] Skill, stamina
and heart.

156
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,735
[Shura] Yeah, but
the most important thing

157
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,237
is to not control
your emotions so much.

158
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,006
Demons take advantage of that.
Thank you.

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,276
Pent‐up anger and stress
give them a way in.

160
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,178
Rin's got the makings
of a good exorcist

161
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,648
'cause he doesn't
hold anything back.

162
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,184
A person like you,
on the other hand,
is the real danger.

163
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,687
You're the type
that gets turned.

164
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,362
Try cutting loose,
open up for a change
and see what happens.

165
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,065
[Yukio] All right,
you asked for it.

166
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,300
I've hated you
since the day I met you.

167
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:11,605
Whoa! [chuckles]
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about.

168
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,741
[chuckles]

169
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,648
Uh‐uh. You are not
still working.

170
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,383
Oh, yeah, I guess.

171
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,620
See? I'm making fever reducers,
but I'm almost done.

172
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,290
Yeah, that's great and all,
but didn't you feel
that earthquake?

173
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,294
Earthquake? Oh!
That's what that shaking was.

174
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,330
Oh, brother. Talk about getting
lost in your work.

175
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,999
[giggles]

176
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,702
Whatevs. At least you're in
a good mood again.

177
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,403
Tough as a weed, no joke.

178
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,907
[giggles] A person can't stay
all mopey forever.

179
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,612
Well, the important thing is
that you're back to what
you're normally like.

180
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,981
What am I normally like?
Can you tell me?

181
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,917
Huh? Are you serious?

182
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,953
You're always cheerful,
in a ditzy way.

183
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,456
Plus, you're brave, 'cause
you're not afraid to walk up
and talk to anyone.

184
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,259
That's you in a nutshell.

185
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,462
Is... is that how
everyone sees me?

186
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,031
No way.

187
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,365
What?

188
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,434
Nothing.

189
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,403
It's just that...
I'm not like that.

190
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,076
Truth is, I thought,
after all this time together,

191
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,111
we're all becoming
better friends.

192
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,781
But I didn't really know
Rin and Yuki

193
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,283
and about all the stuff
they were dealing with.

194
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,389
You feel bad 'cause you didn't
know Rin was Satan's son?

195
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:40,527
I spent so much time around him,
and I had no idea.

196
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,736
When they were taking him away,

197
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,372
I realized I couldn't do
anything for him.

198
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,040
Then I freaked out.

199
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,177
I lost confidence in everything
I did after that.

200
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,146
I managed to screw up
even the simplest things.

201
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,818
I don't even have the guts
to talk to Rin anymore.

202
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,689
You know what?

203
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,824
That just means
I have to work harder.

204
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,926
And I'll start
by doing the laundry.

205
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,398
Do you want Rin to be
more than... you know?

206
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:21,167
‐Excuse me!
‐[gasps]

207
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,805
‐Dang, Izumo, you look
so hot in that!
‐[scoffs]

208
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,774
[Konekomaru]
Miss Moriyama, quick.
We need some ice.

209
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:28,842
Bon's been hurt!

210
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,245
Oh, sure. What?

211
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,953
Are you gonna tell us
what happened?

212
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,823
The Right Eye was stolen
from the field office.

213
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,825
[all gasp]

214
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,060
No way. For real?

215
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,363
For real.
Then they took Okumura away.

216
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,166
‐No!
‐Why? What did he do?

217
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,402
His flames came out
and damn near everyone saw 'em.

218
00:13:56,537 --> 00:14:01,241
[flames whooshing]

219
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,378
Well... then where is he now?

220
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,148
At the field office,
locked in a cell.

221
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,886
So, like, now he's, like,
in trouble?

222
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,521
Like serious trouble?

223
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,994
Rin.

224
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,200
[footsteps]

225
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,438
[Shura] So, you cool off yet?

226
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:39,546
How ya feelin', kiddo?

227
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,551
Still a little wobbly.
But I can move OK, I guess.

228
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,352
‐You're up.
‐Huh?

229
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,991
Uh...

230
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,963
Is this how
you're gonna show me up,

231
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,765
by getting thrown in jail?

232
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,968
And all that big talk
about making my head spin.

233
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,304
I don't even know what to say.

234
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,346
While you were conked out,
Suguro's dad slipped this to me.

235
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,517
Guess he wanted me
to give it to you.

236
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,186
What's it say?

237
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,124
It's addressed to you, dude.
Open it.

238
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,171
Interesting.

239
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,240
Well, what's it say?

240
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,944
‐I can't read it.
‐Huh?!

241
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,112
Jeez! I knew you were
a dumbass,

242
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,148
but this is
un‐freakin‐believable!

243
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,384
Kids these days make me worry
about the future.

244
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,387
No way!
I can't read it either!

245
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,724
‐That's what I was saying!
‐It's cursive script.

246
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:59,425
I can read enough to get by.

247
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,696
OK, Mr. Okumura.
Translate it for the class.

248
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,503
Go on, chop‐chop.

249
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,206
I want to hear what the old fart
has to say, so get on with it.

250
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,142
He might tell us something about
this mess with the eyes.

251
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,581
OK, here goes.

252
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,448
"Greetings, Rin Okumura.

253
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,451
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,321
[Tatsuma] <i>I am a priest</i>

258
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:38,799
<i>and the reason is, I have</i>
<i>an important favor to ask.</i>

259
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,703
<i>You're probably confused</i>
<i>as to why a total stranger</i>

260
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,607
<i>would be asking you for favors,</i>
<i>so I'll begin by telling you</i>

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,308
<i>a little about my past.</i>

262

265
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,820
<i>would be before</i>
<i>you and Ryuji were born.</i>

266
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,989
Hold on, it's not working?
She's not better?

267
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,026
[pained breathing]

268
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,263
Torako.

269
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,165
[Tatsuma]
<i>I was much younger then,</i>

270
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,168
<i>and my pregnant wife</i>
<i>had become very ill.</i>

271
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,870

272
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,438
<i>She grew weaker by the day,</i>

273
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,741
<i>and I was powerless</i>
<i>to help her.</i>

274
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,044
<i>The miasma from the Right Eye</i>
<i>of the Impure King</i>

275
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,379
<i>is what made her so sick.</i>

276
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,652
Ah, Torako!

277
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,954
Hi, Tatsuma.

278
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,156
Torako?

279
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,227
Don't worry, it's OK.
The baby and I are fine.

280
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,329
Go back to work, honey.

281
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,533
OK.

282
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,871
[Yukio] Tatsuma.

283
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,273
The Master wishes to see you.

284
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,443
Tatsuma, what do you think
you're doing?

285
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,312
You cannot neglect
your duties.

286
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,381
Protecting everyone from
the Right Eye's poison

287
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,283
is your responsibility.

288
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,119
You must pray to the Buddha
every day without fail.

289
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,556
If you don't, he will
forsake you and take
his power away from you.

290
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,795
But... I have prayed.
I've prayed
for the last seven years.

291
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,132
In all that time, 15 people have
died instead of getting better.

292
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,867
Torako can't take it.

293
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,737
If this keeps up,
she and our baby are going to...

294
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,908
Can I really save everyone
by tending the sacred flame?!

295
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,512
Is there anything else you can
do for her besides tend it?

296
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,079
Uh...

297
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,448
The best way
to fight this evil

298
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,852
is by honoring the teachings
of our noble ancestor without...

00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,896
I must go back to my duties.

One day, son, my duties
will be yours.

When I die,
the true secrets of this temple

And for the rest of your life,
you must dedicate yourself
to keeping them safe.

00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,492
Secrets?

310
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,427
If Torako doesn't survive,

311
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,030
find a new wife
of hardier stock.

312
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,602
Having a successor is yet
another of your duties.

313
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,573
Clear your mind
and relinquish desire.

314
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:37,477
<i>I was powerless,</i>
<i>so I accepted his words.</i>

315
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:56,897
<i>At birth, I became the 17th</i>
<i>in the line of high priests</i>
<i>of Myoda.</i>

316
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>Each and every day,</i>

317
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:04,538
<i>carried out their duties</i>
<i>in order to protect</i>
<i>that bloodline.</i>

318
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,708
<i>And I had duties of my own</i>
<i>to fulfill.</i>

319
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>As long as my mind</i>
<i>was clear of doubt,</i>

320
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,312
<i>I could protect Myoda</i>

321
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,849
<i>and Torako</i>
<i>and her unborn child.</i>

322
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,084
<i>I forced myself</i>
<i>to believe that.</i>

323
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,220
<i>Then one day...</i>

324
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,455
[creature shrieks]

325
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,124
<i>...out of the sky...</i>

[shrieking]

327
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,663
[priests scream]

‐[gun fires repeatedly]
‐[creature groans]

329

‐What the...
‐Protect the young Master!

330
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,006
[creature wails]

331
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,880
I don't believe it.
The sacred flame.

332
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,852
[Shiro] Holy shit, that hurt!

333
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,887
Ugggh!

334
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,256
‐[priests] Tatsuma!

[dramatic music plays]

336
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,026
[Shiro] What's up
with this mountain?

337
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,828
It's crawling with monsters.

338
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:05,131
Typical of Mephisto
and his janky intel.

339
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,701
My gun's too small,
I'm out of ammo.

340
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,803
Should have brought a cannon.

341
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,972
‐Hey, who are you?!
‐[Shiro] Me.

342
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,875
We were performing
a sacred ritual
and you ruined it!

343
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,409
Get down here!

344
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:20,080
[Shiro] Ooh, lookie
what we have here.

345
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:23,517
[gasps] Oh, no.

346
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,552
[Shiro] Ain't this
a Koma Sword?

347
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,157
News flash: it's mine now.

348
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,226
Huh? What?

349
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,961
[snorts]

350
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:37,898
[Tatsuma] <i>That was when I met</i>
<i>Shiro Fujimoto,</i>

351
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,232
<i>the man who raised you,</i>

352
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,802
<i>the man you call your father.</i>

353
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,269
Are you insane?

354
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,638
You can't have it.

355
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,940
That's Myoda's sacred relic!

356
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:51,745
[gasping]

357
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,346
Oh, my God.

358
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,416
I had no idea
our fathers knew each other.

359
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,152
That's how Dad got his hands
on the Koma Sword?

360
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,621
No way.

361
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:03,223
It belongs to Suguro's temple?

362
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,759
[groans] Don't stop now,
keep reading!

363
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,093
Uh, right.

364
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,665
[Tatsuma panting]

365
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:20,406
I'm beat. Fifteen years ago,
I could do this, no sweat.

366
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:27,013
Oh, well.
At least now I get to put
my purpose in life to the test.

367
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,415
[panting]

368
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,786
Watch over me, Shiro,
you scoundrel!

369
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:49,770
[Rin Akatsuki singing
"Kono Te De" in Japanese]

370
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,194
[Shiro] I'm gonna kill
a kid with this.

371
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,496
[Tatsuma] Give it back!
That's sacred to us!

372
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,532
[Shiro] Oh, shut up.
This is all bullshit!

373
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,233
[Tatsuma] Can you save them?

374
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,803
[Shiro] I hate guys like you
worse than anything!

375
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,839
[Mamushi] If I go through
with this, the others
will never forgive me.

376
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,608
[Todo] Are you having
any regrets?

377
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:37,944
[Mamushi] Mr.Todo,
what are you, really?
