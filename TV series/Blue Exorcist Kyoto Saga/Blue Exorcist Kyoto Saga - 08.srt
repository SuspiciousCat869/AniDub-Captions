The miasma's already started
drifting down from the mountain.

Would you please take
the demon‐warding masks

Hey, Yukio, I just wanna say
sorry in advance
for something I did.

00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,166
Great. What have you done
this time?

16

Actually, never mind.

17
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,533
Knowing you,
it's something ridiculous.

18
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,700
Yukio, be honest with yourself
before it's too late.

19

Ms. Kirigakure,
the Director wants to see you.

Okey‐dokey, handsome.
Lead the way.

Everyone's pretty scared, ma'am.

22
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,866
This is the first time
any of us have gone up
against a demon this big.

23
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,133
[Shura] Eh, the size
don't matter all that much.

Hearing that from a senior
Exorcist from the Vatican,

26
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,200
Good. But just between
you and me,

27
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,566
this is the biggest
damn monster I've ever seen.

[priest gasps]

29

We need to build up this fire.

30
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,733
‐[Shura] So? What's the plan?
‐We're making preparations
to summon Ucchusma,

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,666
the guardian that purifies
the unclean.

32
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:31,666
Summoning it
isn't too complicated,

33
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:35,566
but it does require
ten senior Tamers
chanting in unison.

34
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,866
We're shorthanded here, so we'll
need your help with this.

The Impure King is related
to the King of Rot.

36
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:45,233
According to the table
of demonic elements,
fire is its weakness.

37
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,766
At this point, the best option
we have to destroy it
is Ucchusma,

38
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,500
the most powerful fire demon
we can summon.

39

Ucchusma. An Agni.

40
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,700
It's dangerous as hell,
but at least it will be
on our side.

41
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,200
Oh, boy.

I am Ucchusma,
and once summoned,

45
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,066
I am obliged to do the bidding

49

Of this list,
only five of us are left now.

50

Five is not enough!

51
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,333
With that said,
it would displease me greatly

52
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
if the Impure King
were to corrupt this land.

53

Therefore, I shall grant you
the power equivalent
to the blood of five.

I was, but the pact I had
with him was broken

after my secret was revealed.

00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,836
I came to get you.

88
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:37,569
[Tatsuma] Well, that was dumb.

89
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:40,769
I have healed your wounds,
Tatsuma,

90
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,669
but you must not move yet.

91

Karura.

92
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,469
I've never seen you so tiny.

93
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,736
Can't believe we're both
still alive after that.

94
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,869
Yes, well, I am also known
as the Phoenix.

95
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,502
I can always be reborn.

96
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,536
As for you,
I will not let you die.

is still in effect.

00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,602
Rin, you're here!

100
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,969
Does that mean you read
my letter?

101
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:08,336
Mm‐hmm.

102
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:10,469
‐I read it too, Dad.
‐[Tatsuma] What?!

103
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:11,702
No more secrets.

104
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,536
Everyone here understands
the basic situation.

105
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:17,336
But you need to tell us
everything now.

106
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,469
All right, son.

107
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:25,069
I'll tell you how to kill
the Impure King.

108
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,725
The legend of the Impure King
is a record of how our founder
fought it.

109
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,592
Only the higher‐ups in our sect
know about it.

110
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,992
It says the Impure King will
grow as big as a castle.

111
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,925
Then a sporangium is supposed to
sprout up in the middle of it.

112
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,825
Sporangium? Is that it?

113
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,792
That curly‐cue thing poking up?

114
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,559
Yeah, I guess that's it.

115
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,025
When it matures, it's gonna pop
and let loose

116
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,159
a thick cloud of toxic spores.

117
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:56,125
Then the miasma
will spread all over.

118
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:59,992
Last time this happened,
150 years ago,

119
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,259
40,000 people died.

120
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:05,492
And if it gets loose again
in modern‐day Kyoto,

121
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,692
even more people are gonna die.

122
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,859
We've gotta stop it
no matter what.

123
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:13,659
Then if we kill that thing
before its spore sac pops,
that should do it.

124
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:16,625
That's the idea,
but killing it won't be easy.

125
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:20,059
The Impure King's only weak spot
is its heart

126
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,759
and that's inside
the sporangium.

127
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,225
The legend says
when Fukaku fought it,

128
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,294
it took all he had
just to get to the heart.

129
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:30,461
He chopped it in half,
sealed the pieces away,

130
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:31,828
and stopped it.

131
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,394
Then the Right and Left Eyes

132
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:35,462
are really just the two halves
of its heart.

133
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,662
But then, in order for us
to get access to its heart,

134
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,929
we'll have to break open
the sporangium first.

135
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:43,695
‐You got it.
‐[Suguro] That'll be tricky.

136
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:48,895
Fifteen years ago, I made
a pact with Karura to borrow
something called Holy Fire,

137
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:53,495
a spell that converts
the user's life span
into a powerful flame.

138
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:58,695
You can set off a fire that
burns everything if you use it
at the end of your life.

139
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,395
I was saving it
for the end of mine

140
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:04,029
to destroy the Impure King
once and for all.

141
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:07,362
But when it revived,
I had to keep it contained

142
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:09,162
so I used the Holy Fire early,

143
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:12,329
and now I don't have
much flame left.

144
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:16,229
Even if it's not a lot,
I'll use it to create a barrier,

145
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:19,229
so even if the sac pops
and the miasma gets out,

146
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,029
it won't make it
off the mountain.

147
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:24,162
But, Rin, I still need you
to get in there somehow

148
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,695
and destroy the Impure King's
heart with the Koma Sword.

149
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,295
I'm sorry, I can't.

150
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:36,062
No, it's OK.

151
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,062
I'm asking you
to risk your life, after all.

152
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:43,762
[Rin] Nah, that ain't why.
I can't draw the sword.

153
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,562
[all] Huh?

154
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:49,029
I've been trying and trying
but I can't get
the damn thing out.

155
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:51,562
‐Pull harder, ya weenie!
‐[Rin] Leave me alone.

156
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,729
I got one of those mental blocks
going on or something.

157
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:57,729
‐You'd need a brain for that.
‐I'm all worried and stressed.

158
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,762
I can't help
if I can't use this.

159
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,395
Sorry, Mr. Suguro.
I suck.

160
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,295
No, it's OK.

161
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,695
Oh, well.

162
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,795
I can't just sit here.

163
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:10,962
I'd better go and get
that barrier up.

164
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,562
You mustn't, Tatsuma, you have
lost far too much blood.

165
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:17,262
‐Even so, I...
‐Master!

166
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:18,595
Easy, Dad.

167
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:20,129
I healed your wounds.

168
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,162
However you nearly
bled to death.

169
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:25,495
If you try to cast
a barrier spell
in your current state,

170
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:27,629
you will surely die.

171
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,229
[Tatsuma]
It will only take a second.

172
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,995
Besides, containing it's
more important than my life.

173
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:37,229
Konekomaru, what's goin' on?
Did you get through
to Ms. Kirgakure yet?

174
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:40,595
I tried, but the only thing
I get is static!

175
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:42,429
The miasma might
be blocking the signal.

176
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:46,895
Dad! There's gotta be
something else we can do!

177
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:51,662
Oh. So, you are Tatsuma's
son, then. Perfect.

178
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:55,962
If you share the same bloodline,
I can transfer the Holy Fire.

179
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,462
[Tatsuma] No, you can't!
I won't let you!

180
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,829
He's just a kid.

181
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,062
No way are you going
to drag Ryuji into this.

182
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,029
I swore this damn curse
would end with me.

183
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,762
There's no way I'm gonna
let my boy bear this, too.

184
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,462
I'd rather die.

185
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,762
[Suguro thinking] <i>That's why</i>
<i>he was the way he was.</i>

186
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,395
Sorry, son, it's a secret.

187
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:23,195
I can't tell anyone what it is.
Ever. Not even my own son.

188
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,595
You can't.

189
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:26,595
I've told you a million times

190
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:28,562
you can do
what you want in life.

191
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,429
[Suguro] You've been carrying
this load all on your own.

192
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,329
Just to protect me.

193
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,729
[Tatsuma panting]

194
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,195
[chuckles]

195
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:40,562
Nah, I just did it
'cause I wanted to.

196
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,029
I can help you!
So let me help!

197
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:48,195
You're in no shape to handle
this alone anymore!

198
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:51,995
[Karura] Your son is wiser
than you, Tatsuma.

199
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,462
I know he is.

200
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,262
That's why I didn't want him
getting involved in this.

201
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,295
[Karura] I shall now transfer
the Holy Fire.

202
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:09,195
First, you must prove you are
kin to Tatsuma Suguro
with your blood.

203
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,862
Ugh!

204
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:17,229
You are of the same bloodline
as Tatsuma Suguro.

205
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:21,695
Ryuji Suguro, the power
of Holy Fire is yours now.

206
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,162
It's a red flame.

207
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:26,995
Ryuji, I'll show you
our strongest barrier spell,

208
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,262
one that only
the high priest knows.

209
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,729
Come here.
Some of these gestures
are going to be new to you.

210
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,595
Try and memorize
the combinations.

211
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:39,762
Watch close,
I can only do this once.

212
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,362
‐Got it?
‐Mm‐hmm.

213
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,295
You start by forming the sign
to bind Earth and then...

214
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:48,095
[Tatsuma chanting]

215
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:54,729
[Tatsuma] Ryuji, thought I told
you not to come around here.

216
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:59,129
Well, I should say no, but,
eh, what the heck.

217
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,629
[chanting]

218
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:10,662
[Tatsuma] Then touch the ground
with the Earth sign

219
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:12,229
and the barrier should...

220
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:13,662
No, Dad!

221
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,529
[Tatsuma gasping]

222
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,962
Hey, guys,
I need your help here.

223
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,129
Could you stay with my dad
and keep an eye on him?

224
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,295
‐[Shiemi] Yeah, sure.
‐[Izumo] You got it.

225
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:28,262
Shima, Konekomaru, tell
Ms. Kirigakure and the others
what my dad told us.

226
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,695
‐I'm heading up the mountain.
‐Wait, what?

227
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,762
I gotta go and put
that barrier up.

228
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,262
It spreads out from the spot
where my finger's
gonna touch the ground,

229
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,029
so I have to get as close
as possible to the spore sac.

230
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,929
Ahh... are you crazy?!
We're not letting you
near that thing!

231
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,629
Bon, I've always been down
for whatever you said

232
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:48,129
'cause as far as my family's
concerned, you're the boss,

233
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,929
but this time, I'm not
gonna keep my mouth shut.

234
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:55,095
‐You do this, you're gonna die.
‐[Rin] It's cool.

235
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:57,862
I'm gonna be there
to protect him.

236
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,529
‐[Suguro gasps]
‐Chill, man.

237
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:02,595
I can't draw my sword, but I can
sort of use my flames.

238
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:04,229
Besides, I'm super strong.

239
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:07,829
So, what do you say,
Konekomaru? We good?

240
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:11,395
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Well, I say...

241
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:13,162
[Renzo] Koneko!

242
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,629
Everyone's nuts tonight!

243
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,195
Don't say I didn't warn you
when everything goes to shit!

244
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,429
Let's roll. Time's a‐wastin'.

245
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,762
Uh... yeah!

246
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,295
[Suguro, weakly] Be careful.

247
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,662
I never wanted this.

248
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:32,662
Ryuji, I'm so sorry.

249
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:34,862
Try and forgive me.

250
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:40,229
You know, I always loved
listening to you chant.

251
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,762
So don't you go dying
on me now, Dad.

252
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,359
Focus your attacks
where it's growing the fastest!

253
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,092
Don't let it advance
any further!

254
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,259
‐Arrggh!
‐Get back!

255
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,459
‐Salamander!
‐[Salamander roars]

256
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:17,659
[gasping]

257
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,159
[gunshot]

258
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:22,159
That was close.
Fall back, I got this.

259
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,192
Thank you.

260
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,225
[Yukio thinking]
<i>Something's off.</i>

261
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,192
<i>Everything sounds like</i>
<i>it's coming from</i>
<i>a million miles away.</i>

262
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,392
<i>Like none of this is real.</i>

263
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,359
[Shura] <i>Yukio, be honest</i>
<i>with yourself before</i>
<i>it's too late.</i>

264
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:49,325
[Yukio thinking] <i>Saburota Todo?</i>

265
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,359
<i>But he looks so young.</i>

266
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,325
<i>And those flames.</i>

267
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:56,292
<i>Should I call for backup</i>
<i>or go in?</i>

268
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,792
Hi. Don't hide.

269
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,192
I already know you're there.
Come on, show yourself.

270
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,525
Yukio Okumura.

271
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,659
[gasps]

272
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:11,325
[Yukio] Where did he get
that kind of power?

273
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:13,292
Thank you for obliging me.

274
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,425
What the...?
Are you Saburota Todo?

275
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,392
How do you look like that?
Tell me!

276
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,792
Slow down, my boy.
[chuckles]

277
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,092
Yes, I am Todo.

278
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,325
The demon whose powers
I was using before wore out,

279
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:29,325
so I switched it with
what you might call
a higher grade model,

280
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:30,792
and now I'm even stronger.

281
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,625
[Yukio thinking]
<i>He switched demons?</i>

282
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,459
<i>I never heard of a human</i>
<i>doing that before.</i>

283
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,725
‐All right, what are you?
‐Don't worry about that.

284
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,892
Help me test
these new flames out instead.

285
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,359
How about this? We could have
a chat while we play.
Sound good?

286
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:49,525
Now then, what should we
talk about, hmm?

287
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,025
Oh, I know.
How's your brother doing?

288
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:58,725
Oh, my, dodging the question?

289
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:02,092
It shouldn't be too difficult
for you to answer that one.

290
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,692
[Yukio groaning]

291
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,792
Let's try this again.
How is your brother doing?

292
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:12,759
[Suguro] What the hell?

293
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,625
It's turned into
some kind of weird‐ass castle.

294
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,725
Crap. We'd better hurry
or we're all screwed.

295
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,525
‐Let's go.
‐[leaves rustle]

296
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,592
‐Rin!
‐[Rin] Kuro!

297
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:24,392
‐Get outta here!
‐Huh?

298
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,859
Don't "huh" me.
It's too dangerous here!

299
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,925
This mountain's possessed
by a mountain demon!

300
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,159
A really stinky one!

301
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,625
Hang on,
it's called the Impure King.

302
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,492
And yeah,
we know it's dangerous,
but we ain't leaving.

303
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,859
We gotta climb up inside
that thing so we can kill it.

304
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,525
Are you crazy?!
You can't deal with this.
Uh‐uh, no way!

305
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:44,125
Well, someone's got to
or people are gonna die.

306
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,359
You big dummy.

307
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:49,259
It's not safe so I'll take you.

308
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:52,925
Really? Aw, sweet.
You're the best, Kuro!

309
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:54,859
Don't just stand there, hop on!

310
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:57,025
Huh? On that?

311
00:17:57,092 --> 00:18:00,059
[Renzo] Koneko, Koneko, wait up!

312
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,359
Dude, would you stop, already?!

313
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:06,425
[Konekomaru] If you're
too scared to come along,
then go back!

314
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:08,325
[Renzo] No! Look!

315
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:10,592
It's part of the Impure King.

316
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:12,925
Are there any other paths
we can take?

317
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,059
This is the only one that will
take us back to the temple.

318
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,325
What do we do?

319
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,525
Soil ourselves?

320
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,925
‐[Tatsuma coughs]
‐I'm sorry.

321
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:28,625
I don't know about that tea.
It's not really working.

322
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,925
It's all the miasma in the air,
it's too strong.

323
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:36,092
His immune system
must still be really weak
from all the blood he lost.

324
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,025
Oh, if I could only summon Nee.

325
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:42,492
He'd give me an herb so I can
make a more powerful dose
of medicine.

326
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,559
[Izumo] Hmmph. Whining about it
isn't going to help.

327
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,325
We need to get him
to a hospital right away.

328
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:50,225
We're responsible
for his safety.

329
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,792
Let's get him
off this mountain, now!

330
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,692
Mm‐hmm.

331
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,459
[roaring]

332
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:00,325
[Mephisto] The Impure King
is one of the four pets

333
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,059
of the King of Rot.

334
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,859
It is a mindless thing

335
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:06,859
and the damage it could inflict
on Assiah would be
catastrophic.

336
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:09,825
They can scurry about
like ants all they want,

337
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,892
but I doubt these humans
can defeat it.

338
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,259
[chuckles]

339
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,125
‐[blows nose]
‐[snaps fingers]

340
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:21,825
‐The clouds are gathering
for one nasty storm.
‐[thunder rumbles]

341
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,925
Come now,
why do you look so angry?

342
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:32,392
Let's have it.
Does it have anything
to do with your brother?

343
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,359
That's none of your business!

344
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:38,592
Huh. You know you and I
aren't all that different.

345
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,059
You're shackled to your family
day and night, aren't you?

346
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,725
‐Uggh!
‐I get it.

347
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,759
I used to be the same way,
actually.

348
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:55,292
Funny, those memories keep
popping up in my current
condition.

349
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,959
[Yukio thinking]
<i>I'm nothing like him; he's just</i>
<i>trying to psych me out!</i>

350
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,225
<i>I'll die if I don't</i>
<i>do something.</i>

351
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,392
<i>Come on, think! Think!</i>

352
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,759
[Todo] Ow! That really hurt.

353
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:16,325
These bullets must have been
blessed by a naiad.

354
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:19,792
Since fire's my power, right.
It makes sense.

355
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,959
Bullet's attuned to water
affect me.

356
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:26,325
Unfortunately for you,
using these on me is like

357
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,392
flicking water on a hot stone.

358
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:31,392
[chuckles]

359
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,492
Weren't you in the AP program
at True Cross?

360
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,692
You wanted to be a doctor,
didn't you?

361
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,659
Come to think of it,
your father was licensed
as a doctor.

362
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,625
You must have worked so hard.

363
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,659
A doctor and a dragoon
at your age is quite
an achievement.

364
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:48,559
You know your father excelled
at both those meisters.

365
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,725
I expect you'll follow
right along in his footsteps

366
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,925
and get all the meisters
eventually.

367
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,759
You want to be like him so much
that after he passed,

368
00:20:56,825 --> 00:21:00,159
you took over his anti‐demon
pharmaceutics class.

369
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:04,392
Your life is nothing more
than a carbon copy of his.

370
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:08,792
Poor thing. The father who once
guided your every move
is no more.

371
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,892
The only family you have now
is your big brother.

372
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,659
If he died,
what would happen to you?

373
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,759
You'd have nothing left
and you'd be alone.

374
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:18,859
[Yukio] Shut up!

375
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,659
[Todo] You spent your whole life
up to now

376
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:23,859
trudging down the path
your father laid out for you.

377
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:27,725
[sobbing]

378
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:31,292
Yukio, wanna join me
and fight together?

379
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,925
Huh?

380
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:36,359
Do you want to be afraid
forever or be strong,

381
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:39,325
so you can protect Rin
and other people?

382
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:43,559
I could protect Rin? Really?

383
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,459
[Todo] <i>Your father always</i>
<i>treated your brother</i>
<i>like he was special.</i>

384
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,092
<i>And how did he treat you?</i>

385
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,792
<i>I'm sure he was strict</i>
<i>and made you work extra hard</i>

386
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:57,692
<i>so you could become</i>
<i>an Exorcist like him.</i>

387
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,159
Or maybe he raised you that way
to serve another purpose,

388
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:02,859
to protect his favorite son.

389
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:06,425
No! Becoming an Exorcist
was my choice!

390
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,259
Dad and Rin had
nothing to do with it!

391
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:11,992
Ha ha! You're not even aiming.
It's obvious you're upset.

392
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,959
I don't blame you.

393
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:19,059
I'm sure the thought's
crossed your mind many times,
even now:

394
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,925
why do you have to be the one
to protect Rin?

395
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,492
It must feel awful,

396
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,392
especially since he doesn't know
how much you've suffered.

397
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,359
It's OK to say it's not fair.

398
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:31,625
It's OK to say
you can't stand this anymore.

399
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:33,792
[panting]

400
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:36,359
It's OK to say
you hate your brother.

401
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:38,925
And you do, don't you?

402
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,792
[Rin Akatsuki singing
"Kono Te De" in Japanese]

403
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,825
[Rin] We can beat this, Suguro!
