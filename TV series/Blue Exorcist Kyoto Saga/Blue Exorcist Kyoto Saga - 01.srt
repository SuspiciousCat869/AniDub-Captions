What are Exorcists doing here?
Did something happen?

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,121
This area is not safe, ma'am.
You should stay indoors
until we give the all‐clear.

00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,824
[woman] Oh, uh, OK.
Come on, Satoru.

[Satoru] Aww, Mom!

00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,394

fight the monsters!

No, stand down!

Look, we've got you surrounded,
so let the boy go!

won't do you any good!

Aw, crap, it's too hard.

that sucks.

[groans] How'd you find me?
Nobody knows about this place.

28
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,292
I knew you practiced up here
every morning since you started,
you booger.

29
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,794
[Rin] Wha... For real?

30
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,830
What did you expect?
It's my job to keep
an eye on you

31
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,265
because you're a threat
to the safety of everyone here,

32
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,535
including these poor candles.

33
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,004
You should only be lighting
the ones on the ends,

34
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,706
not nukin' 'em all,
you dumbass.

00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,040
[Rin] I know, I know!

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,342
If your flames
get out of control again,

37
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,045
you'll be declared a demon
and executed, remember?

38

[Rin snarls]

39
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,054
Get a handle on using
those flames of yours.

40
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,489
You can't draw the Koma Sword

Come on, let's go.

Where?

45
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,272
[officer] Please, folks,
this area is dangerous.

46
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,008
For your safety,
I need you to stay back.

47
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,443
We'll be taking it from here.

48
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,212
[officer] Okumura,
right this way.

[Yukio]
I'm an Intermediate Exorcist.

First Class. Yukio Okumura.

Senior Ex, First Class,
Kirigakure.

00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,993
‐[Yukio] Huh?
‐[Rin] Me.

54
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,361
[Yukio] What are you
doing here, Rin?

55
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,165
I'm Rin Okumura,
Exorcist, ExWire, Ex‐cetera.

56
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,333
Here to kick demon ass.

57
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,969
Aren't you the...?

58
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,336
Is it OK he's here?

59
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,139
[Shura] Orders from
the Law Enforcement Division.

60
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,808
Besides, he ain't gonna
leave my sight.

61
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,277
Got him on a tight leash,
so you can bet your ass

62
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,512
he's gonna behave himself.

63
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,647
Can either of you tell us
what happened here?

64
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,317
‐Y‐yes, I can.
‐[Kinoshita] Take it easy.

65
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,219
I'm Saburota Todo.

66
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,122
My rank is Senior Exorcist,
Second Class,

67
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,757
and the Deep Keep's warden.

68
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,661
My job is to keep watch over
the Left Eye of the Impure King.

69
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,031
The academy had it sealed away
in the Keep, but it was stolen.

70
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,600
The Impure King?

71
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,136
‐Left eye? Like a real eye?
‐How the hell did that happen?

72
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,972
Hang on. I thought the Deep Keep
was supposed to be protected

73
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,509
by one of the strongest
magic barriers at the academy.

74
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,779
It is, but somehow the thief
got in and stole the eye anyway.

75
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,882
<i>He wore a gas mask so</i>
<i>I couldn't tell who it was.</i>

76
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,652
<i>The Keep's elite guard and I</i>
<i>chased him to the alley.</i>

77
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,253
<i>We thought we had him cornered.</i>

78
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,822
[officer] No, don't!

79
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,625
<i>He used a boy as a shield</i>
<i>and then...</i>

00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,427
‐[whoosh!]
‐[officers groaning]

81
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,297
‐[Satoru] Mommy!
‐[mother] Satoru!

82
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,800
[Todo] He ran into that building
with the hostage,

83
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,702
but we haven't seen him
come out yet.

84
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,105
The miasma he released from
the flask is incredibly potent.

85
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,809
So far 31 people, including
civilians, have been infected,

86
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,712
and we don't have enough doctors
to help them all.

87
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,215
That boy was exposed to
the full force of the miasma,

88
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,886
and if he's not already dead,
he will be soon.

89
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:16,289
If the thief gets away
with the Left Eye, it's over.

90
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,593
This is the biggest failure
in True Cross's history!

91
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,128
[Rin] Dude, come on.
You know about
this Left Eye thing or...?

92
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,398
There's no time to panic.
We'll do everything we can
to get it back.

93
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,068
How tough is this guy
with the gas mask?

94
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,771
I have no idea, to be honest.

95
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,239
He never fought back,
he just ran.

96
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,341
We don't even know
if he's human or a demon.

97
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,445
‐Hmm.
‐We have to act, and fast.

98
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,782
Between Shura and I,
we'll figure out a way to‐‐

[woman] Excuse me.

100
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,852
Do you know if my son
is all right?

101
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,887
[sobs]

102
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,022
You don't have to worry
about a thing, lady.

103
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,558
The best in the biz is here
to do some head busting.

104
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,160
We'll get your kid back
safe and sound, promise.

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,762
If any...

106
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,131
We might be too late.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

107
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,035
He's been in there a long time,
so you should prepare
for the worst.

[sobbing]

109

What the hell, Yukio!

110
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,975
Shura, I'm leaving Rin
with you.

111
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,343
‐What?
‐That's cool.

112
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,846
I just remembered I got
something else I gotta do.

113
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,080
Come on, Rin, let's go.

114
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,983
[Rin] Screw you, man,
I'm comin'!

115
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,187
Exorcists are not superheroes.

116
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,589
We can't save everyone!

117
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,490
So don't go making promises!

118
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,695
You're writing that kid off
before you even do anything,
you chicken shit!

119
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,965
[Shura] All right, tough guy,
we got some errands to run.

120
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,199
Let go, Boobzilla!

121
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,101
[Rin grumbling]

122
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,573
[Yukio] That idiot.

123
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,942
‐[Todo] Okumura?
‐Huh?

124
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,512
‐[Yukio] Mr. Todo?
‐Let me go with you, please.

125
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,113
[Yukio] Are you sure
you're well enough?

126
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,515
[Todo] I've been inoculated.

127
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,483
I have to go.
This happened on my watch.

128
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,986
I understand, sir.
Then let's head in.

129
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,657
[canary singing]

130
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:00,026
[Todo] I hear your background
is... complicated.

131
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,329
But they say you're quite
talented for someone your age.

132
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,432
[Yukio] And I heard you come
from a long line
of well‐respected Exorcists.

133
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:11,572
Your family's been
guarding the Deep Keep
for generations now, hasn't it?

134
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,139
[Todo, wearily] It has.

135
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,109
[Rin] So, what's up
with this Left Eye thingie?

136
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,211
[Yukio] Huh? Rin?

137
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,480
Why are you here?
Where's Shura?

138
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,283
Who knows?
I gave her the slip.

139
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,953
What, you think you can
sideline me whenever things
get a little hairy?

140
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,289
I promised that kid's mom
we were gonna save him.

141
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,757
[canary singing]

142
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,594
I can carry the bird
if you want, I don't mind.

143
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,662
[Yukio] Fine, carry it.

144
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,598
But that's all, understand?

145
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,166
So, what's the bird for?

146
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,802
[Todo] It's a pseudo‐canary.

147
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,571
If it senses miasma,
it will stop chirping.

148
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,508
Then there must be some around
'cause it stopped chirping.

149
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,942
[Yukio gasps]

Look, the kid's still breathing.

[Yukio] But he's in bad shape.
We have to hurry.

00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,755
Don't move!

155
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,861
Another step, and I'll shoot.

156
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,668
[Rin] He's gone!

157
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,604
[Satoru breathing weakly]

158
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,940
Take it easy, kid,
we'll get you out of here.

159
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,445
[Yukio] It's a fake!

160
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,080
‐[Yukio] Ugggh!
‐Yukio!

161
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,917
[Yukio] Mr. Todo?

162
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,855
[Todo, younger voice] Oops.
I guess the jig's up.

163
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,792
Still, I can keep you busy
a bit longer.

164
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,527
‐[cocks gun]
‐[Yukio] Oh, my God!

165
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,295
He's gone over!

166
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,798
Rin, that boy
doesn't have much time.

167
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,167
Get him out of here! Hurry!

168
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,802
I'm on it!

169
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,406
Now, now, I can't have you
running off just yet.

170
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,375
‐[whoosh!]
‐[Rin groans]

171
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,343
[both scream]

172
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,779
[Yukio] Rin!

173
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,314
[Todo] You better stay focused,
or else...

174
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,749
[Yukio groaning]

175
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:03,950
[Todo] Believe it or not,

176
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,219
when I was your age,
I was a lot like you.

177
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,289
My family decided what course
my life would take

178
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,791
since the day I was born.

179
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,293
They didn't care
I had my own dreams
and I never complained.

180
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:18,164
And like a dog, I did
whatever they said and worked
for the good of the Order.

181
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,968
All I wanted was to be like
my dad and big brother.

182
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,172
So now, after a life like that,
do you know what I have
to show for it?

183
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,942
Nothing.

184
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,311
I decided the best thing
for me to do

185
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,479
was admit how I really felt.

186
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,049
My father, my brother,
the Order,

187
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,120
I hated them all,
and everything else
in this world.

188
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,955
That was all it took.

189
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,191
And once I admitted that,
I felt wonderful.

190
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,962
The missing piece in me had been
found and put into place.

191
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,565
[Yukio] You gave into
the temptations of a demon!

192
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,033
You're weak!

193
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,002
There's weakness
in the hearts of all humans.

194
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,606
Are you afraid
to acknowledge yours, boy?

195
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,575
[Yukio gasping]

196
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,944
‐[phone beeps]
‐Looks like my time's up here.

197
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,647
But before I go,
I just want to say

198
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,215
how happy I am
to have had this chat with you.

199
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,719
If what I said doesn't
make sense now, give it time.

200
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,556
You'll understand eventually.

201
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,291
When you do, I'll be there
to welcome you,

202
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,094
Yukio Okumura.

203
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,663
[Yukio] Wait!

204
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,668
[Rin] Yukio!

205
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,771
What do we do?
He's getting worse!

206
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,839
[Yukio] Your flames burned
the spores,

207
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,942
so they multiplied,
to try to repair themselves.

208
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,479
There's no time to get help.
I'll treat him here.

209
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,048
[Yukio panting]

210
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,290
[gasping] Damn this suit.

211
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,792
Dude, what are you...?

212
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,027
You're gonna get infected!

213
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,163
‐I can do it!
‐[Yukio] No, you've done enough!

214
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,768
I have to inject
the vaccine into the spore
without popping it.

215
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,305
Easy.

216
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,940
Damn it.

217
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,212
What's with my hands?
They're shaking like...

218
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,515
<i>like when I was a kid.</i>

219
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,383
<i>I was so scared of demons,</i>
<i>I'd stand there shaking...</i>

220
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,985
[boy whimpering]

221
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,854
<i>just like now!</i>

222
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,624
[Todo] <i>All I wanted was to be</i>
<i>like my dad and big brother,</i>

223
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:27,928

227
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,003
What are you doing?!

228
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,972
[Yukio groans]

229
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,109
[Yukio thinking] <i>Like hell.</i>
<i>I'm not like you!</i>

230
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,359
‐You're safe!
‐Mommy?

231
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,294
[mother] Thank you so much.

232
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,729
Not at all.

233
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:10,470
Nice work!
I expect nothing less
from our Mr. Okumura.

234
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,738
[Rin] Mephisto!

235
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,407
[Mephisto] Hmm.
What a god‐awful mess!

236
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,910
‐Quite the clever
diversion, though.
‐[Rin] Huh?

237
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,880
‐[Mephisto] The real
Left Eye was stolen.
‐[brothers gasp]

238
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,050
‐Don't freak out,
I got my familiar tracking it.
‐[Yukio] What, already?

239
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,286
I had a feeling
that Todo guy was shady,

240
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,655
so I snooped around,
and sure enough he is.

241
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:32,192
As if this wasn't enough,
the mischief makers
were attempting

242
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,827
a two‐pronged assault.

243
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,396
They also tried to liberate
the Right Eye

244
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,965
from our good friends
at our Kyoto facility.

245
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,836
‐[gulp]
‐What a bothersome situation.

246
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,538
What's up with
this Right‐Left Eye crap,
already?

247
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,872
[Mephisto] Anywhoo...

248
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,875
I'm assembling a crack team
to track the Left Eye down

249
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,244
and return it safely
to the academy.

250
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,715
Mr. Okumura, I'd like you
on that team.

251
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,150
‐But why me?
‐[Mephisto] Simple.

252
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,553
We don't know
what the enemy's goal is yet

253
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,755
and since you had contact
with him,

254
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,757
your presence
would be most beneficial.

255
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,559
I understand.

256
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,228
Lovely. See you
at the base in an hour.

257
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,165
Shura, watch him better.

258
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,667
Roger that.

259
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,303
Sheesh, he's the grumpiest
15‐year‐old ever.

260
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,639
He's gonna go bald soon.

261
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,774
[Rin] Hey, Yukio!

262
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,143
You think you're so rad!

263
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,145
One day I'll leave you behind!

264
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,547
Count on it!

265
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:30,851
You'll leave me behind?

266
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,253
Huh. You should work
on your jokes.

267
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,689
‐They're as lame as you are.
‐What?!

268
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,224
I can't baby‐sit you 24/7.

269
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,995
As you can see, I've got
more important things to do.

270
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:46,533
[Yukio thinking]
<i>That's right, this is who I am.</i>

271
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,102
[snarling] You stupid jerk!

272
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,872
I'll show you up someday,
and when I do,

273
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,074
it's gonna make your head spin!

274
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,685
[Rin] In middle school,
I didn't get to go
on the field trip to Kyoto,

275
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,352
so this'll be my first time.

276
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,590
I can't wait
to break that banana
out of my snack pack!

277
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,326
Your little "Yay, I get to go
on a trip" act's almost cute,

278
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,697
but this is work,
so get your ass on the train.

279
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:19,633
[passengers murmuring]

280
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,435
So, is it OK
if I just sit wherever?

281
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:26,106
Know what "read the room" means?
It means you sit up front.

282
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,042
While I'm checking out
how the vaccinations
are coming along

283
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,511
‐up in car three,
‐[Kuro mews]

284
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:32,813
you keep your ass in that seat
and stay out of trouble.

285
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,080
Yeah, I got it.

286
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,517
‐[Shura chuckles]
‐[Rin] Oh, yeah!

287
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,152
Oh, no way!

288
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,588
They got a tower in Kyoto, too?

289
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,824
Sweeeet!

290
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,159
Gotta make sure
to check that sucker out.

291
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,196
Rin.

292
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,335
Shiemi!

293
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,672
[Shiemi thinking]
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

294
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,508
<i>Wh‐Why can't I say anything?</i>

295
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,949
Uh, Suguro, Miwa, Shima!
Good morning.

296
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,752
‐Morning.
‐Good morning, Moriyama.

297
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:13,386
[Konekomaru] Good morning.

298
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,190
Um, Ms. Kirigakure
wants you to go to car three
to get your vaccination.

299
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,859
Oh, right.

300
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,362
Hey, what up?
Glad to see you guys are OK.

301
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,532
Did you know Kyoto
had a friggin' tower?!

302
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,902
What am I saying?
Of course you did.
You're all from Kyoto.

303
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,506
Hey, you know any other cool
spots I can check out?

304
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,541
Let it go, Bon.

305
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,577
I know, I know.

306
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:39,913

00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,152
Oh, come on, Konekomaru.
Don't blank him like that.

308
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,955
What are they thinking,
sending him with us?

309

What are we gonna do
if he goes on another rampage?

310

Hey, if that's what
the bigwigs want,
that's what they want.

311

Quit your stressing,
or you'll pop a blood vessel.

312

OK, listen up.

322
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,171
I'm Shura Kirigakure
and I got forced
into leading this op.

323
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,707
Hold the questions till after
I give you the rundown.

324
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:45,512
All right, so this morning,
someone snuck into the Deep Keep

325
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,214
and stole this hazardous
demonic thing called

326
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,316
the Left Eye
of the Impure King.

327
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,719
We know the thief
wasn't working alone.

328
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,187
He got help from the warden,

329
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,790
Senior Second Class Exorcist
Saburota Todo.

330
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,194
As for why it was stolen
and how many others were
involved, we don't know yet.

331
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,364
Over in Kyoto,
same time this was going on,

332
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,700
someone was trying
to break into their Deep Keep.

333
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,536
They were after the Right Eye
of the Impure King.

334
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,706
They failed this time,
but we think they'll try again.

335
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:16,009
Excuse me, ma'am, I don't know
who this Impure King is.

336
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,678
We haven't studied him.

337
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,614
[Shura] That's probably
'cause he's not one
of the better‐known demons.

338
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,416
<i>The Impure King</i>

343
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,196

<i>left and right eyes.</i>

344
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,832

346
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,504
He gouged them out?
What the hell was he thinking?

347
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,439
That Fukaku guy sounds
like a show‐off.

348
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,541
Oh, my God.

349
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,043
So, anycrap,
even though we don't know

350
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,878
what the enemy wants to do
with the eyes yet,

351
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,015
we're pretty damn sure it's
gonna be for something nasty.

352
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,250
As long as the Right Eye's
at the Kyoto branch,

353
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,719
it's a cinch
it'll get attacked again.

354
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,755
The mission is,
care for the wounded Exorcists

355
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:05,458
and beef up security
in case those scumbags make
another play for the eye.

356
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,529
And I expect
all you ExWires to help out.

357
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,165
And lastly, teamwork,
do your best, blah‐blah‐blah.

358
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,068
And please don't make
extra work for me.

359
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,745
Why aren't you scared of me
like everyone else?

360
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,112
Me, scared of you?

361
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,048
That's the stupidest thing ever.

362
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,783
What, 'cause you're
half‐human, half‐demon?

363
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,654
Let me tell you something,
there's lots of people
who are a mix of the two.

364
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,557
In fact, I know there's
a ton of Exorcists who are.

365
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,791
No way. Seriously?

366
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,225
In my opinion,

367
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,927
the only problem
anyone has with you

368
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,428
is that you're
the son of Satan.

369
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,497
I bet the Order is still
trying to figure out

370
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,633
if having you on their side
is a pro or a con.

371
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,869
That's probably why
they haven't killed you yet.

so does that mean
you have that power, too?

[Yukio] No. I didn't inherit it.

As far as I know,
I'm still human.

The man who raised us
sealed Rin's flames away
in the Koma Sword.

for the sword to contain

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,417
Exorcists can't fight
the good fight on their own.

459
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,721
Like it or not, you better learn
to work together.

460
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,564
[snake]
Straight down
thissss road.

461
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,699
[snake
rattling]

462
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,102
Yukio.

463
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,171
Wanna join me,
fight together?

464
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,506
[Yukio] Huh?

465
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,575
You wanna be afraid forever,

466
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,343
or do you wanna be strong

467
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,778
so you can protect Rin

468
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,046
and other people?

469
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,715
[Yukio] Huh?
Protect Rin?

470
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,684
I can do that?

471
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,719
Really?

472
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:43,129
[Uverworld singing
"Itteki No Eikyo" in Japanese]

473
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,827
We got the enemy
right outside our door,

474
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,996
so now's not the time
to be fighting!

475
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,932
Hmm. If you feel that strongly
about it, Ryuji,

476
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,869
go tell that to your father,
the so‐called master.

477
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:31,337
[Suguro] Watch your damn mouth,
Mamushi!

478
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,907
[Tatsuma] So, uh,
what's your name?

479
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,409
‐[Rin] It's Rin Okumura.
‐[Tatsuma] Really?

480
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,945
I've heard of you.
