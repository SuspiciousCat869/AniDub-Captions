That stuff's related to Rot,

If we use the torch
to keep it away,
we can get down the path.

‐Konekomaru, it's hopeless.
‐Why?

That torch ain't gonna last

Bon and the others will

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,304
That's amazing, Nee!
You're growing so fast.

[Izumo] <i>She's making</i>

309
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,804
Ms. Kamiki, hey,
we'll save you, don't worry.

310
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,737
OK, Nee, go for it!

311
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:25,570
[Nee] Yaaaa!

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,337
Arrrrgh!

314
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:48,137
I don't think so!

There's no stopping this thing!

319
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,037
[Suguro] Okumura, behind you!

320
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,004
I got it!

321
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,070
[groaning]

322
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:12,904
I got it.

323

325
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:25,704
Huh!

326
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:31,837
Oh, no.

327
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,637

[Todo gasps]

332
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,604
What?

333
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,004
Why is everything blue?

334
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,870
What's going on?

335
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:26,470
What happened to... my eyes?

336
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,704
[Todo] Your eyes...

337
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,937
they changed.

338
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,504
How strange.

339
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,370
My instincts kicked in
and made me jump clear of you.

340
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,270
I said you were
interesting before.

341
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:46,304
It seems that was quite
the understatement.

342
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,404
[Yukio] What...

343
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,304
What are you...

344
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,304
[panting]

345
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,870
Those eyes, they don't
belong to you, do they?

346
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:02,237
Argggh!

347
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:09,304
Oh, my, you again.

348
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,070
You're so persistent.

349
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:15,037
How in the world
did you know I was here?

350
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:17,437
Mr. Shima.

351
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,637
When you're
showing off your flames,
you're easy to find.

352
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:22,804
You rotten bastard!

353
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,104

[chuckles]

355
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:33,137
You've ruined everything
that was important to me,

356
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:34,870
and when I get done...
[sword clangs]

357
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,304
there won't even be ash
left of you!
