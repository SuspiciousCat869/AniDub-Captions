[Suguro] <i>I can't take</i>

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:16,049
I've asked you all to this
meeting today for one reason...

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,420
to find out which one of us
is the traitor!

5
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:28,494
On that day, it looked to me
as if the Master were
controlling the flames.

6
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:30,931
Surely, he's not behind this.
That's insane.

7
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:36,169
The fact is, if he wasn't
involved, he'd be here
trying to figure out who was.

<i>Juzo!</i>

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,293
[priest] Excuse me, sir?

14
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,795
Yes?

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,565
[priest] We heard about
the meeting earlier
this afternoon with the elders.

16
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,900
Is something going on
we should know about?

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,403
No. Why?
Did someone tell you there was?

18
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:16,643
The thing is, we thought
maybe something came up
at the meeting you were at,

19
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,646
because all the senior exorcists
in charge of the Keep security

20
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,982
were told the director wanted
to see them ASAP.

21
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,650
‐And this is happening now?
‐Yes, sir.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,519
‐[Juzo] Where?
‐[priest] I don't know.

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,054
But after what happened
the other day down there,

24
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:32,726
it's kind of odd to leave
the Keep's defenses so thin,
don't you think?

25
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,396
[Juzo] Yeah. I'll go find
the director and talk to him.

26
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,764
Thank you.

You can finally get started
on your training now.

Wait, I thought I was training.
Why have I been killing
all these candles?!

61
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,443
You have to control your flames
all the time,
not once in a while.

How many times have
I gotta say it?

If you let them get
out of control again,
it's over for you

00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,955
[Timowan] Let us get straight
to the point.

65
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,357
Is the creature before us
the son of Satan?

66
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,159
[Mephisto] That he is,
your honor.

67
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,128
I simply can't hide the truth
from you any longer.

68
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:06,833
And what was your reason
for having Shiro Fujimoto
raise the boy in secret?

69
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,475
[chuckles]

70
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,778
Why, to fight Satan, milady.

71
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,181
To make him a weapon
for the Order.

72
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,716
May I have everyone's attention?

73
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,019
I would like to propose
the following wager to you.

74
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,455
Will the spawn of Satan become
the demon king of Gehenna

75
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,725
or the savior of the Order?

76
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,795
No, of Assiah.
Place your bets, please!

77
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,864
‐[man] Preposterous!
‐[woman] This is an outrage!

[crowd jeering]

79
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,438
Sir Pheles, we, the Grigori,
accept the wager
put forth by you.

80
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,474
However, certain conditions
must be met.

81
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,513
First, he must pass
the Exorcist Authorization Exam
in six months.

82
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,482
Second, if he is determined
at any time to be
a threat to Assiah,

83
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,987
he shall be declared
an exorcism target
and executed immediately.

84

[Rin snarls]

85
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:07,594
Yeah, you're right, I still got
a long ways to go.

86
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,696
[chuckles] But still,
I lit 'em!

87
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,733
It might be a small step
for one man,

88
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,368
but it's a huge‐ass leap
for mankind!

89
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,003
What the hell
are you talking about?

90
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,607
‐Get back to practicing, doofus.

[keys jingle]

95
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,042
I knew it.
You're the one who betrayed us.

96
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,681
The trick with the sacred flame
was a nice touch.

97
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:05,552
I didn't suspect you until you
started pointing fingers
at me at the meeting.

98
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,221
I'll be honest,
maybe we never clicked,

99
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,990
but I did admire you.

100
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,227
No one else was as dedicated
to Myoda as you were.

101
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,996
So why did you do it?

102
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,601
Say something!

103
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,671
[Mamushi] I did it
to open Myoda's eyes.

104
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,575
There are two traitors.

105
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,879
One is Tatsuma Suguro!

106
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,182
The other is
the Order's precept,

107
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,952
Mephisto Pheles.

108
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,220
Mephisto?

109
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,493
Mephisto? Why do you think that?

110
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,962
Eight years ago,

111
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,599
when we began our studies
at the cram school
for exorcists,

112
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,570
Mr. Todo asked me
to his office one day.

113
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,772
‐Miss Hojo.
‐Yes, sir.

114
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,708
[Todo] What I'm about
to tell you is confidential.

115
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,511
Have you heard of the Left Eye
of the Impure King?

116
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,779
What?

117
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,181
[Todo] The precept,
Mephisto Pheles,

118
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,784
is storing the Left Eye
in the Deep Keep.

119
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,186
He says it's
his personal property.

120
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,790
Supposedly, a Right Eye
is also said to exist.

121
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,626
To be honest,
this is all quite mysterious.

122
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:23,263
Since you're from the Myoda sect
and they defeated
the Impure King,

123
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,266
I was wondering if you knew
anything about it.

124
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,734
The Left Eye?

125
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,704
But this is the first time
I've ever heard about it.

126
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,873
Oh, that is unusual.

127
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,274
It is.

128
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,376
[Todo, voice fading]
Now I'm really concerned.

129
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,744
I don't think the precept...

130
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,045
[Mamushi] <i>So we talked.</i>

131
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,148
He told me he had been
suspicious of Mephisto

132
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,584
for a long time.

133
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,219
He wanted to expose
the precept's corruption.

134
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,487
[Juzo] What?

135
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,089
[Mamushi] Something else
Mr. Todo found out

136
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,258
was that Tatsuma Suguro was
also involved in the treachery.

137
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,663
For the past few years, I've
been cooperating with Mr. Todo,

138
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,366
and I've been doing
my own investigating.

139
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,404
I dug and dug and dug,
but I couldn't find
anything, really.

140
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,939
Till a week ago.

141
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,443
I found out a disciplinary
hearing had been held
at the Vatican.

142
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,179
Mephisto was the one
being questioned.

143
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:17,283
It turns out, Mephisto had
spared the son of Satan's life

144
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,985
and was raising him in secret.

145
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,921
He did what?!

146
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,256
[Mamushi] It's true,
and what's worse is,

147
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:27,861
he used the most sacred relic
of Myoda to seal his powers.

148
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:33,767
You understand
what that means, don't you?

149
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,937
It means Mephisto was
involved in a conspiracy,

150
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,540
just as Mr. Todo suspected.

151
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,075
And Tatsuma Suguro helped him.

152
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,111
Can you prove it?

153
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,448
What, do you think I have
the evidence with me?

154
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,684
No matter.
It will all be clear soon.

155
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:55,055
[Mamushichanting spell]

156
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,258
We can't trust our superiors
anymore.

157
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,094
[wind whooshing]

158
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,637
[hisses]

159
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,205
[Mamushi] Mr. Todo will help us.

160
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,441
He'll take the right
and left eyes and seal them away
somewhere safe.

161
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,879
Stop it, Mamushi!
Think about what you're doing.

162
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,048
If what you say is true,
you should tell the elders!

163
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,717
[Mamushi, scoffing]
The elders.

164
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:27,688
Even though Tatsuma sold
Myoda out to the Knights
of the True Cross,

165
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,390
our elders would never
accuse him of anything.

166
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,358
Even my own father wouldn't!

167
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,861
Do you think they'd believe
what I just told you?!

168
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,198
<i>And your father? Hah!</i>
<i>He's even worse!</i>

169
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,466
<i>I could hand him the evidence</i>
<i>on a platter,</i>

170
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,169
<i>and he'd just laugh</i>
<i>and say I was imagining things.</i>

171
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,772
<i>There's no time</i>
<i>for playing those games.</i>

172
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,475
Well, things have escalated
sooner than we thought.

173
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,911
Master?

174
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,314
Yes, I've heard enough.

175
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,816
[coughs]

176
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,986
I'll have the senior exorcist
on standby to take her
into custody.

177
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,223
Is that OK, Uwabami?

178
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,262
Mamushi's an adult now.

179
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,131
Yes. Do it.

180
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,668
‐[hisses]
‐[Juzo] This is wrong, Mamushi.

181
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,170
[Mamushi] I don't need
your approval.

182
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,110
I'm doing this to save Myoda!

183
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,446
[Juzo groans]

184
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,948
[Juzo] Fine then.

185
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,550
We were friends once,

186
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,718
and now it's up to me
to stop you!

187
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:35,822
Mamushi, Juzo, stop it!
Calm down and let's
talk this over!

188
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,991
‐[building rumbling]
‐Aaah!

189
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,731
[Rin] What the hell?
Everything's shaking.

190
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,199
[sniffs]

191
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,300
[Kuro] Over there!

192
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,103
Something's up
at the field office.

193
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,605
Rin, stay here
and keep on...

194
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,707
‐[bell clangs]
‐Huh?

195
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,175
Huuuuh?!

196
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:59,613
[Shura snarls]

197
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,181
[Rin screams]

198
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,316
Yo, where do you think
you're going?!

199
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,786
I'm your guardian
and I told you to stay!

200
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,054
‐I got it, I got it!
‐[Shura snarls]

201
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:12,593
‐You damn well better!
‐[Rin] Ow ow ow ow ow!

202
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,227
[Rin] Oww!

203
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,600
What do we do?

204
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,669
‐[earth rumbles]
‐[Rin] Ohh!

205
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,839
Ah, what the hell.
Come on, kid.

206
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,948
‐[alarm wailing]
‐What's going on?
That's no earthquake.

207
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,317
[Tatsuma] It's an intruder!
Get to the Keep!

208
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,853
‐[alarm ringing]
‐Hey, you know what's going on?

209
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,287
The Keep's being
broken into again!

210
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,857
‐[rumbling]
‐[Suguro straining]

211
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,892
[Suguro] What the hell's
going on?

212
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,493
[rumbling continues]

213
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,432
[Juzo] The ceiling.
It's rotting!

214
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,879
Mamushi!

215
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:21,494
Why, hello, Mr. Shima.

216
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,297
So good to see you again.

217
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,012
Todo! You devil!
You tricked Mamushi into this!

218
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,847
[Todo chuckles]

219
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,348
[Todo] Devil, am I?

220
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,449
[chuckles]

221
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,820
I like it, but you're wrong
about me tricking her.

222
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,489
Actually, Ms. Hojo asked
for my help.

223
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,927
What he says is true.
Stealing the eyes was my idea.

224
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,830
I don't believe that!
He's brainwashing you!

225
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,567
Come on, Mamushi!
Can't you see he's messing
with your head?

226
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,036
Snap out of it!

227
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,540
Don't do it.
You're out of your mind!

228
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,010
Stop!

229
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,912
I know what I'm doing.

230
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,081
‐You're the ones being tricked.
‐[air whooshing]

231
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,651
[priests straining]

232
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,060
[priest] What happened?!

233
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,132
[surprised murmuring]

234
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,200
No way. I can't believe it.

235
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,936
Mamushi was the traitor?

236
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,971
Where'd they go?

237
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,907
[murmuring continues]

238
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:45,311
[Yaozo] Quiet, everyone.
Now's not the time to panic.
We have to regroup.

239
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,948
[footsteps]

240
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:57,023
‐Long time, no see, Dad.
‐[Tatsuma chuckles]

241
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,425
Ryuji!
Yeah, it has been a while.

242
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,462
That sure is one heck
of a mohawk you got going on.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,898
‐[Suguro] Going somewhere?
‐[Tatsuma laughs nervously]

244
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,367
Actually, yeah.
To go find Mamushi.

245
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,836
Can't have her out there
with that eye, can we?

246
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:13,439
‐You mind letting me go?
‐You're going after Mamushi,
huh?

247
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,077
Do you know why she betrayed us,
why we're in this mess now?

248
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,479
It's 'cause of you!
This is your fault!

249
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,448
You should have been
at the meeting
instead of farting around!

250
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,717
Suguro...

251
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,722
[Shura] You know the old guy?

252
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:32,859
[Rin] Yeah. That's Suguro's dad.

253
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,661
You better start talking, Dad.

254
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,463
Is it true what Mamushi said,
that you betrayed us?

255
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,166
I... What are you saying?
Of course not.

256
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,671
OK then, why don't you tell
everyone, right here, right now,
what you've been up to?

257
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,775
You really wanna know, huh?

258
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,885
Sorry, son, it's a secret.

259
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,488
I can't tell anyone what it is.
Ever.

260
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,024
Not even my own son.

261
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,229
How can you say that
after what just happened here?

262
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,465
Yeah, well, I have to go
after Mamushi.

263
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:16,570
Listen, be a good boy and do
what your mom and teachers
tell you.

264
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,173
Oh, and stay out of trouble.
Got it, son?

265
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,908
Drop the act, already!

266
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,644
[soft murmuring]

267
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:31,184
You're only ever around
when it's convenient for you.

268
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,588
This time, if you bail now
without explaining yourself,

269
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:38,491
then as far as I'm concerned,
you're not my dad anymore!

270
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,129
Gimme a break!
You're not my father.

271
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,598
You're nobody to me.

272
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:48,835
Don't ever let me see you
acting like my father again!

273
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,303
Ugggh!

274
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:54,407
That boy is my son,
and I'm taking him back.

275
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,380
Oh, Dad!

276
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:05,786
I, uh...
I really should get going.

277
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,756
Try and forgive me.

278
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,527
[Tatsuma groans]

279
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,632
[Rin] Wait.

280
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,704
Huh? Crap.
He gave me the slip again.

281
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,374
‐O... Okumura!
‐[Rin] Why are you walking away?

282
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,577
You're supposed to be his dad,
ain't ya?

283
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,547
‐Rin, I...
‐You cool leaving it like this?

284
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,215
Well, are ya?

285
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:41,588
And as for you, Suguro,
quit being an ass!

286
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,591
‐[crowd shouting]
‐[Juzo] Bon!
‐[Shura] Rin!

288
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:51,364
‐[priest 1] Are you all right?
‐[priest 2] Bon!

289
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,734
[priestess] Did you see
a flash of light just now?

290
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:57,303
[Rin] I don't know what went
down between you guys before,

291
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,040
but I know you're both gonna
regret this later on!

292
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,545
Apologize!
Tell your dad you're sorry,
while you still can!

293
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,614
What do you know?
This ain't your business!
Stay out of it!

294
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,450
He's your dad, man.
You can't push him away
like this!

295
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,687
Yeah, right,
like you're one to talk.

296
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,189
Now, now, boys,
let's everybody cool down.

297
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,924
Why don't you shake hands
and make up?

298
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:21,494
What are you still doing here?
You know where the door is.

299
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,096
Leave.

300
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,365
And don't come back!

301
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,649
[Rin whimpers]

302
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,150
[flames whoosh]

303
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,252
I used to think you were
the coolest.

304
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,855
‐No, Rin!
‐[Rin] I used to look up to you!

305
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:53,527
But you're not cool at all.
You're an asshole!

306
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:57,163
‐What's happening to him?!
‐[priest] He's on fire!

307
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,099

Excuse me,
coming through here.

310
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,706
That's enough, Rin!

It ain't like I wanna be
Satan's kid!

318
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,904
My situation ain't
the same as yours!

319
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:42,008
It ain't, is it?
Tell your dad you're sorry.

320
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,611
It'll be too late
when he's dead!

321
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,081
Don't make the same mistake
I did!

322
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,984
Tell him you're sorry! Now!

‐Don't worry, Bon, I got this.

Did you forget what the Grigori
said the other day
at the hearing?

[Rin groaning]

337
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,168
You can't lose it.
Get a grip or you'll be
executed as a demon.

338

I don't care!

00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:16,803
Hey, um, can I get a hand
taking this doofus to a cell?

348
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:20,273
He's out cold
so he won't bite ya, promise.

I hope so,

Yes, well, then I expect you'll
stop by to explain it later?

Of course I will, sir.

of this responsibility
isn't too much for you.

Keep an eye on Rin for me,
will ya?

to gas everyone?

[Yukio]No way.
There has to be more to it.

359
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,438
[Shura] He sort of flared up
in front of everyone.

360

[Yukio] He's such an idiot!

Shura, you scoundrel!
