According to the table

the weaker.

And in our case,

[Todo] <i>Oh, Mr. Okumura.</i>

[groaning]

167
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,566
Todo!

168
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:29,533
Where are you?

169
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,100
Where?!

170
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,626
[murmuring]

171
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,593
[coughing]

172
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,426
[Yukio] Did everyone make it?

173
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:45,160
[Uwabami] I hope so.

174
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,860
A person can't last

175
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,226
with the amount of miasma
trapped in the barrier.

176
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:53,260
It went up just in time
and prevented God knows
how many deaths.

177
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,726
But who could have cast
such a high‐level spell?

178
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,160
It's obvious, the Master did.

179
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,660
[Konekomaru] It wasn't!

180
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:02,393
[Uwabami] Konekomaru! Renzo!

181
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,126
The Master didn't put it up.

182
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,826
Bon cast the spell
that created the barrier.

183
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:10,626
Okumura went with him and
both of them are still inside!

184
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,393
[gasps] Are you sure?

185
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,226
Super sure. The Master's hurt

186
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:16,426
and Kamiki and Moriyama
are with him.

187
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:17,826
They're on the eastern slope.

188
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:21,660
Master Yaozo, please,
our friends need help!

189
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,960
All rightie.

190
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:28,560
I'll go on ahead,
slip inside the barrier

191
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,360
and help Suguro and Okumura.

192
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:33,826
[Yaozo] Right. We'll talk
to the boys and find out
what they know.

193
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:36,460
Then I'll send up teams
to assist you and the Master.

194
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,560
[Shura] Awesome.

195
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,060
[boys gasp]

196
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,193
[Shura] Miwa, Shima,
you did good.

197
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:48,093
Man, I deserve more than
a lame pat on the head.

198
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,226
I could use some nuzzlin'
after what I went through.

199
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,793
Back to normal, huh?

200
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:04,960
[Shura] <i>Rin, I hope you got</i>
<i>your confidence back.</i>

201
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:09,326
[Izumo groaning]

202
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:16,193
It's a fungus demon,
so we should use ferns and moss.

203
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,760
Hey, Nee, I need libby...

204
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,226
I meant liverwort
and hornwort.

205
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:22,960
Cover the fungus with those.

206
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:24,726
[Nee] Yaaaa!

207
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:28,126
[Nee casting spell]

208
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,626
[Shiemi] Skeleton fork next!
Then horsetail!
Then adder's tongue!

209
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:39,126
[Izumo thinking]
<i>Wow! She's really pushing</i>
<i>her familiar.</i>

210
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,626
<i>How can she handle it?</i>

211
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,560
[groaning]

212
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,326
Suguro!

213
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:00,060
Suguro!

214
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:06,326
[Suguro groaning]

215
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,660
Karura!

216
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:16,226
I call for your protection!

217
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,826
[Karura] As you wish.

218
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:43,909
I managed to drive away
the Impure King.

219
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:46,642
However, you have cast
a double spell

220
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,009
and it will quickly deplete
your energy.

221
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,776
[coughing]

222
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:53,876
[footsteps]

223
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:56,442
[Rin] Suguro! You OK?!

224
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,142
‐[Kuro mews]
‐[Rin] What did you do?

225
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,776
[Karura] I diverted a small bit
of power from the barrier

226
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,109
to protect Ryuji.

227
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:07,609
If the caster loses
consciousness, all is lost.

228
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:11,476
The Impure King is drawn
to the energy of the living.

229
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,876
But against fire,
he is weakened.

230
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:16,542
This should keep him away
for the time being.

231
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,976
‐Great, so now we just‐‐
‐[Suguro] Hang on.

232
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:22,942
[Suguro] I doubt the barrier
will hold another 15 minutes.

233
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,642
Say what? What do you mean?

234
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,976
Dude, I'm totally
wiped out here.

235
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:30,009
I feel like I hit
the freakin' wall.

236
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:34,009
I don't think I could
do this for much longer.

237
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:38,376
I guess Koneko and Shima

238
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:42,676
couldn't get to the others yet.

239
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:46,609
I hope whatever happens...
that they're OK.

240
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,942
Sure they are, they gotta be!

Well... I guess this is it.

255
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:55,409
I can hold the barrier
for a bit longer...

256
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,542
so get out while you can.

257
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,776
No!

258
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,009
[Suguro] Go on.

259
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:04,342
You need to evacuate
as many people as you can.

260
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,309
Hurry up. Don't argue.

261
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:10,709
Every second counts now.

262
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,342
Go!

263
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:24,476
‐Wait, that's right!
‐[Suguro] Huh?

264
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:27,442
[Rin] What's that thing called?
Kyoto something.

265
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,009
Oh, now I remember.
Kyoto Tower!

266
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:32,576
Uh...

267
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:35,942
Dude, I wanna go see it
and go to the top.

268
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,742
Can we go, like maybe tomorrow?

269
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,742
You're from here,
and I want a tour.

270
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,142
I read it's a tower
but with a bath house in it.

271
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,942
I so gotta see that.

272
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:48,542
It'd be rad if we could get
everyone to go too.

273
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:53,009
Thing is, it'd suck if Kyoto
and the tower got destroyed.

274
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:57,876
And if our friends died too...
that'd suck worse.

275
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:00,109
We'll win.

276
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:02,342
We gotta.

277
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,909
Why...

278
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:13,809
Why the hell are you nerding out
about Kyoto freakin' Tower?!

and I've never been to it!

‐You're kidding!
‐Kyoto's got a ton

of famous temples

283
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:29,376
I don't know anything about
towers and "rally‐fences."

284
