1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,516
[Kuro] Huh? [gasp]

2
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,851
It's that tower
you were talking about!

3
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,586
[Rin] Whoa!

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,755
That is so cool!

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,389
Look, you guys!

6
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,561
[Kinzo] Over here, folks!

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,395
[train horn blows]

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,268
[Uverworld singing
"Itteki No Eikyou" in Japanese]

9
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,996
OK, so I'm Kinzo Shima
and I represent
the local field office.

10
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,998
Welcome to Kyoto!

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,701
Aw, Kin, that's so corny.

12
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,370
Hope no one figures out
we're related.

13
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,541
First things first.
We'll be taking you
to the inn you'll be staying at.

14
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,109
And, once your rooms are sorted
and your bags dropped,

15
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,212
you guys are gonna help us out
with the Temptaint victims.

16
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,814
We appreciate your support.

17
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,283
‐[microphone feedback]
‐[Kinzo] Oww!

18
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,788
[Kuro] Rin, look at that!
Look, look!

19
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,291
[Renzo] Dear God,
please kill me.

20
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,827
Kill me now!

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,131
[Kinzo] And here we are.

22
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,033
Hmm? [gasp]

23
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,702
[staff] Welcome, everyone.

24
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,506
‐Right this way, please.
‐[man 1] It's Bon!

25
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,408
[man 2] Look, you're right.
It is Bon!

26
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,077
Welcome home, Bon.

27
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,445
Chill out, guys.
I'm not here to visit.

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,315
Bon? I didn't even
recognize you, man.

29
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,617
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,719
Wow, today's a special day.

31
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,053
Oh, ma'am!

32
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,622
No, wait!

33
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,759
[gasps] Ryuji!

34
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,761
[sighs]

35
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,698
My boy.

36
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,968
‐Ow!
‐What the hell did you go
and dye your hair for?!

37
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,539
What do you think you are,
some kind of rooster?!

38
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,373
It... it's for motivation.

39
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,577
Motivation, my ass!
Change it back now!

40
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,246
[Renzo] I knew she'd flip out
about the hair.

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,781
[snarls]

42
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,249
Should we go?

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,752
Oh! Oh, my,
where are my manners?

44
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,623
Nice to meet you.
My name is Torako.

45
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,726
I'm so happy to finally meet
my son's friends.

46
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,161
[gasp] No way.
You're his mom?!

47
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,596
I thought you'd be more...

48
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,765
‐[buzzer sounds]
‐[growling]

49
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,768
Yep, this here
is Bon's family home.

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,470
I thought Suguro's house was
supposed to be a temple.

51
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,473
It was, but the temple couldn't
make ends meet anymore.

52
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,644
Luckily, I inherited this inn
from my family.

53
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,712
[Izumo] I just thought
of something.

54
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,948
Since it's always "Bon" this
and "Bon" that,

55
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,051
‐we should call him "Bon‐Bon"!
‐I can hear you!

56
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,788
‐Thanks so much
for putting us up here.
‐Not at all!

57
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,823
Whenever the Knights
of the True Cross
come through town,

58
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,059
we always appreciate
the business.

59
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,395
I have to head over
to the field office
to help those guys out,

60
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,397
but I'd like to leave
half our doctors here

61
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,466
to treat anyone infected
with the Temptaint.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,036
‐I do appreciate it.
‐Suguro, Miwa, Shima.

63
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,438
You guys haven't seen
your families in a while,

64
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,274
so go spend some time
with them.

65
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,509
Thanks.

66
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,477
Moriyama, Kamiki,

67
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,779
Takara and Okumura.

68
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,814
Tend to the wounded.
We good?

69
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,448
[all] Yes, ma'am.

70
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,351
Follow me, guys.
I'll take you to 'em.

71
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,120
[patients groaning]

72
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,922
[Izumo] There are so many.

73
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,158
And there's another 15 or so
back in the guesthouse.

74
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,760
OK, everyone, here's the plan.

75
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,495
They're making an herbal
antidote in the kitchen,

76
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,731
so we're going to need you
to hand it out.

77
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, and if you see
any empty IVs, replace them.

78
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,368
[all] Right.

79
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,372
Uh... Hold it.
Not you, Okumura.

80
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,710
Oh. OK, what do you
want me to do?

81
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,045
Hmm. Let's see.

82
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,947
What to do, what to do.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,718
‐I know, pick stuff up.
‐Like what?

84
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,020
Like trash.

85
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,288
Huh?

86
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,490
[Torako] Yaozo,
you have a visitor.

87
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,328
Who is it? [groans]

88
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,363
Bon! [coughs]

89
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,167
Dad! Take it easy, Dad.
Are you OK?

90
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,902
Yeah.

91
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,705
[Torako] Yaozo, please.
Lie back down and relax.

92
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,241
Don't worry.
It's not that serious.

93
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,177
I'm the field office chief.
I can't stay in bed.

94
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,280
The sooner I get on my feet
and back to work, the better.

95
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,449
How is everyone else doing?

96
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,186
They're fine.
No one died, they just
need treatment is all.

97
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,756
That's good, thank God.

98
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,324
It's good to see that you're
doing all right, kid.

99
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,927
Yeah. They're the reason
for that.

100
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,596
[Yaozo] Konekomaru.

101
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,265
Thank you for keeping Bon
out of trouble.

102
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,867
You're one tough little guy.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,536
No, I'm not really
that tough at all, sir.

104
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,705
All I did was panic
like a scaredy‐cat.

105
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,741
Dad, Dad, you won't believe
how many times I risked my life.

106
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,980
Oh, yeah? Was it before
or after you dyed your hair?
I didn't trust you with my k'rik

107
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,683
so you could go
and run around outside
with pink freakin' hair!

108
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,385
Jeez, Dad, I've been doing
the best I can, honest.

109
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,189
Actually,
he pretty much panicked
like a scaredy‐cat, too.

110
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,758
Dude, do you honestly think
you're helping here?

111
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,729
And my dad...
did he get hurt
like everyone else?

112
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:40,901
Master Suguro just happened
to be visiting the field office
right when the attack broke out.

113
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,737
He got a little shaken up
in all the commotion,
but he's OK.

114
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,172
[Suguro] And where is he now?

115
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,876
Good question.
I know he goes back
to the temple every day.

116
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,845
If only he had a cell phone,
we could call him.

117
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,115
Damn it.
I got a bone to pick

118
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,084
with that no‐good,
bald‐ass bastard.

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,188
[Kuro sighs]

120
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,558
Psst! You there!

121
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,227
Could you give me a hand
over here, sonny?

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,995
[Rin] Hmm?

123
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,432
Aw, yeah, watermelons!

124
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,035
Shhh! Do me a favor.

125
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,538
If you slice them up
and hand them out
to the injured,

126
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,439
you can have a slice
for yourself.

127
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,543
You got it.
I'll slice them up good.

128
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,215
[Kuro] Whew! This guy
smells like alcohol.

129
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,588
Yeah. Yo, have you been
hittin' the bottle?
That ain't very monkly.

130
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:39,025
Oops, busted. It's so hot,
I couldn't help myself.

131
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,961
[Tatsuma chuckles]

132
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,701
A degenerate holy man.
You're the same as my dad was.

133
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,370
Ha ha! I like you, kid.

134
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:54,140
So, uh, what's your name? Hmm?

135
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,309
It's Rin Okumura.

136
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,178
[gasps]

137
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,280
Really?

138
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,382
I've heard of you.

139
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,451
So, when are you gonna
tell me who you are?

140
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,020
Who, me? Didn't I?

141
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,624
Oh, I guess not.
I'm Ryuji Suguro's dad.

142
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,526
Huh? You're kidding!

143
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,427
‐[buzzer sounds]
‐[growl]

144
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,029
[chuckles] No, I'm not.

145
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,132
‐See the resemblance?
‐Not really.

146
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,202
‐Suguro looks way more cooler.
‐You think?

147
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,172
Sounds to me like you and my boy
get along pretty well,
don't ya?

148
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,978
We had a fight.

149
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,214
‐Oh, no. You too, huh?
‐[Kuro mews]

150
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,618
Welcome to the club, boy, 'cause
he's pissed off at me too.

151
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,453
‐[chuckles]
‐[Rin] I don't think it's funny.

152
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,122
‐Huh?
‐[Kuro mews]

153
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,659
He can be, I don't know,
difficult.

154
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,061
[chuckling]
I heard that.

155
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,565
Deep down,
I know he's a good guy.

156
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,534
I just...

157
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,401
wish we could get along.

158
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,871
I know how you feel.

159
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,442
[Shura] So this
is Kyoto's Keep, huh?

160
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,344
[Kinzo] Yep. Sure, it might be

161
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,113
a little smaller
than the Deep Keep
at True Cross Academy,

162
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,150
but FYI, the wards
we got protecting it
are just as strong.

163
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,086
Both Keeps got broken into
all the same, though.

164
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,121
[chuckles] Yeah,
you got a point there.

165
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,324
I heard the Myoda sect's got
some in‐fighting going on.

166
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,894
You think maybe that's
got something to do with this?

167
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,429
Ma'am, if you really want
to know the truth,

168
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,799
you might have hit
the nail on the head there,

169
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,968
but you didn't hear that
from me.

[Shura] The Right Eye
of the Impure King.

171
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,747
There! Hey,
since this was your idea,

172
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,449
wanna help carry them
into all the...?

173
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,451
Yo, pops,
where are you going?!

174
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,654
I'm glad I got
to meet you, Rin.

175
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,756
Looking forward
to our next chat.

176
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,158
Hey, wait,
why don't you use the door?

177
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,929
[Juzo] Don't give me that.

178
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,732
Security of this Keep
is Hojo responsibility.

179

Your people couldn't
do their jobs and that's
why we're in this mess.

If your people on the upper
level were paying attention,

181
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,708

to us.

were supposed to be
more chill.

185
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,952
Don't you dare put this on us,

186
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,856

snake‐faced hags!

‐Bon.
‐Master Ryuji.

194
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,150
We got the enemy
right outside our door,

195
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,952
so now's not the time
to be fighting.

196
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,355
I... You're right,
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,960
Hmm. If you feel that strongly
about it, Ryuji,

198
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,663
go tell that to your father,
the so‐called master.

199
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,331
Instead of behaving
as a high‐priest should,

200

he's a drunk and the butt
of everyone's jokes.

Watch your damn mouth, Mamushi!

202
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,107
[Shura] No, Mamushi's right.

203
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,642
Bon.

204
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,144
[Suguro] Whatever.
Just stop fighting.

205
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,117
[Kuro] It's a shame no one's
hungry for watermelon, huh?

206
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,485
Yeah.

‐Damn it, Bon!
‐It's fine, Dad.

210
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,906
We don't have the money
to buy them snacks anyways,
so what's the harm?

00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,912
‐Yaa!
‐Hey, where are you going, Bon?

Thought I told you
not to come around here.

216
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,696
I know. I was just bringing
an offering for Buddha, Dad.

217
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,434
Since I'm here, can I listen
to you do the sutras again?

218
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,071
Well, I should say no,
but, eh, what the heck.

I know you're busy,

but would you take some food
over to the field office?

Well, Ryuji, you just

‐Hmm?

for a little while?

Sorry. I'm responsible for you,

00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,115
and there's no way
I'm letting you go
to the mountains after dark.

00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,546
I'm supposed to inherit
this temple, so I gotta‐‐

311
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,816
[monk] I can't take this.
I'm leaving the Myoda sect.

312
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,553
I can't feed my family
because the temple keeps
losing parishioners.

313
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,255
Besides, what if
another Blue Night happens?

314
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,425
I don't wanna be here!

315
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,427
‐Bon!
‐[Suguro] Wait!

316
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,329
When I grow up
and take over the temple,

317
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,264
my dad and me
are gonna defeat Satan.

318
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,434
We'll make sure the Blue Night
never happens again!

319
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,737
And we won't let anybody else
get hurt!

320
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,607
Don't go! Stick with us
for a little longer!

321
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,176
But, Ryuji,
the other issue we have is,

322
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,012
your father
gave away our temple's
most sacred artifact.

323
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,314
It's an insult to us.

324
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,817
It's an insult
to the entire Myoda sect.

325
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:35,789
I am sorry, but we just can't
follow Master Tatsuma
any longer.

326
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,759
You'll see, Dad'll fix it.

327
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,962
Don't leave, please don't.

328
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,964
[Juzo] Hey, Bon.

329
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,366
Is everything OK here?

330
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,870
Juzo, they said everyone's
leaving the temple.

331
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,206
Like you and Mamushi,
and Shima and Konekomaru.

332
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,509
Is everyone really gonna leave?!

333
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,911
Don't worry,
it won't come to that.

334
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,646
Huh?

335
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,582
[Yaozo] Ever since
the Blue Night,

336
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,317
a number of issues have taken
their toll on Myoda.

337
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,722
And after much deliberation
between us senior priests
and the master,

338
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,257
we have finally come
to a decision.

339
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:16,362
We will affiliate ourselves
with the Knights
of the True Cross.

340
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,299
We'll have to make some changes,
but they won't conflict

341
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,135
with our beliefs regarding
pure exorcisms.

342
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,070
And the master has approved.

343
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:27,941
All in favor,
raise your hand!

344
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,810
[monks murmuring]

345
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,648
Dad! I heard about
the Knights of the True Cross.

346
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,418
Are you gonna be
an official Exorcist now?

347
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,187
‐No, I won't.
‐Huh?

348
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,223
After we merge
with the Knights,

349
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,860
I'm going to let Yaozo
and Uwabami handle things
from now on.

350
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,895
That should ease the minds
of everyone.

351
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,533
And you don't need to worry
about any of that stuff either.

352
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,369
Well, son, I've got work to do.
See you later.

353
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:00,741
But, Dad...

354
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,743
[Uwabami] Master Ryuji.

355
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,245
[gasps] Uwabami.

356
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,080
It's been a while, hasn't it?

357
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,416
I heard you managed to defuse
that altercation earlier.

358
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,085
Thank you for doing that.

359
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,120
Nah, it's cool.

360
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,990
Master Ryuji,
I hate to say this,

361
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,425
but we suspect the burglar
might be one of ours.

362
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,529
‐What?
‐It's true,
and it's why I've decided

363
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,565
to keep the investigation
quiet for now.

364
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,768
‐Any idea who it could be?
‐Not yet.

365
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,236
Everyone's a suspect,
even the field officer director,

366
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,907
so I have to act,
and with any luck,
I'll find the traitor.

367
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,677
Have you talked to my dad
about this?

368
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,714
Why? There's no point.
This is an internal matter.

369
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,184
‐The master has no say.
‐He does, too, damn it!

370
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,921
Sorry. I'll help.

371
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,224
But I want you to bring my dad,
even if you have to drag him.

372
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,926
As you wish.

373
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:05,839
I decided to go
to True Cross Academy in Tokyo.

374
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:09,209
I want to go
to their cram school
and become an Exorcist.

375
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:14,548
If I'm gonna lead our followers,
I have to know all the different
kinds of exorcisms.

376
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,850
‐You can't.
‐Why can't I?

377
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,652
Look, I've told you
a million times,

378
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,453
you're free to do
what you want in life.

379
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,689
You're smart
and you don't have a Temptaint.

380
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:24,625
You don't have to live
a life like this.

381
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,727
You can run your mom's inn
if you want instead.

382
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,095
But this is
what I want to do, Dad!

383
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,431
I don't wanna run
some stupid inn!

384
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,301
[groans] We're definitely done
talking about this.

385
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,371
Not even!
Why are you always running away?

386
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,374
You're never home,
you blew off the Knights,
and you deserted Myoda!

387
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:42,976
Running away
is all you ever do!

388
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,712
You know what everyone says
about you, Dad?

389
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:49,415
They call you a coward,
a drunk priest, a bum!

390
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,151
Doesn't that piss you off?

391
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:54,254
It damn well pisses me off!

392
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,989
I won't...

393
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,225
...run away.

394
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,795
[snoring]

395

‐[pop‐top opens]
‐[Shura sighs]

396
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,909
Hmm?

397
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,210
The hell?

398
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,046
This ain't booze, it's juice.

399
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,716
‐[Renzo panting]
‐[Rin snoring]

400
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,786
Why does my life
have to suck so hard?

401
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,454
[Renzo straining]

402
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:32,959
Mmm. [chuckles]

403
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:37,130
I got a couple
of Rembrandts here, huh?

404
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,732
[chuckles]

405
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:52,312
[snake] Target is close.
Very closssse.

406
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:03,790
[Yukio] I'm breaking it.

407
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,529
[miasma spluttering]

408
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,535
They're dead!

409
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,872
[Todo chuckles]

410
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,374
[Todo] Everything is set to go
on my end.

411
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,345
I hope things are ready
on yours.

412
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,048
If you don't act
before they find you,

413
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,116
you won't get another chance.

414
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,785
There's not much point to this

415
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:35,355
unless we get both the right
and left eyes.

416
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,658
[chuckling]

417
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:49,102
[Rin Akatsuki singing
"Kono Te De" in Japanese]

418
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,827
[Rin] Okay, now I'm pissed!

419
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,030
[Shiemi] I'll never be any help
to anyone at this rate.

420
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:28,034
[Konekomaru] I don't...
I don't... have anything.

421
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,671
[Juzo] Master, do you know
why it's doing that?

422
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,372
[Yaozo] I've asked you all
to this meeting today

423
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:34,708
for one reason.

424
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:38,044
To find out which one of us
is the traitor!
