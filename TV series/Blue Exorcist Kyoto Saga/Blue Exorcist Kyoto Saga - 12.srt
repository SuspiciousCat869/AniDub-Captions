that another matter
kept me from coming sooner.

All things considered,
I can say without a doubt

85

that not even
thePaladin's Angelic Legion

would you please testify?

your side of the story

Oh, I don't think I should.

107
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,679
I might pass out
and wake up without my head.

108

to get you drunk

[Mephisto] Splendid view.

113
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:13,512
And the students. You handpicked
every one of them.

Even me.

And what's up with Takara?

116
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:20,779
You gotta have a good reason
for letting someone like him in.

to use Rin for?

to your expectations?

How shocking.

120
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:34,212
I thought you never
allowed yourself to get
attached to anyone.

121

Why are you so concerned about
what happens to Rin Okumura?

you hired me for.

158
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,345
‐What in the hell?
‐Don't kill me!

159
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:27,879
‐What do you think you're doing?
‐Uh... sweeping up?

160
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,512
‐No, I mean your clothes!
‐Oh!

161
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:33,345
There's nothing for me to do
at the temple anymore.

162
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:35,579
I didn't want to get bored
sitting around,

163
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:38,612
so I figured I'd help
Torako out around the inn.

164
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,079
[gasps] What are you saying?

165
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:44,212
[Torako] I know how this looks,
son, but believe me‐‐

166
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,145
Mr. Tatsuma, Bon, hurry!
You need to see this!

167
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:49,779
[both] Huh?

168
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,845
Surprise, everyone.

169
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:00,445
I'm marrying Mamushi.

170
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,612
I've been thinking
about settling down,

171
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,912
and now's as good a time as any.

172
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,712
I never agreed to this.

173
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,945
How dare you presume
I'd marry you!

174
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:13,445
It's easy. After what happened
between us yesterday.

175
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:17,245
No, enough, stop talking!
Absolutely nothing happened!

176
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:20,912
I'll kill you for this,
you, you...

177
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:24,479
You perverted monkey!
You defiled our sister!

178
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,145
Say it ain't so, Juzo!

179
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,412
You can't marry
a bony‐assed snake chick!

180
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:32,745
I always pictured you with
some hot blonde with a huge rack
and a slammin' booty!

181
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,979
You disgusting,
horny misogynist!

182
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,045
‐No one bad‐mouths our sister!
‐Who are you calling disgusting?

183
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,712
‐What did we walk into here?
‐[Tatsuma chuckles]

184
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:42,912
[Uwabami] Silence!

185
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:48,079
Um, Juzo?

186
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:53,045
I get the impression you and
Mamushi aren't on the same page.

187
00:12:53,112 --> 00:12:56,045
So perhaps the two of you should
talk it over some more?

188
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,012
This is an important decision.

189
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,812
I know, Dad. It's just, I don't
think talking's going to help.

190
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,312
Of course not. She'd never marry
a loser like you.

191
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,912
[girls giggle]

192
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,479
Mamushi, I'm serious about this.

193
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,012
Will you marry me?

194
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,612
But... I can't get married.
I'm a traitor.

195
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,979
I'm still waiting
for my punishment.

196
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:20,079
So, that's all
that's holding you back?

197
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,645
What if we say marrying me
is your punishment?

198
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:25,379
Would that be
grueling enough for you?

199
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:28,712
Only a fool like you
would suggest such a thing!

200
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,245
Anyway... I think
I could live with that.

201
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,445
[both] Mamushi!

202
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:38,679
[sobbing]

203
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:40,812
‐Look, Juzo...
‐[Juzo] Sir?

204
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,812
You do realize she'll be
stripped of her meister

205
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,179
and expelled from the Order
for what she's done.

206
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,145
And her right eye
will never fully recover.

207
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:53,312
Knowing that, you'd still
have her as your wife?

208
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,112
Yes.

209
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:59,412
Please, sir, if you would...

210
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,312
may we have your blessing?

211
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,945
Yes, of course.
Take care of my little girl!

212
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,845
‐That was fast.
‐Thank you very much, sir!

213
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:14,012
‐Don't I get to have a say
in this at all?
‐[Uwabami sobbing]

214
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,245
‐[Mamushi and Uwabami sobbing]
‐Boy, what a happy day.

215
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:20,779
Juzo's got some guts,
I'll give him that.

216
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,379
See that, son?

217
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,312
You can protect folks
all you want,

218
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,779
but in the end, they can
take care of themselves.

219
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,379
‐[Suguro] Uh...
‐Best to let 'em.

220
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,545
If what you say's true,
then why did you protect us?

221
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,812
Was there any point?

222
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,145
You were important to me,
that's why.

223
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:48,245
Then you're done chanting
the sutras?

224
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:54,212
[Tatsuma] You don't need me
to sing you lullabies
anymore, son.

225
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:02,012
Holy moly, Juzo's gonna
marry Mamushi?

226
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,079
But she's like my sister!
That's just gross.

227
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,512
What's up?

228
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,212
Oh, hey. Sorry to interrupt,
but I've been looking for you.

229
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,179
It's on.

230
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,545
[Rin] Oh, yeah!

231
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,212
If we're gonna get all touristy,

232
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,612
might as well start
with the Golden Pavilion.

233
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,345
Honestly, Shima,
what are you thinking?

234
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:22,845
We should start with Toji Temple
'cause it's closer.

235
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:27,079
If we don't plan
our route carefully, we won't
squeeze everything in.

236
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:29,645
‐You're right.
‐If there's anything
you want to see,

237
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,412
tell me and I'll
put it on thelist.

238
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:34,379
Oh, I'd like to try
some of the local sweets,

239
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,245
like anmitsu and kuzukiri!

240
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:39,812
Fushimi Inari shrine.
I always wanted to check it out.

241
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,679
I wanna meet cool girls!

242
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:43,245
[Rin] Oh, oh, over here!
Over here!

243
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:47,112
‐Let's go see Kyoto Tower!
‐Oh, boy.

244
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,212
Why do you want to visit
the tower?

245
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,612
Kyoto has more interesting
places than that.

246
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,379
Agreed.

247
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,779
Come on! I wanted to see it
since before we got here!

248
00:15:56,845 --> 00:16:01,545
If Satan's kid wants
to check out the tower,
we better go.

249
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:02,812
Don't wanna get burnt.

250
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,112
Wait, you still think
I'm like that?!

251
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,312
[Konekomaru] You have a point.

252
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,612
Your wish is our command,
O Son of Satan.

253
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,712
Aw, not you, too.

254
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:56,612
I want this one!
But I can't afford it.

255
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,012
This'll do!

256
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:01,745
‐Wait.
‐[group] Huh?

257
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,712
[Rin] Um... guys.

258
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,845
Since you're all here,

259
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,879
‐I wanna ask something.
‐[Suguro] What?

260
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:13,979
[Rin] Even though some of you
might not be cool
with what I am,

261
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:17,245
can we take a group shot
with us in Tawawa?

262
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:20,345
Crap. We better do
what the Son of Satan says

263
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:22,445
or else he'll burn us
to a crisp.

264
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:25,745
If that's what the Son of Satan
wants, we don't have a choice.

265
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,379
I don't know if it's just me
or what, but that kind of
sounded like a threat.

266
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,312
Your wish is our command,
O Son of Satan.

267
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:35,145
Jeez, would you guys
quit razzing me?! That's mean!

268
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,112
Dude, you're the one
with satanic powers.

269
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,312
If I was that punk‐rock,
I'd be rockin' 'em hard.

270
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:42,812
You don't have to ask.

271
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,912
We'd all be glad to get
a picture with you.

272
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:51,745
Is everyone ready?

273
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,245
[Suguro] Here we go.
Get in your spots!

274
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,712
‐[Konekomaru] Right.
‐[Izumo] OK.

275
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,079
Let's see those smiles.

276
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,579
Hold it.

277
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,445
[Rin chuckles]

278
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:07,079
[others snickering]

279
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:11,345
What the...
Does that say "Satan"?

280
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:18,779
[footsteps]

281
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,879
What up, Yukio?
Took you long enough.

282
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:26,279
Why did you wanna meet here?

283
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:29,879
What do you mean?

284
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:32,879
It's as good a place
as any, ain't it?

285
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:40,245
Yukio, I know I'm Satan's kid,

286
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:43,579
but I'm still gonna be
an Exorcist one day.

287
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,079
[Yukio sighs]

288
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:46,845
‐[Yukio] I don't approve.
‐[Rin] Why?

289
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,779
What do you mean why?

290
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:50,345
Can't you see how much trouble

291
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:53,245
those powers of yours caused
over the years?

292
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:56,712
You did good here,
but don't fool yourself,
you're still a threat.

293
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:59,512
What was I even thinking?

294
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,512
When I found out they wanted
to try and train you,
I should have shut it down.

295
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,079
Every time you use those flames,
you become more powerful.

296
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,079
How do you think that's gonna
turn out in the end?

297
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:12,279
Until I know for sure
your power isn't a threat

298
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:15,612
to the safety of everyone,
I don't approve.

299
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,079
I promised our father
I'd protect you at all costs.

300
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:29,312
[chuckles] OK, fine.
Be that way.

301
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:32,279
I won't try to change
your mind or anything.

302
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,645
It doesn't matter
who's right or wrong.

303
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,479
We're a little of both, I guess.

304
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:39,679
The important thing is that
we got each other's backs.

305
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:44,045
[Yukio thinking] <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>Hell...</i>

306
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:48,245
Heck, that's what being
a brother's all about, ain't it?

307
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,179
[Yukio thinking]
<i>How can he be so confident?</i>

308
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,079
<i>Why can't I be?</i>

309
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,012
Hey, Yukio?

310
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:08,012
Back in the day, you and Dad
fought a lot of demons together.

311
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,112
I feel kind of jealous.

312
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,312
Like I wish I could have
fought by his side.

313
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,145
I wish he could have
taught me how.

314
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:21,745
Hey, maybe you could
tell me some stories sometime.

315
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:25,145
Yeah, sure.

316
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:29,412
If you become an Exorcist,
I will.

317
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:33,445
[Rin] When are you gonna stop
being such a dick to me?!

318
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:37,212
You and me are so different,
it's like oil
and freakin' water.

319
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,345
That's true.

320
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:42,279
[Rin] It'll be so cool
when I get to be an Exorcist.

321
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:44,379
Picture you and me,
side by side,

322
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:47,679
kicking all the demon ass,
we'd make a good team.

323
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,812
I guess. Maybe.

324
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,645
We would.

325
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,645
[Yukio] OK. If you become
an Exorcist.

326
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,879
Why do you gotta
keep saying that?

327
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:01,279
You jerk,
always acting superior!

328
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,879
One of these days,
I'm so gonna leave you behind!

329
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:07,945
Leave me behind?

330
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:10,612
Seriously,
you should work on your jokes.

331
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,445
They're as lame as you are.

332
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,212
Wait...

333
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,512
I don't know why,

334
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:18,412
but it feels like we've been
down this road before.

335
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,979
Eh, screw it.

336
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,345
The important thing is
we got to have this talk.

337
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:25,212
But if anything's still
bugging you, let it rip.

338
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,945
That's what having a big brother
like me is for.

339
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,712
[whirring noise]

340
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:40,545
[Yukio] I'm good.

341
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,379
You sure?

342
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:43,779
[Kuro mews]

343
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,179
Hey, Kuro,
where have you been hiding?

344
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:52,379
[Kuro mewing]

345
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,179
[Yukio thinking] <i>The truth is,</i>
<i>I hate myself.</i>

346
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:02,612
<i>That's why I always</i>
<i>looked up to you and Dad.</i>

347
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,112
<i>Always.</i>

348
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:08,545
You think you're so rad!
One day I'll leave you behind!

349
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:10,179
[Yukio thinking] <i>Damn it, Rin.</i>

350
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,845
<i>You took the words</i>
<i>right out of my mouth!</i>

351
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,479
[Rin] Hey, Yukio!

352
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,445
You coming or what?

353
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,412
[others chuckling]

354
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:29,879
[Yukio] Mm‐hmm.

355
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:32,812
[Yukio thinking]
<i>This is who</i> I <i>am.</i>

356
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:49,145
