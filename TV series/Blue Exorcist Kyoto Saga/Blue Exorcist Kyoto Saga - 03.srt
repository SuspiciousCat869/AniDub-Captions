[yawns]

2
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,788
The whole night's a blank
after I left you guys.

3
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,191
It's like I got drunk
and passed out or something,
but how?

4
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,730
Oh, son of a....
She gave us her drinks
by mistake.

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,832
Some teacher she is.

6
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,067
How are you feeling now?

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,736
[Suguro] Eh, I'm OK.

8
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,172
You get a chance to pay
your respects to your folks yet?

9
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,342
Uh, yeah, last night.

10
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,845
I'm glad you got the chance to.

11
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,247
Well... see you at the meeting.

12
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,282
OK. Be there in a bit.

13
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,617
Cool.

14
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,153
[snoring]

15
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,497
[Renzo] Good morning, Okumura.

16
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,634
Dude, you got
some hellacious bedhead.

17
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,136
Did you find your way
back to your room OK?

18
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,872
[Rin] I don't remember.

19
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,173
[Renzo laughs]

20
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,275
[Renzo] Yeah, I bet you don't.

21
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,778
Good thing I didn't drink
my juice.

22
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,882
[Rin, mouth full] Are you
OK with talking to me
in public like this?

23
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,050
Huh? Of course.

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,553
[laughs]

25
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,821
[Kinzo] Ren...

26
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,089
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,991
[Kinzo] ...zo!

28
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,094
[Renzo groans]

29
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,830
Damn it, Kin,
what the hell was that?

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,331
Huh? Whaddya mean?

31
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,535
That was a flying kick.
Man, you're dense.

32
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,237
You're calling me dense?!
You jerk!

33
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,173
Renzo, looks like
you're doing all right.

34
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,775
[Renzo] 'Cept for my head.

35
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,412
Anyway, Juzo, this right here
is my bud, Okumura.

36
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,816
Oh, nice to finally meet ya.
I'm Juzo.

37
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,253
‐I'm Renzo's big brother.
‐Oh, hey.

38
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,455
‐Huh?
‐[Kinzo, munching] Oh, so good.

39
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,357
Hey, Koneko.

40
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,160
You wanna come eat with us?

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,831
Oh, thanks.
But I already finished.

42
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,198
[Juzo] Huh?

43
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,501
[Kinzo munching]

44
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,771
What's his deal?

45
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,542
‐[Konekomaru] Shima!
‐Hmm?

46
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,511
Um...

47
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,747
How can you still be friendly
with Okumura?

48
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:27,914
Huh?

49
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,317
Juzo and Kinzo don't know
what he is or what he can do!

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,219
Wh‐what are you gonna do
if they...

51
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,121
if they find out
he's the son of Satan

52
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,057
and you're palling around
with him?

53
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,324
[Renzo] Eh, so what?

54
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,728
It's cool.
Whatever happens happens.

55
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,731
What's wrong with you?
You can't take anything
seriously!

56
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,334
[groans] Don't you think you're
taking this too seriously?

57
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,936
‐[Konekomaru gasps]
‐[Renzo chuckles]

58
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,740
It's way more harder to go
out of my way to avoid him.

59
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,276
And trust me,
I thought about it a lot.

60
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,781
But in the end, it's just
too much of a hassle
to bust my brain on.

61
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,250
It's like, whatever he is,
he's still a good guy.

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,187
And deep down,
I know you know he is.

63
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:13,694
Oh, right. Don't you gotta be
at that Myoda meeting in a bit?

64
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:18,498
Must be a drag,
being head of your family
and always going to meetings.

65
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,702
Times like this,
I'm glad I'm the youngest son.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,907
[yawns]Hmm?

67
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:32,813
Dang, look at her.
Up early and working hard.

68
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,249
Right!

69
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,485
‐[Rin] Oh, hey, Ms. Suguro.
‐Yes.

70
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,622
[Rin] Do you got
any candles around here?

71
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:45,358
‐[Torako] Sure. Why?
‐It's for a project,
and I need a bunch of them.

72
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,860
[Torako] Huh?

73
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,096
[Suguro groans]

74
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,799
Where the hell's Dad at?

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,434
[Juzo] Hey, Bon!

76
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,070
The meeting's gonna
start in a bit.
You coming?

77
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,707
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Gimme a sec.

78
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,711
[Suguro thinking] <i>Bald bozo!</i>
<i>What's his friggin' problem?!</i>

79
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,714
<i>He should be here!</i>

80
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,987
[Uverworld singing
"Itteki No Eikyou" in Japanese]

81
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,184
Did anyone tell the Master
about the meeting?

82
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,686
[frustrated groan]

83
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,390
Everyone... [coughs]

84
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,696
I'd like to begin
by thanking you all
for coming on such short notice.

85
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,065
[coughs]

86
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,768
This is a matter
of grave concern to our sect.

87
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:12,072
Unfortunately,
the Master said he's tied up
with something important

88
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,874
so he won't be joining us today.

89
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,142
‐[gasp]
‐Hmm.

90
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,746
[coughs]

91
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,550
If we had the time to wait
for him, believe me, we would.

92
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,687
But this requires
our immediate attention.

93
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,422
I've asked the heads
of all the families here,

94
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,892
along with those who were
in charge of security

95
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,995
of the Right Eye the day
the Keep was broken into.

96
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,732
So, Juzo, why don't we begin
with you telling us

97
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,001
everything you remember
about the incident?

98
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,368
[Juzo] Uh, yes, sir.

99
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,673
That day, I noticed
the sacred flame
at the head of the monk's seat

100
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,309
was acting kind of peculiar.

101
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,111
<i>So I sent for the Master.</i>

102
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,517
[Juzo] I'm sorry to make you
come all the way over here
for this.

103
00:06:56,517 --> 00:07:00,386
Oh, please.
I'm happy to help
whenever I can.

104
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,890
[women chanting in distance]

105
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,032
Let's see, now.

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,741
Master Tatsuma.

107
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,709
‐[Tatsuma] Hmm?
‐[Mamushi] Is it true

108
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,478
you're not going to join
the Knights
of the True Cross?

109
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,915
Mamushi, now's not
the time for this.

110
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,619
It's true. I don't have
the time for it, actually.

111
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,357
I'm busy with something
much more important.

112
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,826
According to Myoda legend,

113
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:44,064
when the Impure King was
defeated by our founder,
Fukaku,

114
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,067
all that remained of it
was its right eye,

115
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,736
glaring up at him.

116
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:53,173
Fukaku established
the Myo‐O Dharani sect

117
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:57,077
to make sure future generations
kept the eye sealed away.

118
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,046
Master, guarding the Right Eye
is the sacred duty

119
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,215
of all who are born
into the Myoda sect.

120
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,619
So what could you possibly
be doing that is more important
than that?!

121
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,154
Knock it off!
Show some respect.

122
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,758
[Tatsuma] I'm sorry you feel
that way,

123
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,660
but you know
if you ever need me,

124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,729
all you have to do
is send for me.

125
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,197
[Mamushi shuddering]

126
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,999
‐[fire crackles]
‐[Tatsuma] Huh?

[fire whooshes]

128
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,737
Master, do you know why
it's doing that?

129
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,274
‐Get everyone out!
‐Yes, Master!

130
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,515
[Tatsuma chanting]

131
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,121
I'm going to stay
and protect the eye!

132
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,223
[Tatsuma finishes chant]

133
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,330
[Yaozo] What's going on here?

134
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,233
[Juzo] Come back, Mamushi!

135
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,168
[snarls]

136
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,607
Run! Clear the area!

137
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,146
[Tatsuma chanting]

138
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,422
[Yaozo] Oh, no!

139
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,192
The seal on the Right Eye
is melting!

140
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,328
[Tatsuma chanting fiercely]

141

‐[Tatsuma yells]
‐[Juzo] Dad!

142
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,476
That day, there were only
a few people near the eye:

143
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,712
my three daughters,
along with Juzo,

144
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,381
his father, Yaozo,
who ran in to help,

145
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:45,018
and lastly, Master Tatsuma,

146
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,621
who couldn't be here,
unfortunately.

147
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,723
Six people.

148
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,760
I've asked you all to this
meeting today for one reason:

149
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,231
to find out which one of us
is the traitor!

150
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,700
[scattered gasps]

151
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,840
We already know who helped
steal the Left Eye
from the Tokyo branch.

152
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,511
Senior Exorcist Second Class
Saburota Todo,

153
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,345
the Deep Keep's warden.

154
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,680
With that said,

155
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,784
you, Juzo, and you,
both had him as an instructor

156
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,654
at that cram school
for exorcists.

157
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,556
[Juzo] What's that
supposed to mean?

158
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,592
Father, do you think I'm
a suspect?

159
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,695
I'm saying, you and Juzo
are the only ones here

160
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,463
with direct ties to the man.

161
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,732
You're joking.

162
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:35,301
All I did was take his class.

163
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,637
You, on the other hand,

164
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,306
you were on much better terms
with him than I was,
weren't you?

165
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,443
What?! It wasn't like we were
friends or anything.

166
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,911
I liked his class is all.

167
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,514
Why are you so upset?
I'm just stating a fact.

168
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,115
Then here's a fact for you.

169
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,118
During the attack,
you were the one trying
to get to the eye.

170
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,420
Only because I thought
it was in danger.

171
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,525
Or because you knew
it was in danger,
so how'd you know that?

172
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,094
Wha...? What are you getting at?

173
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,830
Your behavior was suspicious,
that's what.

174
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,433
Father, please,
don't believe what he says.

175
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,270
Obviously he's trying to shift
suspicion onto me.

176
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,208
Mamushi! We're still trying
to figure this out,
so calm yourself.

177
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:22,182
On that day, the sacred flame
flared up suddenly.

178
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,417
It seemed alive.

179
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,555
From where I stood,
it looked as if the Master
was controlling it.

180
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,156
[scattered gasps]

181
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,861
Also, he was chanting
a mantra I'm sure
I've never heard before.

182
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,030
She's right,
he totally was.

183
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,932
[Nishiki] It was like he was
urging the flames on.

184
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:43,904
What concerns me is why
the existence of the Left Eye
was kept secret from us.

185
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,107
I can't believe Master Tatsuma
didn't know.

186
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,010
‐He had to.
‐Surely, he's not behind this.

187
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,112
‐That's insane.
‐[Konekomaru] Stop talking
like that!

188
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,848
How can you say those things
about the Master?!

189
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,650
I understand how you feel.

190
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,754
After all, he did
take you under his wing
when you were orphaned.

191
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,857
The fact is, if he wasn't
involved, he'd be here,

192
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,659
trying to figure out who was.

193
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:09,429
That's right. His absence today
is proof enough.

194
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,366
‐That doesn't prove a thing!
‐[priest] Then who else
could it be?

195
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,569
Enough! [coughs]

196
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,003
We're getting nowhere.

197
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,205
I'll discuss the matter
with Uwabami

198
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,276
and we'll set up a time
when the Master is available
to address the issue.

199
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,545
[coughs]

200
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,881
For now, this meeting
is adjourned.

201
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,390
Bon... are you all right?

202
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,996
Ah, they're crazy to think
the Master had anything
to do with this.

203
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:46,667
‐He can't possibly be involved.
‐[Suguro] You sure?

204
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,670
Everyone's right
to suspect my old man.

205
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,205
And deep down,
I bet you do, too.

206
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,541
[Konekomaru] What? No.
I would never‐‐

207
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,943
Don't deny it!

208
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,813
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,282
I need to be alone
for a little bit.

210
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,085
Bon...

211
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,354
Miss Moriyama, could you please
take that pot of herbal tea

212
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,790
over to Miss Kamiki?

213
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,191
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,394
[Shiemi] <i>She's so amazing.</i>

215
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:18,331
Excuse me, Miss Kamiki?
I brought you some...

216
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,534
[Shiemi shrieks]

217
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,969
I'm sorry!
It was an accident!

218
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,371
You didn't get wet, did you?

219
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,175
We've got things
pretty much covered here

220
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,946
so why don't you go out
to the garden and pick
some more valerian?

221
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,916
Oh, sure. I'm sorry.

222
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,889
[thinking] <i>I'm useless.</i>

223
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,991
<i>Worse than useless.</i>

224
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:54,000
<i>I'll never be any help</i>
<i>to anyone at this rate.</i>

225
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:00,340
<i>Nee! Come out.</i>

226
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,009
<i>I knew it.</i>

227
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,613
Hey, Nee, I need
some bug repellant roux.

228
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,649
‐[Nee] Nee!
‐[Shiemi gasps]

229
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,052
Nee, Nee, Nee, Nee, Nee!

230
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,523
<i>I haven't been able</i>
<i>to summon him since then.</i>

231
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,025
<i>I'm such a weakling.</i>

232
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,763
<i>I was all cooped up</i>
<i>in my own little world.</i>

233
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,431
<i>And then...</i>

234
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,835
Snap out of it!
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

235
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,637
[Shiemi] <i>Rin!</i>

236
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,374
<i>He dragged me out</i>
<i>into the real world.</i>

237
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,247
<i>He was just trying to save me</i>
<i>back in the forest.</i>

238
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,117
‐[thunder rumbles]
<i>‐I know that!</i>

239
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,853
‐But still, I....
‐[Izumo] Move it.

240
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,289
[Shiemi gasps]

241
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,424
Sorry to interrupt
your daydreaming,

242
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,061
but you were taking so long,
they sent me out here
to help pick some herbs.

243
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,963
So move, already.

244
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,464
[Shiemi] I'm sorry.

245
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,404
I can tell something's
been bugging you.

246
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,172
So are you just gonna
stand there

247
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,374
or do you want
to talk about it?

248
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,912
I just...

249
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,216
I just wanna be helpful
to everyone.

250
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,385
But all I do is mess things up.

251
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,621
At this rate...

252
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,390
if I can't do better...

253
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,761
I'll never be able
to help my friends

254
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,131
when they get in trouble.
[sobbing]

255
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:35,401
But... why should anyone
trust a failure like me?

256
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:41,074
That's why... that's why
Rin and Yuki didn't.

257
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,477
That's why they kept their past
a secret from me!

258
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,680
[wailing]

259
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,015
[flames roaring]

260
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:56,623
[Rin] Dammit!

261
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,926
[Shura] Hey, dumb ass,
burn the candles, not the roof.

262
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,195
[Rin] I know, Boobenstein!

263
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,531
What the heck's he doing
up there?

264
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,868
[sniffles]

265
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:10,070
This sucks.

266
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,272
Why am I so weak?

267
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:18,178
You amaze me, you know that?
Like seriously.

268
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:22,616
You're plenty strong,
or like... tenacious.

269
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,450
You think so?

270
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,654
Yeah. You bounce back
like nobody's business.

271
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,122
Kind of like a weed.

272
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,557
[Shiemi] A weed?

273
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:34,027
Whoa, I hope you're not thinking
about doing some more crying.

274
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,598
No, I like how you compared me
to a weed.

275
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:38,865
Huh?

276
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,668
Thank you, Miss Kamiki.

277
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,471
I promise I'll try to be
as tough as a weed from now on.

278
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,375
[Izumo thinking]
<i>J‐Jeez! Doesn't anything</i>
<i>faze this girl?</i>

279
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,212
<i>She's even more resilient</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

280
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:58,051
What's the matter?
Are you OK, Miss Kamiki?

281
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,787
[Izumo, uncertainly]
Yeah, I'm fine.

282
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:13,466
Well, kiddo, if you don't
figure this out soon,

283
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,669
every store in Kyoto's
gonna run out of candles.

284
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,674
Oh, I already thought of that.
Suguro's mom's gonna hook me up.
All I gotta do is ask.

285
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:23,810
Oh, you thought of everything.

286
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,880
You dumb ass, quit slacking
and take this seriously!

287
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,250
I am! Jeez!

288
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,987
[groans] We're definitely gonna
be up here for a while.

289
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,189
I'm gonna get some more beer.

290
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,526
[snarls]

291
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,704
[roars]

292
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,340
[Rin] Crap, this blows!

293
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,342
[Shura] The problem is
you keep going boom.

294
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,444
Like I've been telling you,

295
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,914
picture a poof of flame
lighting a candle.

296
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,584
[Rin] Whatever.
I'm gonna go cool off.

297
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,920
Uck! "Poof," she says.

298
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,421
Poof.

299
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,690
Poof?

300
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,058
Poof. Poof! Poof!

301
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,460
Poofity poof poof!

302
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,662
Poof?

303
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,634
I don't know if he's making
progress or just lucky as hell.

304
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,573
[gargling]

305
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,614
Man, that hit the spot!

306
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,016
[Konekomaru] Father.
Mother. Ancestors.

307
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,417
[Rin] Huh?

308
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,723
I'm weak and helpless.

309
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,225
And I need your guidance.

310
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,293
<i>Tell me what to do.</i>

311
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,129
[Rin] Konekomaru?

312
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,700
Hey, wait!

313
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,468
OK, now I'm pissed!

314
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,739
Why are you running away?

315
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,508
All I'm trying to do
is make things right with you!

316
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,344
That doesn't matter.

317
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,547
I just want you
to stay away from Bon!

318
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:10,316
'Cause... 'cause right now he's
going through a rough time.

319
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,053
Can you forget about Bon
for a sec?

320
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:16,456
Jesus! I'm here 'cause
I wanna talk to you!

321
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,059
I don't...

322
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:23,229
I don't have anything.

323
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:27,601
I don't have any family...

324
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,605
<i>or any talent,</i>
<i>like Bon and Shima.</i>

325
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,441
[Suguro] Sixteen years ago
on the Blue Night,

326
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,845
my temple's followers
were killed by blue flames
like yours.

327
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,815
That's right,
your blue flames kill people!

328
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,116
People like my grandpa

329
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,986
and Shima's grandpa
and oldest brother.

330
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,954
And Konekomaru's family!

331
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,958
[Konekomaru] I was all alone.

332
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,562
But the people in Myoda
took me in and raised me.

333
00:19:55,562 --> 00:20:01,134
And someday, I'll pay them back
for their kindness.

334
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,671
When I grow up,
I wanna be useful to Myoda.

335
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,942
They're the only thing
I have to go back to.

336
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,677
They're my home.

337
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,881
Anyone who poses
a threat to them...

338
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,884
I don't care who they are,
they're my enemy!

339
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,288
OK. I get it.

340
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,324
[Konekomaru] Uh...

341
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:29,630
So, all I have to do is show you
I'm not a threat.
Then you and me are cool, right?

342
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,867
I think I get
why you're scared of me.

343
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,870
Even though I practice
every day like crazy,

344
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,673
I still haven't got control
over my flames yet.

345
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:42,876
Heck, if I were you,
I'd be nervous, too.

346
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:45,311
It all makes sense now!

347
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,749
Right! I'm gonna go train
some more.

348
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,420
Oh, by the way...

349
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,857
before, you said
you had nothing.

350
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,859
But that's not really true.

351
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,996
You got your friends.
That's something, ain't it?

352
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:06,833
It's like, whatever he is,
he's still a good guy.

353
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,603
And deep down,
I know you know he is.

354
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,908
[whimpering]

355
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,843
Okumura.

356
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,718
[sighs]

357
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,486
[gasps]

358
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,489
God, would you get a grip
on those flames, already?

359
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,092
You know, you can't stay up here
messing around forever.

360
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:35,395
‐[Rin groans]
‐[Rin] And nagging
ain't helping.

361
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,601
[Shiemi] He's training?

362
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,135
Training.

363
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,204
[gasps]

364
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:47,440
<i>That's it! So will I.</i>

365
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,846
<i>I'll train</i>
<i>and I'll catch up with you.</i>

366
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,715
<i>So wait for me.</i>

367
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,751
How can those fools
suspect our sister?!

368
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,387
If anyone's a traitor
around here, it's that Juzo!

369
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,526
[Mamushi] Do you believe
I'm telling the truth?

370
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:08,729
[both] Are you kidding?
Of course we do!

371
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:21,942
[Suguro thinking] <i>Dammit.</i>
<i>What are you up to, Dad?</i>

372
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:24,344
[Tatsuma] All rightie.

373
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,713
[fire crackling]

374
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,082
It's time I got back to work.

375
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,857
[snarls]

376
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,826
This time I'll get it!

377
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:49,936
[Rin Akatsuki singing
"Kono Te De" in Japanese]

378
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,895
[Suguro] What the hell
are you up to, Juzo?

379
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,897
We can't trust our superiors
anymore!

380
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,767
‐[Juzo] Bon!
‐[Suguro] You better
start talking, Dad!

381
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:29,936
[Tatsuma] I can't tell anyone
what it is, ever.

382
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,872
Not even my own son.

383
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:35,175
‐You cool leaving it like this?
Well, are ya?!
‐[Shura] Rin!

384
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:39,179
[Rin] He's your dad, man.
You can't push him away
like this!
