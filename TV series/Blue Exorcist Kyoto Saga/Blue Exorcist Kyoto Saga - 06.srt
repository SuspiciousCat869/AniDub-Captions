00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,777
My God, I had no idea
our fathers knew each other.

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,246
That's how Dad got his hands
on the Koma Sword?

[Shura] Don't stop now,
keep reading!

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,750
Right.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,085
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling about this.

6
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,222
[Rin] We still don't know what
kind of favor he wants from me.

00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,157
‐[Rin] Do we?
‐[Yukio] Not yet.

8
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,192
[Rin] Then what
are you waiting for?

[Todo] There's the old
main temple of the Myoda.

13
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,077
[Mamushi] Goma Hall
is just beyond that.

14
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,846
‐We're almost there.
‐Good.

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,449
Although, are you sure
that I will be safe in it?

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,618
[Todo] The temples of Fudobuji

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,120
were built around Goma Hall
to protect it.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,423
I assume it's because
the hall was where the Eye
was originally kept.

19
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:01,061
Returning it there
would be the wisest choice.

[young Tatsuma] Oh, dear.

This is where you've been,
eh, Mamushi?

30
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,935
Your daddy's been worried sick
about you.

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,404

Would this be Goma Hall?

34
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:53,547
[Mamushi] Yes.
It was once a sacred place

35
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,449
where only the head priest
was allowed inside.

Without a master

it's just an empty shell.

The sacred flame is lit!

00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,866
[Todo] Hmm.

42
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,169
I bet there's
a hidden door somewhere.

43

‐OK.

Boy, was I ever wrong about you.

155
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,313
So... I'm glad you're happy
and all,

156
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,749
but that don't change nothing.

157
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,250
I want the sword.

158
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,119
It's only fair.
I did save all those lives.

159
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,421
I even showed you
how to cure 'em.

160
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,892
Don't you think I'm entitled
to it after all I've done?

161
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,360
[Torako] Tatsuma?

162
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,829
Uh, why don't you get some rest?

163
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,933
I thought you were
a good person.

164
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,837
Yep, you're a sucker, big‐time.
And brother, I hate suckers.

165
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,439
I don't care what you think
about me.

166
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,076
And I can find that thing
without your help.

167
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,646
If you're scared to get
your hands dirty,

168
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,481
you won't get nowhere.

169
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,883
[feet running]

170
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,521
‐[Tatsuma] Father!
‐That's the man!

171
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,155
Restrain him!

172
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,425
[priests chanting]

173
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,127
[snakes hiss]

174
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,996
No, wait!

175
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,497
[Tatsuma's father]
After him! Hurry!

176
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,366
Catch the intruder.
Don't let him leave here alive!

177
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,736
Father, you got it all wrong.
He's not‐‐

178
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:06,072
[father] Silence.
Don't even think you'll go
unpunished after this.

179
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,543
That man is an exorcist from
the Knights of the True Cross.

180
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,311
You let a heretic
into our temple!

181
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,146
You let him work
his foul magic on‐‐

182
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,049
No, listen!
He just healed our followers.

183
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,785
All of them. He even saved
Torako and the baby!

184
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,787
I don't give a damn
who that bandit saved.

185
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:25,191
Any outsider who finds out
about the Koma Sword
and our secrets

186
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,327
has to be killed!

187
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,732
I have a responsibility
to protect Myodo.

188
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:37,070
You're not protecting the Myodo,
just its rules.

189
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,705
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,909
I'm not like you.

191
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,080
Tatsuma, get back here!
Tatsuma!

192
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,219
‐[priest 1] I see him!
‐[priest 2] Don't let him
get away!

193
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,589
Don't these bastards
ever give up?

194
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,258
[groans] Tore open my wounds.

195
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,027
[Tatsuma] Fujimoto!

196
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,764
‐[Shiro] Tatsuma.
‐You forgot this.

197
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,934
[Shiro] The Koma Sword!

198
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,971
I know the way out of here.
Hurry, follow me.

199
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,438
[Shiro] Wha... Hang on!

200
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,008
I can take this, you're sure?

201
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,844
‐[Tatsuma] Yes.
I know it's empty.
‐Huh?

202
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,815
[Tatsuma] When I was a kid,
I drew the sword
when no one was looking.

203
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,884
I wanted to see Karura.

204
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,888
But nothing came out:
no Karura, no flames.

205
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,756
It's empty just like you said.

206
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,125
And I've known all these years.

207
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm done praying
over an empty sword.

208
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,963
I feel like I got back
the will to fight.

209
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,733
And it's all thanks to you.

210
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,968
I'm gonna kill a kid with this.

211
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,705
[Shiro]
No, I don't think you will.

212
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,472
You're a good person.

213
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,943
Ha. You really are
a first‐class sucker.

214
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,679
[priest] I found his tracks!
This way!

215
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,016
The way out's down there.
Guess this makes us even.

216
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:01,221
Uh‐uh. This
here makes us friends.

217
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,525
‐[priest 1] Over there!
‐[priest 2] Oh, damn, he jumped!

218
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:08,595
[priest 1] We can still
catch him, come on!

219
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,865
[Tatsuma] <i>Well, that's the story</i>
<i>of me and Fujimoto,</i>

220
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,300
<i>the man who raised you.</i>

221
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,538
<i>A few months later,</i>
<i>the Blue Night happened.</i>

222
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:20,206
<i>My father made me</i>
<i>the high priest</i>

223
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,575
<i>and with his dying breath</i>

224
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,944
<i>told me the secret</i>
<i>of the Myoda.</i>

225
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:28,448
<i>And that secret was truly,</i>
<i>truly horrible.</i>

226
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,287
I knew we'd find it
sooner or later.
Let's hurry.

227
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,426
A door.

228
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,830
I had no idea there was
a hidden chamber under here.

229
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,566
[coughs]

230
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,500
[Todo] Give me the Eye.

231
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,337
But I thought you said
you weren't strong enough
to carry them both.

232
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,408
[Todo] We're almost there.
Besides, I'm more worried
about you.

233
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,579
Whatever good intentions
I may have had before,

234
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,048
I'm starting to regret
I ever involved
my favorite pupil

235
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,917
in something so dangerous.

236
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,153
You've risked so much already.

237
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,924
‐Are you having any regrets?
‐No, sir.

238
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,227
[Mamushi thinking] <i>I'm the only</i>
<i>one who can protect everyone.</i>

239
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,463
[Todo] You're an extraordinary
young lady.

240
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,332
Come on, let's open it.

241
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,403
[fire crackling]

242
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,805
[gasps]

243
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,077
What is that?

244
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,279
[Todo] The Impure King.

245
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,414
[Mamushi] What?

246
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,784
[Todo] In 1858,
your sect's founder, Fukaku,

247
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,385
made a pact with Kurikara,

248
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,388
the demon sword possessed
by the fire demon Karura.

249
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,858
Fukaku couldn't kill
the Impure King,

250
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,326
so he subdued it instead,

251
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,262
by plucking out its eyes
and sealing them.

252
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,098
Then Karura abandoned Kurikara.

253
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,067
Here is the truth of your sect.

254
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:58,138
Here is what the Myoda's
secrets within secrets
have been hiding from the world.

255
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,940
[Mamushi] The Impure King?

256
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,245
That thing?
You mean it's been down here
for the last 150 years?

257
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,548
But if it gets
its eyes back, then...

258
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:11,151
[Todo] Correct. If someone
were to return its eyes

259
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,953
to its shriveled husk
of a body,

260
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:17,558
then the Impure King would be
restored to his former glory.

261
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,626
Mister Todo.

262
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,662
What are you, really?

263
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:25,331
[chuckles] Ms. Hojo, you were
always my favorite student,

264
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,434
and I have to admit it hurts
to be the one to tell you this,

265
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,337
but... I have no further
use for you.

266
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,639
[Mamushi gasps]

267
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,608
[screams]

268
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,209
Well, look who showed up!

269
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,243
Master!

270
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,380
Mamushi, everything
will be fine.

271
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,651
I'll get you back to your daddy
safe and sound, don't worry.

272
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,654
The Impure King has been
a cancer on the world,

273
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,089
but it ends now.

274
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,424
I won't let it infect
another generation.

275
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,995
‐I will protect everyone.
‐Master!

276
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:58,131
As the 17th high priest
of Myodo,

277
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,634
I, Tatsuma Suguro,

278
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,236
won't let anyone stop me!

279
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,445
[young Tatsuma] Father!

280
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,848
[Tatsuma] <i>On the Blue Night,</i>
<i>I learned all the secrets</i>

281
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,784
<i>passed down by the high priests</i>
<i>of Myodo.</i>

282
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,687
Please, you can't die!
Father!

283
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,188
Agggh!

284
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,360
I go by the name Karura.

285
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,063
I serve the high priest
of the Myo‐O Dharani.

286
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,066
Are you a descendant
of Fukaku?

287
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,701
Prove it with your blood.

288
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:39,706
Uh... I'm Tatsuma Suguro...
Fukaku's descendant.

289
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,277
[Karura] Indeed,
you are of his blood.

290
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,982
Henceforth, Tatsuma Suguro,
I shall serve you.

291
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,851
[young Tatsuma thinking]
<i>All this time,</i>

292
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,720
<i>I never knew Karura</i>
<i>was something</i>
<i>the high priests used.</i>

293
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,589
What do you want in return?

294
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,924
What I desire is secrecy

295
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,693
of my existence

296
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,563
and of the reason for which I
have been bound to serve you.

297
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:06,099
You must keep those secrets
from all in your life.

298
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,901
That's all you want?

299
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,670
[Karura] Precisely.

300
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,072
I am born of secrets
that are kept,

301
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,741
and lies and suspicion
are my nourishment.

302
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:20,413
In exchange,
I shall lend you my flames
to seal the Impure King.

303
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,483
‐But it's dead.
‐Not quite.

304
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:28,188
For the past 150 years,
it has slumbered
beneath this temple.

305
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,656
[Tatsuma stammering]

306
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:35,128
Karura, come forth.
It's time to lend me your power!

307
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,763
Oh, my God!

308
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:40,066
[Karura] That is our pact.
I shall grant your request.

309
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,367
Karura.

310
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,370
The vermillion bird,
the phoenix.

311
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,673
That's a magnificent familiar
you've got there.

312
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,010
[Tatsuma] You demon!
I don't know what you want
to do with it,

313
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,814
but the Impure King
can't be controlled that easy.

314
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,282
Put down the eyes and be gone!

315
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,418
I'm afraid I can't do that.

316
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,253
I've waited years
for this moment,

317
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,790
and I'm not
about to let you ruin it.

318
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,693
Karura flame... devour!

319
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,032
He's a tough little
whippersnapper.

320
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,969
[Karura] Such is the case
with humans possessed by demons.

321
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:19,940
All right, then,
Karura flame... blaster!

322
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,508
[Todo groans]

323
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,277
I can't heal fast enough.

324
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,714
Karura's power is amazing.

325
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,083
Uggh! I got it.

326
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,521
Let's get the ball rolling,
shall we?

327
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,224
No, don't! [groans]

328
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:45,298
Hang in there, Mamushi.
I got ya.

329
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,268
I'll get you out of here.

330
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,237
The Impure King is waking up!

331
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:59,012
[Juzo] Goma Hall?
Why would they come here?

332
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,482
‐[ground rumbles]
‐[Juzo gasps]

333
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,554
What the...

334
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,893
‐Master! Mamushi!
‐[Tatsuma] Juzo!

335
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,460
[shouts]

336
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,567
Watch it.
Don't let those globs hit you!

337
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,244
‐What the hell is that?
‐Juzo, perfect timing.

338
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,314
Good thing Yaozo told you
to follow me.

339
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:39,185
I got this, so take Mamushi
down to the field office
and bring back some help, quick.

340
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,055
Right. But what is that thing,
anyway?

341
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,357
She can tell you
on the way down.

342
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:48,228
She's not doing so hot
'cause she's been
carrying around that eye.

343
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,731
Go. Take her back
to her daddy for me.

344
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,099
‐And you be gentle with her.
‐[Juzo] What about you?

345
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,502
[Tatsuma] I'll try
to hold it here till
you get back with help.

346
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,605
‐Hey, you're OK.
‐Master, I...

347
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:01,608
You tell everyone
everything that happened here.

348
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:05,245
‐You got that?
‐I will, I promise.

349
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,479
Master!

350
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,582
[Tatsuma] Get moving!

351
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,417
Come on, Mamushi. Hang on.

352
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,756
[Mamushi] Master?

353
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,959
My secret has been revealed.

354
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,996
Thus, my pact to serve
the high priest of Myoda ends.

355
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,967
Yeah, but you and me made
another pact, so you're
not done with me yet.

356
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:31,137
We got to stop it before
it matures and releases
its miasma.

357
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,508
I say we hit it full‐on
with a purifying flame seal.

358
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,878
[Karura] That spell requires
a great deal of power.

359
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,646
We'll use holy fire.

360
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:43,650
That was created as a killing
blow against the Impure King.

361
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,453
Use it now and you will not
be able to use it again.

362
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:51,357
At this point, we got no choice.
Let's begin!

363
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,461
[Tatsuma chanting]

364
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,302
Holy fire!
Purifying Flame Seal!

365
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,505
‐[explosion]
‐[Tatsuma panting]

366
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:08,041
Whoo, boy, that should keep
a lid on it for a...

367
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,676
[gasping]

368
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,345
That took a lot out of me.

369
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,782
I did warn you it would.

370
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:19,285
Yeah, well,
I ain't dead yet, am I?

371
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,722
No, sir, long as I got
breath in my...

372
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,857
[Tatsuma gags]

373
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,762
[Todo] Oh, dear.

374
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:32,533
You know, I feel awful about
deceiving Ms. Hojo like that.

375
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,301
But it was the only way
I could find you.

376
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,704
You pretty much keep
to yourself.

377
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,773
That made it hard
to pin you down.

378
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,709
I can't even begin to tell you
how long it took for me

379
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,611
to devise a plan
to get you out in the open,

380
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,281
but eventually I realized
the only way was to revive
the Impure King.

381
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,553
I was dead certain
you were using Karura
to seal away his highness.

382
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:56,657
The problem was,
I had to wait years before
the time to strike was right.

383
00:20:56,657 --> 00:21:00,894
You were my target all along,
Tatsuma Suguro.

384
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,462
Or, to be more precise,

385
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,932
your familiar was what
I really had my sights on.

386
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,334
[Karura] Tatsuma!

387
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,105
[Tatsuma thinking]
<i>He's eating Karura!</i>

388
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,308
<i>Who is he? What is he?</i>

389
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,450
[Todo chuckles]

390
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,887
It's even more powerful
than I thought.

391
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,222
[Tatsuma thinking]
<i>He absorbed Karura!</i>

392
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,057
<i>It's part of him now!</i>

393
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:35,629
<i>How can a human force his will</i>
<i>on a demon and use its power?</i>

394
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,764
‐Impossible!
‐[Todo] My, my.

395
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,567
I feel like
I've suddenly become younger.

396
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:45,071
I didn't know
Karura's power came with such
a wonderful side effect.

397
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,472
[groans]

398
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,474
It's flapping around
in my stomach.

399
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,444
[chuckles]
My body might not be

400
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,413
the perfect vessel
for it after all.

401
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,650
Oh, well, I'm sure
I'll get used to it.

402
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,786
I'm another step closer
to my ultimate goal now.

403
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,889
Thank you, Tatsuma Suguro.

404
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,257
[Tatsuma groaning]

405
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,727
[Tatsuma] Wait!

406
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:10,631
[Tatsuma]
<i>Please, Rin, I'm begging you.</i>

407
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:15,101
<i>Use the Koma Sword</i>
<i>and destroy the Impure King.</i>

408
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,370
<i>I know I'm</i>
<i>just a stranger to you</i>

409
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,807
<i>and what I'm asking</i>
<i>is beyond crazy, but still...</i>

410
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,010
<i>if you have even</i>
<i>the tiniest sliver...</i>

411
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,612
[Yukio] "...of compassion
in you,

412
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:27,581
like your father had in him,

413
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:30,016
I hope you'll accept my request.

414
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,385
Thank you for taking
the time to read this.

415
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,820
Tatsuma Suguro."

416
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,924
[groans]

[Rin Akatsuki singing
"Kono Te De" in Japanese]

418
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,061
[Yukio] Come on, you tried.
Now give the sword back.

419
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:24,665
[Shura] You've seen his flames
work against demons before!

420
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,667
I say it's worth a shot.

421
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,869
[Mamushi] He can't fight
the Impure King on his own.

00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:32,138
The Inquest Committee headed
by the Grigori took a vote.

423
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,808
Rin Okumara, you've been
sentenced to death.

424
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,645
[Rin] Old man,
why did you save me?
