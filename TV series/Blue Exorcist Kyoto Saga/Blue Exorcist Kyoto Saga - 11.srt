Dude, there's a lot
of people up here.

160

What of it?
They are of no importance.

161
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,904
Those who set foot
in the Impure King's castle

or were touched by his minions

163
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:59,404

Screw it, I gotta try!

172
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,837
You can no longer afford
to dawdle.

[Ucchusma] Why do you hesitate?
Pour more power into it!

This darn fungus is growing
faster than I can handle!

Would you stop? Can't you tell
you're totally exhausted?

198
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:50,004
You used your demon too much!
You'll die!

Stop it!

Hmm‐mm. I won't.

That's... Kashoh‐Zanmai?

Only that one's way beyond
what I summoned.

Man, it was super weird
when your flames hit us.

We were covered in 'em,

Did I scare you again?

Nah, dude, he keeps his feelings
bottled up inside,

00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:33,537
[gasp] Holy hell!
How'd you make it out alive?

319
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:36,537
I already got used
to you being gone.

320
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,337
You know I'm kidding.

321
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:40,471
[Suguro] Sorry if I
made you worry.

322
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:42,871
[chuckles] Worry about you?
Never.

323
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,337
[Yukio] Rin!

324
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,071
[panting]

325
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:51,904
Oh, hey, Yukio!
I was wondering where you were.

326
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:57,037
[Yukio] Shura.
What is my brother doing here?

327
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:58,604
Who let him out of his cell?

328
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:02,204
Remember my apology from before?
That's for this.

329
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:05,071
‐[growling]
‐[Rin] See, Yukio?

330
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:08,404
I saved everybody here
like a freakin' boss!

331
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:10,671
Bet your head's spinnin' now,
ain't it?

332
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:13,904
[Rin laughs loudly]

333
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:17,637
Soon I'll leave you behind.
Eat my dust.

334
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:25,337
You idiot! Do you understand
the mess you're in?

335
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:32,637
Yeah, I understand.

336
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,971
Don't you worry.

337
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:39,771
I get it.

338
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:42,904
Sure, I'm the spawn of Satan.

339
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,971
I can't escape that or my power.

340
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:48,704
I've always been afraid of it,

341
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:52,304
of facing it, accepting it.

342
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,604
But now, now I understand
how wrong I was.

343
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:05,571
Take a good look.

344
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:09,571
This is me, Yukio,
this is who I am.

345
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:15,637
[groaning]

346
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:20,037
If I'm not cool with myself...

347
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:23,571
I'm not gonna get anywhere.

348
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:26,871
Yukio, we're brothers.

349
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:29,604
I need you to be cool...

350
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:33,537
with me too.

351
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:38,471
‐[Rin collapses]
‐[Yukio] Rin!

352
00:23:38,537 --> 00:23:41,037
[Suguro] Okumura!

353
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:52,804
Dad. Hey, Dad, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do from now on.

354
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:54,871
Do you know?

355
00:23:56,371 --> 00:24:00,204
Seriously? You're gonna have to
work that out for yourself.

356
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:07,337
[grown‐up Rin] <i>What the hell</i>
<i>did you save me for?</i>

357
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:21,271
[Rin] Yukio, I need
to talk to you.

358
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:24,271
It can wait for now.
But soon.
