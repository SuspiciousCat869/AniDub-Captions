00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,200
[Tatsuma, feebly] <i>Wait.</i>

2
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,666
<i>Please, Rin.</i>

3
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,466
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

4
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:21,533
<i>Use the Koma Sword</i>
<i>and destroy the Impure King.</i>

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,300
<i>I know I'm just</i>
<i>a stranger to you</i>

6
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:28,266
<i>and what I'm asking</i>
<i>is beyond crazy, but still...</i>

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>if you have even...</i>

8
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:32,700
[Yukio] "...the tiniest sliver
of compassion in you,

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,433
like your father had in him,

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
I hope you'll
accept my request.

11
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:39,500
Thank you for taking
the time to read this.

12
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,766
Tatsuma Suguro."

13
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,900
[chuckles]

14
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:50,633
That letter turned out
to be a bigger eye‐opener
than I thought.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,333
You said it, but we can't
give Rin the Koma Sword.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,900
Combined with his flames,
who knows how they'll affect
the Impure King?

17
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:02,400
I hate to disappoint
Suguro's dad, but this is
too risky for us to...

18
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:05,266
The letter's addressed to you,
Rin, so it's your decision.

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,766
What do you want to do?

20
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,266
I wanna...

21
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,700
Really? What's the point
in asking him?

22
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:16,200
[Rin] I... I wanna help.

23
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,733
Come on! Do you even understand
the mess you're in?

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,133
I wanna help 'cause our old man
saved my life.

25
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,200
So like, if there's a chance
I can save someone else,

26
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:30,266
I can't sit and do nothing.

27
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,866
Hell, I know I screwed up.
I just wanna help.

28
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,433
‐Well, you can't and that's‐‐
‐[Shura] Ah, screw it.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,233
[Shura] From here it descends
and to him it shall return.

30
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,266
‐What do you think you're doing?
‐Hmm? What do you mean?

31
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,933
If he wants to help,
we need to make sure
he can draw this thing

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,266
and still keep his cool.

33
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,433
So, let's see if he can.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,466
‐Uh...
‐No! Have you gone
completely insane?

35
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,166
He's here because he just
lost control, and now you want
to hand him the sword

36
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,666
and hope for the best?!

37
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,766
If he flares up again,
he's gonna be executed for sure!

38
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,233
Listen, Doofus!

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,166
The Vatican knew
what was going down

40
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,233
when I started chanting
the imprisonment spell,

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,200
so they could have executed Rin
whenever they felt like
after that, but they didn't!

42
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,766
The kid's already screwed,
so there's no point
in pussy‐footing around now!

43
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,133
Besides, if the Impure King
really has come back to life,

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,166
don't you think that
son of a bitch is a bigger
threat to the world

45
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,433
than Rin is?! [straining]

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,400
You know what he can do
when he's all riled up.

47
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:32,366
You've seen his flames work
against demons before!

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,100
I say it's worth a shot.
Go ahead, try and draw it.

49
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,000
[straining]

50
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,800
Huh?

51
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,800
[straining]

52
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,066
What's wrong?

53
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,700
[Yukio] What are you doing, Rin?

54
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,933
[Rin, straining] It's, uh...

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,133
What's with this thing?
I can't draw it!

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
‐Huh?
‐Would you quit screwing around?

57
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm not, damn it!

58
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:07,366
Arrgh! I don't know why,
but it ain't budging.

59
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,700
All right then, let me take
a crack at that thing.

60
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,233
Come on, gimme.

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,433
What? No, I can do it.
It's just a little stuck is all.

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,166
‐Just need to pull
a little harder.
‐Please don't break it.

63
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,966
Oh, I got it.

64
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,800
You're scared, ain't ya?

65
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:25,866
‐Uh...
‐[Shura] I can't say
I blame ya.

66
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,866
A little while ago,
you were up on that roof,

67
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,833
stoked you got control
of your flames,
and then you flared up.

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,966
I bet you feel like you're back
to square one now, huh?

69
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:40,600
You're thinking,
"What's gonna happen to me
if I draw the sword?

70
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,933
Am I gonna be OK or am I
gonna lose control again?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,033
And what if this time I really
hurt someone I care about?"

72
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,800
‐[Rin] No, I...
‐[Shura] You know I'm right.

73
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:53,933
[Shura] You can't draw it
'cause you lost your confidence.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,366
[Rin] Huh?

75
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:59,333
[Uverworld singing
"Itteki No Eikyou" in Japanese]

76
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,533
Hang on a sec.

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,300
Not having confidence is why
I can't draw this thing?

78
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,700
Come on, you tried.
Now give the sword back.

79
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,033
[Rin straining]

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,833
[Mephisto] Goodness gracious.
Alley‐oop.

81
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,336
Guten abend,
my little trouble makers.

82
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,302
[chuckles]

83
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,836
‐[Yukio] Sir Pheles?
‐Mephisto. What do you want?

84
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:52,469
Your rude tone is as
disappointing as this venue.

85
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:54,669
To think, my first
grand appearance in ages

86
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,036
and it's in a jail...
an icky jail.

87
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:01,402
Rejoice, though, for I have
arrived to clean up your mess.

88
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,636
<i>Eins, zwei und drei!</i>

89
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:09,136
<i>Das staärkste Gefaängnis.</i>

90
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,902
The most impenetrable prison.

91
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,969
[Rin gasps]

92
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,536
[groans]

93
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:19,702
I just received word
from the Vatican.

94
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,836
Apparently,
due to Rin's bad behavior,

95
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:26,436
the Inquest Committee headed
by the Grigori took a vote.

96
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:29,302
Rin Okumura, you've been
sentenced to death.

97
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,136
[Rin groans]

98
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:33,236
[Rin] No! Wait!

99
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:36,002
[gears whirring]

100
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:38,236
I can't believe
they decided so fast.

101
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:43,769
[Mephisto] You think I'm lying?
Please. I'm far too busy
to play around like that.

102
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,836
[Shura] Yukio, you OK?

103
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:50,902
Regardless of the boy's fate,
destroying the Impure King
is our top priority.

104
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:52,002
[sneezes]

105
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,336
Excuse me.
Be a dear and hold this.

106
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,969
Back up a second there.

107
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:59,002
If you know about
the Impure King,
why don't you help?

108
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,002
‐Surely you're joking.
‐[snaps fingers]

109
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,736
Unfortunately, I can't abide
fungus‐y things
due to my allergies.

110
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:10,002
‐My poor nose!
‐[Shura] Oh, my God.

111
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,202
If it's been revived,
the Impure King
will grow rapidly.

112
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:18,469
As soon as it reaches maturity,
Kyoto will become a city
of death.

113
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:21,969
I'm on my way back
to the field office
with Mamushi.

114
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:24,569
Get everyone together
and meet us at the entrance.

115
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,169
Can you see it from there yet?

116
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:29,536
Uwabami, can you see it?

117
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:33,702
[Uwabami] Yes, I...
I think so.

118
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:38,402
Defeating the Impure King
will most likely take
a great deal of manpower.

119
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:39,902
And I'd like to do my part.

120
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:42,302
Please accept this equipment
as my gift.

121
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:46,802
They're nothing fancy,
but I think you'll find them
very helpful.

122
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:49,769
‐Huh?
‐And now I must depart.

123
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,669
Best of luck, kiddies.

124
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,136
[Shura] Hey, wait!

125
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:56,902
Man, what a bastard.

126
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,469
Let's just focus on doing
what we can.

127
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:02,502
‐What, for Rin?
‐No, the Impure King.

128
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,869
The Myoda is gonna need
our help destroying it.

129
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,502
[Shura groans]

130
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:12,636
The field office just sent
an emergency summons.

131
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:14,669
They need anyone who's able
over there!

132
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:16,502
‐Yes, sir!
‐Hurry!

133
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,969
[Renzo] I wonder what's going on
with all the commotion
out there.

134
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,002
[Konekomaru] It sounds like
something serious.

135
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,536
[priest] Hey, is it true
they caught Mamushi?

136
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,836
[priest 2] Yeah, Juzo did.
He's bringing her back.

137
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,036
Mamushi?

138
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:30,636
[Konekomaru] Bon!

139
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:35,636
[priest] Look, Juzo's back!

140
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:38,169
[Uwabami] Mamushi! Juzo!

141
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:41,836
[Mamushi] Thank you all
for coming so I can...

142
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,736
[Mamushi coughs]

143
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:46,736
...so I can try
to redeem myself.

144
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:49,736
First I... [coughs]

145
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:52,936
I... I admit I am the traitor.

146
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:57,002
Even so, put your feelings
about that aside

147
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,636
and listen to me.

148
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,736
As most of you already know,

149
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:05,902
Saburota Todo and I stole
the Right and Left Eyes.

150
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:10,236
A little while ago, we used them
to revive the Impure King.

151
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:11,836
[priest] That's impossible!

152
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:14,436
But the Impure King was defeated
way back in the Edo period.

153
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:18,236
[Mamushi] Its body has been kept
in a state of suspended
animation

154
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:20,002
beneath Kongo‐Shinzan.

155
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,869
‐[worried murmurs]
‐Hey, cut the chatter!

156
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:25,769
Right now, it's on the loose
and growing.

157
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,636
Master Tatsuma's up there, too.

158
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:30,102
He's taking that demon on
all by himself.

159
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:34,469
I beg you, please send help.

160
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:37,702
He can't fight the Impure King
on his own!

161
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,969
‐You've got some nerve!
‐You brought it back to life,
so you deal with it.

162
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:44,336
We don't even know
what we're dealing with.

163
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:45,902
Yeah, we don't know how
to fight it.

164
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:48,969
This is not the time
to be arguing amongst ourselves.

165
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,702
Every exorcist, including
security teams one and two

166
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,869
and the team from the keep,
will deploy to assist
the Master.

167
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:58,136
The Impure King is related
to the King of Rot.

168
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,536
So to counter the miasma,
you'll need to get vaccinated.

169
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,202
[priest] Hurry!
Get the syringes ready.

170
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,502
[priest 2] On it!

171
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:07,102
‐[Mamushi coughing]
‐[Suguro] Mamushi!

172
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,569
M‐Master Ryuji!

173
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:13,102
Your eye. I'll get the doc.

174
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:15,502
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,302
He's alone.

176
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,102
The Master's alone!

177
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,869
Save him!

178
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:25,336
[Juzo] Don't worry, Bon,
I'll get her to the infirmary.

179
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:26,969
Then what? You going?

180
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:30,502
Yeah, of course.
I'll head up as soon as
I got her settled.

181
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,302
As for you and your pals,
you'd better head back
to the inn for now.

182
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:34,969
Keep him safe!

183
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:38,736
Anything happens to him,
you're dead, got it,
Renzo, Koneko?!

184
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:42,902
Yeah, we got it.
He's safe with us.

185
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:45,336
Forget about me.

186
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:46,569
[coughs]

187
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:48,869
Hurry and help the Master...

188
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:50,802
[Juzo] Shut up.

189
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:59,636
I'll get you for this, Todo!

190
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:03,502
[Renzo] There's nothing
we can do, Bon.
You heard what my bro said.

191
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:05,802
We have to go back to the inn.

192
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,069
Yo, you guys,
come here for a sec.

193
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,802
‐I've got something for you.
‐Ma'am, how is Rin?

194
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:15,169
The top brass heard about
his flare‐up and they just
sentenced him to death.

195
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,502
[Shiemi and Suguro gasp]

196
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,402
That's an order from the Vatican

197
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,469
and it can't be overturned
by anyone.

198
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,036
Any crap...

199
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:26,102
Here you go, Suguro.
I'm trusting you
with this thing.

200
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:28,969
Kurikara!

201
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:32,402
[Shura] Oh, and here's a letter
your dad wrote to Rin.

202
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:36,602
It says we're gonna need
his power to destroy
the Impure King.

203
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,169
Rin did say he's down to fight.

204
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:42,369
But first he's gonna need you
to bust him out.

205
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:46,869
The only way he'll get
a pardon now is if he does
something big and heroic.

206
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:49,736
Here, these are camo‐panchos.

207
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:52,102
Put 'em on and you'll be
invisible.

208
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,836
You can walk right up
to his cell

209
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:55,536
and no one's gonna notice
you're there.

210
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:57,369
Ms. Kirigakure, it's time to go.

211
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:59,502
OK!

212
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:04,002
As you see, the Order's
got me on a tight leash
so I got to behave.

213
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:06,636
You have to figure it out
from here.

214
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,569
I'm counting on you.

215
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,612
Let's go, guys.
Rin needs our help!

216
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,879
Hell, I wanna get him out
of there as much as anyone.

217
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,479
The thing is, we don't wanna
piss off the Vatican.

218
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:35,379
But... this is our one
and only chance to save Rin.

219
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,679
If we don't try,
we'll regret it.

220
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,679
Cell block's down this way.

221
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,479
‐Bon!
‐Thank you, Suguro.

222
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:55,746
‐Are you cool with this, Koneko?
‐Thanks, Miwa!

223
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,312
[Konekomaru] We promised
we'd protect Bon.

224
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,612
Besides, she's right.
I would regret it.

225
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:08,379
What the...
Dude, we'd better do
what Juzo said.

226
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,846
‐Y‐You're going, too?!
‐Thanks, Kamiki!

227
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:17,379
What's gotten into everyone?
They're all gonna d‐‐

228
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,546
Move your ass, Renzo!

229
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:22,312
While you kids are back
at the inn taking a nap,

230
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,412
I'll be spilling my blood
for Myoda!

231
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,646
[hysterical laughter]

232
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,479
Everyone's nuts.

233
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:32,179
All this stuff
about Myoda and regret.

234
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:35,079
I just don't get
what all the fuss is about.

235
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:37,779
Ah, jeez, damn it!

236
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:39,712
I hate my life!

237
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:45,712
‐Ow!
‐Look, for the last time,
no talking.

238
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,112
‐I didn't. I thought it was you.
‐I didn't say anything.

239
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,112
‐Quit messing around.
‐I'm not.

240
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,912
[guard] Jeez!

241
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,879
That was way too close.

242
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:57,379
[Renzo, whispering] Thanks for
stepping on my heel, Koneko.

243
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,246
[Konekomaru] I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

244
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:01,246
[Izumo] The only problem
with these panchos

245
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:03,012
is we can't see each other.

246
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:04,379
Other than that,
they're pretty cool.

247
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:07,412
[Suguro] Shh!
His cell's coming up.

248
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,312
That's a weird looking door.

249
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:14,779
[Gefaängnis] Wee‐ooh,
wee‐ooh, wee‐ooh, wee‐ooh!

250
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:16,812
[chuckles]

251
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,579
I am Das Staärkste Gefaängnis,
the impenetrable prison.

252
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,646
I can't be unlocked
from the inside

253
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,446
but I can be opened easily
from the outside.

254
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,612
See if you can answer my riddle!

255
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,312
‐What the heck is this thing?
‐A demon!

256
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,312
[Gefaängnis] And the riddle is,
what makes me so impenetrable?

257
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,746
Try to break into me
and see for yourselves.

258
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,746
‐I guess we've got no choice.
‐Huh!

259
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:51,912
[Gefaängnis giggles]

260
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:53,512
The answer is:

261
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,779
I am impenetrable because I can
freeze those who come at me

262
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:59,479
with hostile intent
in their tracks.

263
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:03,279
Now you know how
I got my name. [giggles]

264
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:09,479
Oh, my gosh. Hey, wait.
Um, sir, how come
you didn't freeze me, too?

265
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:11,812
Because you pose no threat
to me.

266
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,146
You're weak
and carry no weapons.

267
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,712
[chuckles]

268
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:18,879
[Shiemi, thinking]
<i>He's right.</i>

269
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:22,246
<i>Without Nee's help,</i>
<i>I am weak.</i>

270
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:27,812
<i>Still, I can't let Rin die.</i>

271
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,446
<i>I won't let that happen!</i>

272
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,112
You said you can be opened
from the outside.

273
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,212
[Gefaängnis] Indeed.
You can get in,
but you can't get out.

274
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,212
[Shiemi, thinking]
<i>Everyone needs him.</i>

275
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,712
<i>I have to try.</i>

[door creaks open]

277
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:54,246
What the hell?

278
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:55,846
Where am I?

279
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:57,612
I'm not dying here.

280
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,279
No way am I gonna die
in this shit hole!

281
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,079
[metal clangs]

282
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,412
I can't die.

283
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,579
Or maybe I should.

284
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:12,979
[Mephisto] <i>We could kill you,</i>

285
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,979
<i>or you could try</i>
<i>to kill us and run.</i>

286
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:18,412
<i>Or you could also kill</i>
<i>yourself: three options.</i>

287
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,546
[Yukio] <i>You should just die!</i>

288
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:25,512
[Rin, thinking] <i>My pop</i>
<i>saved my life for a reason.</i>

00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:28,412
<i>The last thing I want</i>
<i>is to waste it.</i>

290
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,012
<i>But, in the end...</i>

291
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,912
[Shura] <i>You're thinking,</i>
<i>"What's gonna happen to me</i>

<i>hurt someone I care about?"</i>

293
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:43,446
[Rin, thinking] <i>Maybe it's</i>

294
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,612
<i>But...</i>

295
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,179
<i>then I'll die</i>

<i>and without making things right</i>
<i>with the folks I care about.</i>

<i>So why did I even</i>
<i>get a second chance?</i>

298
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:59,512
Old man, why did you save me?

299
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:02,979
What was the point?

300
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,746
[Shiemi panting]

301
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:07,079

[Shiemi] Rin!

304
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,879
I came to get you!

305
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,746
[panting]

306
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:24,512
We talked to Ms. Kirigakure.
She told us what you said.

307
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,212
Everyone's waiting out there
and we all wanna help you.

308
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,546
So come on,
let's get out of here!

309
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,312
Stay away from me.

310
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:38,212
What do you mean, why?

311
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,379
[Rin] Simple. I can't control
my flames without confidence.

312
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,246
I thought,
if I just stuck with it,

313
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,479
I'd get the hang of it
at some point.

314
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:52,346
But now I know
that's never going to happen.

315
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,646
That's just the way it is.

316
00:17:55,812 --> 00:18:00,112
Maybe I'd be
better off if I died.

317
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,246
What are you saying?
Are you crazy?!

318
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,979
How could you say such a thing?

319
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:08,412
Trust me,
you wouldn't understand.

320
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,779
It's not something you need to,
anyway.

321
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:13,279
Stop it! Don't say that!

322
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,479
You can't just laugh
and push me away!

323
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:19,212
I'm on your side!
I'm here because
I wanna help you!

324
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:26,546
Don't you get it?
I'm a monster! Go home!

325
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,012
[Shiemi thinking]
<i>Huh? You're not hot.</i>

326
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,146
<i>You're warm.</i>

327
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:48,379
<i>I'm such a... dummy.</i>

328
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,346
<i>I was so focused</i>
<i>on my problems,</i>

329
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,212
<i>I never considered</i>
<i>what he was going through.</i>

330
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,412
<i>What...</i>
<i>What kind of friend am I?</i>

331
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:12,946
Rin!

332
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,346
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:17,779
[Rin] Don't.
You're gonna get burned.

334
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,412
It's not safe.

335
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,812
I couldn't be safer.

336
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,779
Look, there's not
a single burn anywhere on me.

337
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:30,779
You made sure of that.

338
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,479
Don't you see, you did it!

339
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:37,412
[Rin] Uhh! B‐B‐But I'm still
a monster, you should be scared!

340
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:40,812
Huh? I'm not scared of you.

341
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,579
‐You sure?
‐Mm‐hmm.

342
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:49,346
[Rin roaring]

343
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,912
[door shattering]

344
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,746
It's Okumura!

345
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:56,746
No way, you really came
to save me!

346
00:19:56,812 --> 00:20:01,112
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't
like it if you died.

347
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,112
If it turns out you're not
dangerous, I'd like to be
friends with you.

348
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,012
Konekomaru.

349
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,046
Um, FYI, I'm here 'cause
Ms. Kirigakure told me to,
not for anything sappy.

350
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:15,912
Oh, um, I didn't wanna come,
but I did, so
you're welcome, dude.

351
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,846
You guys are... [sniffs]

352
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,746
Thanks for having my back.

353
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:22,712
[Shiemi screams]

354
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:25,679
[Rin] S‐Suguro!

355
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:28,579
I wasn't thinking straight
before, man.

356
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:31,079
I was kind of pissed
at my dad and stuff.

357
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,979
Anyway, you were right.

358
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:36,446
About my dad,
not, you know, the other crap.

359
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,646
You'll need this
if you're gonna fight.

360
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,212
Here, take it.

361
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,512
I, I'm sorry
I punched you in the face.

362
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:48,379
Yeah, well, I'll show you
the way to Kongo‐Shinzan.

363
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,279
After that, you can do
whatever you want.

364
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:53,646
I don't care.
I'll be fighting too
for what it's worth.

365
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,846
Suguro, I just want you
to trust me.

366
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:59,512
I can't help it
if I'm the spawn of Satan.

367
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:02,046
But I'll use my flames
for good, I swear!

368
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:05,412
Please! Have some faith in me.

369
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,379
[Suguro] I don't care
that you're Satan's kid.

370
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,046
The reason I'm pissed at you

371
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,846
is you were carrying
that baggage all by yourself.

372
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:16,412
If you'd have said something,
maybe we could have helped.

373
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,812
Why should I trust you
if you don't trust me?!

374
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,379
Am I the only one here
that thought we were friends?

375
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,279
No, wait, you got it all wrong!

376
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,346
You're pissed at him
'cause of that?

377
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:28,279
That's what's been bugging you?!

378
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:31,712
Huh? That's one for the books.

379
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:33,046
[Konekomaru] Shima!

380
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:35,546
[Rin thinking] <i>Suguro.</i>

381
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,946
<i>I get it now.</i>

382
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:40,846
<i>OK, you're on.</i>

383
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:46,046
It took ages,
but now the stage is set
and the cast is assembled.

384
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,712
The audience is settled in.

385
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:52,612
It's time to relax
and enjoy the show.

386
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,279
[explosion]

387
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:05,779
[Suguro] Guys, we're going
to Kongo‐Shinzan in Raku‐Hoku.

388
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:11,446
The Impure King's going down.

389
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,779
[Rin, thinking] <i>This is</i>
<i>my chance to prove myself.</i>

390
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,812
<i>To everyone!</i>

391
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:50,379
[Rin Akatsuki singing
"Kono Te De" in Japanese]

392
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:21,112
[Yukio] Becoming an Exorcist
was my choice!

393
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,746
Dad and Rin had nothing
to do with it!
