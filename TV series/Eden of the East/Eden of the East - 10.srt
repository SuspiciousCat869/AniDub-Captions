1
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,250
What's up?

2
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,625
I gotta run.
Something just came up.

3
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,250
Saki?

4
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,291
Bye.

5
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,291
Takizawa!

6
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,625
What happened?

7
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,791
Why didn't Takky get
on the train with us?

8
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,583
I have no idea.

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
You called me... Didn't you?

10
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,375
Daiju Mononobe...

11
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,958
I hear you'd like nothing more
than to punch Mister Outside...

12
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,250
Are your memories back?

13
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,875
How'd you hear that...?

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,541
Did Itazu tell you?

15
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,125
He had good things
to say about you.

16
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,625
He called you a hero...

17
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,041
But can you still live up
to those expectations?

18
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,041
Expecta...? Wait, what
are you talking about?

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,875
Your memories
haven't returned then...

20
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,875
nor have you read
the past logs...

21
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,541
Perhaps I've
overestimated your abilities.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,166
I intend to go to
Harima Science Garden City...

23
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,666
and become the
winner of this game.

24
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,791
Oh yeah...?

25
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,291
Hold on -
what number are you...?

26
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,583
I don't remember noticing
any Seleção spending money

27
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,916
like they thought they were
about to win the whole thing.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,541
I'm Number One.

29
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,583
But there's no need to panic...

30
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,208
I'll make it so you can
finish the game too...

31
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,791
Now then...
Will you come with me?

32
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,541
If you do I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

33
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,041
The truth behind that phone

34
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,458
and the reason you
erased your memories.

35
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,791
Takizawa... What happened?

36
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,541
Um... I have some
urgent business...

37
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,041
I'll call you later,
okay...? Bye.

38
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,000
Hold on! Don't hang up!

39
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,541
I know...
I know about your phone...

40
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,625
I know that it can do things
a regular phone can't...

41
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,125
Remember that night we thought
Osugi'd been kidnapped...?

42
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,375
I found you...
inside that hotel room

43
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,750
unconscious with
a strange woman.

44
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,625
Leading up to that you had
left your phone line open...

45
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,166
so I listened in... and
heard everything you said.

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,000
I saw something
truly bizarre happen

47
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,333
in the room that night,

48
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,125
and I know that woman
used her phone to do it.

49
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,583
It was the same kind
of phone you have.

50
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,375
Be straight with me, Takizawa...

51
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,791
the Seleção are the terrorists

52
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,041
behind Careless Monday,
aren't they...?

53
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you ... connected
to them in any way?

54
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,458
Yeah... Yeah... Give me a sec...

55
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,625
Yeah, I'll call you right back.

56
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,416
Takizawa... Tell me...
Who are you?

57
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,041
I see where
you're coming from...

58
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,083
I do...

59
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,000
Even I think it
sounds suspicious...

60
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,958
but my identity is
still a mystery to me...

61
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,750
And that's the truth, I swear...

62
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,041
Anyway, I'm about to have a talk

63
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,041
with someone who claims
to know all the answers.

64
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,583
So why don't you
stay on the line

65
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,750
and listen in to
our conversation...

66
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,833
I promise I won't hang up...

67
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,500
If it turns out
I'm a criminal...

68
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,500
then forget you ever knew me...

69
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,708
and I'll disappear
from your life forever.

70
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,833
What...? Hold on...

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,750
I didn't mean it like that.

72
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,708
Well...?

73
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,333
I think the evidence
is clear he was involved

74
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,583
in the disappearance
of the NEETs.

75
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,666
So, he used aliases
in the six cities

76
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,333
that were hit with missiles...

77
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,541
then he gathered the NEETs here
right after Careless Monday.

78
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,541
And then twenty-thousand people
just vanished into thin air...

79
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,291
It's like he's "the Pied Piper
of Hamelin" or something...

80
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,458
I just hope they're not buried
somewhere inside this building.

81
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,750
It's strange...
I just don't get it.

82
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,333
What reason could he
possibly have for doing this?

83
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,416
I just got off the
phone with Micchon.

84
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,041
They caught the
last train into town,

85
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,166
but Takky stayed
behind for some reason.

86
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,625
So does that mean
Saki and Micchon are okay?

87
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,458
Yeah, I guess so...

88
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,541
Anyway, I told 'em to
come meet us here, A-S-A-P.

89
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,541
From Itazu?

90
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,750
He just sent a ton of data...

91
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,291
It's too much for
my phone to handle.

92
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,208
Get in.

93
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,750
A helicopter?

94
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,916
What happened to Takky?

95
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,125
It's a message from Panties.

96
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,916
It looks like he's uploading

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,250
a bunch of data
onto Eden's server...

98
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,500
but the files are so enormous
my phone can't read them.

99
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,291
So what are you calling
yourself these days?

100
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,500
Akira... Akira Takizawa.

101
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,958
Takizawa, eh...?

102
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,625
You do know that's not
your real name, right...?

103
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,750
What about this?

104
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,791
Did you know you sent
twenty-thousand people to Dubai?

105
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,166
More or less.

106
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, wait.

107
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:35,875
Do you think he's talking

108
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,541
about the NEETs who disappeared?

109
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,125
I've been able to put

110
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,833
a few of the pieces
together about that...

111
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,791
But what I don't know yet...

112
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,666
Why did I erase my memory?

113
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,958
And why did I need all these
aliases in the first place?

114
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,916
Those are fair questions...

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,875
Are you aware of a firm
called ATO &amp; Company?

116
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,250
ATO &amp; Company?

117
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,416
I've discovered the real
identity of Mister Outside,

118
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,583
the man who dragged
you and I into this game...

119
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,458
His real name is Saizo Ato.

120
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,291
He's the company's CEO
and their senior advisor.

121
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,333
Saizo Ato.

122
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,916
Yes... Heard of him...?

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,625
He's a well-connected
businessman

124
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,750
who made his fortune
through a transport company

125
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,583
he started after
World War Two...

126
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,625
In the post-war reconstruction,
men like him

127
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,958
liked to think they
were "fixing" Japan...

128
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,375
Ah, the youth of
today... ignorant.

129
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,291
So... what kind of
proof do you have

130
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,041
that this Ato guy is
really Mister Outside?

131
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,541
Ato Saizo... Mister Outside...

132
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,083
Wait... you just
swap the name --

133
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,333
Yes, it's an obvious
play on words...

134
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,708
But the reason
I know he's the one is

135
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,875
because he's the only person

136
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,458
with the amount of
resources necessary...

137
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,583
to make this game a completely
automated experience.

138
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,166
At one point he
studied overseas,

139
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,833
focusing on pre-war Europe...

140
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,458
and ideology, and he's also
quite the soccer fanatic...

141
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,791
The name Seleção is derived
from "Seleção", a term stemming

142
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,750
from his idolization
of Brazilian football...

143
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,541
Once these hints
were made clear to me,

144
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,375
it was actually quite
simple to deduce who he was.

145
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,041
But why would a
successful old man want

146
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,708
to blow ten billion yen on each
of us for such an insane idea?

147
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,791
Does he really believe

148
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,375
we can make a difference
in this country?

149
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,333
Perhaps to Mister Outside,
giving a young man

150
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,750
like yourself nearly
infinite power and wealth...

151
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,083
as well as allowing a
serial killer to murder,

152
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,250
and a warmonger the ability
to launch missile attacks...

153
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,333
are all valid and
feasible methods

154
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,333
worth exploring in the
interests of our nation.

155
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,208
Saizo Ato is someone
who prides himself

156
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,333
on having laid the foundation
for modern day Japan...

157
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,000
But as the years went by,
he began to wonder

158
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,208
if the country was
on the correct path...

159
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,750
if all that he had
achieved was right...

160
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,083
I believe he came to
his decision after taking

161
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,916
a hard look at the impasse
our country is facing today

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,250
And then, by forcing
power upon the people

163
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,875
he found to be worthy and able

164
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,708
of the many
hurdles laid ahead...

165
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,916
he sought to replicate
his feats of the past

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,916
by orchestrating
yet another moment

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,083
of dramatic change for Japan.

168
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,458
Yeah, well I still
think it's insane.

169
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,791
I agree with you
wholeheartedly...

170
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,583
He has made us all into victims,

171
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,833
mere pawns in
his twisted game...

172
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,416
However... while I don't defend
his actions in any way...

173
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,291
I understand he
had to act quickly.

174
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,666
At the time this game
was put into motion...

175
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,000
He'd already been diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

176
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,333
The reality is Mister Outside
is most likely dead.

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,916
This is crazy.

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,083
Who's this guy he's talking to?

179
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,916
It's a shame.

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,208
Your chances of punching
Mister Outside are zero.

181
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,125
Ah, well...

182
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm not sure I'd have the nerve

183
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,166
to clock a sick
senior citizen anyway...

184
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,708
So tell me...

185
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,291
What exactly are your plans
for winning this game...?

186
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,791
Even if the old man is dead...

187
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,500
as long as the game continues,

188
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,666
you still have to worry
about the Supporter.

189
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,875
My strategy for
winning is simple.

190
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,041
The plan is to assume
the role of Mister Outside

191
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,833
and then eventually
replace him...

192
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,541
The game itself
borders on absurdity...

193
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,083
but the noblesse phone system

194
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,541
is a form of
engineering artistry.

195
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,500
It gives simple men like
us the political power

196
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,458
that Saizo Ato spent
his life cultivating.

197
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,541
When you use your phone,

198
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,916
you have a concierge who
handles your requests, right?

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,041
Yeah. You mean Juiz.

200
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,416
I will be assuming
control of her, too.

201
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,500
Mononobe...

202
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,083
Are you positive this
is where Juiz works?

203
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,083
This is a research lab owned

204
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,916
and operated by
the Ato Foundation...

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,375
In the years before his death,
Mister Ato reportedly spent

206
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,916
much of his time here on a
variety of secret projects.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,416
You've looked into
everything, haven't you?

208
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,291
Once I figured out the
identity of Mister Outside...

209
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,916
I left public service...

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,750
and began making connections
in the private sector...

211
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,791
specifically,
with ATO's subsidiaries.

212
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,541
Then... just a few days ago,

213
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,333
I assumed the role
of CEO at ATO itself...

214
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,291
allowing me complete
control of the company.

215
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,583
At this point I have
established the identities

216
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:58,333
of ten of the Seleção,
including yourself.

217
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,875
Out of those ten, two of them

218
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,583
have come on board
to work with me.

219
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,833
This is Yuki--Seleção
number ten.

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,250
He's the one responsible

221
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,500
for launching the previous
eleven missile attacks.

222
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,583
Where's Tsuji?

223
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,083
He's waiting inside.

224
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,625
Excellent.

225
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,333
This is Juiz.

226
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,708
Hello there...

227
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,458
Please choose a bottle
of celebratory champagne...

228
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,916
Have it delivered to
the control room at once.

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,041
This is an unusual request for
you to make Mister Mononobe.

230
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,708
You refuse?

231
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,250
No. It's said that rewarding

232
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,041
one's self is good
for the psyche.

233
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,458
Noblesse oblige.

234
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,625
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

235
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,041
Thank you.

236
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,375
I have a question.

237
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,500
Is there more than one Juiz?

238
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,958
The girl who just
answered your phone...

239
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,875
she sounds exactly like mine...

240
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,416
It makes me feel kinda guilty

241
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,583
for running her around so
much with all my crazy requests.

242
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, I don't know why,

243
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,500
but I always had an image
in my head of a huge room

244
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:21,750
full of women sitting at long
tables and taking requests

245
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,541
while using a voice disguiser
so they all sounded the same.

246
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,916
You have a unique imagination...

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,125
The truth is the device
we're standing on...

248
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,916
is Juiz.

249
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,708
Ato would be one hundred
if he were alive today...

250
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,916
I suppose he created
this awesome machine

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,250
as a way of seeking atonement.

252
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,541
Takizawa.

253
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,250
Now that Mister Outside
is deceased,

254
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,166
only those of us in
this room are aware

255
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,666
of the facility
and its capabilities.

256
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,708
He manipulated this country
from behind the scenes

257
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,291
until his death, never taking
credit for his accomplishments.

258
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,125
Now we must carry the torch...

259
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,083
Join us in sending Japan
back to its former glory.

260
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,083
Huh?

261
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,875
Are you really
going to tell him?

262
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,125
Why shouldn't I?

263
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,458
After all, he is one of
Japan's selected few...

264
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,000
No matter what
he decides to do...

265
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,958
Don't you feel he has
earned the privilege

266
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,291
of knowing the full truth

267
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,875
before the general
population does?

268
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,208
The full truth...?

269
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,541
Look, just tell me what
it is you're planning.

270
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,833
Tomorrow at eight a.m...

271
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,000
this country will find
itself under attack again...

272
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,125
Only this time it will
be sixty missiles.

273
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:29,958
So these are...

274
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,833
the people behind
Careless Monday?!

275
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,500
Yuki's the one who
came up with the idea...

276
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,708
We will force society

277
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,000
to re-evaluate what
is important to them...

278
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,708
By doing so we will become
the saviors of this country.

279
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,458
That doesn't make any sense...

280
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,083
Have you even thought
this plan through at all...?!

281
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,500
How can you call
yourself a savior

282
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,750
when you attack
your own people?!

283
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,875
Open your eyes, man...

284
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,333
What doesn't make
sense is how this country

285
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,208
preaches equality then
exploits its citizens!

286
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,708
Yuki says he first received
his Noblesse phone...

287
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,833
in the days after
his parents died

288
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,041
from the effects
of being overworked.

289
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,791
And by that time...

290
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,666
I'd seen there was no
place for me in society...

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,333
I could either settle
for an endless string

292
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,041
of part time jobs...

293
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,000
Or go to school,
get a corporate job,

294
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,250
and work 90 hours a
week for slave wages...

295
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,333
And if I complained,
even the damn NEETs said

296
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,375
it was my own problem
if I couldn't get ahead,

297
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
that I didn't work
hard enough...

298
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,166
The ten missiles that I fired

299
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,333
on Careless Monday
were a message...

300
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,375
It's this society
that has the problem!

301
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,625
And it's this government
that isn't working!

302
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,916
Okay, you may have a point,

303
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,166
but have you considered that...

304
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,500
Come tomorrow morning,

305
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,708
I'm going to give those
bastards who kept me down

306
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,500
a taste of their own medicine...

307
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,291
It's my noblesse oblige.

308
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,416
And you agree
with this, Mononobe?

309
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,083
I've always believed
it's an individual's

310
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,541
responsibility to make
something of himself...

311
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,333
But... if we aim to
downsize the country...

312
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,375
and restore our power in
the global marketplace...

313
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,250
...we need immediate results...

314
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,041
We need to eliminate the
dead-weight slacker culture...

315
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,041
and remove the
gerontocracy's grip

316
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,541
on the reigns of power
before we can move forward...

317
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,083
I believe Yuki's plans will
help accomplish these goals.

318
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,750
So what's your story?

319
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,083
I already had ten billion
yen to begin with...

320
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,583
At this point, I just want out
of this stupid game,

321
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,208
the sooner the better.

322
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,208
Don't get in our
way this time...

323
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,291
You got it?

324
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,958
You people are
outta your minds...

325
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,875
You're misinterpreting what
noblesse oblige means...

326
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,416
I... wanna deck you
guys more than Outside.

327
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,083
That's pretty much what you said

328
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,916
before you evacuated
all those people

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,208
from the impact sites,
not that you'd remember...

330
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,333
You may as well
tell him everything...

331
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,416
Tell him why he
erased his memories...

332
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,125
If he still wants to
interfere with our plans...

333
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,250
I promise not to say anything.

334
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,208
Okay...

335
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,500
In the days before
you wiped your memory,

336
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,291
you were betrayed by
not only those you helped,

337
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,000
but those who helped you.

338
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,500
Thank you for choosing to ride

339
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
with East Japan Railways today.

340
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,125
We appreciate your
continued business.

341
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:14,333
Wait. Are these logs from
Takizawa's cell phone?

342
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,333
It looks like Number Ten's
logs are the ones

343
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,125
in the red font.

344
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,125
I wonder what this is.

345
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,916
What do you think
those numbers are for?

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,083
That's close to ten billion yen.

347
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,583
Hey, look... right there!

348
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,625
It mentions Tomahawk missiles!

349
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,291
Does this mean Takizawa was
involved in Careless Monday?

350
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,500
What's happening?

351
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,083
What the heck is that?!

352
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,750
Who the hell are they?

353
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,125
It's like a naked army!

354
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,833
Who do you think they could be?

355
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,208
Wow... There's
so many of them...

356
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,458
Wait, it's...!

357
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,541
I think it's the twenty
thousand missing NEETs!

358
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,666
Run!

359
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,708
Okay I see what you mean...

360
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,666
it's enough to make
any man lose all hope.

361
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,750
It's not fair.

362
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,583
They're so...
cruel towards Takizawa.

363
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,083
But am I really
any different...?

364
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,125
I'm no better than the
people who betrayed him...!

365
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,333
No, that's not true...!

366
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,000
It's not the same thing at all!

367
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,208
You're wrong...

368
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,958
I've said terrible things.

369
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,083
Right after the missiles fell...

370
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,750
I said to myself how I wished
something bigger would happen.

371
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,500
Did we make the right
decision by letting him go?

372
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,875
We don't even have full
control over the system yet.

373
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,666
If he calls Juiz now
and requests something

374
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,500
that could potentially stop us,

375
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,333
he wouldn't have enough
time to implement it.

376
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,208
We have a little
over eight hours...

377
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,291
Until the missiles
begin launching.

378
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,041
It's here.

379
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,000
Ah, a Bollinger.

380
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,458
It's empty.

381
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,666
It turns out the
winner of the game

382
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,625
will not be decided tonight...

383
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,208
Therefore you will have
to postpone your toast.

384
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,625
Noblesse oblige...

385
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,708
Please continue following
Mister Outside's orders...

386
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,250
And stay on your
path towards becoming

387
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,416
a savior to this
great nation of ours.

388
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,541
Transfer Juiz to
a secret location?!

389
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,166
Number Twelve's
the Supporter...!

390
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,541
Or he's.. Outside himself!
