1
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,333
Say goodbye to your
precious little Johnny.

2
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,500
Your luck ran out the moment
I saw you in the alley.

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,875
Hello? Whoever this is,

4
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,916
I'm kind of busy at the moment.

5
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,958
Have it your way.

6
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,291
Let's take a break...

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,166
And while you're waiting
here for me to return...

8
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,875
I want you to feel nice
and ashamed of yourself.

9
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,291
Well, here we are.

10
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,666
Thank you.

11
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,541
You know if you wanted

12
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,416
to stay longer I wouldn't mind.

13
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,833
I'll just meet up
with you later.

14
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,041
Sounds good...

15
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,333
And remember to bring along

16
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,291
your friends when you do...
I'll see you then.

17
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,708
Hello? Morimi residence.

18
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,000
Saki...? Hurry back home, now.

19
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,208
I'm sorry, but
I can't face Ryosuke;

20
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,333
I'm too ashamed.

21
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,583
Saki, don't be silly.

22
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,416
He's not angry with you.

23
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,166
Well... I just don't
wanna come home.

24
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,583
Why are you
talking like this...?

25
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,541
Tell me where you are,
I can come get you.

26
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,958
I'm at Micchon's...

27
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,250
I'm gonna stay here a while,

28
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,791
so please don't worry about me.

29
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,750
That's unacceptable.

30
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,125
I demand you come home!

31
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,416
Sorry, Asako.
I'll call you later.

32
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,750
I wouldn't worry about it.

33
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,375
It's not like we don't
know where she is...

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,208
Why don't we just let
her do her thing for now?

35
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,416
Honey, you are just
way too easy on her.

36
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,791
I better apologize
to Osugi, too.

37
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,416
Hey... What're you
doing down there?

38
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,500
Can you... lend me some clothes?

39
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,125
I know, my story sounds fishy.

40
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,458
But it's the truth.

41
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,250
It doesn't sound fishy,
it sounds preposterous!

42
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,750
I think you need to go
home and get some rest...

43
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,375
And sorry... but it seems
to me like this Takizawa guy

44
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,416
is trying to pull the
wool over your eyes.

45
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,458
And what are you wearing?

46
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,583
Doesn't seem like your style.

47
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,250
What's the big deal...?

48
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,208
Saki looks good in
everything she wears...

49
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,750
And I think this Takizawa
story's interesting.

50
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,500
We'd be fools not to pursue it.

51
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,708
Really?

52
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,208
I agree, the whole
ordeal sounds absurd...

53
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,875
but our discussion
needs to go beyond

54
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,458
telling Saki whether
or not she should

55
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,708
move in with him.

56
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,166
With the way things
have been going lately,

57
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,541
the future of our
little club is in danger.

58
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,500
She's right.

59
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,916
I don't believe this.

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,875
How did my PR girl get
wrapped up in this mess...?

61
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,583
And now the staff
is supporting you...

62
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,833
All for some shady character

63
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,125
who's probably
trying to find a way

64
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,791
to take advantage of everyone.

65
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,916
I don't know what happened
to you on your trip...

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,041
but you have changed
since you've gotten back.

67
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,333
What happened to the girl

68
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,250
who would shrug off
Osugi's desperate come-ons

69
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,541
like a devout nun...?

70
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,500
Despite all of his
constant groveling...

71
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,625
Not to mention the
thousands of other Johnnies

72
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,041
over the last four years,
all hyped up on testosterone

73
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,958
and willing to do
anything to have you...

74
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,333
Now at what point did you
become so weak in the knees?

75
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,750
No, it's... heh...

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,125
Testosterone aside...

77
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,458
Let us not forget it was
you who said, and I quote...

78
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,750
"Come hell or high-water,

79
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,291
Saki must be a part of
this business venture."

80
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,416
It's true...

81
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,291
Remember the only
reason Eden works

82
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,958
so efficiently is
because Saki makes up

83
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,708
for one of your
major weaknesses.

84
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,916
You're good at a lot of things,

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,666
Hirasawa, but you're
not a natural leader.

86
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,791
What, and he is...?

87
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,250
Look, I don't have any problems

88
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,541
with you pointing
out my faults...

89
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,208
but don't you think
there's a huge discrepancy

90
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,625
between myself and well...

91
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,125
everything this Takizawa
person stands for?

92
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,125
Sure, I did postpone my
graduation for a while...

93
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,625
but I'm gonna use that time

94
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,750
to continue advancing
the business model...

95
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,250
Meanwhile, Takizawa shows up...

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,291
with no clothes,
no memory, no job,

97
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,625
no idea who his family is,

98
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,750
or even his favorite movie!

99
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,916
Seriously...

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,666
Why would you trust
someone like him...

101
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,875
The guy's got nothing!

102
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,625
Oh that poor, poor boy.

103
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,958
What that must've been like:
All alone and lost,

104
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,958
with nothing but his gun waving
around in the cold breeze...

105
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,833
Can we please
stay on topic here?!

106
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,375
Excuse me.

107
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,666
Hirasawa...

108
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,083
I've been listening to
you guys this whole time...

109
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,666
and from everything
I've heard so far...

110
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,666
You've made Takizawa out to

111
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,000
be a worthless troublemaker

112
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,333
and I don't think
that's the case.

113
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,083
He seems to treat
Saki with respect,

114
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,916
and more than anything,
he's a go-getter

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,083
who isn't afraid of
getting his hands dirty.

116
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,625
The guy lives in
a shopping mall,

117
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,750
so he must be loaded... also...

118
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,208
he owns a dog,
so how bad can he be?

119
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,208
Who asked you?!

120
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,208
Sorry.

121
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,708
Sitting here and talking
about him isn't helping...

122
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,125
Let's just go and meet him...

123
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,958
find out ourselves.

124
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,458
I agree...

125
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,875
There's no better way
than a first impression...

126
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,791
Plus, then we can size him up.

127
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,458
I think that's a good point,

128
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,750
but just to be on
the safe side...

129
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,333
let's not walk right in.

130
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,250
First, let's do a little...

131
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,416
snooping around.

132
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,541
Whatever you say...

133
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,833
Mister Top-Secret Agent.

134
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,458
I'm just exercising
some caution...

135
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,416
Well, what do you think, Saki?

136
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,583
I'm fine with that...

137
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,166
Better safe than sorry...

138
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,458
I've always been a little wary
of the things Takizawa told me,

139
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,375
because of how
crazy they sound...

140
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,375
and if they're true,
it's scary stuff...

141
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,250
That's why... we should
all go together.

142
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,333
Alright...

143
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,541
I'll go and get us a car...

144
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,875
We head out in
thirty minutes, people.

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,791
Hirasawa.

146
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,875
I need to get something
off my chest about Osugi...

147
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,125
Last night he took me to a
really expensive restaurant

148
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,750
with champagne and everything...

149
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,250
It didn't occur
to me at the time,

150
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,291
but after hearing Saki's
story, it dawned on me...

151
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,500
He'd originally planned
that dinner to be for her.

152
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,708
Seriously?

153
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,958
Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier?!

154
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,125
Because, I didn't want

155
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,708
to say anything
in front of her...!

156
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,750
You see... Osugi got pretty
hammered during dinner...

157
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,833
which leads me
to believe he saw Saki

158
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,750
with Takizawa
earlier in the day.

159
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,416
It probably broke his heart.

160
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
So... What'd he do afterwards?

161
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,541
He started walking home,

162
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,625
completely drunk
out of his mind...

163
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,791
And now, apparently,

164
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,541
even Saki can't get
in touch with him...

165
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,916
What should we do...?

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We're on the verge of
making a momentous decision

167
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,166
on the future of this company...

168
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,166
We can't just leave
him out in the cold!

169
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,750
I agree.

170
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,250
Even though he did
get a job elsewhere...

171
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,250
he will always be a
valuable founding member...

172
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,625
Additionally, this would
be a golden opportunity

173
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,125
for us to keep Saki
from leaving Eden...

174
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,625
Alright, find Osugi and
put him in the club room

175
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,750
until we all get back.

176
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,416
Right. You got it.

177
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,541
This is where he lives?

178
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,833
Are there any other ways in?

179
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,166
I think if there were,

180
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,375
the homeless would have
found their way in by now.

181
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,875
We could be walking
straight into a trap...

182
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,583
No turning back now.

183
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,875
Saki, you could be marrying

184
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,583
into some serious
money with this guy!

185
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,666
Maybe he bought it cheap.

186
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,333
Property values in this area

187
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,458
took a nosedive
after Careless Monday.

188
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,625
But for all we know,
he could've paid top dollar

189
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,083
for the place before
the missile strike.

190
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,541
Holy crap - Come look at this!

191
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,375
This mall is heaven on earth!

192
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,833
Look at this shirt!

193
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,625
It's so cute! I have to have it!

194
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,208
Careful, girls.

195
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,583
You're gonna get us in trouble.

196
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,708
Whatever, "Dad"!

197
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,875
Looks like he's home.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,166
He lives upstairs in the
movie theater's VIP room.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,875
Hello?

200
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,208
Aren't you going to be our brave

201
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,750
and fearless leader and
introduce him to the team?

202
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,708
'Scuse me!

203
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,458
What's wrong?

204
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,291
Was he not up there?

205
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,708
No, he wasn't...!

206
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,458
But he's got this place covered
in surveillance cameras!

207
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,583
He's probably been
watching us the whole time!

208
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,083
We need to get out of
here before he finds us...!

209
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,500
The guy's obviously dirty!

210
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,708
We don't need to get
involved with someone like him!

211
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,500
Wait a minute. Who's dirty?

212
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,500
Isn't it obvious?
I'm talking about Takizawa!

213
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,583
Hey.

214
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,666
Welcome to my home...
glad to have you.

215
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,958
Oh, look...!
The little guy has wings!

216
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,416
I don't think I've ever
seen anything so cute!

217
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,166
Well as far as I can tell,
this title is legit.

218
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,416
I just dug it out of
a filing cabinet today.

219
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,875
Okay I think I'm following
you for the most part...

220
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,208
But what I still don't
get is why you decided

221
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,083
to financially
support our business...

222
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,708
And before you answer that,

223
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,000
I'd like to know your
intentions with Saki.

224
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,666
My intentions
are good-natured...

225
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,375
I just felt there was
no need for her to work

226
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,541
for elitist men
who'd have the nerve

227
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,291
to dump their lunch in
her lap to prove a point.

228
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,416
If everyone in Japan...

229
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,541
and not just Saki,
turned into NEET's,

230
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,416
we could flip this
country around...

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,375
The old farts who take
their power for granted

232
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,583
would have no other choice

233
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,833
but to bow before
us in gratitude.

234
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,291
You know, that is not a
very well thought out plan.

235
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,458
How so...?

236
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,291
You guys basically
had the same idea only

237
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,125
with some subtle differences...

238
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,958
I had a chance to play
with Eden of the East...

239
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,833
It's very well done...

240
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,500
A visual search engine
that uses social networking.

241
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,041
Brilliant.

242
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,625
I even tried to trip up the
system by using it on my dog.

243
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,333
But no matter what angle I used,

244
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,791
it was able to
recognize him every time.

245
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,166
Micchon here is the one

246
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,750
who wrote all the
code for the program.

247
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,916
No kidding...?

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,208
Hey, you're pretty
talented there, Mittan.

249
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,875
She has a sharp tongue

250
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,583
when she's around
people she knows,

251
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,875
but always tends to
clam up around strangers.

252
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,208
Even when she was a little kid,

253
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,708
she only wanted to play
with her cousin, Hirasawa.

254
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,666
Aw, she's adorable.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,166
My name's not Mittan.

256
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,041
So if you register
something on the site...

257
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,333
any cell phone
can access the data?

258
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,750
That's pretty cool... Genius...

259
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,083
I was talking to Saki...

260
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,166
We were discussing how
great the program is

261
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,541
and about all the
potential for monetization

262
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,833
if it were released...

263
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,708
Why haven't you
explored that yet?

264
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,958
Explain the point of
having assistants...

265
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,083
if I have to do it myself.

266
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,583
We're terribly sorry.

267
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,541
The road ahead is a long one...

268
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,833
In more ways than one.

269
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,375
Juiz?

270
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,583
How may I be of service?

271
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,916
I am in desperate
need of a secretary

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,833
fluent in both
French and Cantonese.

273
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,750
And I need it right now.

274
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,458
Order received...
Noblesse oblige...

275
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,333
I pray that you, one of
the most industrious CEOs

276
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,958
in the world, continue
your service as a savior.

277
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,708
You in the glasses...

278
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,750
Consider yourself laid off.

279
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,125
I don't believe this.

280
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,041
I didn't do anything!

281
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,208
To make a long story short,

282
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,041
we ran into some trouble
that happens all the time

283
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,541
on websites and message boards,

284
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,041
though I'm not really at liberty

285
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,000
to discuss any of
the finer details.

286
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,375
In the end,
it got pretty nasty...

287
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,708
a girl was forced to drop out...

288
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:08,166
and the university opened
an investigation on us.

289
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,083
Ooh... what about this?

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,583
No?

291
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,375
You're crazy.

292
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,500
Well, I think it's cute...

293
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,791
Suit yourself.

294
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,500
We started out as a
small-time recycling group

295
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,666
focused on awareness...

296
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,416
but thanks to the
development of Eden,

297
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,916
we soon realized that
items that were seen

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,791
as junk had real intrinsic
value to some people.

299
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,916
We owe everything to
Saki for not only seeing

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,625
the potential in the program,

301
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,708
but for also
getting the word out.

302
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,583
It didn't take long
for the other members

303
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,291
to jump on board,
and before we knew it,

304
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,500
the entire student body...

305
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,875
was obsessively using
the technology...

306
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,833
Eventually, people
realized Eden could be used

307
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,541
as a highly accurate
match-making service.

308
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,583
And is that where all
the trouble stemmed from?

309
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,875
Yeah...

310
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,166
Everything started
to snowball after that.

311
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,875
One member of our group
left to pursue a job,

312
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,291
and now Saki has
decided to leave home

313
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,791
for some unknown reason,

314
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,750
which she refuses
to discuss with us...

315
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm ashamed I let things
get so out of control.

316
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's go... It's time to leave.

317
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,458
What's up...?

318
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
Could you and Takky not come
to an agreement on a deal?

319
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,916
I am a NEET, understand...?

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,458
I've always prided
myself on that.

321
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,083
I don't have a
specialized skill set,

322
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,666
like Micchon or Saki,

323
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,583
which is why I studied
management and law.

324
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,000
I chose this so
I could support the

325
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,500
elite NEETs and
eventually become one.

326
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,041
I think you're already there.

327
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,250
Almost, but I'm not there yet.

328
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,708
What does this have
to do with the deal?

329
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,833
Eden of the East is
a NEET's paradise...

330
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,541
I don't want to solicit
help from an outsider.

331
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,416
Think of it as the jealousy...

332
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,458
all of the 'have-not's'
feel... towards the 'haves'.

333
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,708
Whatever you say...

334
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,708
I understand...
Actually, I don't.

335
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,041
Excuse me?!

336
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,333
I understand getting
involved with someone

337
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,583
who has amnesia takes
a leap of faith,

338
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,958
but you have to trust me...

339
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,000
In reality, I'm the
one asking for your help.

340
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,333
Now then...

341
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,791
I can't explain the
details of my situation...

342
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,041
but will you help me carry out

343
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,500
my noble obligations
as one of the 'haves'?

344
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,750
You can take my offer

345
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,958
for funding as a
show of my gratitude.

346
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,041
Do it, Hirasawa. Please...

347
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,375
I'm behind this
one hundred percent.

348
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,458
I wanna join Eden full time
and help you run it.

349
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,541
Sounds like a
perfect opportunity...

350
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,208
It was Saki's lack
of involvement

351
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,916
that troubled you the most...

352
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,416
What's there to lose?

353
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:28,958
You've gotta be kidding me.

354
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,875
I'm saved by Saki again?

355
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,291
In the end, does it matter
who saves who...?

356
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,083
Let's make a difference...

357
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,125
moving forward,
working together.

358
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,750
I just want to make
it clear to everyone

359
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,541
that I still don't
completely trust you.

360
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,958
Though I do trust you
enough to shake your hand...

361
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,500
That's a start... But...
when it comes to Eden,

362
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,375
I still call the shots. Agreed?

363
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,625
That's fine...

364
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,625
Now let's get to work
on a NEET's paradise.

365
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,625
Yeah!

366
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,000
Now we're one, big happy family!

367
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,833
Thanks, Takizawa... Really...

368
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,208
You're not
only helping me out,

369
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,791
you're helping out
the whole group.

370
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,833
No need...

371
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,833
I really admire
people like Hirasawa

372
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,708
who go out of their way
to help their fellow man.

373
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,958
Do you... mind if
I ask you a question?

374
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,583
What did...

375
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,958
What did you mean
when you told me

376
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,250
to come over to your place...?

377
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,291
I mean, I don't
think I had told you

378
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,500
about Eden of the
East yet, right?

379
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,250
You wanna know?

380
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,583
You needed a
change of clothes...

381
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,333
I think you'd look
really pretty in yellow.

382
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,083
Look at Micchon.

383
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,666
I can't believe how quickly
she's warmed up to him.

384
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,333
It's not like her.

385
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,125
I can't tell if
they're playing together

386
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,125
or if he's just
messing with her head.

387
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,666
You really have to pack
it in there firmly,

388
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,666
otherwise it'll
just topple over...

389
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,958
See, Mittan?

390
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,208
It's hard for me,
I'm not as strong as you...

391
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,291
And my name's not Mittan.

392
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,375
Hey...! Come on out,
we're ready for ya!

393
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
What've you guys been up to?!

394
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,875
Okay, it's show time!

395
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,166
I didn't know you were
such a scaredy-cat, Mittan!

396
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,791
Micchon... not Mittan.

397
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,000
Hello...? Oh, hey Kasuga...

398
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
Have any luck finding Osugi?

399
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,500
Uh... yes... and no...

400
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,625
if that makes sense.

401
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,333
No, it doesn't. What's up?

402
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,125
Well... The thing
is it's possible...

403
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,958
that Osugi's been abducted by
that psycho, Johnny Hunter.

404
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
<i>The</i> Johnny Hunter?

405
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,541
The one and only.

406
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,958
I was doing some
digging around online...

407
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,500
and I happened across a series

408
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,000
of disturbing posts
on a message board.

409
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,833
And why were you
looking for him online?

410
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,375
That's not important.

411
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,833
This guy is claiming
to have been imprisoned

412
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,083
in a hotel room by
a suspicious woman,

413
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,750
and he keeps posting
picture messages

414
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,083
and begging for help.

415
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,125
He's been doing this for
the past eighteen hours.

416
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,291
From what I can tell,

417
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,875
the police haven't
gotten involved yet...

418
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,208
but it is causing
quite a stir online...

419
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,416
I've looked over these
posts hundreds of times,

420
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,208
Hirasawa, and I'm
convinced it's Osugi.

421
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,416
Send me the URL for
the message board.

422
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,000
Will do.

423
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,333
I also found some
unofficial estimates

424
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,208
that put the number of
Johnny Hunter victims

425
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,375
at twenty thousand,
so the idea that Osugi

426
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,083
is next in line is
not out of the question.

427
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,250
Understood.
