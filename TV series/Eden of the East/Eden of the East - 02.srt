1
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have begun our descent

2
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,875
into Tokyo's Haneda
International Airport.

3
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,333
Please move your seatbacks into
their full and upright...

4
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,750
Did I wake you...?

5
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,791
Good morning... Look...

6
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,208
Remember the missile attack
we saw on TV at the airport?

7
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,041
That must be where it happened.

8
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,375
Yeah, must be.

9
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,708
Looks like...

10
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,541
there's a bunch of spots just
like it that aren't on fire...

11
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,666
You think they're from
missile attacks, too?

12
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,125
Oh yeah... They sure are.

13
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,416
Really?

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,416
See those two
craters right there?

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,250
They're what's left over from
the Careless Monday attacks.

16
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,833
Careless... Monday?

17
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,166
Due to the recent attacks,

18
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,291
security checkpoints at
customs and immigration

19
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,166
are at high alert, making
for longer wait times.

20
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,541
Come to think of it...
Today's Monday.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,083
Every text is from Osugi...

22
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,333
It's already three o'clock.

23
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:38,375
There's no way I can
make that interview now.

24
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,625
They're saying a plane
was shot down by a missile.

25
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,541
By some miracle,

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,250
a six-year-old boy and girl
survived, but everyone else...

27
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,500
No way!

28
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,125
One of those missiles
actually killed people!

29
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,375
Yeah.

30
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,500
I can't believe this.
Last time nobody died...

31
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,833
Huh?

32
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,541
That explains why the
airport is so crazy today.

33
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,458
Wait. Say that again.

34
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,333
You said no one died last time?

35
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,458
Yeah, on Careless Monday
there wasn't a single casualty.

36
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,625
Why not?

37
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,500
What do you mean, "Why not"?

38
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,166
Hey. What's up?

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,250
Ah! Saki! Finally!

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,208
Are you inside the terminal?

41
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,083
Sounds like her
flight landed on time.

42
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,625
Mm-hm.

43
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,416
Yeah, we're all
hanging in there...

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,125
And your sister's place didn't
get any damage, either...

45
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,333
Yeah.

46
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,791
So, uh, today's your
final interview, right?

47
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,416
We're here in the car
waiting to pick you up...

48
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,333
Uh-huh...

49
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,416
That's right.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,166
Osugi, you do
realize in this traffic

51
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,875
there's no way we
can make it in time.

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,625
Shh! No, it's fine.

53
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,958
Uh, just stay where you are.

54
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,375
We'll be right there.

55
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,791
Saki...? The call dropped.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,333
Must be because of the missiles.

57
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,750
I doubt it.

58
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,208
Does anyone else have
something they'd like to add?

59
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,791
You know the two of you
seem to be getting close.

60
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,791
Did you guys bond
during your trip

61
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,291
to America or something?

62
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh crap, the car's
completely full.

63
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,708
Where's Saki gonna sit?!

64
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,083
Boyfriend?

65
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,208
Sounds like your
phone's ringing.

66
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,416
Hello?

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,666
This is Juiz.

68
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,583
Hey.

69
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,125
Number Nine, you have entered

70
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,041
the operating range
of the Seleção System...

71
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,666
Please resume fulfilling
your obligations

72
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,500
as one of the
"haves" immediately.

73
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,583
One of the "haves"...?

74
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,875
I don't--
Juiz, what do you mean?

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,625
Juiz...? Uh, hi there...

76
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,916
Uh, this is
Saki Morimi calling...

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
Can you connect me to
Yamada in Human Resources?

78
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,208
Listen, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

79
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,458
If you know why
I wiped my memory

80
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,833
could you do me the
favor of filling me in?

81
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,166
I don't know why.

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,541
I merely acquired the
means for you to do so...

83
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,083
If you have any further
questions or requests,

84
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,125
don't hesitate to
contact me at any time...

85
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:06,333
Your remaining balance
is 8,262,307,719 yen.

86
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,291
Eight point two billion?!

87
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,458
It is your duty to
spend it all during

88
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,791
the course of your mission.

89
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,208
Hold on... I <i>have</i> to spend it?

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,875
That's correct...

91
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
I am your concierge
and I will strive

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,583
to serve you to the
best of my ability.

93
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,791
Or in other words,
I can request anything I want

94
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,250
and you'll make it
happen no questions asked.

95
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,250
Yes. That is correct.

96
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,958
'Kay then...

97
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,541
I'm stuck here at the
airport and it's a madhouse.

98
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,708
I want to get out of here ASAP.

99
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,416
What can you do for me?

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,708
Order accepted...

101
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,041
Noblesse oblige...

102
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,166
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

103
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,333
So I'm Number Nine then.

104
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,666
Watch out people, move aside!

105
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,291
Clear a path.

106
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
What's this?

107
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,083
APB on a twenty-four
year old male,

108
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,083
unemployed, suspected
of being involved

109
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,750
in the disappearance
of the NEET's.

110
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,208
He is wanted for questioning.

111
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,041
Right.

112
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,208
"No Employment,
Education, or Training."...

113
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,791
Good riddance, I say.
Perfect, now what?

114
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,833
Number Nine...? What the hell?

115
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,875
That's a bribe, clear as day...

116
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,166
And a pack of gum too?

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,666
This guy's getting careless...

118
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,875
Wait a second.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,583
Thank you. Have a wonderful day.

120
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,791
Ah, so I can buy
anything with this phone.

121
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,000
Thanks everyone!

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,416
I've never been so
embarrassed in my life...!

123
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,958
I guess they must
have you mixed up

124
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,291
with someone else...

125
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,916
Unless you are a celebrity...!
You're not, right?

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,791
I don't know.

127
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,375
Hey, Takizawa...

128
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,083
I was wondering if
you had plans later.

129
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,416
No.

130
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,750
Well I was supposed to meet

131
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,041
with someone today but
that's not gonna happen...

132
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,916
so I have the afternoon off...

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,666
We could get a cup of tea...

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,375
I mean if you're up to it.

135
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,916
So, uh...

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,833
this is gonna sound weird but...

137
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,541
See I have a confession to make.

138
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,833
I have what you
would call amnesia.

139
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,708
Whatever happened to me

140
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,916
before the White House
is a total mystery...

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,708
I don't know my name,
what I've been doing,

142
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:51,375
where I've been,
or how I got to DC.

143
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
So... it might be
best if I found out

144
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,083
some answers about myself first.

145
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,416
I think I'll start
by going to the address

146
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,541
that's listed on my passport...

147
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,166
So I guess... this
is goodbye then...

148
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
Bye!

149
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,625
Here I was thinking Number Nine

150
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,500
was dead this whole time...

151
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,833
Of course, it's very
possible someone

152
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,208
just picked up his phone.

153
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,791
Though I can't see
some random person

154
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,916
off the street knowing
how to use it.

155
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,041
No fair.

156
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,458
I really believed the two
of us were hitting it off.

157
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,083
My face...

158
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,583
Maybe I just
didn't smile enough.

159
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,666
I thought your
smile was perfect!

160
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,958
Hey!

161
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,458
What the...?!
You can't come in here!

162
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,583
I just... need some
directions, that's all.

163
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,291
Looks like Number Nine

164
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,875
just waltzed
into the monorail...

165
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,291
I think it's time to get
a look at this guy's face.

166
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,708
What is it?

167
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,833
I just found the address
listed in your passport...

168
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,416
It's right where a missile
hit on Careless Monday.

169
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,208
I'm pretty sure that
whole area is destroyed.

170
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,291
Doesn't sound like my house

171
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,416
has much of a
chance of being there.

172
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,541
So tell me about
these missile craters...

173
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,250
How many are there, anyway...?

174
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,458
Does anyone know why we were

175
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,166
attacked in the first place?

176
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,291
I think there were
eleven missiles total,

177
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,666
counting yesterday's...

178
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,625
No one knows why it happened...

179
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,916
but out of the blue, on Monday,
November 22 of last year...

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,041
the missiles came flying.

181
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,125
The military and politicians
were blindsided...

182
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,833
no one ever dreamed
Japan would be

183
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,625
the victim of a
surprise attack like this.

184
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,208
The following night,
the Prime Minister

185
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,291
went on live television
and said "I was careless."

186
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,958
So that's why they
call it Careless Monday?

187
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,583
Yeah... And...

188
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,041
afterwards, when the news broke

189
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,791
that somehow there were no
fatalities in the attacks...

190
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,000
the Internet and the
media went into a frenzy

191
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,541
trying to figure out
who was behind it.

192
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,375
There were all sorts
of crazy theories,

193
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,375
like it being an
American conspiracy

194
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,291
or the one about our own
government having a hand in it.

195
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,250
But after a while...

196
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,125
when no answers came, people
stopped asking questions...

197
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,583
Everyone went back
to life as usual...

198
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,833
It seems stupid now, but
a lot of us were actually...

199
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,791
anxious when it happened--

200
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,791
like it was a sign something
bigger was coming...

201
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,958
Next stop... Tennoz Isle.

202
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,250
Where'd you go, Number Nine?

203
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,166
I was right.

204
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,458
Dammit...
He should still be here!

205
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,583
Lost him.

206
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,125
Hey.

207
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,958
You and I have the
same exact phone.

208
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,000
Let me ask you something.

209
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,916
Did you lose your memory, too?

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,916
Huh...? Excuse me?

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Sorry--thought you
were someone else...

212
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,083
Your phone just happened to
catch my eye, that's all...

213
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,333
Take care now.

214
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,000
Hey wait, not so fast, kid...

215
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,500
Are you a Seleção?

216
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,625
Seleção?

217
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,208
I'm with the police.

218
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm sure you've probably
noticed the tight security...

219
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,166
I'd like to see
your identification.

220
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,708
Sure, no problem.

221
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,458
Akira Takizawa.
Says here you live in Toyosu.

222
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,625
Well then...

223
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,875
If I see you acting
suspicious again

224
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,666
I'll haul your
ass in, you got it?

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,291
I'll try to be more
careful... Thanks, Officer!

226
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,083
So that's Seleção Number Nine.

227
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
This is not good.

228
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,416
You can head back
once the boat gets here.

229
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
I'll be fine on my own.

230
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,625
Here's your coffee...
And your change.

231
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,916
Seven-hundred-sixty yen.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,041
Thanks... You can
keep the change...

233
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,041
You don't have any cash, right?

234
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,125
Yeah! Right! Thanks!

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,625
I hope your house is...
still in one piece.

236
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,541
Yeah, me too.

237
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,916
But if it's not, I'm sure
I'll figure something out.

238
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,083
Since I don't have
anything useful to say...

239
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,041
why don't you tell me a
little bit about yourself?

240
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,583
About myself?

241
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,875
We may as well
talk about something

242
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,750
until the boat gets here, right?

243
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,958
I'm a... senior in college...

244
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,041
and I, uh...

245
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,333
I hope to find a
job sometime in April.

246
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,208
Hey, that sounds
exciting... Where at?

247
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,375
At the company

248
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,083
that my brother-in-law
used to work for.

249
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,791
So you have an older sister?

250
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,208
Well, uh...

251
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,458
It'll come up sooner or later,
so I'll just tell you...

252
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,625
My parents...

253
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,125
There was an accident and...

254
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,458
And they died...

255
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,041
My sister had just gotten
married when it happened...

256
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,458
I thought I'd have
to drop out of college

257
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,166
and start working, but...

258
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,291
she and her husband ended up

259
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,291
taking over the
family business...

260
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,041
so I could finish college.

261
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,083
She sounds really nice.

262
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,666
So is Ryosuke...

263
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,875
He's my amazing
brother-in-law...

264
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,791
They had a baby last year
and now the four of us...

265
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,208
all live together.

266
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,125
So, what's this
Ryosuke guy like?

267
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,333
You're putting too
much pressure on me!

268
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,375
Ryosuke's probably the
most sincere person I know.

269
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,958
They've been a couple since
my sister was in college...

270
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,000
I remember the first
time I saw them together.

271
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,666
I knew they'd get married.

272
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,958
He sounds cool.

273
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,125
I guess so...

274
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,416
He's definitely
compatible with my sister.

275
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,041
That's good...
You have a nice family.

276
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,208
Yeah, but my life
is far from perfect...

277
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,416
I feel guilty for being
such a... burden on them.

278
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,625
I see.

279
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,041
Guess what?

280
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,083
I think listening to you
just now triggered one

281
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,750
of my memories
to come back... Huh.

282
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,083
 Really?

283
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,041
I was five, and some lady
at a department store

284
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,875
gave me five hundred yen...

285
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,583
She said I could use the money

286
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,750
to buy whatever I wanted to...

287
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,625
When I hesitated about
doing it alone she told me...

288
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,541
"There's no reason
to worry... Remember...

289
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,916
If you have money
in your pocket,

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,458
a little kid isn't any
different than an adult."

291
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,333
I can't recall what it
was I bought that day,

292
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,416
but I still have an
image in my head...

293
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
the cashier bowing to
me when I paid him,

294
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,958
which I thought was
the coolest thing ever.

295
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,583
I felt like the happiest
kid in the world...

296
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,791
I can remember turning around

297
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,458
to tell my Mom that
she was right when I...

298
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,541
Of course, my mom was the lady!

299
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,625
Anyway...

300
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,916
When I turned around
to tell my mom,

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
she had disappeared...

302
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,916
I think that was the
last time I ever saw her.

303
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,958
Oh, no.

304
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,208
Well, at least
I remember having a mother,

305
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,916
so that's a good sign.

306
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,208
So long.

307
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,416
Wait, I...

308
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,750
I don't even know how
to get in touch with you.

309
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,125
I'll take another double.

310
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,166
Monorail... Plum gum...

311
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,333
A bribe at immigration.

312
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:51,833
He got his brain nuked at the
Harima Neuroscience Institute.

313
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,958
That's strange...

314
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,083
Seems like he went
to a lot of trouble

315
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,625
to try and erase his memory.

316
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,125
Wonder why...

317
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,083
And then there's activity at
a shopping mall in Toyosu...

318
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,208
I don't get it.

319
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,625
What does any of this have to do

320
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,750
with serving the country...?

321
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,875
Well... I did find someone who's
worse at their job than me.

322
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,916
I see you're in a
good mood for once.

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,416
Oh, I am.

324
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,375
It looks like luck is finally
startin' to swing my way.

325
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,583
That's exciting news,
Mister Kondo...

326
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,791
Maybe now you can...

327
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,666
pay back the
twenty-million you owe me.

328
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,000
Of course if you can find a way

329
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,125
to misplace a certain
piece of evidence...

330
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll be able to look past this.

331
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,416
Yeah... the airport was crazy.

332
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,583
It took forever to get anywhere.

333
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,791
Tomorrow I'll explain
everything, okay...?

334
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:39,666
I'm gonna stay at
Micchon's tonight. Sorry.

335
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,916
So... You mentioned going
to New York before, right?

336
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,416
Did you walk down Fifth Avenue?

337
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,166
I went to Tiffany's...

338
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,125
but I didn't buy anything.

339
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,541
Here's a picture I
took of Times Square.

340
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,416
I went to the
Lion King that night.

341
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,083
Did you go anywhere else cool?

342
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,041
Sure, I went to Central Park...

343
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,583
and the Statue of Liberty...

344
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,583
and I walked across
the Brooklyn Bridge.

345
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,125
That's the, uh,
gothic one right?

346
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,041
Yeah...! How did you know that?

347
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,333
I'm a bit of a film junkie.

348
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,916
Right, this is the bridge

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,166
with the time portal
in that Meg Ryan movie.

350
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,333
Is it...?

351
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,750
Sorry I don't watch
a lot of movies.

352
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh...

353
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,708
Well, what do you know--

354
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,375
I thought all the girls
had seen that one...

355
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,166
It's kinda crazy how vivid my
memory is for movies and yet...

356
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,500
Well do you remember
any others...?

357
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,708
You never know,
it could trigger something...

358
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,583
What's your favorite
movie of all time?

359
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,416
Uh... It's weird,
I remember dozens of 'em,

360
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,083
except for my favorite.

361
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,750
Oh well.

362
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,041
Hey... What's this?

363
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,541
That's a pic of
the Freedom Tower.

364
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,125
The Freedom Tower?

365
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,375
Yeah.

366
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,125
You know, the new building
they're putting up

367
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,500
at Ground Zero.

368
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,583
As in Nine-Eleven...? Okay...

369
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,041
I don't think they've put
this one into a movie yet.

370
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,125
It was strange to see...

371
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,375
It'll be pretty
once it's done...

372
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,458
I wanted to make a special
trip to see Ground Zero...

373
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,333
but it really
doesn't look anything

374
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,458
like it did ten years ago.

375
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,666
I think it's...

376
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,041
important to never
forget what happened.

377
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,541
I feel it's the least I can do.

378
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,000
Hey, come here.

379
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,416
Look. Ground Zero.

380
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,791
Think you could...
send this to me?

381
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,750
Sure.

382
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,750
I don't know how to...

383
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,208
Here, show me.

384
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,625
It's easy... See?

385
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,708
Mister Kondo, if we keep
having to go down this road...

386
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,791
You'll leave me no choice
but to visit your workplace,

387
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,875
which none of us want.

388
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Whatever... Juiz...
Kill these assholes.

389
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,916
Understood. Noblesse oblige.

390
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,875
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

391
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,208
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,041
Trying to be funny?

393
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,041
Today is the first day
of my new life.

394
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,416
Sounds like someone's
getting delusional.

395
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,708
Bang.

396
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,750
Bang.

397
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,958
Yeah, this one too, Juiz.
Sorry, pal.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,250
Bang.

399
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,458
Seems like a cop just can't do

400
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,416
the right thing these days,
even if he wants to...

401
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,291
Well, whatever...

402
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,541
Thank you, Number Nine...

403
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,375
I'm sure I'll make
a better go of things

404
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,416
once I've got your life...
