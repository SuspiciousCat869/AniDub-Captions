1
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,583
It's unreal.

2
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,416
I'm the one
they've been praising.

3
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,791
The one they call
the Whiz Kid of Kyoto.

4
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,625
Hey! My pants!

5
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,000
That was my only pair.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Farewell... pants.

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,291
I really should be
thanking you, though...

8
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,708
I'll never have to leave
my apartment again.

9
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,416
Unbelievable!

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,708
The Carp have announced
a blockbuster trade with...

11
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,541
a team from the
US Major Leagues!

12
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,666
I asked you to have the
Carp win the entire series...

13
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,000
There's no guarantee
they'll win with this.

14
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,458
Gimme a break...!

15
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,416
It's not exactly something
I can accomplish overnight.

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,666
Okay, I have to hand it to ya.

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,166
That trade just
upped their chances

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,500
of winning to 99.98 percent.

19
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,916
Huh...?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,875
Oh is that the World Computer
you've been working on?

21
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,458
Uh, no!

22
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,208
Hey, wait a second,
how do you know about that?

23
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,166
I don't get it...

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,083
How can you force a major
league team into a trade

25
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,333
just by calling up some
dumb-sounding operator lady?

26
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,375
Fingerprint verification?

27
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,666
So you think by
hacking into this phone

28
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
we'll be able to
read the activity logs

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,541
of all the other Seleção, right?

30
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,916
I think so... yeah.

31
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,000
Follow me in here...
Vintage Boy.

32
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,041
Amazing... Well done.

33
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,375
Welcome to my secret bunker.

34
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,500
This is Mononobe.
I just arrived.

35
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,625
Great. Why don't you
meet me downstairs...

36
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,333
I'm in the lot...

37
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,083
Parked in a green station wagon.

38
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,708
I never would have
imagined you'd come

39
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,333
to Kyoto as well, since
you said it yourself...

40
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,791
Number Nine is
not the Supporter...

41
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,583
The thing is,
Nine's in his own world.

42
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,750
He's way too difficult
to deal with.

43
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,750
I'm not gonna let him
stand in my way again.

44
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,541
If you study his activity logs

45
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,375
you'll see moves that would
suggest he's the Supporter,

46
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,250
but if you compare them
to yours, the man who tried

47
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,125
to blast Japan back
into the stone-age,

48
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,041
he's as passive as a kitten.

49
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,833
Heh, you flatter me...

50
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,791
So,... how should we
go about finding him?

51
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,375
Well I...

52
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,666
figure a good place to start is
calling all the taxi companies.

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,916
That's so like you, Mononobe...

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,083
And yet, life is
unpredictable, is it not...?

55
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,125
For instance,
I'm now working closely

56
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,458
with the very bureaucrat
I used to despise.

57
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,500
Oh pardon me...

58
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,791
I meant the former bureaucrat.

59
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,083
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

60
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,666
Noblesse oblige...

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,916
The obligation
of the privileged.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,625
I gotta say, the Seleção
are a lot different

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,750
from the oppressive organization
I had imagined them to be...

64
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,666
I figured they were more of
an American-styled corporation

65
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,625
trying to shape the
will of the public

66
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,166
under the guise of
national interests.

67
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,208
What do you mean...

68
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,125
by "shape the
will of the public?"

69
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,000
Hm? Like uh...

70
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,000
For instance, the Red Scare
during the Cold War...

71
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,250
or better yet, the dozens of
outlandish conspiracy theories

72
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,791
that were making the rounds
in the months following 9/11.

73
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,791
You see that kind of paranoia

74
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,583
whenever the power of
the state begins to wane.

75
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,000
Just look around.

76
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,708
We've got plenty of that
goin' on right here in Japan.

77
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,500
Of course, whoever it
is that's spearheading

78
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,041
this particular conspiracy...

79
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,875
may not even be aware of the
broader implications himself.

80
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,375
You're pretty clever there,
aren't ya, Panties...?

81
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:39,041
So what got you interested
in researching the Seleção?

82
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,500
Well it first piqued
my interest when...

83
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,916
I ran across some forums
for conspiracy nuts

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,833
that were arguing over the
Careless Monday attacks.

85
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,708
But more than anything,
I was looking to take

86
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,291
some kind of revenge for
the twenty-thousand NEETs

87
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,000
who went missing.

88
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,125
This thing's loaded with data!

89
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,291
Osugi sounded really upset.

90
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,791
I wonder what he found there.

91
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,833
Well he did call out
Takky as being a criminal.

92
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,250
Judging from all the posts

93
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,916
people have been
leaving on Eden...

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,583
it looks like he uses a
number of different aliases.

95
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,291
Sis... ask Micchon what
Takizawa's doing right now...

96
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,916
Since we don't know what's
going on yet... be discreet.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,416
Whatever you say.

98
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah?

99
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,791
Micchon, hey, it's me...

100
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,375
Is Takky there with you?

101
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,875
No, not right now... What's up?

102
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,041
Oh nothing.

103
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,083
Just wondering what
you guys are up to.

104
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,541
He's back at Panties' apartment.

105
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,416
He's probably still trying
to get him to open the door.

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,250
Saki and I went out
to do a little shopping.

107
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,458
Oh, okay... Sounds good...

108
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,458
Give me a call back
if anything happens.

109
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,041
That was weird...

110
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,125
I wonder what Sis wanted.

111
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,500
Is this it?

112
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,875
What's that?

113
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,041
February 12th...

114
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,041
That's the day I was
at the White House.

115
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,541
Like I told you...

116
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,916
I woke up standing there naked
with a pistol and a phone.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,291
Harima Neuroscience
Institute...?

118
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:25,041
Maybe they're the ones you
used to erase your memory.

119
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,875
Charter two large,
full container ships...

120
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,791
Five hundred containers
for sea transport.

121
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,833
So that's what Doctor Hiura
was talking about.

122
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,500
I see what's going on here.

123
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,250
You loaded up the
twenty-thousands NEETs

124
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,041
on those ships, didn't you...?

125
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,916
As if you were exporting cattle.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,958
Can you find out where
the containers went?

127
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,375
Dubai...

128
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,208
Huh, looks like before
the NEETs disappeared,

129
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,250
you approached the Foreign
Office about something...

130
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,250
And then there's
all this food...

131
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,625
It seems you planned...

132
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,375
to keep them out of sight
for a couple of weeks.

133
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,375
So according to this at least,

134
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,625
I didn't commit mass murder...

135
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,416
Guess not... Let's see...

136
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,875
Here's the date
for Careless Monday.

137
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,583
What is this?

138
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,208
I'm not entirely sure...

139
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,541
but it looks like these
are all strange incidents

140
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,375
that happened near the eventual
site of the missile attacks.

141
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,458
So...

142
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,041
Do you know why so
many people believe

143
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,958
there's a conspiracy
behind Careless Monday...?

144
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,416
It has to do with all
the rumors that surfaced...

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,041
Numerous coincidences that
happened in six major cities

146
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,083
in the days
preceding the attacks.

147
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,375
It started with a bunch
of unexploded shells

148
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,541
from World War Two
that were unearthed,

149
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,875
and then the earthquake warning
system malfunctioned,

150
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,041
causing an evacuation
order to be issued,

151
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,291
which is why there were no
victims when the missiles hit.

152
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,291
After the relief faded from
the minds of the people

153
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,041
who were saved,
they started to question

154
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,041
the events leading up
to the attacks.

155
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,291
The media picked up on the story
and blew it out of proportion,

156
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,625
but at the time, the
public were too concerned

157
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,416
with the government's
lack of response

158
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,916
in regard to the attacks.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
So, after a few days, the story
faded away into obscurity,

160
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,500
like it was old news.

161
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,458
Can you pull up the logs
from the other Seleção?

162
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,583
Uh... sure.

163
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,666
Whoa... look.

164
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,500
Bomb Japan's six major cities?

165
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,291
This is proof that you did
not launch those missiles.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,041
Panties! We brought
your magazines!

167
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,750
This stays between you and me.

168
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,583
Absolutely.

169
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,500
Huh...

170
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,708
Looks like Takky was able
to talk his way inside.

171
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,333
Itazu! What happened to you?

172
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,416
What's wrong?

173
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,291
You've put on a few pounds!

174
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,583
Oh, stop...
You're making me blush.

175
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,791
Oh, right...

176
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,083
I'm guessing that's
'cause you haven't seen

177
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,208
a real live girl in a while...

178
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,916
Here: "Come on in,
ladies. Have a seat!"

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,291
Hands off the merchandise...!

180
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,166
You're crampin' my style, man!

181
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,208
Great, they're best buddies now.

182
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,375
Here're the magazines
you asked for.

183
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,291
Oh, uh, thank you!

184
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,000
Got some info...

185
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,458
The person living there
is an engineering student

186
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,041
by the name of Yutaka Itazu.

187
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,833
A student.
So he's not a Seleção?

188
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,916
I reviewed all the logs again...

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,041
and the only Seleção
I could find

190
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,625
that's based out
of Kyoto is you.

191
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,333
Then what the hell is
Number Nine doing here?

192
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,250
Based on his actions
recently, my best guess

193
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,833
is he somehow got a hold of
Number Four's noblesse phone...

194
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,583
He's probably trying to
hack it so that he can read

195
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,666
the logs he deleted off
his own phone

196
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,500
before going through the
process of wiping his memory...

197
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,125
I can't see any other reason

198
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,750
why he would be visiting
an engineering student.

199
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,875
So... you weren't able to find

200
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,250
even one single phone
number or address?

201
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,500
Nope, we struck out.

202
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,541
That's just great...

203
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,708
We came all the way
out here for nothing.

204
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,708
There was never any data on
the phone in the first place...

205
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,833
If it had been used just
once a hacker of my skill

206
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,041
would've been able to restore
everything in mere seconds.

207
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,416
Oh well...

208
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
Did you at least find
out where it came from?

209
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,041
Beats me...

210
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,833
It's probably a manufacturer's
high-end prototype

211
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,750
that was never produced
for market... or not.

212
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,083
The best I can do is guess.

213
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,166
I'm a shut-in, I haven't
left this place in years.

214
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,083
I'm not up to date
on the latest tech.

215
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,791
Mm-hm. Well...

216
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,458
We should hit the road...

217
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,750
I think we can still catch
the bullet train, right?

218
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,333
Yeah. You should be fine.

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,125
Hey, listen...

220
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,166
Can you make it so that phone
receives new logs again?

221
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,125
Well, it's powered on
so if I can get around

222
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,541
the fingerprint recognition
we should be good.

223
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,875
Awesome...

224
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,083
Then I'll just leave
it here with you for now...

225
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,875
Start by analyzing
the old activity logs.

226
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,500
When this game is over...

227
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,083
I wanna be the one
to come out on top.

228
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,375
Well... if everyone
playing the game

229
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,625
who doesn't win gets
killed in the end...

230
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,625
I don't see what
other choice you have.

231
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,083
Yeah, that's a good point...

232
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,791
but more than that, I just
wanna feel the satisfaction

233
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,000
of punching Mister Outside
right in the jaw!

234
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,708
You know what I mean...?

235
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,708
While he's exploiting our lives
and telling us to save Japan,

236
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,208
he's out living the
life somewhere

237
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,666
else safe from danger...!

238
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,416
I won't be content until
I can see his old wrinkled face

239
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,583
right after I've
knocked his lights out!

240
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,625
But you don't really
know if he's old or not.

241
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,333
Only a guy towards
the end of his life

242
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,083
who's accomplished
everything would come up

243
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,000
with such a ridiculous scheme...

244
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,916
"Noblesse Oblige,"
my ass...! Itazu...

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,250
You said you wanted to avenge

246
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,375
all those NEETs who
disappeared, am I right...?

247
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,666
Well I feel the
same way as you do...

248
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,625
Becoming a full-on
NEET is essentially

249
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,583
a voluntary act of terrorism...

250
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,083
to fight back at the oppressors
just like Mister Outside,

251
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,541
is it not?

252
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,958
I'm just a hermit.

253
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,166
I wasn't gonna do
anything that crazy.

254
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,166
Sounds interesting.

255
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,416
In a way it's the ultimate
in social reform...

256
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,958
I'm with you on
this one, Vintage.

257
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,000
Gimme your email address...

258
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,458
and I'll be in touch soon.

259
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,708
I'm sorry... Are you ready?

260
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,041
Uh... I am.

261
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,750
I just need to give Itazu
a present real quick.

262
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,958
Itazu... You got a sec?

263
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,708
I bought you an outfit...

264
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,791
It may be a little small,
but I figured you could use it.

265
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:16,083
Oh, that's cool. Thanks.

266
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,125
I know there's a secret...

267
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,333
with that phone Takizawa's
been carrying around.

268
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:31,333
It's not a normal
phone at all, is it?

269
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,041
I'm sorry, but...

270
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,541
I can't say anything about it.

271
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,541
What's goin' on up there?!

272
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,000
Nothing's going on!

273
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,000
You'll be better off
if you know nothing.

274
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,500
Well look who it is.
Number Nine.

275
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,625
What should we do?

276
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,750
There'll be plenty of time
to deal with him later...

277
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,833
For now...

278
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,541
Maybe I'll have better luck
seeing the activity logs

279
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,500
if I try to access it using
one of my own applications.

280
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,458
Yes! I am... brilliant!

281
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,083
Vintage boy ended up being
a pretty interesting guy,

282
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,791
even though I thought
he was a poseur at first.

283
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,541
Not only did he
have nothing to do

284
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,500
with launching those
missiles, he used Juiz

285
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,791
to evacuate everyone
from the landing sites!

286
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:59,583
Don't worry, man! You're
anything but a criminal.

287
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,875
You're a national freaking hero!

288
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,666
Oh, right!

289
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,166
Someone was messing around
with the naval systems.

290
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,750
What were they trying to
gain by hacking into the...

291
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,500
Oh, I get it.

292
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,791
They simulated an invasion
by faking out the radar...

293
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:24,125
which then prompted automatic
defense measures...

294
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,125
That's nuts...!

295
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,541
I don't know who
you are, Juiz,...

296
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,541
but I know enough
not to mess with you.

297
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,875
The day the PM
said "uncle" on TV,

298
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,291
she fed the Opposition member
who was questioning him

299
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,375
with real intel, but somehow
found a way to alter the source

300
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,416
to make it look like an
email from his former lover...

301
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,166
Which means... whoever
made this phone has

302
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,375
tight connections with the
upper echelons of government!

303
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,375
What the?!

304
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,833
Damn... This is bad...

305
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,541
I gotta tell him about it!

306
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,458
Aw, crap! It's outta juice!

307
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,041
I forgot to charge it again!

308
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,875
No! I said "email"
not "phone number"!

309
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,958
Seriously?

310
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,583
Maybe...

311
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,125
We should have Juiz do
something in the meantime.

312
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,958
I knew it.

313
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,250
Were you able to
hack this phone?

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,958
Did you look at the logs,
the data, anything?

315
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,750
Why did you make me do that...?

316
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,916
If this guy...

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,666
if he dies, that'll
make me a murderer!

318
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,000
You're responsible for launching
missiles at your own country...

319
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,458
and you intend to kill
millions by doing it again...

320
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,208
The fate of one individual
shouldn't give you pause.

321
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,666
The email client
is working again...

322
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,041
Hey, you; did you fix it?

323
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,583
Ah, so... you're Seleção, huh?

324
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,583
Oh well...

325
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,083
So... You talked
to Number Nine...

326
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,208
Did he say anything
about what his plans are?

327
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,333
He's going...

328
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,708
to... beat up Mister Outside.

329
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,958
Oh?

330
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,875
You... fired the missiles.

331
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:27,000
You guys think you're
heroes... but you're not.

332
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,291
The real hero here is...

333
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,333
Yuki... Contact Juiz.

334
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,208
Have her dispose of the car.

335
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,208
Hello?

336
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,375
Is this Number Nine?

337
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,458
Maybe... Who's this?

338
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,666
Wow... What was
this place used for?

339
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,166
Hirasawa!

340
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,833
Did you look at
the posts on Eden?

341
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,625
Yeah.

342
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,000
You need to see this.
