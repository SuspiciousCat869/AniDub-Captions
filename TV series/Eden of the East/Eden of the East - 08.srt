1
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:47,833
Johnny!!!

2
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,375
Johnny!!

3
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,291
Takizawa...! Are you okay?

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,875
Saki. Where's Osugi?
Is he alright?!

5
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,041
Lay back down. Osugi is fine...

6
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,875
Actually, it turns out we had
mistaken him for someone else.

7
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,458
But he's back now and safe,
so there's no need to worry.

8
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,875
Oh... I guess...

9
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,791
I must've passed
out back there...

10
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,750
Saki, when you
got to the hotel...

11
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,166
Was there anyone
else there with me?

12
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,375
No.

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,458
Tell me this.

14
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,541
Why do you think I'd go home

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,125
with someone like
the Johnny Hunter?

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,375
You know me better than that.

17
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,875
I'm sorry...

18
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,458
It's just that all the
messages were being posted

19
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,166
on that lonely singles
forum I see you on every day.

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,083
Idiot!

21
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,291
I thought we discussed this.

22
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,333
No one's supposed to
know I use that site.

23
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,833
If you wanna talk about love,

24
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,583
my ears are open anytime, honey.

25
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,000
No, that's enough.

26
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,791
Let's--Let's just drop it, okay?

27
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,500
I know you're angry, Osugi,

28
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,750
but Kasuga's observations
can't be passed off

29
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,333
as a mistake so easily.

30
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,166
We couldn't reach
you on your phone,

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,375
and we saw pictures of your bag.

32
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,916
Based on that, anyone
would have thought

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,250
it was you calling for help.

34
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,708
Okay, now this is the bag
that got stolen from me,

35
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,875
I'll give you that...

36
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,166
still, you twisted
freaks couldn't come up

37
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,750
with a single
rational explanation

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,500
for why I might
have my phone off?

39
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,666
Really?!

40
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,916
Like maybe some of
the guys at my new job

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,458
dragged me out to the bar
and got me wasted,

42
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,041
y'know, like initiation...

43
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,666
And they took your phone away

44
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,750
while they poured shots
down your throat...

45
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,958
I've been there...

46
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
What's important
is you're okay...

47
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,958
and the fact that you didn't
get your Johnny chopped off.

48
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:41,875
Hey, shut up!

49
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,291
So to recap...

50
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,375
after you left the dinner
you had with Kasuga,

51
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,166
somebody made off
with your bag...

52
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,541
Then that same somebody happened

53
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,166
to encounter the
Johnny Hunter...

54
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,583
and began posting on a
message board you frequent...

55
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,791
while being held against
his will at Hotel Insomnia...

56
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,041
That sound about right?

57
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,166
Don't forget...

58
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,250
"Then Takky busted
open the door".

59
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,583
And by that time,

60
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,875
the Johnny Hunter had
already fled the scene...

61
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,833
All he found were traces that
someone had been held

62
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,458
in the room previously.

63
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,833
I feel like there's
something I need to ask.

64
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,125
What will our relationship
with Takizawa be

65
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,208
from this point forward?

66
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,583
I need to get going.

67
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,333
I don't wanna be late for work.

68
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,500
Once I'm done for the day...

69
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,625
I'm gonna meet up with Saki...

70
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,541
And if the four of you
are truly serious

71
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,083
about teaming up with
this Takizawa guy...

72
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,375
then I'm sorry, but...

73
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,083
this will probably
be the last time

74
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,041
the original members all sit
in the same room together.

75
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,458
Wait - How come?

76
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:49,500
Even I have pride,
and I intend to keep it.

77
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,791
Hey! Osugi, wait!

78
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,458
Well... what'll we do now?

79
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,041
I don't think Takky's
a bad guy, but...

80
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,125
Even though he seems to
have the best of intentions...

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,708
there are still a lot of
mysteries surrounding him,

82
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,416
like how he found
the hotel so quickly

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,000
and his ability to slip out
of there undetected...

84
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,583
One thing that's for certain is

85
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,458
that he's not
your ordinary NEET.

86
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,833
I think our best option is...

87
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,208
Lay everything on the table
and be straightforward

88
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,291
with any questions
we have for him.

89
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,458
He should be here... any minute.

90
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,041
Oh, did Saki send you a text?

91
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,166
When was that?

92
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,041
A few minutes before
Osugi got here...

93
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,125
Uh-huh, says
they're on their way.

94
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,708
I don't know...

95
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,625
Should we have let
Osugi leave like that?

96
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,958
Am I the only one...

97
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,208
who was left in
the dark on this?

98
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,625
That jerk. Who are you really?!

99
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,666
What's up with him?

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,375
He's a creep.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,375
He isn't registered with Eden?

102
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,208
She stopped the police
from getting involved?

103
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,708
Am I the only one

104
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,500
who doesn't know about
the other Seleção...?

105
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,375
I'll have to find a way to
read the older activity logs.

106
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,833
Do you understand the situation
we're having with Osugi?

107
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,541
Uh... Yeah.

108
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,791
Okay, that's good... So...

109
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,708
There are a number of
questions that the group

110
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,541
would like to run by you.

111
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,625
If it's about the business, I
don't mind being the proprietor.

112
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,833
Well, I... that's
one thing, but...

113
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,916
That way if something
goes wrong down the line,

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,541
I'll be able to take full,
legal responsibility...

115
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,708
Oh and, uh,...

116
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,375
As far as all the rights
and dividends go,

117
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm cool with splitting
those evenly between us.

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,083
Wow, that's very
generous of you, Takky.

119
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,250
Huh? I feel bad asking this,...

120
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,708
but I need something
from you in return.

121
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,833
Would any of you be
willing to look

122
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,791
at this phone and
maybe fix it for me?

123
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,958
I can't seem to turn it on.

124
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,166
Well, that's strange.

125
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,916
I don't even see a
port to charge it...

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,708
So what is it
you need off of here?

127
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,750
Are there messages from
before you lost your memory?

128
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,291
Yeah, something like that.

129
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,208
Hold on...

130
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,083
You have two of those phones?

131
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,208
Where'd you get the other one?

132
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,708
Oh... Oh, I found
it in the theater...

133
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,541
As for what sort of
data could be on that one,

134
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,250
I really have no idea.

135
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,250
That's no surprise for
someone who has amnesia...

136
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,291
Micchon... Can... you fix it?

137
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,500
I'm good with fixing
computers, not cell phones.

138
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,375
That's too bad.

139
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,458
Wait a sec...

140
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,125
Maybe Itazu could
have better luck with it.

141
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,666
Panties...?

142
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,458
You know, you may be
onto something there, Saki.

143
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,416
Hold on...

144
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,750
What do you mean "panties"?

145
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,625
Nickname...

146
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,833
It's a guy we went to for advice

147
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,541
and ended up using
as a consultant

148
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,208
when we were putting
together our site...

149
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,541
He's one of the best
programmers out there.

150
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,333
The "Whiz Kid of Kyoto"
they call him.

151
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,666
Or at least they did.

152
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,291
Did...?

153
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,791
He has quirks...

154
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,833
For the last two years he hasn't
once left his apartment...

155
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,541
It's gotten so bad he isn't
even in school anymore.

156
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,708
All right.

157
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,375
Think I'll go pay
Panties a visit.

158
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,500
You can try but...

159
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,541
don't be surprised if he
doesn't answer the door.

160
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,166
We'll see about that...

161
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,166
I'll get him to open up.

162
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,250
Hey, wait a second--

163
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,916
Aren't you gonna ask us
for his address?

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You'll give it to me?

165
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,000
Why don't you let Micchon
show you the way...

166
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,208
He has a soft spot
for girls, so having her

167
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,375
by your side should help
you get in the door.

168
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,958
But I don't want to...!

169
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,333
I hate Panties,
the guy's a creep!

170
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,250
Come on, you don't mean that...

171
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,625
Look, as a fellow programmer

172
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,500
you know exactly how
his mind works...

173
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,375
Plus you speak the
same language...

174
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,375
And while you're there,
don't forget to ask him

175
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,416
about his progress on that big
World Computer project...

176
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,583
I'll text him.

177
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,166
Let him know you're coming.

178
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,833
Fine.

179
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,583
I'll go with you, too.

180
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,208
It's the same place he was
living at before, right...?

181
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,750
The little studio by the river?

182
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,083
Do you think they'll
be all right?

183
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,541
Well...they don't make the
most promising spies, but...

184
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,416
Wait, they're gonna spy?

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,625
Come on, Sis, even you have to
be a little curious, right...?

186
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,833
It's Takizawa's past...

187
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,333
If there are clues on
that other phone...

188
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,583
then we'd be stupid if we
didn't try to check them out.

189
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,416
Let me go...

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,958
I'd make a good spy.

191
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,750
Sorry, but you're not gonna
get any info out of Panties...

192
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,916
It's like I said before,

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,791
Yutaka Itazu has a
big soft spot for women.

194
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,125
Yeah, and...?

195
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,333
That supposed to be
some brilliant observation?

196
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,625
That's true for all guys.

197
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,125
I'll text Panties and
Micchon and have them

198
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,583
do a little snooping around
on that second phone...

199
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,541
In the meantime, let's
go over these documents

200
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,541
Takizawa brought in, line
by line, and see what we find.

201
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,416
If he's trying to
pull a fast one on us,

202
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,208
then there's gotta be a
hole in here somewhere.

203
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,541
No responses yet?

204
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,500
No matter how many
times I use this,

205
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,000
Eden's capabilities
still blow me away...

206
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,791
It wouldn't have any
trouble identifying him

207
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,750
if he were a student here.

208
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:14,625
Hirasawa... You really
are something else.

209
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,625
Hase... gawa?

210
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,041
What the hell?

211
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,916
So what's this "Panties"
guy like, anyway?

212
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,916
Well, he's a programmer,
and a good one,

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,291
which means he's a
tendency to believe

214
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,875
that he's the smartest
man in the world.

215
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,666
Ah.

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,416
Do you know how Hirasawa
first met this guy?

217
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,375
Yeah, Hirasawa
told the story once.

218
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,625
It was at some seminar they
both went to freshman year...

219
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,291
It's funny. Every time
they see each other,

220
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,958
they get into a
screaming match...

221
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,375
but they're actually
really good friends.

222
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,958
Huh, interesting...

223
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,208
So... what's this about
him dropping out of school?

224
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,166
Well, I don't really know
all of the specifics...

225
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,916
but around two years ago...

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,791
we heard he lost his
only pair of pants

227
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,666
when they flew out the window,
and his brilliant solution

228
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,666
to the problem was never to
leave his apartment again...

229
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,875
He's apparently been
a shut-in ever since.

230
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,208
I don't get it...

231
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,875
He has no pants?

232
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,083
I've found a high level
of skepticism necessary

233
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,541
when dealing with eccentrics.

234
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,875
He used to brag
about how he could

235
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,208
predict the movements
of society...

236
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,208
And as it turns out,
he was right...

237
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,916
but of course, soon
after accomplishing that,

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,875
he got bored and abandoned
the entire project...

239
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,083
Loser.

240
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,791
Are you talking about
the World Computer?

241
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,333
Yup... I'm gonna try
and take a nap.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,041
Well...? How's it going
with the real estate contract?

243
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,000
From what I can see,
it looks legit...

244
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,875
I confirmed everything
with the city...

245
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,833
so... from my perspective,
Takky's as clean as a whistle.

246
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,291
Okay...

247
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,708
So all that's left for
us now is to come up

248
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,916
with a company name and
register our official seal.

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,291
That's it.

250
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,916
We're almost there...

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wonder what we
should call ourselves.

252
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,166
I don't know how you guys feel,

253
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,125
but I'm starting to think the
mall is too much space for us...

254
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,791
We might be better served
with a few small offices,

255
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,125
just enough to
maintain the system...

256
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,916
To me that huge mall
just seems like overkill.

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,708
True... but I think
we could eventually

258
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,750
put all that space to good use.

259
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,125
You know, in many
zombie movies...

260
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,166
shopping malls are
depicted as symbols

261
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,125
of a decadent civilization...

262
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,291
For the survivors they're seen

263
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,791
as the final paradise
to hole up in...

264
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,208
So if we're the survivors...

265
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,958
then the mall could very
well be our perfect Eden.

266
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,125
Interesting... But wait...

267
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,458
Let's try turning
that scenario around...

268
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
What if the NEETs are the
ever-multiplying zombies?

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,041
If you look at it
from that perspective...

270
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,541
then perhaps we aren't

271
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,416
the ones who would
find solace at the mall.

272
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,625
I need to figure this out...

273
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,791
These names...

274
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,958
Does he keep a bunch
of different aliases

275
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,416
for different purposes?

276
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,291
I have to expose you
for what you really are...!

277
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,833
It's that one...

278
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,000
Panties' apartment is in the
corner, on the second floor.

279
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,666
Ah, cool.

280
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,583
Hello, anyone home?!

281
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,875
So, what now?

282
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,000
Did Hirasawa send you
any specific instructions?

283
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,041
He wants to see
if we can get a look

284
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,458
at the old messages; find out
if Takizawa has any secrets...

285
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,166
Sounds like fun.

286
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,541
Not just the messages...

287
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,166
We need to find out
what the story behind

288
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,583
that phone really is.

289
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,875
Hello...? Panties, are ya home?

290
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,583
Here it is...
Looks pretty normal to me.

291
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,958
The way you guys made him sound,

292
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,041
I was half-expecting barbed
wire and booby traps...

293
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,875
Don't let him hear you
say stuff like that.

294
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,041
We wanna flatter him, remember?

295
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,208
Right... Maybe I better
let you take over, Mittan...

296
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,791
Put a sock in it, will ya?

297
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,708
This is a private residence, no
one wants to hear your rambling.

298
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,791
Wait... Did I hear Micchon?

299
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,583
Are you Panties?

300
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,625
I don't know who you are

301
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,500
and I'd like it
to stay that way...

302
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,666
Did the girl from the
bakery come along, too?

303
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,125
Yeah... long time
no see... What's up?

304
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,541
Do me a favor.

305
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,083
Run down to the
convenience store

306
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,083
and grab me the latest
photo and lit magazines.

307
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,000
What...? Just order them online.

308
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,375
I don't have time for that.

309
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,416
There's too much going on,
from the whereabouts

310
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,375
of the missing NEETs, to the
truth about Careless Monday;

311
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,958
and now this guy who survived
having his pecker chopped off!

312
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,875
Lotsa crazy stories have
been developing ever since

313
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,416
the Prime Minister said "uncle",

314
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,791
so I can't be waiting around
for stuff to be shipped here.

315
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,500
Just leave the phone
with me and go home.

316
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,666
I'll see what I can
salvage when I get time.

317
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,166
Go back to Tokyo
and wait for my call.

318
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,791
Unbelievable.

319
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,375
Come on...
Just go buy them for him.

320
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,875
Let's go... Micchon.

321
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,625
Just because you're
doing me this favor

322
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,000
doesn't mean I'll let you in!

323
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,291
Hey, Itazu... Tell me...

324
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,333
You interested in any incidents
involving the Seleção?

325
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,791
Look, buddy, don't pretend like

326
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,708
you're interested in
my cutting-edge research.

327
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,625
All you'll end up doing
is corrupting my data!

328
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,041
I don't need some vintage
jean-wearing hipster

329
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,666
butting his nose into my work.

330
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,458
Besides, I'm willing to bet
the first time you ever heard

331
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,625
the word Seleção was
when that lame-ass politician

332
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,250
said it on TV, so nice try!

333
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,291
Well, maybe... or maybe not...

334
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,541
What if I told you I am
an actual Seleção...?

335
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,791
See my phone...? Check it out.

336
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,833
I wonder if he'll let us in

337
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,833
once we bring back
his magazines.

338
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:52,750
Who cares?

339
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,375
I don't wanna go
in there anyway.

340
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,416
But the whole point
of us coming all the way

341
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,625
out here was to get
him to fix the phone...

342
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,833
I know...!

343
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,875
Why don't we try to
find Itazu a sweat suit?

344
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,625
Then he could start
leaving his apartment again.

345
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,791
What do you think?

346
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,000
It's a good idea,

347
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,750
but I'm not sure it
would make a difference.

348
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,375
Huh...? How so?

349
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,833
Well, it is true that he
lost his only pair of pants,

350
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,000
but I doubt that's the only
reason why he's such a hermit...

351
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,458
You know?

352
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,791
I guess.

353
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,958
You're right. He did
tell him to say uncle.

354
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,500
Told ya.

355
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,083
How did you figure that out?

356
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,583
Because I'm the
one who did it...

357
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,416
If you're interested,
I can give you some dirt

358
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,833
on the mass NEET disappearance
and the Johnny Hunter stuff

359
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,500
that people are
confusing it with...

360
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,500
I also know some info
about the accidents

361
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,500
in Roppongi yesterday
and how they're connected

362
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,666
to the Seleção,
but it's up to you

363
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,208
if you wanna hear it or not.

364
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,375
Online, everyone is
just blindly accepting

365
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,250
the idea that the
Johnny Hunter victims

366
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,541
and the NEET disappearances
are the same story...

367
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,333
Who the hell are you, anyway?

368
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,666
I already told you.
I'm a Seleção.

369
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,041
Just let me inside, Itazu ...

370
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,958
I think everything I'm saying
will make more sense...

371
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,708
once you start analyzing all
the data inside this phone.

372
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,625
Tell me more about the phone.

373
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,208
All twelve of us were given one

374
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,041
when we became a Seleção...

375
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,500
You would be amazed
at what it's capable of.

376
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,208
I thought there were
only eleven Seleção.

377
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,958
What the hell?
What is this place?

378
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,625
Hosozawa. Hasegawa.

379
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:41,333
Kise. Shibuya. Okada...
All different.

380
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,500
And yet all of them are

381
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,750
somehow connected
to the same person...

382
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,625
Careful, Saki...!

383
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,333
This guy's more dangerous
than we'd ever imagined!

384
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,750
This is Hirasawa.

385
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,791
It's Osugi.
Is Saki there with you?

386
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,500
No. Something came up.

387
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,791
She went to Kyoto.

388
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,958
Kyoto? Why?

389
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,625
It has to do with Takizawa...

390
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,500
I sent her to go
visit Panties' place.

391
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,041
Did Takizawa go with her?

392
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,041
Yeah, he did.

393
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,875
Idiot! That was stupid!

394
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,208
I'm sure she'll be fine.

395
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,708
Micchon went along, too.

396
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,375
Look, that's not the issue...!

397
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,625
Come to the movie theater
in Toyosu and you'll see...

398
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,125
An-and make sure you
check out the picture

399
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,708
of Takizawa I uploaded to Eden

400
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,000
and all the crazy things
people are posting about it...

401
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,041
He's a criminal!

402
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,333
Just look -
You'll see what I mean!

403
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,416
I don't know what kind

404
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,458
of trouble he's
mixed up in, exactly.

405
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,541
But whatever it is, it's big!

406
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,708
There... Perfect.

407
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,041
I have lived a life of seclusion

408
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,500
for the last two years due
to the unfortunate loss

409
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,750
of my only pair of pants.

410
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,166
But ever since I learned
about the missing NEETs

411
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,208
who I see as my
fellow compatriots,

412
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,416
I've become inspired

413
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,666
to do whatever it takes
to solve the mystery

414
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,125
of their disappearance
from within these walls.

415
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:04,125
And I vow to never see the
sun again until it's finished.

416
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,000
So tell me the truth.

417
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,458
Are you here trying to trick me?

418
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,500
Here.
