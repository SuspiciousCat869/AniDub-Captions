1
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,291
It's turning into a slum.

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,666
Yeah...

3
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,916
but it looks like people are
still in the apartments.

4
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,625
You live in an
apartment too, right?

5
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,416
Who knows...

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,333
Judging by the address,
I'd say it's a house.

7
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, right.

8
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,166
It should be that way.

9
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,291
The missile hit over there,

10
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
so I bet your
place is still standing.

11
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,500
Mhmm. The thing is,
all those buildings are dark,

12
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,083
like they're condemned.

13
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,458
We should at least check it out.

14
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,458
Here we are.

15
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,666
Are you sure this
is it...? I'm not.

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,416
It's the right address.

17
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,000
It worked.

18
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,250
There should be a light
switch around here somewhere.

19
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,541
Wow... Not the kind of place...

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,583
I was expecting.

21
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,083
Tell me about it.

22
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,666
Is anything here ringing a bell?

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,125
You found the key to get
in like you'd done it before.

24
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,791
I feel something
but I can't place it.

25
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,666
Takizawa!

26
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,125
What the...

27
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,958
I got spooked... Aw, cute!

28
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,625
What are you
doing here, little guy?

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
Hey, there!

30
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,708
I think we can say for sure
this is where you live...

31
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,416
I mean, look at him.

32
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,208
That little puppy obviously
knows who you are.

33
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,458
You're right...

34
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,750
You sure are friendly,
aren't ya, little buddy?

35
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,083
I know this is outta
your jurisdiction...

36
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,708
Thanks for sticking
your neck out.

37
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,541
I'm just doing my job.

38
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,041
Oh and hey, would you
mind sticking around

39
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,666
here for an hour or so...?

40
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,791
If I'm not back by then,

41
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,666
head home to your
wife and kids, okay?

42
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,291
Thanks, pal.

43
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,375
You've gotta be kidding me.

44
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,666
The kid actually lives here?

45
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,625
Sure enough, it says
right here in the log,

46
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,000
he bought the entire place.

47
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,541
You're not the only one

48
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,625
who wants to wipe your memory...

49
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,500
I just hope you're inside.

50
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,750
He wants us to go upstairs.

51
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,375
I can't believe
you live in a mall!

52
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,791
How cool is that?

53
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,833
It makes me wonder

54
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,541
what kind of a
person I really am.

55
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,125
It's kinda creepy,

56
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,500
straight out of Dawn
of the Dead, ya know?

57
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,750
Is that a movie?

58
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,250
Mm-hm.

59
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,958
I'm sure if we
start looking around

60
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,958
we'll find something
that'll help you.

61
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,541
The paper was still
being delivered,

62
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,708
and I'm sure there's
some mail, too.

63
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,625
We may even find the paperwork

64
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,708
for when you bought the place.

65
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,833
No way...! This is where
that photo was taken.

66
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,208
So this is definitely the
home of Akira Takizawa...

67
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,000
but what exactly
was I doing here?

68
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,458
Takizawa...! Are you okay?!

69
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,875
Did you find anything?

70
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,416
Nope, nothing yet.

71
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,208
This must be the movie theater.

72
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,583
You trying to get us into
the late show, little guy?

73
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,041
Is this where you live?

74
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,125
Oh, wow...! What in the...

75
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,583
This apartment is amazing!

76
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
Oh yeah...
You definitely live here.

77
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,375
I'm not so sure.

78
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,208
But just look
around you...! Like...

79
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,166
You know more
details about the movies

80
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,041
you've seen than you
do about yourself.

81
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,375
How much do you wanna
bet you worked here

82
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,541
at some point as
the theater manager?

83
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,125
Manager, huh?

84
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,875
Oh look.

85
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,791
You can see
ground zero from here.

86
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,083
Sure can.

87
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,625
Oh! Hey!

88
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,750
Are there any movies that you're
really itching to see...?

89
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,541
It can be any movie at all.

90
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,875
I can play it on the big screen.

91
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,166
I'm not sure.

92
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,375
Remember, I don't
watch many movies.

93
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,916
You can't think of
one movie you like...?

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,791
For instance, what did you
see on your first date?

95
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,541
Uh, well let's see...

96
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,708
There's a French movie

97
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,250
with a dolphin and
a diver I really liked.

98
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,541
Ah, nice one.

99
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,875
And yet you still don't recall
any details about yourself.

100
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,375
I know, huh?

101
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,416
So what is it about that
one that made you pick it?

102
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,875
Someone who I've always liked...

103
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,291
really loves that movie...

104
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,708
Hey Juiz, I was hoping you
could do me a favor...

105
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,333
There's a specific
movie I'm looking for...

106
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,708
Yeah... I'm in the
theater right now.

107
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,250
Police?

108
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,500
Understood.

109
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,750
I'm scanning the database

110
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,958
for the films that are
currently on file there.

111
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,916
Please standby.

112
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,875
Noblesse oblige.

113
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,041
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

114
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,708
Yeah, well... I can at
least try to be a gentleman.

115
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,125
Look at this place...
It's a dump.

116
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,708
I've seen refugee camps
in better shape than this.

117
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,083
Oh man, look at all
these cell phones.

118
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,583
Okay... I get it now...

119
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,416
This kid was involved
in the disappearance

120
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,375
of all those NEET losers.

121
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,291
So a Seleção was...

122
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,625
behind the attacks
and the disappearances.

123
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,625
If I'd paid attention
to his history

124
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,125
rather than blowing
all that cash...

125
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,041
I'd be up for a promotion
right about now.

126
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,958
But... I'm getting myself
a new lease on life

127
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,333
and a cool eight billion
to go along with it...

128
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,875
Simply not my problem anymore.

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Oh right...

130
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,041
I can't have my cell phone going
off while the movie's playing.

131
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,041
The number you are
trying to reach is

132
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,708
either out of range
or no longer in service.

133
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,416
Please try again later.
Thank you.

134
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,875
I have to hand it to Osugi.

135
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,375
You can't fault him
for lack of trying.

136
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,458
I think he's fighting
a losing battle.

137
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,583
Tell everyone I'm staying
at your place tonight.

138
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,416
Pretty please...

139
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,291
I just told Asako that,
so don't get me in trouble.

140
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,208
Hey, when did you get this?

141
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,041
It was around eleven or so.

142
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,666
Uh... What's going on?

143
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,083
We're going home... So tired.

144
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,958
I wonder where she's
really staying.

145
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,791
Maybe Saki's right.

146
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,833
I really could've been
the projectionist here,

147
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,791
just like in Cinema Paradiso.

148
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,958
Wow! The screen's gigantic!

149
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,791
Here goes.

150
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,125
Where is he?

151
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,041
There you are.

152
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,458
You always come to the movies
by yourself, Detective...?

153
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,708
Since you're alone,

154
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,041
I assume you're not here
to arrest me, huh...

155
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,458
You been watching me?

156
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,125
Yeah... See?

157
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,791
So I take it you came
here to talk shop...?

158
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,916
Actually... I was
hoping you'd stop by,

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,125
since we got cut
short last time.

160
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,541
That's nice...

161
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,500
So kid, have you been
checking out my logs recently?

162
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,791
By logs...

163
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,458
You mean the ones
on here, right...?

164
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,416
By the way,
what is a Seleção...?

165
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,083
Look, the thing is,
I'm suffering from amnesia.

166
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,583
I literally don't remember
one detail about myself...

167
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,083
Now if you don't mind,

168
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,500
I'd appreciate the chance to
pick your brain for a while.

169
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,833
So then...

170
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,291
you really did wipe
your memory, huh...

171
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,583
Where's Takizawa...?

172
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,083
Huh, pup?

173
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,333
Interesting...

174
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,541
So Harima Neuroscience
Institute's brainwashing

175
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,041
program really did
the trick, didn't it...

176
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,458
I may have to try it
for myself sometime...

177
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,750
But first... I'm gonna
need you to hand over

178
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,583
that phone you got in your hand.

179
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,625
You got way too
careless, big guy.

180
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,583
What the hell is
that phone, anyway...?

181
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,916
How much money did
yours start with?

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,166
Huh... Stubborn prick.

183
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,083
I'm taking whatever
cash you have on here...

184
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,333
If I had to guess,

185
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,541
I'd say you started with
ten billion like I did.

186
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,250
The joke's on us, though.

187
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,208
'S no way you can change the
world with a measly ten bil'.

188
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,333
It's impossible...

189
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,208
The bastards who forced us
into this game should die!

190
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,708
Mister...

191
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,916
You've got one helluva kick...

192
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,041
The girl...

193
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,750
She has... nothing...
to do with... this, 'kay?

194
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,833
Killing her would
cost me money...

195
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,041
It'd be a waste of my time.

196
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,583
Oh, right...

197
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,625
I may as well give you
a little heads up...

198
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,458
When it comes to
Noblesse phones...

199
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,041
as soon as the
balance hits zero,

200
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,750
someone named the Supporter
will track you down

201
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,458
and give you two to the head...

202
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,625
Those are the
rules we live by...

203
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,458
That's tough luck
for you, kiddo...

204
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,041
The girl may be safe,
but you're a dead man.

205
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:27,041
The score's even now...
Detective.

206
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,125
I wonder who
this Supporter is...

207
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,166
Another mystery.

208
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm sorry.
It doesn't look like I'll...

209
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,958
be able to make the late show.

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,750
Hey, there.

211
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,541
You wouldn't happen to know

212
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,458
where Takizawa went,
would you...?

213
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,833
If he didn't wanna
spend time with me,

214
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,875
he could have just said so.

215
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,958
Ha, nice message.

216
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,125
Well... Time we paid
the Detective a visit.

217
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,916
I now have enough money for us

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,750
to play around with for
the rest of our lives...

219
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,500
I called you a taxi...

220
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:18,500
See you in...
Kabu... kicho... Bye

221
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,958
There, just spent my last yen.

222
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,166
The phone's identical.

223
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,875
You'd think it'd work
the same way...

224
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,833
Damn it... Shit...
I'll have to call Juiz.

225
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,375
Hello. Juiz speaking.

226
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,416
Hey there...

227
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,166
I got a question
I wanna run by you.

228
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,583
What would happen if someone

229
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,750
were to get ahold
of my phone...?

230
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,833
Can just anyone use it?

231
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,916
It uses fingerprint
recognition technology,

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,041
so it would effectively
be rendered useless...

233
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,666
Why, is there a problem?

234
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,750
Oh no... Just making sure.

235
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,708
Thanks... Gotta go...

236
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,833
Son of a... bitch!

237
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,583
Dammit!

238
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,875
How do I always...
fuck things up?!

239
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,958
Thanks, Saki.

240
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,208
Let's go already... Answer.

241
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,750
I know you can hear me...

242
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,375
Come on, Detective Kondo...

243
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
I'm just trying to
make a nice gesture

244
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,750
by returning your
precious ID badge...

245
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,458
The least you can
do is say hello.

246
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,375
Dammit... How did you...

247
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,791
It's about time... So tell me.

248
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,333
Where are you right now?

249
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,208
I'm in the middle
of Kabukicho...

250
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,166
You better get
your ass over here!

251
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,625
Kabukicho...

252
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,541
Um, how do I get there again?

253
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,541
Come on... Stop dicking around!

254
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,291
How quickly you forget.

255
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,625
Remember? I wiped my memory.

256
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,041
Go towards Kiba and
hit the expressway.

257
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,583
Misae.

258
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,916
Hey, what are you
doing here... honey?

259
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,625
"Enough money
for us to play with

260
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,250
for the rest of our lives"?

261
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,916
Hold on... How did you...?

262
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,541
When you text your mistress...

263
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,916
try not to send it to your wife.

264
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,625
It's over... my darling.

265
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,125
You okay, Detective?

266
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:30,125
Shut up, kid... Shut up.

267
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,625
Let me call you an ambulance.

268
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,708
You need help.

269
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,916
Don't bother
wasting your time...

270
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,750
It looks like... I'm done for.

271
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,875
You can't just give up...

272
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,041
I still need to--

273
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,250
Listen. There are
ten others besides us...

274
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,791
All are Seleção and they all
have the same exact phone.

275
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,666
Seleção are people...

276
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,083
just like you and me,

277
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,916
forced into playing
this idiotic game...

278
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,416
whether they want to or not.

279
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,125
You can see their activity
logs on your phone.

280
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,500
Your best bet at finding them

281
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,000
is by tracing their steps
through those logs...

282
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,666
Once you do,
ask them who you are...

283
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,250
Of course, this is assuming
any of 'em are willing

284
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,541
to meet with a dangerous
Seleção like yourself,

285
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,625
so don't be
surprised if they run.

286
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,083
Wait... I'm dangerous?

287
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,666
Damn straight...

288
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,458
You rounded up
twenty-thousand NEET's

289
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,500
and tried to kill them...
and that is the truth.

290
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,708
No wait... Of course...

291
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,500
You're the Supporter,
aren't you?

292
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,333
It all makes sense now...
That's why Misae...

293
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,791
Look Detective, I don't know
what you're talking about.

294
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,250
Well, you got me...

295
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,583
Take this and split, kid.

296
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,208
Said get outta here!

297
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,250
I lost this one.

298
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
In the beginning, I...

299
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,666
I tried to do the right thing...

300
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,250
God knows I... tried...
