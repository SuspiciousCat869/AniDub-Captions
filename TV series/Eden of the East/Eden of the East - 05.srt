1
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,291
Juiz... It looks like
I've done it again.

2
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,291
Killed?

3
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,208
Yes... You know
where to find me.

4
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,833
It's the usual place.

5
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,250
I've pinpointed your location.

6
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,000
Room 1109.

7
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,416
Would you be a doll and
handle the cleanup for me...?

8
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,041
I really don't care
how you manage it,

9
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,500
as long as it's done
elegantly, understand?

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,125
Yes... Noblesse oblige...

11
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,291
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

12
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,250
I can hardly believe it...

13
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,250
I was already caught up
in this stupid game

14
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,666
before I wiped my memory.

15
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,666
If this Mister Outside
gave me the choice today

16
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,250
to sell my life
for ten billion yen,

17
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,166
then I'd say thanks,
but no thanks.

18
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,916
Damn it! I'm screwed!!!

19
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,208
Who does this Mister Outside
think he is anyway?!

20
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,125
The prick has a god complex!

21
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,500
Gimme a minute alone with him
and I'd bash in his fac--!

22
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,541
That was a close one...

23
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,125
If I throw this phone
away the Supporter

24
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,250
will sneak up
and slit my throat.

25
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,041
Wait, is that... Takizawa?

26
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,916
You dick!!!

27
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,083
Settle down.

28
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,541
I take it you're
not the Supporter?

29
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,583
It's your fault, asshole!

30
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,291
What the hell are
you talking about?

31
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't play dumb with me...!

32
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,500
Do you have any idea what we had

33
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,541
to go through these
last two months...?

34
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,333
You promised to take us
to a consumer's paradise

35
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,916
and instead you dumped us
in the middle of a desert!

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Then some jerk-off
foreman from India

37
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,708
started ragging on us
for being weak and useless.

38
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,125
He beat us. He spit on us.

39
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,541
We went days without food,

40
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,250
without money or even a
clue as to what was going on!

41
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,833
It was so humiliating!

42
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,000
Sorry, do I... know you?

43
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,791
Are you serious...?
You don't remember?

44
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,875
Ah, forget it.

45
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,583
It's meatbuns...

46
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,375
So, next month
I'm getting married

47
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,416
to a girl I met over there.

48
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,333
Of all the places in the
world you coulda sent us,

49
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,083
I still don't understand
why you chose Dubai...

50
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,500
but I guess it all
turned out okay for me now

51
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,875
that I can re-enter
society again.

52
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,125
Later.

53
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,458
What just happened?

54
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,833
Sorry to make you do this right

55
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,708
before your big interview...

56
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,125
It's just that you're so
much better at it than me.

57
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,291
No big deal.
I do it all the time.

58
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,000
I hope you don't mind,

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,166
but I decided to make
you into a cookie.

60
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,791
So I'm guessing they'll probably

61
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,000
be a little rough with
you in the interview...

62
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,333
Just try not to
be defensive, okay?

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,666
But... if you decide you
can't take anymore abuse,

64
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,750
don't feel like you
have to force yourself.

65
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,416
What do you mean?

66
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,041
If you need to take more time
to find the perfect job...

67
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,041
we're more than happy
to float you awhile.

68
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,458
I've already been enough
trouble to you as it is.

69
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,916
Come on, Saki, don't be silly...

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,208
You're our family.

71
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,125
That's easy for you to say.

72
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,625
Sometimes kindness
can really hurt.

73
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,166
Hey, Saki.

74
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,583
Good morning.

75
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,250
Hey, Osugi,
I didn't even see you.

76
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,250
I barely recognize
you in that suit.

77
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,375
Yeah, the whole corporate look

78
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,708
doesn't really fit me, does it?

79
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,750
Not really.

80
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,166
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever...

81
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,416
Guess things've
been pretty crazy

82
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
since we came
back from our trip...

83
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,708
Did you hear the
news about Hirasawa?

84
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,666
He decided to defer his
graduation for a year...

85
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,500
And of course he
made this big decision

86
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,125
while we were all in Manhattan.

87
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,583
Oh, that...

88
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,750
Yeah, I figured something
like that was up

89
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,958
ever since he told us he
couldn't come with us...

90
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,000
Good call...

91
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,541
We've always dreamed
of turning Eden

92
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,666
into a real business,
so I understand...

93
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,333
He still wants to chase it...

94
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,625
Guess that's a
choice you can make

95
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,541
when your family's got money...

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,750
He says being a NEET's
all he's cut out for:

97
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,333
"No Employment,
Education, or Training."

98
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,541
But you and I both know
he's capable of more.

99
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,166
As long as he's
willing to try...

100
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,458
Did you know he's already
gotten six job offers?

101
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,250
Funny how he
leaves that part out.

102
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,125
I just hope he doesn't
wait too long...

103
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,625
I've seen guys pushing forty,
still living off their parents,

104
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,250
griping about how they could
never fit into society...

105
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,083
That's gonna be him one
day if he's not careful.

106
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,708
Heh, you know what I mean?

107
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,500
Yeah, I guess
everything you're saying

108
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,500
makes perfect sense, Osugi...

109
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,541
So, uh...

110
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,541
Do you have any free time
after your interview today?

111
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,208
Why do you ask?

112
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,708
Oh, well...

113
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,500
I was hoping you'd want
to get some dinner...

114
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,750
We could celebrate graduation
and both of us finding jobs...

115
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,208
I mean we're
already dressed up...

116
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,458
so we should hit
the town, right?

117
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,458
I should be done around two,

118
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,458
so I can pick you up
if you want?

119
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,125
Mhmm...

120
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,541
Yes!

121
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,041
Congratulations...

122
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,416
I'm sure your mission is clearer
now that you remember the rules.

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,375
Well technically I don't
remember anything...

124
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,791
This whole idea
of saving the nation.

125
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,458
Can the mission get
any more vague...?

126
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,458
I'm... starting to
question just how

127
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,458
feasible this idea really is.

128
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,208
Can you elaborate more?

129
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,916
What I mean is...

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,875
If you give twelve
random people a phone

131
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,166
with ten billion yen on it, and
tell 'em to change the world,

132
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,291
the chances of 'em
succeeding are slim...

133
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,166
Maybe the Prime Minister
could do it...

134
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,125
Right...?

135
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,375
Nah, you'd need to find someone

136
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,791
even bigger than him to
pull it off, for sure...

137
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,333
So--what kinda person
does that make me?

138
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,708
You think I can make the
Prime Minister cry uncle...?

139
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,000
Really?

140
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,708
You've got the life, pooch.

141
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,125
Order received.

142
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,500
Huh?

143
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,041
Noblesse oblige...

144
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,583
Please turn on the television...

145
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,833
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

146
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,250
Turn on the TV?

147
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,083
Based on these
current documents,

148
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,250
there is evidence that the
missiles used on Careless Monday

149
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,375
are identical to those
that were recently deployed

150
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,708
by the Maritime
Self-Defense Forces.

151
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,833
Now, sir...

152
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,333
Is it not true that
you were aware...

153
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,416
of not only the
missiles' existence,

154
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,333
but their use by the MSDF?

155
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,875
We've also received
intelligence suggesting

156
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,708
the terrorists behind
the attacks are part

157
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,250
of an organization calling
themselves Seleção.

158
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,250
The Prime Minister
has the floor.

159
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:12,958
Uncle.

160
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:13,500
What's he saying?

161
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,708
What? Speak up!

162
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,875
Uncle.

163
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,916
Come on Juiz,
that's not what I meant.

164
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,416
Okay so you proved your point...

165
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,125
You're powerful... huh...

166
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,166
What...? Crap, I forgot!

167
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,791
Saki sent me this message
yesterday and I never read it!

168
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,875
"I went home this morning...

169
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,416
did something happen to you...?

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,166
Hope your memories came back"...

171
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,041
Damn, I made her worry.

172
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,416
Takizawa...?

173
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,125
"Sorry I couldn't make
it to the late show...

174
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,666
My memories haven't
come back yet,

175
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,500
but I'm doing fine...

176
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,458
What are you doing right now?

177
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,833
We should meet up...

178
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,833
There's something that I've been

179
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,708
meaning to talk
to you about."...

180
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,708
Now's not a good time.

181
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,041
No reply.

182
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,833
She must be pissed at me...

183
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,916
I should go apologize in person.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Juiz...

185
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,250
Do you remember the girl
I was with yesterday...?

186
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,125
Yeah.

187
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,125
Did you see the
Diet hearings on TV?

188
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,000
Apparently just
saying the word "uncle"

189
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,041
shot the old man's approval
ratings up ten percent.

190
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,416
That only cost him sixty yen?

191
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,958
Juiz... It's me.

192
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,708
If any of you have dreams

193
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,750
of becoming a
professional model...

194
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,125
then you can forget it.

195
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,291
Trust me, you'll have
a much better chance

196
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,958
of winning the lottery.

197
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,666
Ah, if it isn't Number Nine...

198
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,208
He has really
changed his approach

199
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,041
since his return to the fray.

200
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,750
Did anyone watch
the Diet hearings?

201
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,458
Makes me wonder how Number One

202
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,458
will react to this nonsense.

203
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:40,458
There are realists and
there are romantics...

204
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,833
I have no intention
of taking either side.

205
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,083
I usually just
go with the cutest.

206
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,416
Oh, speaking of...

207
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,708
Do I have anything on
my plate for tonight?

208
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,833
Yes.

209
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,333
Well I'm starting
to get the urge

210
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,708
to perform one of my
disappearing acts again...

211
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,833
so you better keep
an eye on me, okay?

212
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,333
Ma'am?

213
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,500
I'm not very effective at
controlling myself these days.

214
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,375
You were lucky.

215
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,166
Having been a
survivor of that incident,

216
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,750
tell us in your own words how

217
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,708
you see this latest
terrorist attack...

218
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,875
We want your honest opinion,
so don't hold back.

219
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,708
Uh...

220
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,375
The youth of today almost seemed

221
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,083
to welcome Careless Monday
with open arms, did they not?

222
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,750
Well...

223
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,083
Up until now, there
were no casualties,

224
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,333
so such a brash opinion
was a viable stance

225
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,791
to take on the issue...

226
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,208
But all that changed
with the most recent attack

227
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,375
when people were
actually murdered...

228
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,833
I feel horrible
for the victims...

229
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,791
That's enough... Thank you.

230
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,416
Okay... Not what
I was hoping for...

231
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,625
You see...

232
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,916
I wanted an opinion
that was truly unique.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,583
Something that doesn't just
regurgitate the status quo...

234
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,250
We need people who
can think outside the box.

235
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,625
I'm glad you made it through

236
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,875
the attack alive and well...

237
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,958
Where there is life,
there is hope, right?

238
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,583
Hey... I know it's a bit early,

239
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,125
but since you came
all the way out here,

240
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,750
what do you say we
do some lunch...?

241
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,083
Our cafeteria is
among the best in town.

242
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,083
Sure!

243
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,916
Where is he?

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,166
Maybe I went to
the wrong cafeteria?

245
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,291
Sorry about that.

246
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,666
No, don't worry about it...

247
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,375
It's no big deal.

248
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,625
Did you see that girl
wearing the ramen earlier?

249
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,500
Oh, I saw her.

250
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,125
It's been awhile since the boss

251
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,666
has had to pull out that trick.

252
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,166
Yeah, tell me about it...

253
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,125
You know, the boss may
be the bad guy here,

254
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,541
but really, could that girl
have been any more dense...?

255
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,291
If she'd actually gotten
a clue after sitting there

256
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,458
alone for nearly an
hour, she wouldn't be

257
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,541
totally soaked in
beef broth right now.

258
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,125
I know, the girl
needs a reality check.

259
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,041
Seriously--you
miss your interview

260
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,250
'cause you're on vacation, and
you still expect to get hired?

261
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,666
Not gonna happen, sister.

262
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,416
You'd have to be
pretty naïve to think

263
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,333
a few good connections
are all you need

264
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,083
to land a job these days.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,291
I guess our customers
like her sense of humor...

266
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,708
maybe she could
find work in sales.

267
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,166
Hello. Sangetsu Bakery.

268
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,125
Yes...? Oh...!

269
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,666
I wanted to thank
you for arranging

270
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,250
that interview for my sister...!

271
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,833
Huh...? Oh, okay... Yes.

272
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:50,541
I see. Well...

273
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,833
I'll pass along the message...

274
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,000
We appreciate the opportunity...

275
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,791
Right... You have
a good day, too.

276
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,500
Hey, Saki.

277
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,958
I'm glad I caught you.

278
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,916
I wanted to apologize for
what happened the other day,

279
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,875
and I also have a few questions
for you, if you don't mind.

280
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,500
Saki...

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,125
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised they rejected me.

282
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,416
I really believed
if I apologized

283
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,916
for missing my first interview

284
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,916
they would see it my way
and give me a fair shot.

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
I mean, it was
out of my control.

286
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,625
Maybe I am naïve
for thinking that.

287
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,166
Seriously though,
I don't think I deserved

288
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,375
to have a bowl of
ramen dumped on me!

289
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,291
I guess they were
just being polite

290
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,083
because of my brother-in-law...

291
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,916
But come on, we're
all adults, you know?

292
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,541
If they really thought they
were so much better than me...

293
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,958
then they should've
just said so!

294
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,458
Thing is...

295
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,583
I already had one job offer...

296
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,750
But when I went
to the interview...

297
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,500
...they kept giving
me this cheesy line

298
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,916
about how they "needed
the youth of today

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,625
to pave the way
for tomorrow,"...

300
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,416
but it seemed like what
they really meant was,

301
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,583
"we're looking for
young people willing

302
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,666
to work long hours
for little pay...

303
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,333
so we can take
advantage of them"--

304
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,208
I ended up turning
down their offer.

305
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,000
I think it was a huge mistake.

306
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,375
I don't feel comfortable
going back home...

307
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,583
Don't get me wrong,
I have nothing

308
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,083
but love for my entire family,
especially Ryosuke...

309
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,541
I love him so much!

310
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,000
That's what makes it so hard!

311
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,125
Come over to my place...

312
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,333
I promise to take
care of everything...

313
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,541
Listening to you just
now has helped me realize

314
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
what it is I need to do.

315
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,750
So don't stress about
finding a job for now.

316
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,041
You let me worry...

317
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,625
This country's all sortsa
mixed up these days,

318
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,958
and it's not gonna
straighten itself out.

319
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,166
Someone's gonna have to step
in and do something about it.

320
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,708
But just 'cause
I'm gonna play the game,

321
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,250
doesn't mean I wanna punch the
guy who started it any less...

322
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,375
It's 'cause of him,
the Johnnys--

323
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,541
Look--don't worry about the job.

324
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,083
They'll figure out
they were the ones

325
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,500
to mess up by not hiring you.

326
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,541
Just enjoy being
unemployed for now, okay?

327
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,625
Just who... who are you, really?

328
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,166
I don't know...

329
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,000
but, I think I'm
about to find out.

330
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,583
Osugi, would you
please just tell me

331
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,125
what's going on already?

332
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,833
This is the sort of place
you'd take a girlfriend to.

333
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,750
I hope that's not
the way you see me.

334
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,041
Hey, don't go getting
the wrong idea, buddy.

335
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,416
I'm gonna be a working
stooge sooner than later...

336
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,750
So where's the harm in going

337
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,583
to a three-star restaurant
now and then...? HUH?!

338
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,333
Damn it, why the hell'd
you ask me on a date?!

339
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,541
I paid a lotta money
for that meal.

340
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,708
I'm not puking it up!

341
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,875
Why have I been wasting
my time with you, huh?

342
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,666
If you had a boyfriend all
you had to do was tell me...!

343
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,750
Then I never would have gone
after you in the first place!
