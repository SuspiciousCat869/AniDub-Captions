1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,833
He became a prince
out of necessity...

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,875
He had come to the
realization that the future

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,625
we all hoped for would
never come to pass

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:19,541
unless someone volunteered
to become a sacrificial lamb.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,875
It wasn't what he wanted out of
life, but he did it anyway...

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,250
He became a prince in this
world without a king...

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,833
But what exactly did he have
to do to become a prince...?

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,208
The answer still
eludes me today.

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,541
Well... Here we are, miss.

10
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,916
And here's your bag.

11
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:54,333
Oh wow. So this is
the center of the world?

12
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,291
It's much different
than I'd pictured it.

13
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:12,166
And the fountain's a lot further
away than I'd hoped it'd be.

14
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,583
I wonder if they're mad at me.

15
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,000
Probably...

16
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,791
If I had my phone on, Osugi'd
be calling me right now.

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,750
Well I didn't come
down here for nothin'...

18
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,916
Time to put up or shut up.

19
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,416
Darn it! It's too far.

20
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,166
Hey! Young lady!

21
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,833
What did you just throw?

22
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,791
Asshole! You wanna die?!

23
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,208
Hey! Over there! You okay?!

24
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:07,208
What the...?
Why is that guy naked?

25
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,583
Number Nine is turning out

26
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,375
to be more unique than
I'd ever imagined...

27
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,708
But it ends here.

28
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,250
I see. That's
disappointing to hear.

29
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,000
So you're on his side, huh...?

30
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,916
I'm jealous... Juiz.

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,833
Prepare for my return to Japan.

32
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,125
Understood.

33
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,000
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,208
I'm freezing...!

35
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,625
And I'm naked.

36
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,041
A cell phone... and a gun?

37
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,000
The White House.

38
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,583
I know what the
White House is...

39
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:10,041
and yet I don't have
any idea of who I am.

40
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,333
Hey! Young lady!

41
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,958
What did you just throw?

42
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,333
Asshole! You wanna die?!

43
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,791
Hey! Over there! You okay?!

44
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,083
Actually... I'm the
one in trouble.

45
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,541
Did he get hit?!

46
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:46,416
Get him!

47
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,416
Well, now's my chance. Ah!

48
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,958
You could've been in
real trouble there.

49
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,708
I'd make a run for it while
you can, if I were you.

50
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,916
Um... I'm not in trouble.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,083
Yeah...? Well I'm pretty
sure it's against the law

52
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,333
to throw stuff
at the White House.

53
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,125
You saw me?

54
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,958
Sorta.

55
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,416
Oh... Well thank you.

56
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,458
Hey, uh... Aren't
you a little cold?

57
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,500
I sure am.

58
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,291
Well then...

59
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,416
Let me... help you out.

60
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,875
You sure...?

61
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,916
I'll probably never
see you again.

62
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's fine...

63
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,416
Thanks so much for helping me.

64
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,250
Thank you...
I really owe you one.

65
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,416
Bye!

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,708
It's empty. Damn it!

67
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,958
I was hoping
there'd be something

68
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:30,375
that could help me
remember who I am.

69
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,416
Hello. Juiz speaking.

70
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,000
Juiz...? Do I...?

71
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,500
I am your concierge...

72
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,958
I didn't think I would
hear from you again...

73
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,958
but it sounds like you're fine.

74
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,125
Huh...? Tell me...

75
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,333
Would you happen...
to know who I am?

76
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,250
Who you are?

77
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,750
This is the first time
you've erased your memory.

78
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,958
I never received an order to
prepare a new legend for you,

79
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,250
so as to who you are right now,
I can't answer that.

80
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,125
Erased my memory?

81
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,000
The last order
I received was to give you

82
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,833
instructions on where to
go after the procedure...

83
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,083
I'm sending that
address to you now...

84
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:09,958
That is all.

85
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,166
I hope you succeed and I pray

86
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,041
for your continuing
service as a savior.

87
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,333
This is my home?

88
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,000
If you say so.

89
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,250
That was scary--

90
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,750
No one's gonna believe
me when I tell them...

91
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,791
I guess I... shouldn't be taking
risks in a foreign country.

92
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,625
Oh no! My passport...!

93
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:40,208
Where did I...
I had it in my coat pocket.

94
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,708
Hey, what's up!

95
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,458
I'm dressed like a fool.

96
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,375
No wonder everyone's
staring at me.

97
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,000
What am I gonna do...?

98
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,291
I have to get it back from him!

99
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,166
Looking for him?

100
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,708
There he is!

101
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,208
Wha... Why'd that guy
just hand over his pants?

102
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,708
This doesn't make any sense!

103
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,916
Hey! Hey! Wait up!

104
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,875
This it?

105
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,791
Crap! Where'd he go?

106
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,958
Wait!

107
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,000
How's it going?

108
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,250
Hey. Dude.

109
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,708
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:41,125
Uh... My place is on the,
uh, second floor, right?

111
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,833
Try the third floor.
Apartment Three B.

112
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,583
Oh no, I'm running out of time!

113
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,625
If I don't hurry up and get out
of here, I'll miss my flight!

114
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,666
Hey, what's that
guy's room number?

115
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,625
Three B.

116
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,416
Thank you!

117
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,208
Uh, we got a suspicious male

118
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,708
and female couple
on the loose...

119
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,208
I'm sending the pic
from the security camera.

120
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,458
Aw, really?

121
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,083
None of this is ringin' a bell.

122
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,458
Is this really my place?

123
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,000
Perfect fit.

124
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,750
What the hell?

125
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,000
It looks like a
terrorist lives here!

126
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,916
Reminds me of that movie...

127
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
What was it called again?

128
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,125
Taxi Driver...!

129
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,583
Except he had a
Mohawk, didn't he...

130
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
Some passports...

131
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,000
Man, there's a lot of 'em here.

132
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,583
Maybe I'm more of a Jason
Bourne than Travis Bickle.

133
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,541
They all have my pic...

134
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,666
I'm starting to wonder
if someone's setting me up.

135
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,000
No way...!

136
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,250
I think I really am a terrorist!

137
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,875
Could I have actually
killed people?

138
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,041
Hi.

139
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,916
You're the guy I gave my
coat to earlier, right...?

140
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,958
I hope you don't mind,
but I kind of need it back.

141
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,083
See, I forgot to
take out my passport

142
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,666
and wallet before
I gave it to you...

143
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,708
You can keep the coat.

144
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,791
I don't care about it...

145
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,083
I just need my stuff!

146
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,375
Hey, sure...
Hang on a second, okay?

147
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,291
Saki Morimi...

148
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,208
Born nineteen-eighty-nine.

149
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,833
There we go...! Looks good.

150
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,541
So the name is...

151
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,041
Akira Takizawa...

152
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,416
Cool...! So from now
on I'm Akira Takizawa.

153
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,416
What's he doing in there...?

154
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,833
Hurry up already.

155
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,291
Hello... I need to
ask you something.

156
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, sure. What?

157
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,875
The girl in this picture...
Is that you?

158
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:41,166
Um... well... I'm not, uh...

159
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,458
Sorry about that... Ready?

160
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,625
I uh...

161
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,500
Wait a second.

162
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,708
Come this way... please.

163
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,250
Sir, are you Japanese?

164
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,541
I'm gonna need
to see your, Johnny.

165
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,416
Whoa! It sure does look
like me, doesn't it...?

166
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,875
Crazy, huh?

167
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,416
What do you think?

168
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,625
Can you get a
positive ID off this?

169
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,875
Thank you. Have a nice date.

170
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,375
Okay, guess I passed.

171
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,583
Well... Take it easy.

172
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,083
Phew...

173
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,958
Good thing it was
so cold out there...

174
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,750
Let's hurry... this is
getting uncomfortable...

175
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,958
Wha-- What do you mean?

176
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,250
Nothing really...

177
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,375
it's just a little
toasty for my taste...

178
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,916
Hey... When are you
goin' back to Japan?

179
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Right now...
At least I'd hoped to.

180
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,750
Really...?

181
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,125
Then we should
go back together...

182
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,208
Come on...

183
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,208
What...? Wait!
I don't even have my...!

184
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,625
Huh?

185
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,875
I don't have my bag...

186
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,500
I dropped it to
catch up with you.

187
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,083
Wait, you mean way back
by the White House...?

188
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,416
Did you have anything
very important in there?

189
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,666
Just some presents...

190
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,458
and some clothes I like.

191
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,958
Oh... That's too bad...

192
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,041
We can't show our
faces around there.

193
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,583
I'll handle it...

194
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,416
You think you got
enough cash for a cab?

195
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,541
Here, get in. Go on.

196
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,833
Take us to the police...
Fast as you can.

197
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,750
The police, why?

198
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,041
So this passport isn't
a fake, after all...

199
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,250
Lucky me.

200
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,708
Here... One ticket and passport.

201
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,166
Thanks... I take it
you're well-traveled.

202
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,291
Yeah.

203
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,208
I have to admit my heart
was pounding at the embassy...

204
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,666
I didn't think they'd be
able to get us tickets...

205
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,916
Not to mention what would happen

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,708
if they found out we were lying.

207
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,250
Technically, we
didn't lie... you know...?

208
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,708
We even filed a police report
that the bags were stolen...

209
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,166
If we hadn't, the embassy

210
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,166
would've never
replaced our tickets.

211
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,041
You have to know how
to play their game

212
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,291
in order to get what you want.

213
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,833
Is that right?

214
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,958
So uh...

215
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,208
You've really gone
out of your way

216
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,666
to help me out today,
and I appreciate that...

217
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,958
but do you mind if
I ask you something

218
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,666
that's been bugging me?

219
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,041
Go ahead.

220
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,458
At the White House...

221
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,416
What exactly were
you doing there...?

222
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,958
Was it some kind
of naked protest?

223
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,583
You want the truth...?
I'm a terrorist.

224
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,291
Kidding... Ha.

225
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,375
It's just a little game we
exchange students like to play.

226
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,166
My buddies were adamant
I carry a gun this time,

227
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,875
even though it was just a fake.

228
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,125
Sounds kind of
extreme for a game.

229
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,625
Yeah, pretty much.

230
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,583
So tell me.
What were you doing in DC?

231
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,083
Huh...? Ah...

232
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,541
It was kind of a
college graduation trip...

233
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,250
We actually went to New York...

234
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
but I didn't wanna
come to America

235
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,083
and not see the White House...
so I slipped away.

236
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,500
Oh. Why'd you wanna see
the White House so bad?

237
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,041
I don't know...

238
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,375
Ever since I was a kid...

239
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,583
I've always seen it as
the center of the world.

240
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,875
That must sound strange, huh?

241
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,125
I mean, don't get me wrong,

242
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,166
I don't usually pay much
attention to the U.S.

243
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,916
But one day, I just started
thinking everything

244
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,583
from my little problems...

245
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,625
to the world as a whole,
it all seems to lead back here,

246
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,958
like it's all connected
at the root, ya know?

247
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,666
Besides, there's
some disturbing trends

248
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,583
going on in Japan right now.

249
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,625
It's like this heavy feeling
that we can't do anything

250
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,208
for ourselves anymore.

251
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,416
So I thought since I'm here

252
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I may as well make a
wish for that to change.

253
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,500
That's why you saw
those cops talking to me.

254
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,875
They saw me throw a
quarter over the fence.

255
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,833
Ah... And that's
when I interrupted you.

256
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,000
I actually
reconsidered my wish...

257
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,500
on the way down here...

258
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,375
I guess deep down
I know the U.S.

259
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,166
has nothing to do with
what goes on at home.

260
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,791
I gotcha. Kinda, anyway.

261
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,625
What's that?

262
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,166
But then someone
decided to whip out

263
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,250
a little terrorist act
and everything seemed to...

264
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:46,541
turn out fine.

265
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,333
Only thing that got
whipped out was my Johnny!

266
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,375
Funny... My name's Saki.

267
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,875
And I... Here ya go.

268
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,291
It says you're Akira Takizawa.

269
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,125
What?

270
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,750
I don't believe this.

271
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,750
You were born January 7th, 1989?

272
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,666
What are the odds
of this happening...?

273
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,500
It's gotta be at
least a million to one!

274
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,833
I gotta say...

275
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,125
Today's been one of the
strangest in my whole life.

276
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,083
Here we are, born
just one day apart...

277
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,708
Maybe destiny has
brought us together...!

278
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,458
Heh... Just kidding.

279
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,708
Or maybe I'm not...

280
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,166
Could he be... the prince I've
been looking for?

281
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,791
Nah, there's no way.

282
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,416
What's up?

283
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,541
You know that heavy feeling

284
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,500
in Japan you were
talking about...?

285
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,541
Looks like this could be it.

286
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,208
There's been a
missile attack on Tokyo.
