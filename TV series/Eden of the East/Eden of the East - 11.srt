1
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,541
Wait, so you're saying
Takizawa has a phone

2
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,541
that can do anything
he asks it to?

3
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,583
That's insane!

4
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,833
This line's too long!

5
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,083
Let's try somewhere else!

6
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,833
Anyway, before you
do anything else,

7
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,666
take a look at the
data that Panties sent...

8
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,416
I've tried calling him,
but he's not picking up.

9
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,583
I'll take a closer
look as soon as I can...

10
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,750
but whatever you do,
do not come to Toyosu!

11
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,541
Huh...? How come?

12
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,166
Well uh...

13
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,958
You know those twenty-thousand
missing NEETs...?

14
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,708
They're all in the movie theater
right now looking for Takizawa.

15
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,625
This place isn't safe anymore.

16
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,791
I'm impressed, Hirasawa.

17
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,083
How'd you find this spot?

18
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,916
I saw it in the
real estate documents.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,625
So do you really
think we'll be all right

20
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,166
if we hide in here?

21
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,500
It's our only option.

22
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,875
We can't reason with a
bunch of angry, naked men.

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,500
Wow.

24
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,750
They seem more concerned
with finding their phones

25
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,750
than they do about
freezing to death.

26
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,166
I'm not surprised.

27
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,541
Their phones are
obviously important to them.

28
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,458
Hello?

29
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey, it's me.

30
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,875
So we're gonna head
your way after all.

31
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,791
It'll be much faster to go
over all the data together.

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,041
Okay.

33
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,458
But are you absolutely
certain there will be

34
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,875
a sixty-missile
attack this time...?

35
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,500
And if so, is there
anything we can do ourselves

36
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,916
to stop it from happening...?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,083
It's not like we have magical
phones at our disposal.

38
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,458
I don't think Takizawa
saved all those people

39
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,500
on Careless Monday because
he had a "magic" phone...

40
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,333
I think he did it because
that's what needed to be done.

41
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,250
Then what was the point of
erasing his memories...?

42
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,833
And it certainly doesn't explain

43
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,375
why all these NEETs
are so angry with him.

44
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,541
He's right, Saki!

45
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,916
They wouldn't be so pissed

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,291
if he hadn't done something
to make 'em that way!

47
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,250
Osugi...

48
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,750
Takizawa had to do more

49
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,166
than just protect people
from the missiles.

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,125
He also had to protect
the twenty-thousand NEETs

51
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,291
who helped with the evacuation.

52
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,125
To draw suspicion
away from them,

53
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,916
he set himself up to
look like the sole bad guy,

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,708
then wiped his memory.

55
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,041
After he got that phone and
learned about the attacks,

56
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,708
Takizawa used the Internet
to anonymously assemble

57
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:00,166
an army of volunteers,
and they evacuated people

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,833
from the landing
sites by methods

59
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,708
that were borderline criminal...

60
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,125
And you're saying the volunteers

61
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,000
were the twenty-thousand NEETs?

62
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, I think so...

63
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,625
But after the missiles hit and
the initial shock wore off,

64
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,958
the people they'd rescued
started getting angry,

65
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,666
and venting to the media...

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,125
They wanted answers:

67
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,041
How did anyone know to evacuate
them in the first place?

68
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,333
Was there some ulterior
motive behind it all?

69
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,250
See, Takizawa's volunteers
didn't really know

70
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,958
for certain that the missiles
would come, so apparently,

71
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,875
some of them had
used the opportunity

72
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,166
to steal things at the sites.

73
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,875
Most of them, though,
were simply excited

74
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,416
and proud to have been part
of saving so many lives.

75
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,166
But they had to keep
their involvement a secret.

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,208
And when many of the people
who'd lost their homes

77
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,958
in the attacks remained
vocal about their suspicions

78
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,625
that they'd somehow
been deceived...

79
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,125
well, eventually, the NEETs

80
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,291
couldn't remain
silent any longer.

81
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,666
They began firing back at
the evacuees in forums

82
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,875
and message boards online...

83
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,083
and very quickly,
the different rumors

84
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,416
and conspiracy theories began
to spiral out of control...

85
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,916
So, to help diffuse
the situation,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,583
Takizawa used a number of
aliases to gather the NEETs

87
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,333
at the mall in Toyosu,
and he redirected their anger

88
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,916
by telling them
he'd been the one

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,916
who orchestrated
the missile attacks.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,291
That explains why they know him

91
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,000
by so many different names,
and why they're still

92
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,791
so openly angry with him...

93
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,250
That, and the fact that he
helped shipped them to Dubai

94
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,041
for three months to shield
them from the spotlight

95
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,000
until media interest
in the story died down...

96
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,958
Public opinion can be fickle.

97
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,750
And people are quick to latch
on to unfounded rumors...

98
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,583
Especially in times of crisis,

99
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,250
when all they really want
is someone to blame...

100
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,541
Takizawa was betrayed
by the people he'd gone

101
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,250
to such great lengths to
protect, so he lost hope...

102
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,333
And that's what led him
to erase his memories...

103
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,541
Has he remembered
all this himself?

104
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,708
I don't know...

105
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,291
What I do know is,
it's up to us this time.

106
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,500
We have to find a way

107
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,291
to stop these new
attacks from happening.

108
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,250
Dammit, why did you have to
get us involved in all this?!

109
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,083
Even if Takizawa is a
good person at heart...

110
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,958
it's obvious that the
guy is a complete idiot...

111
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,166
He has a phone

112
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,750
that can literally do
anything, and yet...

113
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,375
he still finds a way
to screw everything up!

114
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,000
I think the missile
target areas are listed

115
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,583
in the data Itazu
sent over to us...

116
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,375
If we use the Internet
like Takizawa did

117
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,708
for Careless Monday...

118
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,416
there's a chance we
may be able to stop it.

119
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,833
Yeah, good idea...

120
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,750
Nowadays, even the threat
of violence is enough

121
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,250
to get you arrested...

122
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,041
I'm sure that we'll get
some sort of reaction...

123
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,958
if we post another missile
attack is on the way...

124
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,166
But...

125
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,416
But what?

126
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,375
We can't post anything
to the Net right now.

127
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,000
What do you mean?

128
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,083
The laptop with
all the data on it...

129
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,958
has fallen into the
hands of the zombies!

130
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,208
I'm so sorry!

131
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,583
I must've left it on the
bar when we ran out of there!

132
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,250
Hey look...! I see it!

133
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,666
Where?

134
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,750
Right there. It's that guy!

135
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,875
But how are we supposed
to get it back from him?

136
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,625
I think I know...!

137
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,708
Our only chance is to hit
them with a stealth attack.

138
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,916
Which means we should
all take our clothes off!

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,750
Huh...? Wait, you
want us to strip?

140
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,750
Yes...! It makes
perfect sense...

141
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,000
The best place to hide a
tree is in the woods...

142
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:33,916
So to blend in with the NEETs,

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,375
we should all be naked!

144
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,416
Looks like they
haven't noticed us yet...

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,333
Guess my plan is working, huh?

146
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,041
It would appear so.

147
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,625
Let's go...!

148
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,791
Don't hesitate,
you have to commit!

149
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:11,250
Yeah... I guess you're right.

150
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,125
You have got to be kidding me!

151
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,625
I don't know how
we're gonna do it,

152
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,916
but we have to find the others.

153
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,250
I say we run as fast as we
can and hope for the best.

154
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,416
Girls!!

155
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,958
Nice laptop you got there.

156
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,416
Oh thanks...

157
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,416
but it's useless
without the password.

158
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,083
Let me take a shot at it.

159
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,541
Wait a sec...
You guys have hair.

160
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,375
And you're really pale.

161
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,833
Excuse me. Run!

162
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,083
Oh great, they're following us.

163
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,208
Don't worry.

164
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,375
They look like the type

165
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,916
who are only into
two-dimensional girls.

166
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,250
This way!

167
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,625
Get back here!

168
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,541
Osugi...! Catch!

169
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,791
Run Os...

170
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,625
Run...! Don't stop-Keep going!

171
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,958
Saki!

172
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,333
Osugi, why aren't you
wearing any clothes?

173
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,458
Don't let the computer touch it!

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,041
Geez, do you have any idea

175
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,541
what I went through
to get that back?

176
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,041
Sorry, but all that matters
right now is the data!

177
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,333
Come on...! Get in here!

178
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,416
Sis!

179
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,541
Sis!

180
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,125
I'm so glad you two are okay!

181
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,250
Enough with the hugs,
let's get to work!

182
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,166
If I remember correctly,

183
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,000
we should be looking
for some red text.

184
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,208
Like this?

185
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,041
The Diet building
and Roppongi are listed!

186
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,166
All right, let's split this up.

187
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,875
First, send it to all
of our cell phones.

188
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,708
You got it.

189
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,833
Wait...! Oh no... Look at this!

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Toyosu?

191
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,791
What the hell?

192
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,583
Test 1-2-3...

193
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,208
Just making sure
the camera's working.

194
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,583
It's Takizawa!

195
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,875
Can you believe this?

196
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,291
Hey, Johnnies...!

197
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,333
You may be wondering

198
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,708
why I've gathered
you here today.

199
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,041
Well, believe me,
it's for a good reason.

200
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,541
I'm minutes away
from launching yet

201
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,708
another missile attack to kill
each and every one of you.

202
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,916
I'm getting rid of everyone
who knows the truth

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,083
about Careless Monday
and teaching the rest

204
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,041
of the country a
lesson all in one shot.

205
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,291
That's a lie!

206
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,750
Why would you say
something like that...?

207
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,291
I know you're not capable
of committing mass murder...

208
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,750
Stop joking around
and tell the truth!

209
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,583
Believe me, this is not a joke.

210
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,041
But there is good news.

211
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,291
You still have a
chance to survive...

212
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,208
If any of you Johnnies
wanna live, head to the roof.

213
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,041
I'll meet ya there.

214
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,083
Takizawa.

215
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,375
Damn it! I can't believe
we let Juiz slip away!

216
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,375
Sorry kid, but from here on out

217
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,708
it's every man for himself...

218
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,375
I believe Mister Outside
is still alive after all

219
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,416
and I plan on locating him...

220
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,958
If I find anything
I'll contact you,

221
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,250
otherwise don't expect
to hear from me.

222
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,333
But...

223
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,625
I think you've been
played, my friend.

224
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,750
What do you mean?

225
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,791
I mean you're really stickin'
your neck out on this one...

226
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,291
What if he's the Supporter,

227
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,916
did you ever stop
to think of that?

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,750
He put you up to
launching another attack,

229
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,833
to eliminate the witnesses...

230
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,666
Well, what if he's just setting
you up for an epic failure

231
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,708
so he can take you
out of the game?

232
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,166
Best of luck to you, man...

233
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,541
But keep your eye out for
that clown Number Nine...

234
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,833
I'm pretty sure he's gonna
try to pull somethin' again.

235
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:04,916
It's too late!

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,125
He can't stop it.

237
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,583
Didn't you read the news?

238
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,750
They altered the strategic
programming protocols

239
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,541
for the Patriot missile
systems... Two days ago.

240
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,041
Save yourselves.

241
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,041
We'll find a way out
of here eventually.

242
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,250
That won't be easy...

243
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,500
All of the fire
exits are blocked.

244
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,666
You think we can make
it to the elevator?

245
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,083
Uh, hold on.

246
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,000
Hold that door.
Hold on, wait! Wait!

247
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,916
That was close!

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,791
Open up!

249
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,166
Hey! Come on, guys!

250
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,833
Wait for the next one!

251
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,083
Osugi!

252
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,875
It's him!

253
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,375
Takizawa?!

254
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,750
You must be Osugi.

255
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,750
You've got balls... and
I expected nothing less.

256
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,583
Takizawa, wait!

257
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,750
You didn't come here
to kill everyone.

258
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,500
You're here to
save 'em, right...?

259
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,916
You're gonna paint yourself
as the bad guy again...

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,750
to protect us!

261
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,541
So you listened in on
the phone all the way

262
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,625
to the end, huh?

263
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,125
Until my battery ran out, yeah.

264
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,500
Afterwards, I went
back to Itazu's place

265
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,166
and found out that he had sent
all the logs over to Hirasawa.

266
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,166
So...

267
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,958
I knew you guys
would eventually turn up

268
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,791
here once you saw the data.

269
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,375
Your memories... are they back?

270
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,291
Hey, guys...!
Good to see you again...!

271
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,875
The missiles should be
arriving any minute now!

272
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,416
This time around...

273
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,916
I want you to post
solutions for shooting down

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,833
the missiles onto the
Eden of the East website!

275
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,708
Look at 'em go!

276
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,125
Yeah.

277
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,666
Ah, the power of crowd-sourcing.

278
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,833
Put enough minds together
and you can achieve brilliance.

279
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,208
Just you watch.

280
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,333
I'm sure they'll come up
with something miraculous,

281
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,708
just like they did
on Careless Monday.

282
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,875
It's not like I did that
all by myself, you know.

283
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,375
Come on, guys!

284
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,666
Get hacking! What?

285
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,375
We're not hacking anything.

286
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,250
Juiz?

287
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,833
This is Juiz...

288
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,208
I've culled the information from
the posts on Eden of the East

289
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,708
and have narrowed them down

290
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,875
to the most effective ways
of countering the missiles...

291
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,041
I pray for your continuing
service as a Savior.

292
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,666
Thank you...
Let's get started then.

293
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,166
Bang!

294
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,250
Hey, you made it.

295
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,666
Is Takizawa the one who
called in the fighter jets?

296
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,833
Yep... but he could
never have done it

297
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,000
without the help
of all these NEETs.

298
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,916
This is amazing.

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,125
Is this happening
all over Japan?

300
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,083
Anytime you want
to come and save me,

301
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,583
I'll be waiting for you...

302
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,625
Selecao Number Nine.

303
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,916
Well would you
look at that... I did it.

304
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,750
He can shoot down all
the missiles he wants.

305
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,875
Doesn't change the fact

306
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,708
this country's at
the end of its rope.

307
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:39,375
It looks like he
made it just in time.

308
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,750
Bang!

309
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,041
Who am I, the
Sundance Kid...? Idiot...

310
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,166
Saki!

311
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:46,958
Hey, Juiz?

312
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,250
Yes?

313
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,416
I'm afraid this time
around passing myself off

314
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,458
as a terrorist won't be
enough to cover all my tracks.

315
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,458
So I'd like you to use
the rest of my balance

316
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,833
to make me the King of Japan.

317
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,500
Did you say... king?

318
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,916
That's right.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,708
There are a lot of intelligent
people in this country,

320
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,458
but none of them are willing
to step up and lead the way.

321
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,875
Honestly...

322
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,250
I'd rather not be the guy
to have to do it, either...

323
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,916
But there's one girl
who truly believes in me.

324
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,666
Order accepted...
Noblesse oblige...

325
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,666
I pray you shall be a splendid
prince the next time we speak.

326
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,208
When that time comes...

327
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,166
I hope I'm the same as I am now.

328
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, Juiz! One more thing!

329
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,666
Damn it... Well isn't
that a shame...

330
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,166
No gold ring on
this merry-go-round.

331
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,833
And so he became a prince...

332
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,541
In this world without a King.
