1
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,458
First you extend your
trip all of a sudden...

2
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,458
And then you stay out all night?

3
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,208
Oh, hey, Ryosuke.

4
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,541
I thought graduation trips
were about leaving

5
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,791
the student in you behind

6
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,541
and taking that first
step into adulthood...

7
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,166
So what happened
with that interview

8
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,375
you had scheduled
the other day...?

9
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,041
I heard that you didn't make it.

10
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,416
Um...

11
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,708
I'm just glad you're
home safe and sound.

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,250
I'd head to your room
if I were you...

13
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,458
The last thing you want is
for Asako to chew you out.

14
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,083
This whole
"having no memory" thing

15
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,583
is seriously gettin' annoying...

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,083
This business about me
killing twenty-thousand NEET's.

17
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,250
Is it true?

18
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,583
I'm terribly sorry...

19
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,208
I have no information
as to what happened

20
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,125
to them after their abduction.

21
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,166
Okay, that's fair enough...

22
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,458
Let's try a different angle.

23
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,791
Was I the one responsible
for kidnapping them?

24
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,875
You were.

25
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,250
Are you kidding me?!

26
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,416
Then I must've done it.

27
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,125
Okay, next question.

28
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,333
Do you know why I was
chosen to be a Seleção?

29
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,583
I couldn't say.

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,083
I was never informed of
the selection criteria.

31
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,291
So... then you
really don't know?

32
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,708
Correct.

33
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,166
Then can you at least tell
me what the Supporter is?

34
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,583
Of course.

35
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,291
The Supporter is one of
the twelve Seleção members,

36
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,166
tasked with the job of
eliminating those

37
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,041
who are deemed unfit
as an effective savior.

38
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,208
And that's me, right?

39
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,083
I'm not at liberty
to divulge that.

40
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,208
So... in other words
I'm just spinning my wheels

41
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,125
trying to ask you about myself.

42
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,666
Yes. Exactly.

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,583
Then who am I supposed to ask?

44
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,666
I thought you were
supposed to help me out

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,875
in these situations.

46
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,041
Oh right, the Detective
said my best bet

47
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,083
is to ask the other Seleção.

48
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,666
This one sure is busy.

49
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,916
It seems like he's got something
new going on every minute...

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,791
Is Number Five
constantly barraging you

51
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,291
with requests all day?

52
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,333
No, not at all...

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,375
Whenever I receive
complex requests

54
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,958
I itemize each step,
individually.

55
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,375
I see, so all of these
combine into one request.

56
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,916
I'm seeing here that
someone had an MRI machine

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,750
delivered two days ago
from Toyo Medical Tech.

58
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,625
Can you find out
who that is for me?

59
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,833
Order received.

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,333
I pray for your continuing
service as a savior.

61
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,083
Just one missile did all that?

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,666
Hey! Get away from there!

63
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,666
What an idiot.

64
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,166
Didn't he see the huge sign
and cones back there?

65
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,333
For a second I really thought

66
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,000
he was gonna drive
right off the edge...

67
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,000
You know, like in that movie.

68
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,333
Huh, what movie?

69
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,958
Um, it's that British
flick from the 70's.

70
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,500
I remember a guy
driving his scooter off

71
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,875
a cliff in the last scene.

72
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,208
I just can't think of the title.

73
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,291
You think I would know?

74
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,083
Nobody watches
old movies anymore.

75
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,916
What? Sure they do.

76
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,500
Johnny!

77
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:07,166
Johnny...! Johnny! Hey!

78
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,458
Hey... get off me!

79
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,500
Stop it...!

80
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,375
Geez, you don't have to bite me!

81
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:26,083
You buncha useless bastards!!!!

82
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,291
Hey... You okay down there?

83
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,958
It's called Quadrophenia.

84
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,083
Huh?

85
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,875
It's the name of the movie

86
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,791
you two were talking
about just now.

87
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,583
Yeah...! That's it...!

88
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,500
It was right on
the tip of my tongue.

89
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,708
For the record I'm
nothing like that guy...

90
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,500
I may be in a rough spot,
but I'm not that bad off.

91
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,041
How do I get to the
Kanetsu Expressway?

92
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,958
Oh, really...?

93
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,208
I think she just got home
sometime this morning...

94
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:27,500
Yeah... she told me she stayed
at Micchon's last night.

95
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,625
Saki... Osugi's on
the phone for you...

96
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,416
Are you up or
you still sleeping?

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,958
I'm up.

98
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,416
He must be worried.

99
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,208
This is the fifth
time he's called.

100
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, Osugi?

101
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,166
Did I wake you?

102
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,875
Oh, no... Sorry I didn't
call you earlier.

103
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,750
It's alright.

104
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,625
I'm just happy you're okay...

105
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,625
So did you and Micchon
have a fun time last night?

106
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,583
Yeah.

107
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,666
That's cool...

108
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,416
Uh... What ever happened
with your interview?

109
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
They understood
once I explained,

110
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,875
so I rescheduled
it for tomorrow.

111
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,000
That's great...!

112
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,291
So, do you want to go together?

113
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,750
I have a prospective employee

114
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,458
training seminar
starting tomorrow.

115
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,541
But... isn't that
out of the way?

116
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,375
Oh no, it's not a big deal...

117
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,625
I know how much of a
beating interviews can be.

118
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,708
If you're with someone

119
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,416
it's easier to build up
your confidence.

120
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,291
Okay... That sounds good.

121
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,458
Awesome... See ya...

122
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,541
I can't believe she lied to me.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,541
What am I doing?

124
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,916
Excuse me. How you doing?

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,416
I have a question for you...

126
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,416
I understand someone purchased
an MRI machine recently...

127
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,083
Would you mind telling me
who it was that bought it?

128
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,041
Don't think I've ever
heard that one before...

129
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,750
Uh... if I had to guess,
I'd say it was the Director

130
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,625
who does most of
the purchasing here.

131
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,958
That makes sense...

132
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,375
Look, I really appreciate
you helping me out...

133
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,958
Would you mind calling
up the Director

134
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,041
and telling him
I'm waiting to see him?

135
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,708
I'm sorry, but do you...

136
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,541
have an appointment?

137
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,166
Uh, no...

138
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,750
Tell ya what: Let him know
a Seleção is downstairs...

139
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,583
and I'm sure he'll fit me in.

140
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
Here's my number.

141
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,916
There's a lot of
old people here.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,333
I wonder what's up with that?

143
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,166
Paging Doctor Azuma.

144
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,833
Line Five.
Doctor Azuma. Line Five.

145
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,500
You don't wanna
read this trash...

146
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,666
To us patients,

147
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,875
Doctor Hiura is nothing
short of a savior.

148
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,833
I don't care
what the papers say.

149
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,708
Savior?

150
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,875
That's what I said.

151
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,750
I didn't stutter,
you little jackass...

152
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,166
Saki Morimi...

153
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,083
Yeah, hello?

154
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,833
Is this the gentleman
claiming to be a Seleção?

155
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,958
Yes... Um.. My name's Takizawa.

156
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,416
How did you find me?

157
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,666
I was reading the
activity logs on my phone

158
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,916
and saw that an MRI machine
was delivered here, recently.

159
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,541
What is your number, son?

160
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,625
'Scuse me?

161
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,625
Your number.
Which Seleção are you?

162
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,166
Oh, uh, Number Nine.

163
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,583
You don't say...

164
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,083
So Number Nine is the Supporter.

165
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,875
Now hold on just a minute...

166
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,708
Detective Kondo said the
exact same thing to me...

167
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,791
I'm trying to find
out what that means.

168
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,250
Kondo. You mean Number Four?

169
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,666
That's right... Look, Doctor...

170
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,708
I'd prefer it if we
talked face-to-face.

171
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,500
For some reason I decided
to erase my memory,

172
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,000
so I'm kinda in the dark
about a lot of this...

173
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,500
My phone, the fact
that I'm a Seleção,

174
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,208
the game we're all playing.

175
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,083
It's all a blur to me.

176
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,291
All I want...

177
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,583
is for you to answer
a few of my questions.

178
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,166
Come on, I'm asking nicely.

179
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,875
I have no qualms with
you eliminating me...

180
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,083
I'm well aware of the rules...

181
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,500
However I'm reluctant
to be killed

182
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,458
while there's still
money in my account.

183
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm... not here for that.

184
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,375
Then I guess the point is moot.

185
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,875
I'm sending you some medicine.

186
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,333
Take the pills to find out

187
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,333
how you came into
possession of the phone.

188
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,041
I guarantee you will
find the information

189
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,958
I have to offer well worth it.

190
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,458
This, uh, medicine
you want me to take.

191
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,833
You mind telling
me what's in it?

192
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,083
It's just a little something.

193
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:58,833
What the...?

194
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,041
Hey, hold on...

195
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,875
Am I not allowed any
time to think this over?

196
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,666
Ah, forget it.

197
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,250
Damn it...

198
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,041
I think the quack just
poisoned me...! Bastard!

199
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,625
What the hell kinda
doctor is this guy?

200
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,166
Greetings to you.

201
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,916
My name is Mister Outside.

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,375
Mister Outside?

203
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,416
Guided by my own highly
personal convictions,

204
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,000
I have taken it upon myself
to select twelve individuals

205
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:17,000
to act as saviors in an attempt
to rescue this country of ours.

206
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,958
I am calling each of
these saviors Seleção,

207
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,541
and I have appointed one of them

208
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,291
into a very important role,
that of the Supporter.

209
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,708
From this moment forward,

210
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,625
you are no longer just a
citizen, you are a Seleção.

211
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,125
Congratulations.

212
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,458
As for the Supporter,

213
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,500
you can think of that
role as the "twelfth man."

214
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,000
A fierce advocate for the team,

215
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,041
as well as a cold-hearted
sentinel who is always watching.

216
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,208
Be aware that if at any
time your performance

217
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,541
as a Seleção is deemed
to be unsatisfactory,

218
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,583
you should expect to
face swift judgment

219
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,083
at the hands of the Supporter.

220
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,416
So I take it I'm not
the Supporter then?

221
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,333
The answer to that is a
closely guarded secret

222
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,958
known only by me.

223
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,083
It may be you, or it may not.

224
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,583
As for the twelve I have
hand-picked out of millions,

225
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,041
each is an individual who has
an inherently strong desire

226
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,500
to be a Seleção, whether
they realize it or not.

227
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,875
Therefore, participation in
this mission is compulsory.

228
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,708
Refusal is not an option.

229
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,708
The phone I have given you
contains ten billion yen.

230
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,916
How you decide to use the
funds is entirely up to you.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
All I ask is that you use
the money to lead this country

232
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
towards what you feel
is the right path,

233
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,291
using any methods necessary.

234
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,291
But please note that
the ten billion cannot,

235
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,791
under any circumstances,
be converted to cash.

236
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,291
Should you have any requests,

237
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,166
a concierge is available to
you twenty-four hours a day

238
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,708
by pushing the center
button on your phone.

239
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,708
Upon utilizing your concierge,

240
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,916
the costs of any
requests will be deducted

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,291
from the ten billion.

242
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,791
The eleven other
Seleção will be able

243
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,875
to see your purchase in their
phone's activity history.

244
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,583
Be aware that there
are penalties involved

245
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,875
with this venture.

246
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,291
Any Seleção who meets
the following conditions

247
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,208
during the course of
this mission will face

248
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,000
a certain death carried
out by the Supporter.

249
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,791
First: those who wish to abandon

250
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,458
the mission or
attempt to escape...

251
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,750
Second: those who go
long periods of time

252
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,750
without using their phone
and post no results...

253
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,875
Third: those who are
caught using the ten billion

254
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,291
to serve their own,
personal needs rather than

255
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,250
the needs of the
country at large...

256
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,083
And Fourth: those whose
balance reaches zero

257
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,916
before accomplishing
the ultimate goal

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,583
of saving the nation.

259
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,125
However, these four rules
are by no means exhaustive.

260
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,750
I would like my chosen twelve
to take full responsibility

261
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,375
for any actions they may take.

262
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,291
And last but not least, the
first Seleção to accomplish

263
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,291
the mission will be deemed the
victor and ultimately survive.

264
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,083
Any remaining Seleção will
be immediately terminated.

265
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,291
There is absolutely
no way around this.

266
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,625
Wait, are you serious...?

267
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,791
So just being picked
is a death sentence!

268
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,166
That is all I have
for you at this time...

269
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,541
Remember, I chose
you for a reason.

270
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,375
If you can tap into the hidden
power I know you possess,

271
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,958
and become the first Seleção
to successfully save this nation

272
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,458
from the peril it faces,

273
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,416
you will be brought
to my location at once.

274
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,958
Noblesse oblige...

275
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,500
I sincerely pray that you
will become our savior...

276
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,458
Don't let me down.

277
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,291
I'm curious, Doc.

278
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,083
Did you get the same
dog and pony show

279
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,833
when you got your phone?

280
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,333
I suppose it was a
little over-the-top.

281
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,875
Why'd it have to be like this?

282
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,333
I wanted to see my
final request granted today

283
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,208
in front of the Prefectural
Assembly meeting...

284
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,958
I wasn't certain if you
were the Supporter or not...

285
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,583
That's why I drugged you.

286
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,291
What you just
experienced is identical

287
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,833
to my own initiation.

288
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,375
For me it was after
stumbling into a taxi drunk

289
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,791
and covered in vomit.

290
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,583
Only then did I notice the
strange box staring at me.

291
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,708
Well you didn't have
to replicate the vomit.

292
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,000
So was it any different for you?

293
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,375
Did you choose to join the game
or were you forced to, like me?

294
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,208
I had no choice...

295
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,083
but... in a way
I didn't mind it...

296
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,208
You see, I'm a brain surgeon,

297
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,166
but it limits me to helping
only one person at a time.

298
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,750
And I know I'm capable
of doing more.

299
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,708
After all, the number
of lives a doctor can save

300
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,416
in his career pales
in comparison

301
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,541
to the population as a whole.

302
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,541
Take a look at something.

303
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,833
I had a law changed that
allowed me to transform

304
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,625
this neighborhood into
a self-sustaining utopia

305
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,458
where patients and their
families can live and work.

306
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,291
Uh...

307
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,083
My story is a simple one...

308
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,541
Japan was on the verge
of abandoning its elderly...

309
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,708
so I decided to
exhaust my ten billion

310
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,125
creating a private hospital...

311
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,250
where we could give them
work and low-cost health care.

312
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,208
The only thing left to
do is ensure the system

313
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,166
is self-manageable,
preferably by the government.

314
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,958
Then my work will be done.

315
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,875
I just scanned your history...

316
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,000
They all look like bribes to me.

317
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,583
Juiz is absolutely brilliant...

318
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,916
She was able to win
over the entire Assembly

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
in what would take any
normal person decades.

320
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,875
Juiz did that...? Wait.

321
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,000
Does this mean that...

322
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,750
me and the other
Seleção are going to be

323
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,000
terminated by the Supporter?

324
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,625
No. That won't happen.

325
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,083
Honestly, I created this
hospital and community

326
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,416
for personal reasons
and nothing more.

327
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,958
In the end I doubt
it will impress

328
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,041
Mister Outside in the slightest.

329
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,875
If all this work
isn't enough to win,

330
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,541
then what the hell does he
expect the rest of us to do...?

331
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,208
This Mister Outside
sounds like the devil.

332
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,916
Funny you should say that.

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,250
I see him as more
of a generous god.

334
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,958
You know...

335
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,666
we've been pulled into a
game of life and death here.

336
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,458
I don't want to
die anytime soon...

337
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,250
but how about if I give
you half my money...

338
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,500
to keep you going?

339
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,958
You're a thoughtful kid
and I appreciate that...

340
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,750
but I've never had any intention
on actually winning this game.

341
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,333
Don't hesitate to fire away

342
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,625
with any questions
you may still have...

343
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,583
Although if you ask me
who it is you are...

344
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,625
I'm not sure I could
answer that one.

345
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,791
Okay. What've I done up to now?

346
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,916
I've spent around
two billion so far.

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,208
Well, you bought
the shopping mall

348
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,416
in that ghost town...

349
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,958
five hundred
shipping containers...

350
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,875
and some Foreign Office
entertainment...

351
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,125
It would seem to
me that you've been

352
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,000
quite the busy guy lately.

353
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,958
Yeah, but have I...

354
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,541
killed a lot of people?

355
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,958
Sorry, but that's one question
I'm not able to answer.

356
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,250
You sure about that?

357
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,541
You had a goal that
was so important to you

358
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,916
it was worth wiping
away your memory...

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Judging solely by
your activity logs,

360
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,750
the old Number Nine
was an appealing,

361
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,458
fearless and
highly-driven individual.

362
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,833
You had a good life you
were willing to give up...

363
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,750
in order to bet everything
on your future self...

364
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,083
That's why I believe you should

365
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,416
continue on the
path you're on now.

366
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,791
I'm glad I got to
meet you before I die.

367
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,625
Come on, don't
talk like that...!

368
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,041
You're still...

369
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,708
I hope you turn out
to be the true savior.

370
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,833
Juiz speaking.

371
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,416
Hello again...

372
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,125
I just wanted to thank you
for all your help...

373
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,208
If it weren't for you,

374
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,958
I never would have been
able to accomplish all I did.

375
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,500
That's nonsense...

376
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,750
I should be apologizing
for not doing enough.

377
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,291
No... you were great...

378
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,083
Thanks, Juiz.

379
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,833
So... You're the Supporter, huh?

380
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,708
All right.

381
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,708
I'm ready to die...
I have no regrets.

382
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,041
The Supporter's here?!

383
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,458
Doctor Hiura...

384
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,750
You deserve better than this.

385
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,291
I hate this game...

386
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,291
What kind of a maniac would
think this is a good idea?

387
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,666
I wanna deck the bastard...

388
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,125
who gave me this phone.
