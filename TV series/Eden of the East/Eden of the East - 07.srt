1
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,750
Okay...

2
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,833
You're right, it does
look like Eden's mascot.

3
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,458
That confirms it.

4
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,625
That looks exactly
like his bag,

5
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,500
and he's always had
that charm on it...

6
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,458
This picture was taken
today around noon...

7
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:52,208
"Help me. Johnny Hunter...
I'm gonna die... Hotel?"

8
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,208
It's consistent with the legend.

9
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,666
Looks like the area the
Johnny Hunter grabbed him

10
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,541
in is pretty close to where
Kasuga last saw him.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,583
There's a lot of
circumstantial evidence

12
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,208
pointing towards
this being Osugi.

13
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,375
So who's this Johnny Hunter
you guys've been talking about?

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,000
It's an urban legend that's

15
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,833
been going around
the last few years...

16
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,375
There's this beautiful woman...

17
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,833
who lures innocent young virgins
like us into hotel rooms...

18
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,458
and if they can't, you know,
"perform," to her liking...

19
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,500
then she slices
off their Johnny!

20
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,041
Some are claiming the number

21
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,500
of her victims to be
over twenty-thousand!

22
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,125
Twenty-thou? Some coincidence...

23
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,166
you sure they're not
just mixing 'em up

24
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,708
with my twenty-thousand?

25
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,916
I don't get it.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,166
Why would he ask for help
on a message board...?

27
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,791
If this really is Osugi...

28
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,208
Don't you think
he would at least

29
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,333
try to contact one
of us directly?

30
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,750
This is a special forum
made for lonely singles...

31
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,708
and Osugi is on
here all the time.

32
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,791
He's been in a really
fragile state recently,

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,166
depressed about not
having anyone in his life.

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,291
I'm afraid he let his
guard down last night.

35
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,291
And in a desperate attempt
to fill the void in his heart,

36
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,375
he left with the first woman

37
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,416
who would make eye
contact with him.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,833
I'm sure he's just filled with

39
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,625
too much pride and embarrassment
to call us for help...!

40
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,875
Oh! Poor Osugi!

41
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,166
I know exactly how he feels!

42
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,458
So who is this Osugi, anyway?

43
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,500
The poor guy was
drunk out of his mind...

44
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,875
If only I had taken him home

45
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,666
after dinner last night,
then none of this...

46
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,708
would have happened!

47
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:41,083
You went to dinner...?
Was that for--

48
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,500
That's right...!

49
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,166
It was the date he was supposed
to have with you, Saki!

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,458
Not me!

51
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,666
Dumbass!

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,833
Would you guys
mind filling me in?

53
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,375
Look! A new image just uploaded!

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:01,625
It looks like a picture of
his reflection in the window.

55
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,250
Is that what he
was wearing?! Look!

56
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,625
Yeah, it's definitely him.

57
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,916
I'm positive.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,625
Hey, what is that?

59
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,583
I think it's a... piano.

60
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,250
Try running it through
Eden's search engine.

61
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,833
It's a Steinway Louis the
Fifteenth, Model M-1150.

62
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,208
Super rare.

63
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,625
Japan purchased a few
during the economic bubble.

64
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,333
Since we know the manufacturer

65
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,500
and the model number, we can
find out where it was purchased!

66
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,541
Way to go, Eden!

67
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,750
I knew we could count on you!

68
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,083
There's a new comment...

69
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:43,375
"Her accomplice's name is Juiz."
Who could that be?

70
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,208
Juiz? No way...

71
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,291
And where are you off to?

72
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,250
I might have an
idea where he's at,

73
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,166
so I'm gonna check it out.

74
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,291
I need you to find me
a piano in the area.

75
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,208
It's a Steinway
Louis the Fifteenth.

76
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,750
Model M-1150.

77
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,791
It's had some repairs
done to its legs.

78
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,875
Order received.

79
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,250
I found it...

80
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,916
That piano is
currently in Room 1109

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,958
of the Hotel Insomnia
in Roppongi.

82
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,666
What name is the
room booked under?

83
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,125
A woman by the name
of Hanako Roppongi

84
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,750
has occupied the room
for over a year now.

85
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,291
Sounds fake to me...

86
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,041
Can you find out her real name?

87
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,125
Hey, Juiz?

88
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,916
Yes?

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,541
Are you familiar with
the Johnny Hunter?

90
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,958
No... Would you like me
to do some research?

91
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,708
Nah... forget it.

92
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,500
I've got it.

93
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,500
Her real name is
Diana Kuroha Shiratori.

94
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,666
She is the CEO of Monolom,

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,500
a talent agency
for foreign models.

96
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,125
Where is she right now?

97
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,000
Location confirmed...

98
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,583
She is currently
traveling by car

99
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,041
in Minato near the main
Roppongi intersection.

100
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,000
I bet that's right
near the hotel...

101
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,708
Juiz... I need you
to stop her for me.

102
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,791
Is there a specific method
you'd like me to use?

103
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,250
I don't care. The police...?

104
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,458
Whatever's the quickest, got it?

105
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,458
Order received...
Noblesse oblige...

106
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,916
Even though you are now
guilty of abusing state power,

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I still pray for your
continuing service as a savior.

108
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,958
What's wrong, officer?
I was going the speed limit.

109
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,625
Evening, ma'am...

110
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,833
License and
registration, please.

111
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,875
Number Nine's trying
to make contact with me.

112
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:52,208
But why? I feel... honored.

113
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:59,916
Hey! Get back here!

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,083
Juiz.

115
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,541
Find me the motorcycle
that went through

116
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,625
the Kasumigaseki toll booth
about fifteen minutes ago.

117
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,375
Hello? Takizawa?

118
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,166
Saki... Your friend, Osugi...

119
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,416
I know where to find him.

120
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,916
Really...?

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,083
Takizawa figured out
where Osugi's being held.

122
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,208
What, you're kidding...!
How'd he do that?

123
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,791
Is he okay?

124
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:35,083
He's in room 1109 of the
Hotel Insomnia in Roppongi...

125
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,291
I'm just a few minutes
away from there...

126
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,708
Talk to you soon.

127
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,541
Hold on, don't hang up!

128
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,125
Huh?

129
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,541
Thanks for your help...

130
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,625
But how were you
able to find him?

131
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,500
Takizawa...?! What's wrong...?

132
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,875
Are you okay?

133
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,541
Takizawa!
What happened...? Hello?!

134
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,750
He said Osugi's
being held captive

135
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,708
at the Hotel Insomnia, right?

136
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,833
I just got off with
the front desk...

137
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,583
the guy said they're
just way too busy

138
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,666
to send someone up to the room.

139
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,041
Hey. Check this out.

140
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,666
That's on the way to Roppongi!

141
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,583
There. Just try to get
into your hotel room now.

142
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,375
If you wanna play dirty...

143
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,791
Then, that's the way
we'll play it...!

144
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,875
Uh, Miss Roppongi.

145
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm terribly sorry,
but the ownership

146
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,541
of the hotel has
just changed hands.

147
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,041
Unfortunately, we're
unable to grant access

148
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,541
to the rooms at
this time, and uh...

149
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,708
... and I'm afraid
I've been instructed

150
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,916
to ask all guests to
vacate the premises.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,750
I tried knocking on
the door to your room,

152
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,833
but your companion
isn't answering...

153
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,500
I... wasn't sure
if you would approve

154
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,250
of me entering
the room by myself,

155
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,333
so I decided to wait for you.

156
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,250
You made the right decision.

157
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,250
Number Nine paid one-and-a-half
billion for this place?

158
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,916
What a colossal waste of money.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,416
Now I own it.

160
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,791
But why did the price go up
200 million in five minutes?

161
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,875
You're a crafty one, aren't you?

162
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,708
We're running out of time.

163
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,875
Let's begin, shall we?

164
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,791
I got it open, Juiz.

165
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,500
Though I may have thrown out
my shoulder in the process.

166
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,291
Noblesse oblige...

167
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,458
You're such a violent savior...

168
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,291
I pray you will show more
restraint in the future...

169
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,416
Thanks for the advice,

170
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,125
but now's not the
best time for it.

171
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,583
So you're the Johnny Hunter.

172
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,458
Huh, you really are a Seleção.

173
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,333
And good looking too...

174
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,916
Not the type I would expect
to go blowing up tanker trucks

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,583
and clipping off
men's Johnnies for sport.

176
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,791
Number Nine...
You're just a baby...

177
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,166
I find it hard to believe

178
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,166
you were the one behind
the Careless Monday attacks.

179
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,125
Wait, are you saying I was
somehow involved with that, too?

180
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,666
It's no good.

181
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,458
We're gonna be
stuck here for a while.

182
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,166
It looks like it's
a pretty big wreck.

183
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,625
I hope Takky's doing okay.

184
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,625
Who knows? I must confess,

185
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,791
I was hoping to get the
chance to meet you someday...

186
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,000
It's too bad you have
to be the Supporter.

187
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,416
You're wrong.

188
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm not the Supporter...

189
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,541
I'm just another Seleção...

190
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,750
Plus... The only reason
I'm here is to save him.

191
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,666
He's a friend of
a friend of mine.

192
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,333
You're friends...

193
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,000
with someone who knows
this degenerate lowlife?

194
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,291
Well... from what I've heard
he's actually a stand-up guy...

195
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,833
Right, Osugi?

196
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,750
Hey, easy!

197
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,291
Let's assume for the
moment you actually

198
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,041
are friends with
this piece of garbage.

199
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,041
I will still have
my way with him.

200
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
I feel my methods of mutilation

201
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,833
are justified through
my personal convictions...

202
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,375
I felt this way long before
I received this phone.

203
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,916
Not even the
Supporter can stop me

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,833
from reaching my goal.

205
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,375
I told you,
I'm not the Supporter...

206
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,666
And how does a
serial killer come

207
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,416
into possession of a
Noblesse phone anyway?

208
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,291
You got me.

209
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,500
The only time I ever use it is

210
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,750
to have Juiz hunt down
these pigs for me...

211
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,083
Then once I'm done with them,

212
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,791
she gets rid of the bodies.

213
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,750
Juiz gets rid of the bodies...?

214
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,000
What in the world are
they talking about?

215
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,666
What's up, Saki?

216
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,041
Did you get a hold of Takizawa?

217
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,041
Uh-uh.

218
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,375
I-I'm gonna go ahead on foot.

219
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,708
See ya there!

220
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,500
Saki, wait!

221
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,541
I guess Seleção come from
all walks of life, huh...?

222
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,291
You're so different
from Doctor Hiura...

223
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,916
How do you expect
to win this game

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,125
if that's all you use Juiz for?

225
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,458
For each pig I remove
from this earth...

226
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,583
I use my agency to replace them

227
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,875
with a gentleman
from overseas...

228
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,958
To be honest with you...

229
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,333
I have no desire
to win this game...

230
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,625
You can fight to change
the world all you want...

231
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,125
but you'll never get more than

232
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,500
half the world to
agree with your side.

233
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,000
Until I exhaust the
last of my ten billion,

234
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,208
I intend to carry out
my own brand of justice.

235
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,541
So in order for me
to get Osugi back...

236
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,291
My only choice is to
take you out first.

237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,583
I'm sorry I can't
be more accommodating.

238
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,500
Remind me. Your name
is Kuroha, right...?

239
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,208
I'm curious.

240
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,375
What was it that got you

241
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,000
into Johnny snipping
in the first place?

242
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,708
You have something against 'em?

243
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,083
Yes, I do.

244
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,541
Well there you go...

245
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,625
I'll have to save you, too...

246
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,000
Cuz I'm different from you.

247
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,708
See, I wanna win this game.

248
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,458
Giving a serial killer the
chance to save the nation...?

249
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,458
What has this
country come to...?

250
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,166
This Mister Outside
deserves a beating

251
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,166
for the games he's playing.

252
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,125
Kuroha.

253
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:26,166
You were hurt by a man
in the past, weren't you?

254
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,333
And what makes you think that?

255
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,750
I just get the feeling
that you've never...

256
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,916
had true love from a Johnny.

257
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,833
Takizawa, who is
it you're talking to?

258
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,958
And what is a Seleção?!

259
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,916
I've often wondered...

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,166
but I'm not sure that
it's even out there...

261
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,083
the Johnny that
can give me love...

262
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:26,125
If it exists,
I'd love to give it a try.

263
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:36,125
If it exists,
I'd love to give it a try.

264
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:48,625
If it exists,
I'd love to give it a try.

265
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,958
Takizawa...? If you're
there, say something!

266
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,250
Come on... Come on, already!

267
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,791
Hi, there.

268
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,416
What's going on?

269
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,166
And you are?
His girlfriend perhaps?

270
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,125
What happened to Takizawa?

271
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,458
Did you do something?

272
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,875
Takizawa...?

273
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,625
I've been taking good
care of him, that's all...

274
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,750
Looks like you've got
yourself a nice girl.

275
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,250
You better cherish
every hair on his head.

276
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,416
He's a special guy.

277
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,125
Juiz... it's time, do it.

278
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,500
Hold on...! That's my...

279
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,625
Don't you worry, kid...

280
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,375
This man has nothing
to do with you.

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,708
He's a wanted serial rapist.

282
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,708
His life holds
absolutely no value...

283
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,125
I wonder how you mistook
him for your friend...

284
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,000
How odd...

285
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,750
This is goodbye...
Seleção Number Nine...

286
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,375
We should meet again sometime.

287
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,750
Takizawa!

288
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,500
Takizawa?

289
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,833
What happened to you?

290
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,833
Takizawa...! Snap out of it!
