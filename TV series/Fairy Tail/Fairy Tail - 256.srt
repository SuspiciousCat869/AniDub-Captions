1
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,291
I'm a life form
far above yours.

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,833
Etherious.

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,208
You were foolish to believe
you could defeat me.

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,916
For I am Tempester the Immortal!

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,750
You may've bested
me once human,

6
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,625
but I swear it will
not happen again.

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,125
Ya know, I feel exactly
the same way about it.

8
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,541
[LAXUS] This is the second
time you've brought harm

9
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,166
to my family.

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,208
[LAXUS yelling]

11
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,708
And it's the last time.

12
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,666
Because you're not gonna
make it outta here alive.

13
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:18,000
There's nothing yet.
I'll keep on looking though.

14
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,916
Well don't even bother
searching over here

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
because there's
no sign of him.

16
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,000
I mean he couldn't have
gotten very far, could he?

17
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,125
Well, we're running
outta places to look.

18
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,583
I'm gettin' antsy.

19
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,041
Laxus wasn't in any kinda
shape to go off by himself.

20
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,541
Honestly.

21
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,208
He sure does take after that
short old fool, doesn't he?

22
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,958
It's rather exasperating.

23
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,083
[MACAO]
So, what do we do now?

24
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,583
We've got no choice.

25
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,875
I'm afraid it's time for
us to call off the search.

26
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,458
No! We can't!

27
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,500
Why won't he think
things through?

28
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,750
He can't actually believe
he's strong enough to fight.

29
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,291
So, are you ready to end this?

30
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,416
But you don't have
much power left!

31
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,041
Fighting won't do you any good.

32
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,708
[yelling]

33
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,625
Let's see you handle
the Raging Bolt!

34
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,333
Is that the best you can do?

35
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,750
Sah-whoosh

36
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,541

[groans]

38
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,166
[TEMPESTER]
Looks like the Bane Particles

39
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
are working to
weaken your abilities.

40
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,208
And while your little
attempts amuse me,

41
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,541
I suggest you admit
defeat and give up, human.

42
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,958
Not gonna happen.

43
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,250
Now. Whoosh.

44
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,625
[LAXUS]
Lightning Dragon Roar!

45
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,958
Fah-woosh.

46
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,166
Gotta hand it to you, big guy.

47
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,125
You definitely don't
make this easy for me.

48
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,000
You gotta pace yourself.

49
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,958
[TEMPESTER]
You have a choice to make here.

50
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,958
You can continue fighting
and be destroyed.

51
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,416
Or give up and be destroyed.

52
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,083
[growling]

53
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,208
Here's the truth about us.

54
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,958
We never quit. No!
Not for anyone!

55
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,333
Swish.

56
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,041
How can you call yourself
a demon anyway?

57
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,208
I thought they weren't
allowed to show fear.

58
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:39,250
Now, get ready for
Lightning Dragon Jaw!

59
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,041
Swish.

60
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,416
[TEMPESTER]
Vwum.

61
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,375
Laxus! No!

62
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,083
It's over. Why won't
you admit it?

63
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,375
Your attacks, they're just
getting weaker and more pitiful.

64
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,000
You've reached your
breaking point, haven't you?

65
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,583
I think I know when
I'm out of my league.

66
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,125
So I'll decide when
I'm done fighting.

67
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,666
What I mean is,

68
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,541
don't you ever
tell me what to do.

69

[yelling]

71
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,291
Crack and smash.

72
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,666
Savor your last breath, human.

73
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,750
[LAXUS]
Once again... it's all up to me.

74
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,458
[knocking]

75
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,750
[NATSU]
Laxus, you awake?

76
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,000
Come on, man!
We gotta talk to you!

77
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,625
Hey, cut it out, Natsu.

78
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,166
Don't wake them up.

79
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,125
Porlyusica said they need to
rest so they can recover faster.

80
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I heard what she said.

81
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,416
Hey, Laxus!

82
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,833
Thought you might wanna know,

83
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,416
we're leaving to search
for the Council Members.

84
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,000
And being a Dragon Slayer,

85
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,125
I can pretty much
breathe in anything.

86
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,541
I know the same
goes for you too.

87
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,000
So you can relax, we got this!

88
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,125
Natsu.

89
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,916
I'm sure everything
will be okay.

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,958
You just worry about
feeling better.

91
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,375
I hope.

92
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,791
See ya later, big guy!

93
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,666
You're in pain,

94
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,416
so I'll make this quick and
put you out of your misery.

95
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,875
Say goodbye. It's over.
A-Whoosh!

96
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,875
[screaming]

97
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,041
Just try to hang on, Laxus!

98
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,000
[TEMPESTER]
Uh?

99
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,166
[TEMPESTER]
Let go.

100
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,500
I admit it. I'm down.
I can barely move.

101
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,291
But I ain't done!

102
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,083
That's insane, how's
he even doing this?

103
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,875
[TEMPESTER]
Damn you!

104
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,708
What were you thinking leaving
yourself open like that?

105
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,458
One blow and you'd be dead.

106
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,791
I was waiting for this.

107
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,833
[LAXUS]

00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,083
[LAXUS]
Gajeel, catch!

110
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,875
Laxus, what're you--?

111
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,916
[LAXUS]
Take that and get out of here.

112
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
[GAJEEL]
Huh?

113
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,125
Go on, hurry. Give it
to the old lady.

114
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,291
She'll know what to do with it.

115
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,625
That's his blood.

116
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,083
Use it for an... anti... dote.

117
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,166
I won't leave you!

118
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,708
So then, you did
all this for blood?

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,375
[MAKAROV]
Things may look grim now,

120
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,708
but we are far from finished.

121
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,416
As long as we stand together
to fight against the darkness,

122
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,125
Fairy Tail will never fall.

123
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,708
I told you to go.

124
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,083
The antidote can
save their lives.

125
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,041
Well, I ain't gonna
leave you behind.

126
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,166
No matter what happens,
we stick together.

127
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,041
Stop worrying about me.

128
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,791
Don't you get it? They need
the blood. You have to hurry.

129
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,750
Just shut up.

130
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,375
--[rumbling]
--[GAJEEL gasps]

131
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,208
This is a joke, right?
I mean, it was dead.

132
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,875
Unfortunately for
you, I am immortal.

133
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,125
And as long as the
Underworld King is alive,

134
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,083
I will forever be supplied
with an endless stream of power

135
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,875
to curse you humans.

136
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,416
[GAJEEL]
What?

137
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,916
[TEMPESTER]
You see,

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,250
even though each of the Nine
Demon Gates has the ability

139
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,833
to be revived by
the Hell's Core,

140
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,625
I am the only one to be given
the title of "Immortal."

141
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,666
Do you know why that is?

142
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,583
[TEMPESTER] It's because my
body is strongest of all.

143
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,500
And in addition to the power
I receive from the Underworld,

144
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,291
I, alone, have incredible
regenerative abilities,

145
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,083
unlike any other ordinary demon.

146
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,791
[TEMPESTER] If you still
think you can kill me,

147
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,583
allow me to give you a tip.

148
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,416
[GAJEEL]
We don't need anything from you.

149
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,083
In order for you weak humans

150
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,666
to destroy me completely,
you would have to defeat me

151
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,541
in a single blow before
I was able to regenerate.

152
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,708
Obviously, there has
never been an opponent

153
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,250
who has ever possessed
such an attack.

154
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,500
And let's face it,

155
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,250
you two don't even have
the power to come close.

156

[growls]

157
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,666
[LAXUS] Oh yeah? I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

158
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,833
[TEMPESTER]
You fool.

159
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,500
What hope could
you possibly have?

160
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,500
Beating you in one shot is
gonna be a piece of cake.

161
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:25,250

00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,541
[GAJEEL]
Laxus.

165
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,833
No way! You gotta
get up! Stay with me!

166
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,916
Come on!

167
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,166
[TEMPESTER]
Well done, human.

168
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,666
[TEMPESTER] My powers aren't
working to restore me.

169

Not even the life force of
the great Underworld King

170
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,458
can help me now.

171
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,583
Hell's Core's gone.
I have nothing left.

172
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,833
And in a few seconds, I will
die, just as a mortal would.

173
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,291
Oh yeah?

174
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,333
So why don't you just do us
a favor and die already--?

[TEMPESTER]
However, before I go,

176
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,666
I have one final mission
I must complete.

177
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,583
[GAJEEL]
What?

178
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,166
You might've defeated me,

179
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,375
but these Bane Particles will
ensure that I won't die alone.

180
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,666
I'm taking you all to hell.

[GAJEEL gasps]

182
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,083
Now what? What do we do?

183
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,833
Damn it!

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,166
Is that ice?

187
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,291
What's happening to
the Bane Particles?

188
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,750
Gray must've turned them
all into ice somehow.

189
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,750
He looks bad. Did he
actually fight like that?

190
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,500
[GAJEEL]
Y-Yeah.

191
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,916
So these are the Bane Particles

192
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,166
that took him and the
Thunder Legion down.

193
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,000
Should be better now
that they're frozen.

194
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,125
We get the blood?

195
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, we've got it right here.

196
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,666
You need to hurry.

197
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,333
Where the hell do you
think you're goin'?

198
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,958
To slay some demons.
Every last one.

199
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,000
So is this the control room?

[FRANMALTH]
Um, yes.

201

Hey, Erza, look over there!

202
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,333
It's the former Chairman.

203
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,000
You need to stop the
Faces this instant!

204
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,000
[FRANMALTH]
Wait a minute.

205
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,833
This can't be Keyes'
corpse manipulation.

206
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,208
Which means it must be...

207

[ERZA gasps]

[ERZA]
Wait, what?

210
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,208
What's going on?
Why can't I stop?

211
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,375
Why am I doing this?

212
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,833
What is happening to us?

213
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,708
It's really hard to breathe!

214
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,750
It's the enemy's magic!

215

Stop this!

Behold. This is the true
power of the Macro Curse.

217
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,333
Don't kill them all yet.
I want that one for myself.

Seilah. Kyoka.

219
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,541
Tell the truth. What have
you done to the Chairman?

220
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,875
Just a little curse.

221
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,791
I can't manipulate
people as well as

but my Macro curse
can control corpses

224
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,333
when it's absolutely necessary.

225
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,500
The former Chairman is
such a dedicated ally

226
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,541
that even death won't
prevent him from launching

to their tragic ends

disappointed in you Minerva.

[MINERVA (NEO) growls]

235
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,666
And, Erza, how does it feel
to be completely immobilized?

236
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,916
Does it take you back to our
time in the torture chamber?

I think it would be more fun
if we turned it up a notch.

I'll be okay.

completed the activation.

just absorb Seilah's life force?

upon the wasteland of
this never-ending war.

Its roar will rock
the land with terror

will cause waves

to swell across the oceans.

When this true
destruction is upon us,
