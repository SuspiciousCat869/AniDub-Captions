1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,166
[JACKPOT] It's close.
So very close!

2
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,083
[JACKPOT] "Time ticks forward,
on toward inevitable chaos!"

3
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,916
[Jackpot laughs]

4
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,916
[ARCHBISHOP] That dream.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,750
[ARCHBISHOP] Not again.

6
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,583
[ARCHBISHOP]
"Time ticks forward,

7
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:53,333
on toward inevitable chaos"?

8
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,500
Her grave? You're pretty
morbid this morning.

9
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,041
Well, since
Lisanna's still alive,

10
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,666
it's pointless to have it up.

11
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,666
And I'd rather not have
to look at it again.

12
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,083
Then just go knock it over.

13
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,875
That seems a bit harsh.

14
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,250
The church said the
decision's up to us,

15
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,416
so we have time
to think it through.

16
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,750
Natsu will never take down
the one that we made.

17
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,250
Right, ya big softy?

18
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,708
You just had to go
and bring that up.

19
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, we could leave it
as a monument to the day

20
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,583
she came back home. Changing
it might be a bit pricy.

21
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,791
[LISANNA]
Speaking of the church,

22
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,666
this is a special time
for them, isn't it?

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,250
[NATSU] Whaddya mean?

24
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,375
[ELFMAN] The Archbishop's coming
to town, or something like that.

25
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,083
[HAPPY] Hold on,
I've heard of him before!

26
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,416
It's kind of a big deal
for him to come here.

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,083
This Arch-fish-up guy comes
into town every few years

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,291
to perform a big,
important ritual.

29
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,000
[MIRAJANE] You got
most of that right.

30
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,041
Throngs of people make
pilgrimages from faraway lands

31
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,375
just to catch a glimpse of him.

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,166
[NATSU] Really?
For one guy?

33
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,666
[HAPPY] Jeez, Natsu, you
don't know anything, do you?

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,458
[NATSU] You don't either!

35
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,500
[GRAN DOMA] You're
absolutely certain of this?

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,958
[LAHARL] Yes.
I'm very sorry, sir.

37
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,958
But despite our best
efforts, it appears a church

38
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,416
in the Akaza region burned to
the ground yesterday morning.

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,458
[GRAN DOMA] That makes
over thirty incidents.

40
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,166
Yet the identity
of the perpetrator

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,583
still eludes you, Lahar?

42
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,333
[LAHARL] We're analyzing
pieces of the buildings,

43
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,750
but there are no
solid leads yet.

44
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,583
[ORG] Other lands have taken
notice of this as well.

45
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,791
If we're to save face,

46
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,958
we must find and capture
the culprit quickly.

47
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,166
[GRAN DOMA] At this rate, the
Custody Enforcement Unit's

48
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,875
reputation will be ruined,

49
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,916
and the Council's
right along with it.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,291
Do not fail.

51
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,833
Sir!

52
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,875
[HAPPY] Father's Memento!

53
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,750
[LUCY] Wow, another one?
What gives?

54
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,125
Did something bad happen?

55
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,875
Someone's been setting
fire to churches lately.

56
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,375
That's a sadistic hobby.

57
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,791
I know him!
He works for the council!

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,375
[HAPPY] Seven years and
he hasn't stopped frowning.

59
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,458
Natsu, look!

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,916
He's dead to the
world, isn't he?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,583
Brain dead and
oblivious is pretty much

62
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,125
par for the course with him.

63
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,708
[HAPPY] I can't believe someone
would set fire to churches.

64
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,250
Times have changed.

65
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,666
I'm having trouble
catching up with everything.

66
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,416
Not to mention our
seven year cat nap

67
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,958
destroyed my clairvoyance.

68
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,750
The future is nothing but
fuzzy pictures to me now.

69
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,750
[WENDY] That's not good.

70
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,416
[CARLA] It's quite annoying.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,791
That's a weird smell.

72
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,416
[HAPPY] Sleeping beauty's up.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,875
[ROMEO] Hey, Lucy!
You have a visitor!

74
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,125
[ROMEO] The blonde with the
pig-tails is the one you want.

75
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,583
Thank you for the help,
young man.

76
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,875
Who's that girl?

77
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,416
No idea.

78
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,916
[MICHELLE] Excuse me, but
are you Lucy Heartfilia?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,625
Yes, ma'am,
I'm a Heartfilia, but--

80
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,916
Who's asking exactly?

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,916
Who am... I?

82
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,708
How could you forget your dear
Michelle Lobster? You meanie!

83
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,958
[LUCY] What?

84
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,833
Her tears are like waterfalls.

85
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,958
Way to be a jerk, Lucy.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,291
I'm so sorry. I guess
I shouldn't expect you

87
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,458
to remember me
after such a long time.

88
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,750
Would you like some tissue?

89
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,041
How could you forget
a vision like that?

90
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,208
Elfman. I hate you.

91
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,958
[MICHELLE]
Allow me to start over.

92
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm Michelle Lobster,
of the Lobster family.

93
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,625
It's good to see you again,
Big Sister Lucy!

94
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,875
Hang on...

95
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,000
[ALL]
"Sister"?!

96
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,041
I guess Daddy Lucy
was sewing wild oats

97
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,416
on those business trips!

98
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,416
While the Lobsters
and Heartfilias are related,

99
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,708
Lucy and I aren't
really sisters.

100
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,958
I see, so you're a
distant relative of hers.

101
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,708
That makes a
little more sense.

102
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,625
Yeah, they do seem
pretty different.

103
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,375
Looks to me like they've got
a couple of things in common.

104
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,875
First it's Gildarts and Cana,

105
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,958
and now Lucy has a
shellfish for a daughter?

106
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,541
How did you get that idea?

107
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,916
Just kiddin';
don't blow a gasket!

108
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,083
[Plue chirps]

109
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:20,500
Would you mind explaining
why you call me "Big Sister"?

110
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,916
[MICHELLE] Because you're
older than me, silly goose!

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,416
Okay.

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,750
No offense, but I thought
you were the one who's older.

113
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, that's alright.

114
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,375
What's the matter, Natsu?
You look confused.

115
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,875
That girl's from the
future. I totally get it.

116
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,250
I don't think you do.

117
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,291
Even though we've been
bringing this up constantly

118
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,750
ever since we got back to
the guild, Flamebrain forgot

119
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,750
we spent seven years
on Tenrou Island.

120
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,291
When you take that into
account it makes perfect sense.

121
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,750
Lucy may not have aged
physically, but her actual age

122
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,916
remains unchanged, so
she's technically older.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,250
Uhhh...

124
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,416
His poor little brain
can't handle all of this.

125
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,041
That's our Natsu.

126
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,833
At long last,
I finally found you.

127
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:01,708
Come on, don't cry! Here, why
don't I take that case for you?

128
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,875
Oh, that's right. I'm
supposed to give this to you.

129
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,708
You're so thoughtful, Lucy!

130
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,291
Wait!

131
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,250
The entire point of my
journey was to find you

132
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,750
so I could deliver that.

133
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,875
On another topic, could I
have some ice for my footsie?

134
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,958
A real man woulda
saved her footsie!

135
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,458
So why didn't you
save it, ya jerk?

136
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,500
This is heavy.

137
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,250
No kidding!
Is it full of cement?

138
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,541
Are you sure
they're related?

139
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,458
They're both blonde,
busty, and have their own

140
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,708
personal brand of crazy.
Sounds like family to me.

141
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,666
[Plue hums affirmatively]

142
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,625
[LUCY] Okay. What the
heck is in this thing?

143
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,416
[MICHELLE]
I'm not sure, honestly.

144
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,291
All I know is your father
wanted you to have it.

145
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,125
[Lucy gasps]

146
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,000
[MICHELLE] I was his assistant
until just a short while ago,

147
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,916
and this is my last
errand for him.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,250
Actually, he passed
the case on to me

149
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,958
when he was on his deathbed.

150
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,333
So here we are.
My last assignment

151
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,416
for Mr. Jude's come to an end.

152
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,416
[LUCY] His final moments. And
you were right there with him.

153
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,541
He never stopped
worrying about you

154
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,583
after you went missing
all those years ago.

155
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,458
But he was sure you
were alive somewhere.

156
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,791
It's because he held onto
that hope that he asked me

157
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,458
to find you and give
you this memento.

158
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,333
He went peacefully,
as if falling asleep.

159
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,333
And ever since then
I've been searching for you.

160
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,625
Finding you has
been my sole purpose.

161
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,791
And now it's all done.
I think Mr. Jude

162
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,666
will finally be able
to rest in peace.

163
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,208
[LUCY] So, what's in it?

164
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,625
[MICHELLE] I don't know.
I was only told to deliver it,

165
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,583
so I never looked inside
to see for myself.

166
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,750
Thanks, Michelle.

167
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,750
[NATSU] Open it up!

168
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,750
Huh?

169
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,791
Don't leave her
hanging like this.

170
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,375
Seriously, she busted her
butt getting this thing here.

171
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,583
The least you could do
is let her see it.

172
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,875
So hurry up,
everyone's waiting.

173
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,458
[LUCY] Okay.

174
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,750
[LUCY] Can I close it now?

175
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,458
[NATSU] It smells funky.

176
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,791
Maybe it's this cloth.

177
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,750
Nah, it's got some
kind of magic on it,

178
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,541
but whatever it is,
it smells really old.

179
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,083
You okay, Carla?

180
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,083
Maybe she has gas.

181
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,250
[CARLA] Oh. It's nothing.

182
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,833
Michelle... What
is this, exactly?

183
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,333
[MICHELLE] I assume it's
something Mr. Jude was fond of;

184
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,791
does it look familiar?

185
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,416
[LUCY] Not really.
I don't remember

186
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,750
seeing anything like
this around the house.

187
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,833
[NATSU] Ahh... A weapon!

188
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,333
Yeah, somehow I doubt that.

189
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,250
I just remembered!

190
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,750
It's totally a weapon, isn't it?

191
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,000
[MICHELLE] No, it's not.

192
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,041
But you do know what it is?

193
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,250
No, it's just...

194
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,541
I remembered that I haven't
eaten anything in three days.

195
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,041
[sound of stomach growling]

196
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,166
[MICHELLE] It seems
like a fun guild!

197
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,375
[LUCY] You mean Dad
didn't tell you about it?

198
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,125
Fairy Tail's only the
most important thing

199
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,208
that's ever happened to me.

200
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,416
[Plue chirps]

201
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,541
Actually, I knew
you were in a guild,

202
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,041
but you had already vanished.

203
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,291
That seems to have
thrown a wrench

204
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,750
into a bunch of people's lives.

205
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,375
[Plue coos]

206
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,583
After everything
you've been through,

207
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,666
I'm surprised
you've remained here.

208
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,166
[LUCY] Really? I wouldn't
give it up for the world.

209
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,833
Like I said,
Fairy Tail's my life.

210
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,625
The guild's got its fair share
of bad apples, but who cares?

211
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,000
Everyone's so passionate.
They all love their magic

212
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,583
the same way I love
my Celestial Spirits.

213
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,916
We would do anything for
one another. We're like family.

214
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,291
I think Mr. Jude
would be very happy

215
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,583
to know that you've
found a home.

216
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:36,125
I'd like to think so, too.
I'm glad you're here, Michelle.

217
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,916
[Plue trumpets]

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,833
Tadah! Welcome to
Castle de' Lucy, Madame!

219
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,833
[Plue cheers]

220
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,625
You know it's because
of Dad that I'm still able

221
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,708
to call this place my home.

222
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,125
[LUCY] Get comfy!
I'll brew us some tea!

223
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,833
[MICHELLE] Oh,
don't trouble yourself!

224
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,708
[LUCY] It's no
trouble, trust me.

225
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,625
I can't tell you
how happy I am.

226
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,000
I was so little
when mom passed away,

227
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,250
and then I lost Dad
in the blink of an eye.

228
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,666
It's been pretty rough lately.

229
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,916
Finding out I have
relatives is awesome!

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,125
So are there any other
Lobsters nearby?

231
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,916
I'd love to meet them sometime.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,458
Do you get to see them often?

233
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,833
Don't mind me, I just
ramble when I'm excited.

234
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,000
Keep your chin up, Iris,
you'll get through it somehow!

235
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,208
Oh, come on! Don't read
things without permission!

236
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,500
So how long have you wanted
to be a writer, Big Sister?

237
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,750
You're worse than Natsu.
Chew or talk, it's not hard.

238
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,083
[LUCY] I really wish
I knew what this thing is.

239
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,541
There's no
inscription or anything.

240
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,458
[MICHELLE] You're
so cool. I'm jealous.

241
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,666
You've achieved one dream,

242
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,250
and now you're working
towards another.

243
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,875
You're really living
a charmed life, aren't you?

244
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,666
You think so?

245
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,083
[MICHELLE] I do.
It must be nice.

246
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,458
To have a dream.
All your own.

247
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,958
[LUCY] So, where are
you going from here?

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,166
[LUCY] Hey, why don't
you stay with me for a bit?

249
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,250
It's no trouble, really!

250
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,750
Oh, no. I don't want
to be a bother--

251
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,500
Don't be silly!
I'd love a roommate!

252
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,833
Thank you! I promise you
won't regret it, Big Sis!

253
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,166
I'll find a job quick.

254
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,625
Don't worry about rent;
I'll be on time, promise!

255
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,750
[LUCY] Michelle, your nose.

256
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
I've got an idea! Why don't
you work at the guild hall?

257
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,041
[MICHELLE] Me?
Work at Fairy Tail?

258
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,750
[LUCY] It hasn't been long
since Michelle showed up

259
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,458
with a package and
became part of my family.

260
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,291
[GROUP] Cheers!

261
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,708
[LUCY] And of course
everyone adored her

262
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,750
from the moment they met her.

263
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,708
She's been helping with every
little odd job you can imagine.

264
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,833
Even doing people's hair!

265
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,458
I've really enjoyed having her.

266
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,791
She's pretty shy and
tends to keep to herself,

267
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,833
and she's not the most
dependable worker around.

268
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,416
Honestly, she's clumsy
and can squirt out tears

269
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,458
faster than she drops plates.

270
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,833
But I take care of her
like a good big sister.

271
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,166
In a way, she's helped me
get my own act together.

272
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,708
Say, Mom. Do you think it's
possible Dad sent her my way

273
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:36,291
so I wouldn't be lonely?
I'd like to think that he did.

274
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,291
Giddy-up Mr. Horsie man,
it's outlaw Lucy!

275
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,500
We gotta go catch her!

276
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,083
[LUCY] No, it's the
little bounty hunter!

277
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,166
[MAKAROV] Be thankful you
don't have facial hair.

278
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,791
Horses don't talk, silly!

279
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,000
But they feel!

280
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,666
Natsu's lookin' for ya, Lucy.

281
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,291
It was somethin'
about huntin' bandits.

282
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,916
I'm so excited.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
'Bout time, slow poke!

284
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,000
We've been waiting for you!

285
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,666
May I come along?
I'd love to watch you work.

286
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,500
[BISCA &amp; ALZACK] Huh?

287
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,916
[LUCY] Umm, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

288
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,833
But I'd love to see what
wizards do first hand,

289
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,416
and you'll be there
to protect me!

290
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,791
Yeah, she'll be fine!

291
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,625
Come on, Lucy;
there's nothing more fun

292
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,791
than watching this team
put the hurt on some thugs!

293
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,416
And we do
guarantee satisfaction.

294
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,166
Master, would you talk
some sense into them?

295
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,791
May I please go?

296
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,833
--You bet!
--Go for it!

297
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,833
Guess it's settled.

298
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,541
Any objections,
Master Macao?

299
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,500
Whatever;
knock yourselves out.

300
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,291
[ERZA] I have no
objections, either.

301
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,500
Experience isn't a bad thing.
Even if that experience is

302
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,708
forced on someone too early,
it will still benefit them.

303
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,208
You know all
about that, don't you,

304
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,958
Miss "I'm going on an S-Class
Quest Without Permission"?

305
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,541
Yes, Erza.
I see your point.

306
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,750
Alright, Michelle.
Welcome to the team.

307
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,916
How exciting!

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,666
It might get pretty hairy,

309
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,375
but stay by my side
and you'll be just fine!

310
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,416
This is awesome! We're gonna
make hunting down these bandits

311
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,458
a family affair! I'm fired up!

312
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,791
[GRAY] The flier says
these bandits are so ruthless

313
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,666
the victims suffer from night
terrors after the attacks.

314
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,208
[NATSU] They sound nasty.
This should be fun!

315
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,416
Even royal soldiers who
went into the mountains

316
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,416
to search for them came back
sobbing like a bunch of babies.

317
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,708
I'm having second thoughts
about this whole thing.

318
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
I brought snacks
if you're hungry.

319
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,541
She's just like Natsu.
Totally clueless.

320
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,125
So good...

321
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,791
I can't believe you're depended
on more than the royal soldiers!

322
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,000
"Depended on" might
be a bit much.

323
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,166
[ERZA] The client
gave us this to use!

324
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,458
[NATSU] Please tell me
she's not driving.

325
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,041
I've got this all worked out.

326
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,541
First, we need to tempt
the bandits into robbing us.

327
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,583
Lucy and I will ride
in the front seat,

328
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,583
posing as a pair
of helpless women.

329
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,541
Meanwhile, Natsu, Gray,
and Michelle will hide

330
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,833
in the wagon so they
can spring the trap.

331
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,041
Once we're surrounded,
Lucy and I will distract

332
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,791
as many of the fools as we can
with our feminine wiles.

333
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,250
At that moment, Natsu and Gray
will leap out and dispatch

334
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,708
the other bandits before joining
us in a pincer formation--

335
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,291
If you think I'm setting
foot in that wagon,

336
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,750
you're out of your mind!

337
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,916
You object to my plan, do you?
That's a gutsy move.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,250
Beat me all you want;
I ain't goin'!

339
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,458
What's wrong?

340
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,625
Natsu has trouble
with anything on wheels.

341
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,125
[MICHELLE] That's
certainly surprising.

342
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,000
[GRAY] It's so hot!

343
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,250
[LUCY] Don't you dare!

344
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,625
If you'd like someone
else to be up front,

345
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,041
I'm a fairly capable driver.

346
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,250
[LUCY] Huh?

347
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,875
That's fine, if you
don't mind being bait.

348
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,458
It'll be dangerous.

349
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,041
I know, but it makes
more sense to have

350
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,708
all the fighters in
the back, doesn't it?

351
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,375
If it would better our chances,
I'll gladly take the reins!

352
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,375
I don't know about this.

353
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,291
[BANDIT 128A] Looky looky.

354
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,916
[BANDIT 128B]
Ooh, more visitors.

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,125
[BANDIT 128C] We've
got a big haul today!

356
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,333
Next time you wanna fly,
leave me out of it.

357
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,000
Come on, gimme a break.

358
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,500
If you want to blame someone,
blame Erza for coming up

359
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,083
with such a stupid plan!

360
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,375
[HAPPY] Tell that
to her face, hot shot.

361
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,625
[NATSU] Screw that.
You tell her!

362
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,541
[HAPPY] Uh huh.
That's what I thought.

363
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,750
Here they come. Don't
leave my side, understand?

364
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,750
[LUCY] Operation
"Show the Goods" is a go!

365
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,958
[MICHELLE] Right!

366
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,416
We're so lucky you big
strong men found us!

367
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,833
Prepare yourself.

368
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,041
Okay, but "Show the Goods"
is the best you could do?

369
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,333
We're lost and need some
major help right now.

370
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,791
[LUCY] They're putty
in my hands.

371
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,583
[BANDIT 128A] Oh my!
Cover yourself!

372
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,958
[BANDIT 128B] Yeah,
nobody wants to see that.

373
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,708
[BANDIT 128C]
Only bimbos flaunt it.

374
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,500
Besides, my skin
has much more luster!

375
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,791
[BANDIT 128B]
You tell her, girl!

376
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,583
[BANDIT 128A] Get the
cargo before I vomit.

377
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,583
I think my
self-esteem just died.

378
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,541
[BANDIT 128B] Hope you're
packing product, ladies.

379
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,583
[BANDIT 128A] Or a wagon
full of chocolates!

380
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,750
Sorry, fellas, but all
we're packin' is a beating.

381
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,166
[BANDIT 128A] He's gorgeous!

382
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,750
--[BANDIT 128B] Kiss me!
--[BANDIT 128D] I saw him first!

383
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,916
[ERZA] You fiends! I stayed
up all night long planning

384
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,750
that strategy of ours and
now it's been for nothing.

385
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,208
In the name of
all night owls,

386
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,166
I shall punish the lot of you!

387
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,166
And survey says: crazy!

388
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,166
You made me break a nail,
witch. I'll get you back!

389
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,250
Keep trash-talking; that's
not all she'll break on ya.

390
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,291
[BIG SIS] Brazen hussies!

391
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,791
[BANDIT 128A]
Big Sis, it's you!

392
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,333
[BIG SIS] You may have been
born women, but your hearts

393
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,208
will never possess the
feminine spark ours do!

394
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,666
Also, your hair is atrocious,

395
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,541
your hips are too curvy,
and those fun bags look about

396
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,916
as real as daddy's dentures.

397
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,791
Big Sis, I have such a
girl crush on you right now.

398
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,208
[LUCY] I see. No wonder
all of their victims

399
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,083
kept having
nightmares for months.

400
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,875
I think someone
deserves a spanking!

401
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,000
[MICHELLE] Lucy,
get out of the way!

402
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,916
You almost killed me,
you nut job!

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,666
You're done!
Chew on Fleuve d'étoiles!

404
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Huh? Why does this
always happen to me?

405
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,458
Come on, work!
Pretty pretty please!

406
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,166
[NATSU] Let's do it, Happy!

407
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,500
[HAPPY] Aye, sir!

408
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,041
[NATSU] Fire Dragon
Brilliant Flame!

409
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,916
[ERZA] So are you
going to come quietly?

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,125
[MICHELLE] Amazing!

411
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,458
That was absolutely
incredible, Big Sister!

412
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,833
I can't believe how strong
you and your friends are!

413
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,541
[LUCY] Thanks, but I
didn't do anything.

414
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,333
How did you like
your first job?

415
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,208
[MICHELLE] It was
awe inspiring!

416
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,208
Wizards and their
guilds are amazing!

417
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,250
That's right. It can get
kinda rowdy at times,

418
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,500
but there's never a dull moment.

419
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,791
[MACAO] So, ya find anything?

420
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,625
I had one of my contacts
look into it for us.

421
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,375
Laki should be back with
the report in just a bit.

422
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,750
Speak of the devil.

423
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,208
[MACAO] Thanks, we owe you one.

424
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,541
[WAKABA] Sorry to send you
on a weird errand like that.

425
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,833
[LAKI] Don't worry, it's
not like it was a bother.

426
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,375
According to your contact, the
Lobsters were a wealthy family

427
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,291
that had a lot of land in the
Zentopia region's townships.

428
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,833
So we were worried over nothing.

429
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,416
Hardly. There's no such thing

430
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,625
as "too cautious" these days.
Still, this is quite a relief.

431
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,458
Hold your whiskers.
Did ya notice

432
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,916
how Laki said they
"were" a wealthy family?

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,125
It's rough stuff. The rest
of the family was lost

434
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,083
in a tragic accident
several years ago.

435
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,958
[WAKABA] Man, rough is right.

436
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,000
[CARLA] I guess
that makes Michelle

437
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,000
the sole surviving
family member.

438
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,291
[LAHARL] This makes no
sense. First it burns,

439
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,916
then it collapses,
and now it's corroding?

440
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,375
Given the distance from each
parish and the traces of magic

441
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,666
left behind, there's clearly
more than one person involved.

442
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,750
This can't be.
It's impossible!

443
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,000
[LAHARL] Who is he?

444
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,125
[SUBORDINATE 128A]
The priest. He was outside

445
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,333
when the incident occurred.

446
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,708
[LAHARL] But the
earlier report stated

447
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,166
that there was a body
found among the wreckage.

448
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,208
[SUBORDINATE 128A] Yes sir.

449
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,375
[LAHARL] So, if the
only man who was

450
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,541
supposed to be here
is still alive...

451
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,708
Where did the body come from?
Is it one of the culprits?

452
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,666
We don't know, sir. He insists
that no one else was here.

453
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,791
[Jackpot laughs]

454
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,875
[MICHELLE] I've been putting
some thought into this.

455
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
And I was wondering if
I could bend your ear.

456
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,208
[LUCY] What's up?

457
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm curious as to how your
guild receives its jobs.

458
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,875
Do people pay for their
requests to be considered?

459
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,458
[LUCY] I think so.

460
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,166
[MICHELLE] I'd really like to
know more about the memento your

461
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,791
father left. So I'm thinking
of putting in a request.

462
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,083
Michelle, you're a
freakin' genius!

463
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,500
[MAKAROV] This is a first.

464
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,541
In all of my years, I don't
think I've ever seen

465
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,958
a wizard hire another wizard!

466
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,458
I don't see any
problem with it;

467
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,041
I'll have Mirajane make a
request poster for the board.

468
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,041
What a great idea, Lucy!

469
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,375
Indeed. I look forward
to seeing who takes the job.

470
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,791
So you're asking
Fairy Tail for help?

471
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,083
[LUCY] Yep! It's approved!

472
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,125
I'm curious about
the magic on the cloth

473
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,458
wrapped around the memento.
And I'd like to find out

474
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,833
what Mr. Jude was
trying to tell Lucy.

475
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,375
It is his very last
message to her after all.

476
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,166
Good attitude! Happy and I
will solve it, no prob!

477
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,291
[HAPPY] Just don't
let him hold it,

478
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,750
unless you want
him to break it.

479
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,208
[NATSU] Oh, yeah? How bout
I break your face, pal?

480
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,875
[MAKAROV] Seems like
fate, doesn't it?

481
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,291
Those two meeting up.

482
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,041
The only family either of them
has left is each other.

483
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,041
By the way, I want you to know
I'm impressed you had the

484
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,875
foresight to run a background
check on our new friend.

485
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,208
[MACAO] Being thrust into the
role of Master for seven years

486
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,916
teaches you to think on
your feet. I've learned a lot.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,875
Like how to be paranoid.

488
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,250
[CARLA] I still can't
shake the feeling

489
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,750
that something is
very wrong here.

490
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,750
[MICHELLE] Aaahh!

491
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,958
[NATSU] Not my fault!

492
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,083
[LUCY] Are you okay, Michelle?

493
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,125
[MAKAROV] Huh?

494
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,125
Hey, look!

495
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,958
Yes, I see it, too.

496
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,708
Huh?

497
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,791
I am seriously
freaked out right now.

498
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,791
What's with the writing? Is it
some kind of ancient script?

499
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,250
[LUCY] If it is,
Levy could read it!

500
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,166
[MAKAROV] She left with
Shadow Gear this morning

501
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,458
for a job clear across Fiore.
Fried is gone, too.

502
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,541
What do you think it's
trying to tell us, Big Sister?

503
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,083
I wish I knew.

504
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,666
Can't you read ancient
graffiti too, old man?

505
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,166
Listen closely, I think you
should let sleeping dogs lie.

506
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,250
[LUCY] What are
you talking about?

507
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,375
I can't. I'll solve it!

508
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:40,791
[LUCY] I have to! For my
dad's sake, and for mine.

509
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,916
[HAPPY] What? You're challenging
Loxus to another fight?

510
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,333
Boy, you just never
learn, do you Natsu?

511
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,916
[NATSU] Hey, it's not just me!
Gajeel does it all the time!

512
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,083
[HAPPY] Yeah, but he
doesn't challenge

513
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,166
people like Erza or Gildarts.

514
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,875
[NATSU] A real man always aims
for the top, no matter what!

515
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,208
[HAPPY] A real man also knows
when he's out of his league.

516
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,625
Unlike you.

517
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,083
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
Turbulent Showdown!

518
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,750
Natsu vs. Loxus!

519
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,416
[NATSU] Where the
heck did Lucy go?

520
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,666
[HAPPY] I don't know.
I think she's still

521
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,208
fighting that stick thing.

522
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,625
[NATSU] Hey, I wanna fight it!

523
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,708
Alright, stick! I'll show you
who's boss around here!
