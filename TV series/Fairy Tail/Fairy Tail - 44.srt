1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,125
HEY GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,125
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,000
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,833
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV!

5
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,583
- Laxus:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,500
- Lucy: LAXUS BEGAN
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL

7
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,708
AND FORCED MEMBERS
OF THE GUILD

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,583
TO FIGHT AGAINST THE THUNDER
LEGION AND EACH OTHER.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,333
PRETTY SOON, NATSU AND GAJEEL
WERE THE ONLY ONES LEFT,

10
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,250
AND THEY'RE STUCK
BEHIND SOME BARRIER.

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,000
GOOD THING ERZA RECOVERED
AND MYSTOGAN CAME BACK TO HELP.

12
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,541
AS FOR ME,
I'M STILL A STATUE!

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,208
- ( theme music playing )

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,291
- WE'VE GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE.

16
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,833
- THIS SAVES ME THE TROUBLE
OF HUNTING YOU DOWN, I SUPPOSE.

17
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,833
THE SOONER I DEFEAT YOU,

18
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,208
THE SOONER THE OTHERS
WILL BE TURNED BACK!

19
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,750
- AREN'T YOU CONFIDENT?

20
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,375
- THAT WON'T WORK!

21
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,958
- SO THAT HEINOUS ARTIFICIAL EYE
ACTUALLY WORKED IN YOUR FAVOR?

22
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,125
THEN LET'S SEE HOW
YOU LIKE MY FAIRY MACHINE GUN.

23
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,250
LEPRECHAUN!

24
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,958
TRY AGAIN.
- COWARD!

25
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,333
- YOU'RE QUITE ADEPT AT
DEFLECTING MY THORNS,

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,208
AREN'T YOU?

27
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,041
BUT I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

28
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,541
I WONDER,
CAN YOU HANDLE TWICE AS MANY?

29
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,166
( laughing )

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,958
FROM THIS DAY FORTH,
I SHALL BE KNOWN AS TITANIA,

31
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,708
FOR I AM
THE TRUE FAIRY QUEEN.

32
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,041
WHAT?

33
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,666
AHHH!

34
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,333
- ( Happy speaking )

35
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,750
- ( groaning )

36
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,708
- PERSONAL CHARACTER ASIDE,

37
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,750
YOU'RE STILL A MEMBER OF FAIRY
TAIL, THE SAME AS ANYBODY ELSE.

38
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,708
SO IF YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF
TITANIA, THEN FEEL FREE.

39
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,541
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO GAVE ME
THAT NAME IN FIRST PLACE.

40
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,791
IF YOU CEASE THIS NONSENSE AND
TURN THE GIRLS BACK TO NORMAL,

41
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,500
THEN I PROMISE
THAT I WILL NOT HARM YOU.

42
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,083
- YOU'RE BEING A BIT NAIVE,
AREN'T YOU?

43
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,708
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW,

44
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,000
MY STONE EYES GRANT ME
ANOTHER ABILITY AS WELL.

45
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,041
REMOTE CONTROL.

46
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,541
DROP TO YOUR KNEES
AND BOW BEFORE ME.

47
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,708
IF YOU REFUSE,
THEN I'LL USE MY POWER

48
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,666
TO TOPPLE YOUR PRECIOUS
LITTLE STATUES AND SHATTER THEM!

49
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,833
AH!

50
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,666
- I'M IMPRESSED, EVERGREEN,

51
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,250
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE KIND

52
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,083
WHO'D SACRIFICE HER LIFE
FOR HER IDEALS.

53
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,916
IF THEY MUST BE SHATTERED,
I WILL HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,250
BUT TO COLLECT YOUR SOUL
IN RETRIBUTION FOR THEIR DEMISE.

55
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,208
- ( whimpering )

56
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,000
( Evergreen screaming )

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,583
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLUFF,
THEN DO IT RIGHT.

58
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,208
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN.

59
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,958
- OH MY, WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

60
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,500
- I CAN'T REMEMBER.

61
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,833
- THEY'RE ALL BACK TO NORMAL!

62
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,416
- LUCY!
- UH, HAPPY?

63
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,958
- "ERZA VERSUS EVERGREEN. THE
WINNER IS ERZA." - WELL, LAXUS!

64
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,166
YOU'RE ALL OUT OF HOSTAGES,
BOY.

65
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,041
CAN'T CONTINUE
WITH YOUR GAME NOW, CAN YOU?

66
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,250
- YOU FAILED ME!

67
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,041
I PUT MY FAITH IN YOU,
EVERGREEN,

68
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,541
AND THIS IS HOW
YOU RETURN THE FAVOR?

69
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,583
I COME TO FIND OUT
YOU'RE WEAKER THAN ERZA?

70
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,916
DAMN.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,291
- TITANIA'S STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK.

72
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,916
BIXLOW AND I SHOULD'VE
GONE AFTER HER INSTEAD.

73
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,875
- WHY ARE YOU HERE
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE FIGHTING?

74
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,791
- BECAUSE THE GAME IS AS GOOD
AS OVER.

75
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,541
WITHOUT HOSTAGES,

76
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,750
WE CAN NO LONGER
FORCE THE MASTER'S HAND.

77
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

78
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,333
- THIS FIGHT AIN'T OVER.

79
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,875
IF YOU DON'T WANNA FOLLOW ME,
THEN YOU CAN GET LOST.

80
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:28,250
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR WEAKLINGS
IN MY FAIRY TAIL.

81
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,291
- HE CALLED IT
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL?

82
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,416
- LAXUS OUTDID HIMSELF
THIS TIME.

83
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,750
- Makarov: AT ANY RATE,
IT'S OVER NOW.

84
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,750
I PLAYED ALONG
WITH HIS FOOLISH GAME

85
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,625
BECAUSE YOUR LIVES
WERE IN DANGER,

86
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,625
BUT I WON'T INDULGE HIM
ANYMORE.

87
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,708
- MASTER, WE CAN'T LET HIM
GET AWAY

88
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,166
WITH HURTING OUR FRIENDS.
- YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT!

89
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,000
IF WE DON'T TEACH LAXUS
A LESSON,

90
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,166
THEN HE'LL NEVER LEARN.
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

91
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,416
I'M GONNA GIVE THAT BOY
A PUNISHMENT HE'LL NEVER FORGET.

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,166
HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
YOU CAN MESS WITH ME,

93
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,166
BUT YOU CAN'T MESS
WITH MY GUILD!

94
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,125
HEY NOW, HOLD ON A SEC.
I DUNNO ABOUT TAKING HOSTAGES,

95
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,833
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY HARM IN
FINDING OUT WHO'S THE STRONGEST.

96
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,833
I THINK WE SHOULD
KEEP THE BATTLE GOING.

97
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,791
- IN THE END,
I BET HE WAS JUST TRYING

98
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,625
TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN FOR THE
FESTIVAL. GIVE HIM A BREAK.

99
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,458
- ( groans )

100
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO
WITH YOU, NATSU.

101
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,250
- HA HA! SO, IN OTHER WORDS,
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

102
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,791
WE GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE HERE!
LET'S START BRAWLING!

103
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,833
C'MON!
ROUND 2, RIGHT NOW!

104
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,416
- All: WHAT?

105
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,416
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU NINCOMPOOP!

106
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,625
- AW, C'MON!
I GOTTA DO SOMETHIN'

107
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,666
WITH ALL THIS PENT-UP ENERGY
I'VE GOT!

108
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,375
- GIVE IT A REST.

109
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,333
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR NEW EXCUSES TO PICK A FIGHT.

110
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,333
- IF YOU NEED
TO BLOW OFF STEAM THAT BAD,

111
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,375
I'M ALWAYS READY TO RUMBLE.
- DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM, GIRL.

112
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,916
- YA KNOW, I DON'T THINK IT'S
NICE TO BEAT UP ON GIRLS,

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,083
ESPECIALLY
WHEN THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

114
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,958
- A GIRL, A GUY, FRIEND, ENEMY.
WHO CARES?

115
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,291
- HEY!  KEEP THIS UP
AND I'M GONNA FIGHT YOU!

116
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,583
- C'MON, LUCY, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF!

117
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,333
- NUH-UH, NO WAY!
- ( girls laughing )

118
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,625
- WHY SUCH
A SERIOUS EXPRESSION?

119
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,333
- IT'S NOTHIN'.

120
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,875
- THIS GUILD IS RATHER FUN,
ISN'T IT?

121
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,416
- IT AIN'T BORING, AT LEAST.

122
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,208
- Mirajane: WHAT'S GOING ON?

123
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,916
- THAT'S WEIRD.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,583
- DON'T TELL ME
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING ELSE.

125
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,958
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIGHT US THIS TIME.

126
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,791
- Laxus:
CAN YOU HEAR ME, OLD MAN?

127
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,708
THE REST OF YOU BETTER LISTEN
UP TOO. - WHAT DO YOU WANT?

128
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,583
- LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE RULES
HAS GONE OUT THE WINDOW.

129
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,708
THAT'S FINE.
I'LL JUST ADD A NEW ONE.

130
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,625
IN OTHER WORDS,

131
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,125
SINCE I WOULD HATE TO END
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL EARLY,

132
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,000
I'VE DECIDED TO ACTIVATE
THE THUNDER PALACE.

133
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,291
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND,
LAXUS?

134
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,458
- YOU HAVE ONE HOUR
AND 10 MINUTES.

135
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,750
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN,
YOU'D BETTER GET MOVING,

136
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,500
UNLESS YOU'RE READY TO HAND THE
GUILD OVER TO ME NOW, MASTER.

137
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,708
( laughing )

138
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,958
- THIS GAME HAS GONE ON
FOR LONG ENOUGH, BOY!

139
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,333
I WON'T LET YOU DRAG
INNOCENT PEOPLE INTO THIS!

140
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,541
AH!
- MASTER, NO!

141
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,583
- IS HE HURT?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

142
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,291
- Mirajane: OH, NO!
I'LL GO GET HIS MEDICINE!

143
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,083
- Bisca:
MASTER, CAN YOU HEAR US?

144
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,208
- HANG IN THERE, MASTER.
IT'LL BE OKAY!

145
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,166
- WHAT'S HE MEAN
BY "THUNDER PALACE"?

146
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,208
- ( groaning )

147
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,541
- COME ON, GRAMPS.

148
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,791
- HEY, LOOK OUTSIDE,
YOU GUYS!

149
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,333
- Natsu:
WHAT IN THE HECK ARE THOSE?

150
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,875
- Levy: THEY LOOK
LIKE LIGHTNING LACRIMAE TO ME.

151
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,583
- Cana:
THAT MEANS LAXUS DID THIS.

152
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,541
- WHAT'RE THOSE?

153
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,250
- Man: BEATS ME.
PROBABLY SOMETHING CRAZY

154
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,875
THOSE FAIRY TAIL GOONS
COOKED UP FOR THE FESTIVAL.

155
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,000
- Woman: IF YOU ASK ME
THEY'VE DONE TOO MUCH ALREADY.

156
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,500
- OH!

157
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
I BET THEY'RE FIREWORKS
FOR THE PARADE!

158
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,000
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

159
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,458
THEY MUST BE PLANNING SOMETHING
BIG THIS YEAR.

160
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,416
- Lucy: THEY'RE FLOATING
ALL OVER THE TOWN.

161
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,041
- Cana: THEY MAY NOT LOOK
THAT DANGEROUS,

162
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,875
BUT THEY'RE OVERFLOWING
WITH LIGHTNING MAGIC.

163
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,333
THIS COULD GET UGLY.

164
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,708
LET'S JUST HOPE
HE DOESN'T SET THEM OFF.

165
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,416
- Juvia: COULD THIS BE THE
"THUNDER PALACE"

166
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,916
HE WAS REFERRING TO?

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,250
- Cana: YES, AND IT'S
SURROUNDING MAGNOLIA.

168
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,083
IF THOSE THINGS ARE FULL
OF LIGHTNING,

169
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,208
WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF HE ACTIVATES THEM?

170
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,250
- EVERYTHING WITHIN IT
WILL BE BURNED TO A CRISP.

171
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,583
- Bisca:
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

172
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,958
REQUIP SNIPER RIFLE!

173
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,416
TARGET LOCKED ON!

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,250
STINGER SHOT!

175
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,416
- OH, MAYBE THEY'RE
NOT FIREWORKS AFTER ALL.

176
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING
TO BLOW THEM UP.

177
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,000
- NICE SHOT!
- AWESOME!

178
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,625
- LUCKY WE GOT A SNIPER.

179
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,166
- NOW ALL I GOTTA DO
IS TAKE OUT THE REST.

180
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,000
- ( exploding )
- WHAT?

181
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,291
- AHHH!
- BISCA!

182
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,083
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- BISCA!

183
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,916
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.
- MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,125
- WAS THAT A SCREAM?

185
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,791
- I DON'T WANNA STICK
AROUND TO FIND OUT.

186
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,291
- AHHH!

187
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,000
- WHY DID SHE GET ZAPPED
BY THAT THING?

188
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,291
- C'MON, BISCA!
WAKE UP!

189
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,625
- I DON'T GET IT.
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

190
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,916
- IT MUST BE BODY LINK MAGIC.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,291
- HUH?
WHAT'S THAT?

192
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,875
- IT'S A TYPE OF SPELL
THAT'S BEEN CAST ON THE LACRIMA.

193
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,416
IF YOU DESTROY ONE OF THEM,

194
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,958
THEN THE MAGIC ENERGY
USED IN YOUR ATTACK

195
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,666
WILL BE REFLECTED
BACK AT YOU.

196
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,708
IN OTHER WORDS,
IF WE TRY TO GET RID OF THEM,

197
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,916
WE'LL BE RISKING OUR LIVES
IN THE PROCESS.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

199
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,750
THOSE THINGS COULD WIPE OUT
THE WHOLE TOWN!

200
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,041
- WE GOTTA TAKE DOWN LAXUS,
FAST.

201
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,041
- OKAY, IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL HELP THE CITIZENS EVACUATE.

202
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,666
- I'M COMIN' WITH YOU!

203
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,000
- BIXLOW AND FRIED
ARE STILL OUT THERE.

204
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,916
BE CAREFUL, YOU TWO!

205
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,791
- THOSE THINGS
SURE ARE WEIRD.

206
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,791
- YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WEAPONS, DO YOU?

207
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,500
- Woman: THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS
OF THEM!

208
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,083
- I GOT A BAD FEELING
THAT FAIRY TAIL'S

209
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,083
ABOUT TO CAUSE OUR TOWN
SOME MAJOR TROUBLE.

210
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,666
- ( Laxus laughing )

211
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,958
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT,
YA OLD GEEZER?

212
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,708
NOW EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE
STINKIN' TOWN IS MY HOSTAGE!

213
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,916
- THIS WAS ALL FUN AND GAMES
AT FIRST,

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,041
BUT NOW YOU'VE CROSSED
THE LINE!

215
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,208
- NATSU!
- AH!

216
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,041
- I THINK YOU'RE TAKING
THIS TOO FAR.

217
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,416
- TOO FAR, HUH?

218
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,291
- YOU COWARD!

219
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,875
- I WILL DECIDE HOW FAR
IS TOO FAR.

220
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,041
- IF YOU WANNA BE MASTER
SO BAD,

221
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,666
THEN WHY DON'T YA COME HERE AND
FIGHT GRAMPS FOR IT YOURSELF?

222
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,000
- AH! - THIS IS A FIGHT
TO THE BITTER END!

223
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,833
AND THAT MEANS IT WON'T BE OVER
UNTIL ONE SIDE IS WIPED OUT!

224
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,708
- WHEN I GET OUTTA HERE,
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS!

225
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,000
( grunting )

226
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,750
- STOP!
JUST CALM DOWN.

227
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,750
- I CAN'T CALM DOWN!

228
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,708
- WE'RE NOT GONNA GET OUTTA HERE
THAT WAY.

229
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,333
- THIS SUCKS! STUPID INVISIBLE
WALLS ARE EVERYWHERE!

230
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,750
- IT'S AN ENCHANTMENT.

231
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,875
- YEAH, THANKS,
WE ALREADY KNEW THAT.

232
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,666
- WELL, SINCE IT'S A KIND
OF SCRIPT MAGIC,

233
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,750
I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO BREAK THE SPELL.

234
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,458
- OH, YEAH?
- CAN YOU DO THAT?  REALLY?

235
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,458
- OF COURSE.

236
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:45,833
AND WHEN I DO, YOU GUYS WILL BE
FREE TO GO TRACK DOWN LAXUS.

237
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,791
- HMM.

238
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,375
IF I BREAK DOWN THE LOGUE LETTER
SEQUENCE DATA

239
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,166
INTO COMPONENT BLOCKS

240
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,291
AND THEN PINPOINT THE TERMS
USED TO MAKE UP THE RULES--

241
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,625
I GET L-O-S-U.

242
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,541
OKAY, NOW IF I CONVERT THAT
INTO GEEL GRAMMAR.

243
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,666
- WOW, YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.
WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE,

244
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,125
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

245
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,541
- WAIT, HOLD ON!

246
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,416
THE L. AND S. ARE NOTHING
BUT BLUFFS!

247
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,208
THAT MEANS THE KEY-CODE
MUST BE "ARTH."

248
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,708
- UH, SURE THING.

249
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,000
- I'M ALMOST THERE.
DON'T WORRY.

250
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,083
I PROMISE I'LL GET YOU GUYS
OUT OF HERE.

251
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,125
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL TO ME.

252
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,541
- WELL, IT IS TO ME.

253
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,208
YOU HAVE TO STOP LAXUS.

254
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,750
- LET ME OUT!
( grunts )

255
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,625
- WE CAN STILL WIN.
WE DON'T NEED HOSTAGES.

256
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,375
STOP THIS.

257
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,500
- WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

258
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,125
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT THERE
HUNTING FAIRIES WITH BIXLOW?

259
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,125
THE OLD MAN
IS COUNTING ON ERZA,

260
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,083
SO I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER,
AND MYSTOGAN TOO.

261
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,166
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU DEAL WITH
CANA AND THAT PHANTOM GIRL.

262
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,333
I DON'T NEED EITHER OF THEM
IN MY FAIRY TAIL.

263
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,291
EXTERMINATE THEM.

264
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,375
EVEN IF THEY'RE OUR ENEMIES
NOW, WE'RE STILL IN THE SAME--

265
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,250
- WHEN I GIVE YOU AN ORDER,
YOU HAD BETTER DO WHAT I SAY!

266
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,541
- WE'VE CHOSEN OUR PATH,
HAVEN'T WE?

267
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,083
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
AT THIS POINT.

268
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,250
AS YOU WISH, I'LL FOLLOW YOU.

269
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,958
NO MATTER
WHERE THAT ROAD MAY TAKE ME.

270
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,875
IF YOU WANT ME TO EXTERMINATE,
THEN SO I SHALL.

271
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,250
BUT THEIR BLOOD'S
ON YOUR HANDS.

272
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,916
- LIKE YOU SAID, THERE'S NO
TURNING BACK FOR US NOW.

273
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,708
IT'S TIME FOR SEIZING VICTORY,

274
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,583
NOT WALLOWING IN REMORSE,
FRIED THE DARK.

275
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,041
- ACCORDING TO
WHAT EVERGREEN SAID,

276
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,416
LAXUS SHOULD BE HIDING
INSIDE THIS BUILDING.

277
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I HAVE YOU NOW!

278
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,916
- All: OH!

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,375
- CAN I HELP YOU?
- PLEASE DON'T LOOK, OKAY?

280
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,250
- THIS BATH'S FOR MEN ONLY,
YA KNOW.

281
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,708
- IT'S FINE IF YOU WANNA STAY.
- LAXUS!  WHERE ARE YOU?

282
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,083
YOU CAN'T-- UH.

283
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,750
AH. SHE--
SHE PLAYED ME FOR A FOOL.

284
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,500
- ( laughs )

285
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,666
- DAMN IT!  I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO LOOK.

286
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,750
- IS THERE A PLACE IN TOWN
WHERE HE HAS SOME SORT OF

287
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,250
SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT?

288
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,833
- WELL, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A LONG TIME,

289
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,000
BUT WITH THE WAY
HE'S BEEN ACTING LATELY,

290
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,166
I HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT HE'S THINKING.

291
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,083
- WHY CAN'T WE JUST
WARN EVERYBODY

292
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,416
OVER THE GUILD'S LOUDSPEAKER?

293
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,416
- THERE'S AN ENCHANTMENT
CAST ON IT

294
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,916
THAT'LL ONLY ALLOW THE MASTER
TO USE IT

295
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,875
IF HE CHOOSES TO
SURRENDER TO LAXUS.

296
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,958
THEY WORKED REALLY HARD TO STAB
THEIR FRIENDS IN THE BACK, HUH?

297
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,833
ANYWAY, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WARN
PEOPLE ABOUT THIS MESS

298
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,208
ON OUR OWN.

299
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,541
- LUCY, UM, I'M STARTIN'
TO THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER

300
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,166
IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

301
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,958
- THERE ARE TONS OF PEOPLE
FROM OTHER TOWNS

302
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,500
HERE FOR
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

303
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,625
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE TOWN'S JAM-PACKED

304
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,500
AND EVERYBODY'S ALL WORKED UP.
 - OF COURSE THEY'RE WORKED UP.

305
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,083
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT
THOSE WEIRD THINGS

306
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:21,875
FLOATING IN THE SKY.

307
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,458
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

308
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,458
AND THEY'LL BE EVEN MORE WORRIED
IF THEY FIND OUT

309
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,541
THAT THOSE THINGS
ARE FULL OF LIGHTNING MAGIC.

310
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,541
THEY MIGHT ALL PANIC
AND HURT EACH OTHER.

311
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,833
- BUT THEN WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
THINK, LUCY.

312
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,958
- YEAH.
- THINK, LUCY!

313
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,208
- WHAT'LL YOU DO?

314
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,708
- GET OUT OF THE WAY, LUCY!

315
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,250
- AHH!
WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS?

316
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,166
- Happy:
THEY'RE BIXLOW'S MINIONS!

317
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,041
- YO.

318
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,500
YOU MUST BE THE NEWBIE
EVERYONE'S BEEN TALKIN' ABOUT!

319
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,833
- IS THAT SO?  YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN SAYIN'?

320
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,708
'CAUSE I'M DYING TO KNOW!

321
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,916
- JUST THAT YOU'RE INTO WHIPS,
PLAYIN' DRESS UP

322
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,708
AND YOU LIKE
BOSSIN' PEOPLE AROUND.

323
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,916
- GEEZ, THEY MAKE ME SOUND
LIKE SOME KIND OF PERVERT!

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,541
- HA HA! NICE CHEERLEADER
COSTUME, BY THE WAY.

325
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,416
- Tommens: A CHEERLEADER!
GO, TEAM!  DEFENSE!

326
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,833
- NO, I JUST--
- CHEER!

327
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,291
- All: CHEER!  CHEER!

328
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,250
- ALL RIGHT, BABIES,
TIME TO TEAR IT UP.

329
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,958
TOO BAD.
NORMALLY I'D GO EASY ON YOU,

330
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,875
SINCE YOU'RE
STILL JUST A NEWBIE,

331
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,750
BUT THIS HERE'S A WAR,

332
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,041
AND LOSING IS SIMPLY
NOT AN OPTION FOR US.

333
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,541
- IF YOU THINK THE MASTER'S
GONNA LET YOU

334
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,666
GET AWAY WITH THIS,

335
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,000
YOU HAVE GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING, PAL!

336
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,708
- THE MASTER CAN GO SUCK IT,
FOR ALL I CARE!

337
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,458
BY THE TIME THIS IS OVER,

338
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,958
LAXUS WILL BE THE NEW MASTER
OF FAIRY TAIL. - YEAH!

339
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,708
- THOSE FLYING THINGS
ARE REALLY ANNOYING.

340
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,250
OPEN GATE OF THE ARCHER!

341
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,250
SAGITTARIUS!

342
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,916
- Sagittarius: HORSE POWER!
( neighs )

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,250
HOWDY-DOO, MY LADY!
YOU CALLED?

344
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,875
- OOH, A CELESTIAL WIZARD.

345
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,208
SO YOUR SPIRITS
LIKE TO WEAR COSTUMES TOO?

346
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,791
- THAT'S REAL FUNNY.

347
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,125
AIM FOR THOSE
STUPID FLYING THINGS, GOT IT?

348
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,750
- RIGHTY-O, MY LADY,
AS YOU WISH!

349
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,125
- MY POOR BABIES!
FIRST YOU WERE FROZEN

350
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,166
AND NOW
YOU'VE BEEN BLOWN TO PIECES!

351
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,666
- Both: ALL RIGHT!

352
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,083
- AND TO YOU FLYING FIENDS,
I SAY CHEERIO!

353
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,250
- NO, MY BABIES.

354
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,333
- YOU WANNA SURRENDER,
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

355
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,750
- TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
- THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

356
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,583
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

357
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,875
MY POOR BABIES!

358
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,875
HA HA, PSYCHE!

359
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,125
- AHH!

360
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,625
- OH!  SAGITTARIUS,
ARE YOU OKAY?

361
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,000
- NO.
- WELL, THAT'S IT.

362
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,458
I'M AFRAID THAT I'LL HAVE
TO HIGH TAIL IT BACK

363
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,000
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

364
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,458
TOODLE-OO!
- WHAT THE HECK?

365
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:48,458
- FOR ME, THIS IS MORE THAN JUST
A TOY SHOP, IT'S AN ARMORY.

366
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,625
- Lucy:
YOU'RE CONTROLLING THE TOYS?

367
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,375
- NAW, THEY'RE JUST TOOLS.

368
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,125
YOU CAN BREAK AS MANY OF 'EM
AS YOU WANT.

369
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,291
WHAT I REALLY CONTROL
ARE SOULS.

370
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,875
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- BIXLOW'S SEIDHR MAGIC

371
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,833
ALLOWS HIM TO MOVE SOULS
BETWEEN OBJECTS

372
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,666
AND THEN USE THEM
TO FIGHT FOR HIM.

373
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,333
- ONLY ONE THING TO DO.
- ( laughs )

374
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,041
- HEY, JERK!
- I'LL GET 'EM BACK FOR YA!

375
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,541
- TOO BAD,
LITTLE MISS CHEERLEADER!

376
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,416
I'M AFRAID THE GAME
JUST WENT INTO SUDDEN DEATH.

377
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,208
BUT DON'T WORRY--

378
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,541
I PROMISE I'LL TAKE
EXTRA GOOD CARE OF YOUR SOUL.

379
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,833
BARYON FORMATION!

380
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,250
ATTACK!

381
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,083
- BUT I LIKE MY SOUL.

382
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,916
- LUCY, RUN!

383
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,416
WHAT THE--?

384
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,166
- IT'S STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

385
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,250
FOR SOME REASON,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM

386
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,458
TRAVELING BETWEEN OUR WORLDS

387
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,000
WITHOUT YOU EVEN
HAVING TO SUMMON ME.

388
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,125
THAT MEANS THE WALL BETWEEN
HUMANS AND SPIRITS IS NO MORE.

389
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,041
TOGETHER, YOU AND I
HAVE BROKEN IT DOWN.

390
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,291
AND IT'S ALL THANKS
TO THE POWER OF LOVE.

391
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,208
- POWER OF LOVE?

392
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,250
AW, C'MON,
DON'T JOKE AROUND LIKE THAT.

393
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,833
- I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE LOKE!

394
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,791
- SO THE TIME HAS COME
TO FULFILL MY PROMISE, HUH?

395
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,833
- THANKS, LOKE!

396
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,500
- WELL, WHAT DO YA KNOW?

397
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,583
SO YOU WERE 
A CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

398
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,958
I'VE KEPT YOUR SECRET
SAFE ALL THIS TIME

399
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,875
AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET?
- BUT HOW DID HE KNOW?

400
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,916
- SINCE HE HAS THE POWER
TO CONTROL SOULS,

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,958
THAT MEANS
HE CAN SEE 'EM TOO!

402
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,083
- SO NOW THE SPIRIT WANTS TO
JOIN THE BATTLE

403
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,208
OF FAIRY TAIL TOO.

404
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,291
HUH?
- NO, I DON'T CARE

405
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,500
ABOUT YOUR BATTLE OR LAXUS
OR ANY OF THAT NONSENSE.

406
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,500
LISTEN UP.

407
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,416
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE
IS TO PROTECT LUCY.

408
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,541
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU HURT HER,
UNDERSTAND?

409
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,375
- HA HA!  THAT SO?
OH, THAT'S RICH.

410
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,583
YOU'VE NEVER BEAT ME BEFORE,
YOU KNOW.

411
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,000
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I'VE ALWAYS GONE EASY ON YOU,

412
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,750
LITTLE LION CUB.

413
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,333
LET'S GIVE HIM ONE LAST BEATING
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

414
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,083
BABIES!
- ( all squeal )

415
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,375
- STAND BACK.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

416
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,166
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

417
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,875
ANY DECENT CELESTIAL WIZARD
TREATS HER SPIRITS AS PARTNERS,

418
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,791
NOT AS SHIELDS.

419
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,541
- LUCY LOVES HIM.
- I DO NOT!

420
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,000
- I'LL TRY TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE TOYS.

421
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,541
ONCE HE'S OPEN,
YOU GO TAKE CARE OF BIXLOW.

422
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,083
- OKAY.
LET'S DO THIS.

423
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,458
- AYE!

424
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,458
- O REGULUS,
LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH!

425
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,416
- ( end theme playing )

426
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

427
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,750
- DID YOU GO AND DESTROY
THE REQUEST BOARD AGAIN?

428
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,916
MIRA'S GONNA BE SUPER MAD
AT YOU!

429
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,958
- DON'T EVEN JOKE
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

430
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,416
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE LOSES HER TEMPER.

431
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,333
- IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

432
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,666
- WELL, I WOULD CONSIDER HAVING
EVERY SINGLE BONE IN MY BODY

433
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,083
BROKEN ONE BY ONE
PRETTY BAD.

434
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,541
- OH.
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

435
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,000
- Natsu:
IT MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD, RIGHT?

436
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,791
I MEAN,
I AM STRONGER THAN HER NOW.

437
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,666
- Happy: 
THEN WHY DON'T I TELL HER

438
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,375
YOU BROKE THE BOARD?
 - NO, PLEASE DON'T.

439
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,041
I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE FISH
IN THE WORLD!
