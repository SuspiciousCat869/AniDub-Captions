Previously on Fairy Tail...

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,625
[LUCY] Somehow, I fell asleep
and lost Cana. When I woke up,

00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,625
I had one of the Seven Kin
of Purgatory standing over me.

[HAPPY] Natsu and I
rushed in to save her,

really do that much.

I gotta say, it was pretty lame.

[NATSU] Hey watch it, pal!
I still managed to make up

00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,666
a sweet, new technique to fry
that big dumpling to a crisp!

you can just blast the rocks

How was she able to injure me?!

When my blades
strike they stimulate

the enemy's pain receptors...

31
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,166
One might say they're
"blades of sensation."

32

Such power...

[MELDY] I was not sent here
to answer questions...

Are you sure Zeref
was right here?

00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,250
Then they must've
gotten to him already.

41
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,791
They were definitely here...

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,666
But she must've done
something to mask the smell,

so I can't tell
which way they went.

Grimoire Heart's plan for

53
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,500
taking over the world completely
revolves around Zeref.

Why do the bad guys always
wanna take over the world...?

It sounds like such a huge pain
in the neck if you ask me.

If I took over the world,

yummy fish everywhere!

Let's go find 'em...

We gotta settle the score
for what they did to Gramps.

When I get my hands

How did they get here...?
Hey, wait...

66
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,458
They must've traveled on some
kind of ship to get here, right?

67
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,916
And that dark-haired woman said
she was planning to take Zeref

back with her to see
her master, didn't she?

I'll bet whatever ship they came
in on is anchored somewhere

Well, in that case...

I guess we should head back and
check on Gramps and Wendy...

I'll finally make S-Class rank.

and I can tell him the truth...

But I can't do it until
I'm an S-Class wizard.

I've never seen her
in such a rotten mood...

I guess she could really
use a drink or something.

Wait a sec...

we've been on this island...

00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,416
Not only that, but he took the
communication lacrima with him!

157
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,333
How are we gonna contact
headquarters now, sir?

158
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,750
What exactly are you planning to
do...? Whose side are you on?

159
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,958
[NARRATOR] In a secluded
spot on Tenrou Island,

160
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,458
Fairy Tail's master,
Makarov, lies motionless...

161
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,625
Gravely wounded
from his fierce battle

162
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,875
with Grimoire Heart's
master, Hades.

163
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,291
Unable to heal him,

164
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,166
Wendy and the others anxiously
await Natsu's return.

165
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,708
[NATSU]
Wendy!

166
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,416
You made it back...!
Did you find anything?

167
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,666
[LUCY]
Is Master doing any better?

168
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,750
[CARLA] I can't say his
condition has improved.

169
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,583
[PANTHERLILY] Although it would
seem that the master's wounds

170
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,250
are quite serious, for some
reason I don't feel as though

171
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,458
his life is truly in danger.

172
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,333
[CARLA] Perhaps it has something
to do with this island

173
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
being considered sacred ground.

174
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,583
The traitor's returned!

175
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,958
Where'd you run off to,
whoever-you-are?

176
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,583
That's Mest, the spy
from the Magic Council.

177
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,416
To be quite honest,
my name is Doranbolt.

178
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,458
What are you doing here?

179
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,666
[DORANBOLT]
Please don't be afraid, Wendy...

180
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,541
I guess you could say
I'm on a rescue mission.

181
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,833
[DORANBOLT]
I can use my magic

182
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,875
to transport your guild
members somewhere safe.

183
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,583
I'll get you as far away from
this island as possible!

184
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,541
But first I need to
know where everybody is

185
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,291
in order to do that.

186
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,833
We don't need
your help, okay pal?

187
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,500
What makes you think
we'd trust anyone who's acting

188
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,750
in the interest of
the Magic Council?

189
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,375
This is our problem, not yours;

190
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,041
and we are more than capable of
taking care of it by ourselves.

191
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,583
Listen to me...

192
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,000
I guarantee once the council
finds out what's going on here,

193
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,041
they'll do whatever it
takes to neutralize the threat!

194
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,666
You mean they'll blast us
with Etherion again?!

195
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,458
Once was enough...
Like, seriously.

196
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,750
What's Etherion...? Do you know?

197
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,125
I don't have any firsthand
experience with it...

198
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,166
but apparently, it's extremely
powerful destruction magic.

199
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,666
Yeah, and the Magic Council

200
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,458
used it on us before when we
were in the Tower of Heaven.

201
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,916
[PANTHERLILY] Really? How
did you manage to survive?

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,166
[HAPPY] Well, it's kind of
a long story, actually...

203
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,791
A bunch of other
crazy stuff happened,

204
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,833
and it was all absorbed
inside this huge lacrima.

205
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,958
[CARLA] Yet another example
of this guild running into

206
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,583
major trouble wherever they go.

207
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,458
But if they decide to fire it
while we're all on the island...

208
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,208
Who knows what kind of damage
it might cause this time?

209
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,125
Then we'll have to take care of
business before that happens.

210
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,458
Your master's been defeated...!
And Grimoire Heart's got

211
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,875
incredibly powerful wizards
on their side...!

212
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,625
There's no way
you can beat them!

213
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,083
Oh yeah...? So we should just
blow up the whole island, huh?!

214
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,375
We can't let that happen!
Our guild considers this

215
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,958
sacred ground because our
first master is buried here!

216
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,333
We have to try to protect it!

217
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,458
Here's a message for the
council... Tell them they had

218
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,625
better back off... If they
don't, they're gonna be sorry.

219
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,291
Yeah...! Tell 'em Fairy Tail
can always take care of itself!

220
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:16,041
Are you threatening the Magic
Council...?! Some lowly wizards?

221
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,291
[NATSU] You've got
a lot to learn, man...

222
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,541
Whether it's Grimoire Heart
or the Magic Council,

223
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,500
Fairy Tail doesn't back down.

224
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,125
You attack us, it's gonna
be your last mistake...!

225
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,541
We'll put you deep
in the ground!

226
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,750
[WENDY] The sky... It looks
like there's a storm coming.

227
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,000
Juvia!

228
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,416
[ERZA] Although we don't have
much magic energy left after

229
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,583
the S-Class trials...

230
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,125
we have the advantage...

231
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,000
A two-on-one battle
shouldn't be this difficult.

232
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,500
Number thirteen.

233
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,333
Don't worry... I can handle her!

234
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,250
The wizard known
as Erza Scarlet...

235
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,333
You're assigned number four.

236
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,333
And what does this ranking mean?

237
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,083
Your priority...

238
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,583
It is the order in which
you should be eliminated!

239
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,208
Utter nonsense.

240
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,500
It is necessary.

241
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,166
Tell me why you're
going after Juvia!

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,458
Number thirteen
is worthless trash...

243
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,541
so I want to get her
out of the way.

244
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,333
[JUVIA]
I won't last much longer...

245
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,125
Please stay strong...! Juvia!

246
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,166
[MELDY]
Number three is Gildarts...

247
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,083
But it appears he's
no longer on the island.

248
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,791
Number Two is Makarov...

249
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,625
But Master Hades has
already defeated him.

250
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,916
Master Makarov is number two?

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,333
You mean to tell me there's

252
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,416
a higher priority target
than the master of our guild?

253
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,291
Number one, is that man...
Gray Fullbuster.

254
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,625
Why him?

255
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,208
Why choose Gray?

256
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,958
[MELDY] Because... he has
her blood on his hands.

257
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,791
Ultear's mother... died
because of him...! That man...

258
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,791
Can never be forgiven for
the pain he caused Ultear!

259
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,458
When I find him, I'll
tear him limb from limb!

260
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,833
[ERZA]
She's gone insane!

261
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,583
[JUVIA]
Now you've done it...

262
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:56,000
If you dare carry out that
threat... I swear to you...

263
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,583
You will never live
to speak of it.

264
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,041
What's wrong with her...?
She's only number thirteen.

265
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,791
Wait... Try to calm down Juvia.

266
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,166
How can I do that...? She
plans to kill my beloved

267
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,291
over pure nonsense... And you
think I should remain calm?

268
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,541
[ERZA]
No... But I, uh...

269
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:24,166
I'm afraid there's no way
that's going to happen; not now.

270
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,791
You're gonna pay for even
thinking of hurting him!

271
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,125
[JUVIA]
Water Nebula!

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,041
[ERZA] Amazing... She's a
completely different woman

273
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,000
from the one I faced before.

274
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,750
She's able to channel her
emotions into a massive

275
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,500
flow of strength.

276
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,041
That... is her true power...

277
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,250
Erza, listen...! go ahead; I can
handle this battle on my own.

278
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,166
Find the others and
make sure they're all safe,

279
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,333
especially my darling Gray.

280
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,208
I certainly will...
Best of luck to you.

281
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,291
[MELDY]
Get back here, number four!

282
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,875
Maguilty Rays!

283
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
[JUVIA]
Water Slicer!

284
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,750
The storm is intensifying.

285
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,666
[GRAY] Where's she taking
him...? Back to their base...?

286
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
To Grimoire Heart's master?

287
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,500
[RUSTYROSE] The sky's tears
wash away my own desires...

288
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,208
Its eyes turn cloudy with
the looming darkness.

289
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,125
[AZUMA] Are those the lyrics
of a song... Rusty?

290
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:10,625
In a way... Music to
accompany my drum.

291
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,750
So... Speaking of drums,

292
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,541
it looks as though
you've taken a beating.

293
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,000
Proof that I battled
with a skilled warrior.

294
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,750
Oh, did you now...? I find
that hard to believe...

295
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,041
There doesn't appear to be
a single one in the bunch.

296
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,208
My war drum beats a strong
and steady rhythm.

297
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,583
You'd be wise
to take them seriously...

298
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,708
They are quite formidable.

299
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,583
Their power doesn't
rely solely on magic...

300
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,541
Their hearts and conviction
are weapons enough.

301
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,083
They use Conviction
as a weapon...?

302
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:45,291
Well... That's not unlike
our blossoming flower.

303
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,458
[MELDY]
I find it strange...

304
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,250
We both speak of the
same Gray, and yet...

305
00:18:55,333 --> 00:19:00,250
One is boiling with hate...
And the other one with love.

306
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,166
Although it's the same person...

307
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,625
You'd think we were
discussing two different men.

308
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,416
It's natural... Not
everyone feels the same...

309
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
That's part of being human.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,416
This is an amazing
stroke of luck.

311
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,791
I've come here on a mission
to kill Gray Fullbuster...

312
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,500
And right away,
I've encountered a person

313
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,791
who harbors
strong feelings for him.

314
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,375
What do you mean?

315
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,541
Your deep feelings of love for
Gray... will be what kills him!

316
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,333
Now, Juvia... Enjoy your
brief journey to heaven...

317
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,916
before you descend into
the depths of hell.

318
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:36,291
Picture your beloved...
Feel him inside your heart.

[JUVIA]
My darling Gray...

320
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,583
Just like that...!
My Sensory Link will bind you!

321
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,500
What is that...?
It's hurting my arm!

[JUVIA]
What have you done to me?

324
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,708
I've linked your sensations to
those of your 'beloved Gray.'

325
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,541
It can only be accomplished
between those who have

326
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,166
strong feelings.

327
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,291
You really mean it...?!
My darling Gray and I

328
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
are finally living
our lives as one?!

329
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,416
Only your senses.

What's happening to me?

331
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,458
Why does my face feel
so flushed all of a sudden?!

332
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,750
Doesn't it feel nice...?

333
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,166
your senses are now
completely intertwined.

334
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,583
Oh yes, it does...!

335

It feels so amazing I can
hardly contain myself...!

He too, will experience all
of the pain that I'm prepared

339
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,958
to put you through.

340
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,875
[JUVIA] What...?! You would use
my love to cause Gray... Pain?!!

[JUVIA]
Sierra!

But how...?! Her magic
power has increased!

343
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,750
I underestimated her ability...

344
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,458
She can channel her
feelings into strength.

345
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,708
[MELDY]
Then I'll do the same...!

346

I'll show her the
power of what I feel!

347
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,250
Now...! I'll add one more with
three-spread sensory link!

348
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,541
Why is my attack
hurting me, too?

Damn...! Where is all
this pain coming from?

351
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:58,166
[MELDY] For Ultear's sake...
I would gladly give my life...

352
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,541
I would make that sacrifice.

You are the link
between me and him...

You've allowed me
to connect to my target...

me, you, and your dear,

are all one...
all our senses have merged.

And if one of us were
to die in this battle...

359
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,375
Gray will die as well.

It'll be the end
to all of our lives...

No... The end to all
