1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,250

00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,458
OF S-CLASS WIZARD

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,291
AND I'LL HAVE A BALL
KICKING ERZA'S TEETH IN

4
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,916
WHILE I DO IT.

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,375
I THINK I SEE SOMEBODY.

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,583
- IS IT ERZA?

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:40,875
- ( gasps )

8
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,458
- ( screams )
- NO FRICKIN' WAY!

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,583
- SORRY, DEAD END.

10
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,916
LUCK JUST
AIN'T ON YOUR SIDE.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,916
- WE'RE DEAD.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,708
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,625

14
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,916
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY
ON "FAIRY TAIL..." 

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,208
- ( bells ring )

16
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,083
- Townspeople: WHOA.
( chattering )

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,666
- ( ringing continues )

18
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,625
- WHAT'S UP?
- Both: SOUNDS LIKE BELLS.

19
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,541
- I BET I KNOW WHY
THEY'RE RINGING. - AYE.

20
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,583
- OLD GILDARTS
IS COMING BACK HOME.

21
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,500
- OH, YEAH!

22
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,291
- WELL, IT'S GOOD HE'S BACK,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

23
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,958
WHY EVERYONE'S
GOING TOTALLY NUTS.

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,833
- LOOK HOW HAPPY
THEY ALL ARE.

25
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,541
- Carla: THEY'RE CERTAINLY
MORE OUT OF CONTROL THAN USUAL.

26
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,458
- IT'S ONLY NATURAL
EVERYONE'S EXCITED.

27
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,208
HE'S BEEN GONE
QUITE A WHILE.

28
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,833
THREE YEARS IN FACT.

29
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,833
- Lucy: WHOA, NO WAY!

30
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,666
YOU MODIFIED THE TOWN
JUST 'CAUSE HE'S CLUMSY?!

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,083
- Wendy: HE SOUNDS AMAZING!

32
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,375
- Carla: YES, AMAZINGLY STUPID.

33
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,541
- Natsu: HERE HE COMES.
- Happy: AYE.

34
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,208
- COME ON, YOU OLD GEEZER.
LET'S THROW DOWN.

35
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,833
- THAT'S NO WAY
TO TREAT A MAN.

36
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,416
- GOOD TO SEE YOU!

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,791
NOW LET'S PARTY!

38
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,708
UGH! OY-OY-OY, AH!

39
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,333
( weak chuckles )

40
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,083
OH, YEAH.

41
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,041
- ( clears throat ) IN
ACCORDANCE WITH

42
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,541
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD'S 
TIME-HONORED TRADITION,

43
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,500
I WILL NOW ANNOUNCE 
THIS YEAR'S ENTRANCE

44
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,375
FOR THE S-CLASS
WIZARD-PROMOTION TRIAL.

45
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,583
THE STRENGTH THAT
YOU POSSESS INSIDE,

46
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,875
YOUR CHARACTER, 
AND YOUR HEARTS,

47
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,625
THESE ARE WHAT I CONSIDERED
WHILE MAKING MY SELECTION.

48
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,875
AND I HAVE CHOSEN
EIGHT PARTICIPANTS.

LEVY MCGARDEN.

00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,291
AND MEST GRYDER.

61
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,541
- ( Happy speaking ) 

62
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,791
- Narrator:
WE JOIN OUR HEROES HERE

63
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,500
ON TENROU ISLAND

64
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,041
FOR THE FIRST ROUND
OF THE S-CLASS

65
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,458
WIZARD-PROMOTION TRIAL
IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.

66
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,291
THIS IS ONE OF 
THE EIGHT PATHS

67
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,833
CONTESTANTS HAD
TO CHOOSE FROM.

68
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,375
ROUTE "D."

69
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,458
- ( rumbling )
- ( girls screaming )

70
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,750
- SO STRONG.  HAS SHE
ALWAYS BEEN THIS POWERFUL?

71
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,250
- PRETTY MUCH.

72
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,291
- Erza: YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO

73
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,958
BETTER THAN THAT, JUVIA.

74
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,458
YOU'LL NEVER BECOME
AN S-CLASS WIZARD AT THIS RATE.

75
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,916
- Lisanna:
HER SEA EMPRESS ARMOR.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,375
YOUR ATTACKS AREN'T GONNA
HAVE ANY EFFECT ON HER NOW.

77
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,916
- ( gasping )

78
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,625
I CAN DO THIS.

79
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,125
I WILL DEFEAT YOU.

80
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,500
WATER SLICER!

81
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,250
SHE DEFLECTED MY ATTACK
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

82
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,458
- I'VE GOT YOU NOW, ERZA.

83
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,666
- ( both gasp )
- ( thudding )

84
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,250
- ( screams )

85
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,791
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

86
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,083
TAKE OVER!

87
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,666
YOU'VE IMPROVED A LOT.
I'M QUITE IMPRESSED.

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,125
BUT YOU CAN STILL USE
SOME WORK ON YOUR TIMING

89
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,208
AS WELL AS
THE FORMS YOU CHOOSE.

90
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,541
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH A BUNNY?

91
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,958
- THAT'S IT.

92
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,583
ERZA'S VULNERABLE
WHEN SHE COUNTERS

93
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,166
LISANNA'S ATTACKS.

94
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,666
IF I STRIKE AT
THE RIGHT MOMENT,

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,291
I SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO TAKE HER DOWN.

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,416
IT'S MY ONLY HOPE.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,125
- FINE, IS THIS BETTER?

98
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,291
( screams )

99
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,541
- WATER WHIP!

100
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,041
I TOLD YOU
I'D DEFEAT YOU!

101
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,750
- ( screams )

102
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,083
- ( ragged scream )

103
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,291
- THAT HURT.

104
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,958
- I'M DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, JUVIA.

105
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,958
YOU'VE GOT TO
BE MORE CREATIVE.

106
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,041
ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENT WHILE 
THEY'RE FIGHTING YOUR TEAMMATE

107
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,041
IS THE MOST OBVIOUS
TWO-ON-ONE STRATEGY

108
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,500
YOU COULD HAVE CHOSEN.

109
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,416
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT AS YOU'VE WITNESSED,

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,333
IT'S AN ATTEMPT
THAT'S EASILY THWARTED.

111
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,583
I EXPECTED MUCH MORE.

112
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,041
WHEN WE FIRST MET
AT THE TOWER OF HEAVEN,

113
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,333
YOU WERE FULL OF
DETERMINATION AND SPIRIT.

114
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,500
THERE WAS A FIRE
IN YOUR EYES.

115
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,791
WHERE IS THAT FIRE NOW?

116
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,000
TELL ME!

117
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,416
- ( screams )

118
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,916
- ( screams, gasps )

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,041
- ( screams echo )

120
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,166
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
LUCY AND CANA TAKE A BREAK

121
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,583
AFTER SUCCESSFULLY
CLEARING THE FIRST ROUND.

122
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,750
- ( Lucy sighs in pleasure )

123
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,416
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED. 

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,750
FEELS GREAT.

125
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,541
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE 
GET OVERHEATED SO EASILY.

126
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,000
- IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN HELP IT

127
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,791
WHEN IT'S SO
FREAKIN' HOT OUT HERE.

128
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,541
- ( sighs )

129
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,791
HEY, WE SHOULD GET GOING.

130
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,750
- CAN WE STAY
A LITTLE LONGER?

131
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,541
WE'RE NOT IN A RUSH
OR ANYTHING.

132
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,875
- WHAT'S WITH THIS
"I DON'T GIVE A CRAP" ATTITUDE?

133
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,166
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

134
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,208
- I'M WORRIED NATSU'S STUPIDITY
MIGHT BE RUBBING OFF ON YOU.

135
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,000
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

136
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,750
I'M JUST BEING HARDHEADED

137
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,041
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT 
TO GET OUT RIGHT NOW.

138
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,375
COME ON, CANA.
WE'RE DRENCHED IN SWEAT.

139
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,208
AND THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO WASH IT AWAY.

140
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,916
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,500
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
SOMEWHERE ALONG ROUTE "A..."

142
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,708
- GREAT.
WE'RE SO SCREWED.

143
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,916
- OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO RUN INTO.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,875
- ( growling )

145
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,583
- ( both whimper )

146
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,166
- ( deep demonic pitch )
I'M NOT HOLDING BACK

147
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,000
JUST CAUSE YOU'RE 
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

148
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,458
UNDERSTOOD?

149
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,583
- ( whimpers )
- HELLO! I'M HERE.

150
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,916
YOU GOT TO FIGHT ME TOO,
YOU KNOW?

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
- ( gasping )

152
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,708
SO THIS IS THE POWER...

153
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,958
OF AN S-CLASS WIZARD?

154
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,416
- I SHOULD WARN YOU.

155
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD AT 
HOLDING BACK IN A FIGHT.

156
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,791
SO THIS'LL BE QUICK.
- I'M FIRED UP NOW. 

157
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,458
UH, HAPPY, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING?

158
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,583
- FIGURED WE MIGHT AS WELL
HEAD HOME.

159
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,541
- HAVE SOME FAITH IN ME,
LITTLE BUDDY.

160
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,708
IF YOU REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT,

161
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,500
GILDARTS SHOULD 
BE SCARED OF ME.

162
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,416
I'M GONNA KICK HIS BUTT
AND I WON'T LET UP

163
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,291
UNTIL I HEAR HIM SAY "MERCY."

164
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,416
- FINE, MERCY.

165
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,833
- YOU CAN'T SAY THAT YET!

166
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,375
I HAVEN'T EVEN
LAID A HAND ON YOU.

167
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,875
I'M COMING FOR YOU, GILDARTS!

168
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,333
I GOT A HECK OF A LOT STRONGER
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.

169
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,708
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO SHOW YOU.

170
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,583
- NO, WAIT ONE MINUTE, NATSU.

171
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,291
- ( growling )
- TRY TO CALM DOWN, WOULD YOU?

172
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
I'M NOT READY TO BEGIN
OUR FIGHT JUST YET.

173
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,000
STAY BACK.

174
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,875
- YOU SHOULDN'T RUSH
AT HIM LIKE THAT, NATSU.

175
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,541
HE CAN PULVERIZE
HIS OPPONENTS.

176
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,625
- ( grunts )

177
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,333
( Natsu screams )

178
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,458
- I WARNED YOU.

179
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,000
- GEEZ, KID, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU?

180
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,416
HOLDING BACK IN BATTLE 
ISN'T EXACTLY MY THING.

181
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,458
- OH, NO.

182
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,833
HOW COULD YOU?

183
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,291
POOR GUY'S BEEN BLOWN
TO SMITHEREENS.

184
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,166
- Natsu: YEAH, RIGHT!
HE WISHES!

185
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,833
- WHOA, HE SHATTERED THE GROUND
TO CUSHION THE BLOW.

186
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,083
- THERE'S MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM!

187
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,750
( grunting )

188
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,416
( groaning )

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,541
YEARGH!

190
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,291
- HE'S BEATING HIM SILLY!

191
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,375
NATSU'S SERIOUS.

192
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,208
YOU CAN TELL BY THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE.

193
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,250
- ( screams )

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,583
( chuckles )
- Happy: BUT HE'S STILL SMILING.

195
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,583
FIRE DRAGON...

196
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,375
ROAR!

197
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,500
- YEAH, YOU HAVE
GOTTEN STRONGER.

198
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,291
I'M PROUD OF YOU, NATSU...

199
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,458
THE DRAGON'S SON.

200
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,250
- ( gasping )

201
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,333
( screams )

202
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,458
- ( gasps )

203
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,666
- UH-OH.

204
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,541
- ( groans )

205
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,166
- NATSU?

206
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
- CRAP, I OVERDID IT.

207
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,583
- YOU JERK.

208
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,458
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

209
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,916
THIS WAS JUST
SUPPOSED TO BE A TEST.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,916
YOU KILLED HIM!
- RELAX.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
HE'S DEAD.

212
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,291
IT WASN'T THAT
KIND OF MAGIC.

213
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,250
LOOK UP.

214
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,458
- ( Natsus groaning )

215
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,166
- DISASSEMBLY MAGIC

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,625
BREAKS ITS TARGET DOWN
INTO LITTLE PIECES.

217
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,583
- THERE'S A TON OF NATSUS!

218
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,916
- ( chattering )
- AAH!

219
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,666
- DON'T WORRY. HE'LL GO
BACK TO NORMAL IN A BIT.

220
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,250
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MEANS
YOUR TEST IS OVER, NATSU.

221
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,583
SORRY, BUT I CAN'T PASS YOU.

222
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,625
- Natsus: NOT SO FAST,
YOU OLD GEEZER!

223
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,041
YOU GOT ANOTHER THING COMING
IF YOU THINK

224
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,833
I'M GONNA GIVE UP
THAT EASILY.

225
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,625
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME
JUST 'CAUSE I'M TINY.

226
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,208
I'LL CHAR YOUR FACE OFF!
( chatter )

227
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,958
- PLEASE STOP!

228
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,625
- HEY, I JUST CAME UP
WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA.

229
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,250
I DID TOO.  WE SHOULD
ALL GANG UP GILDARTS!

230
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,333
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY?
GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE.

231
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,791
YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT
AN ARMY OF NATSUS?!

232
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
( high-pitch battle cries )

233
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,333
- ( laughing )

234
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,458
WELL, THIS IS A FIRST.

235
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,916
I'VE NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED
BY A MINI ARMY BEFORE.

236
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,875
- ( water laps )

237
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,375
- ( bones crack )
OH, MAN.

238
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,041
IT FEELS GOOD
TO BE HOME.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,791
- HERE I COME!
- AYE, SIR!

240
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,333
- FIRE DRAGON
SWORD HORN!

241
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,750
- NEVER SAW IT COMING.

242
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,208
- OH, IT'S JUST YOU.
- OF COURSE!

243
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,458
WANT SOME MORE OR ARE
YOU GONNA SAY MERCY? 

244
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,041
- SAY IT.

245
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,791
- OH, COME ON, KID.
I JUST GOT BACK INTO TOWN.

246
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,958
DON'T YOU THINK I DESERVE
SOME TIME TO RELAX?

247
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,000
- NO WAY! I'M ABOUT TO BEAT
YOUR BRAINS OUT RIGHT NOW! 

248
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,583
- ARE YOU SCARED?

249
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,500
- FIRE DRAGON...

250
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,541
IRON FIST!

251
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,416
- AH! NATSU!

252
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,083
- ( chuckles )

253
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,458
- MAN, THAT HURTS.

254
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,416
I SWEAR, THAT GUY'S GOT TO BE
SOME KIND OF MONSTER.

255
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,166
- YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

256
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,708
- DON'T YOU WORRY!

257
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,833
I'M NOT LETTING THAT JERK
BEAT ME AGAIN!

258
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,125
- AYE!

259
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,291
- Young Natsu: GILDARTS!

260
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,333
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU!

261
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,708
- YO. - HEY,
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING, NATSU?

262
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,375
- ( screams, grunts )
- Both: INSTANT K.O. 

263
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,625
- AT LEAST HAVE
THE DECENCY TO SAY HELLO

264
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,000
WHEN SOMEONE GREETS YOU.

265
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,875
WHERE'RE YOUR MANNERS, KID?

266
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,500
- SORRY.  HELLO.

267
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,958
- LOOKS LIKE
HE'S AT IT AGAIN.

268
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,666
YOU'D THINK HE WOULD'VE
LEARNED BY NOW.

269
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,875
- GIVE ME A BREAK.
THAT BONEHEAD'LL NEVER LEARN.

270
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,875
- MIRA, HE MAY NOT BE
THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED,

271
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,125
BUT I THINK HIS COURAGE
IS COMMENDABLE.

272
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,208
- WOW, LOOK AT YOU PULLING
OUT THE BIG WORDS TODAY.

273
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,958
YOU'RE SO LAME.

274
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,750
YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT COMMENDABLE MEANS.

275
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,125
- IF YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY,

276
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,208
THEN GO AHEAD AND SAY IT,

277
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,958
YOU SIMPLEMINDED STRUMPET!

278
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,750
- QUIT TRYING TO ACT LIKE
YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER ME 

279
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,625
OR I'M GONNA KNOCK
YOUR TEETH IN, GOT IT?!

280
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,166
- KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER HELLO?!

281
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,458
- OOH! I KNOW!

282
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,583
- FIRE DRAGON
TALON TO THE HEAD!

283
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,416
- CHEAP SHOT.
- ( laughs )

284
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,750
- Both: SCARY!

285
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,083
- ( screams )

286
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,791
- YOU'RE ON, NATSU.

287
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,000
LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.
- THAT WORKS.

288
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,416
HE'S ALREADY OUTSIDE.

289
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,625
- I THINK WE SHOULD
CALL A TRUCE THIS ONCE.

290
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,166
THEIR FIGHT'S GONNA BE
WAY MORE BRUTAL THAN OURS.

291
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,208
- GOOD POINT,
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

292
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,791
- EVERYBODY'S SURE GETTING THEIR
PANTIES IN A WAD OVER THIS.

293
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,916
- Young Elfman: SO YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GO WATCH WITH THEM?

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,791
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

295
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,416
WHAT ABOUT YOU, CANA?

296
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,041
ARE YOU GONNA GO
WATCH THE FIGHT?

297
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,958
- ME? UH...

298
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,041
NO, I'LL STAY HERE.
- ( unsure ) OKAY.

299
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,708
- ( screaming )

300
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,250
( grunting )

301
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,375
- ( thumping )
- ( groaning )

302
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,708
- YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A SINGLE HIT IN YET, NATSU.

303
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,875
- SHUT UP.
I KNOW.

304
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,416
- WHAT'S THE MATTER? DON'T
TELL ME THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

305
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,083
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, GILDARTS.

306
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,250
- YEAH?
- I KNOW YOU'RE POWERFUL.

307
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,250
YOU'RE THE STRONGEST GUY
IN THE WHOLE GUILD.

308
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,083
- YOU'RE LOOKING
PRETTY WOBBLY THERE.

309
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,000
- Young Natsu:
THAT'S WHY I GOT TO BEAT YOU.

310
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,500
IT'LL HAPPEN SOMEDAY.
- ( thudding )

311
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,666
- YOU KNOW IT'S
KIND OF HARD TO TAKE

312
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,041
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SERIOUSLY

313
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,833
WHEN YOU JUST KEEL OVER
LIKE THAT, NATSU.

314
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,041
- WE'RE GONNA FIGHT.
IT'LL HAPPEN...

315
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,791
SOMEDAY.

316
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,625
- OKAY, BUT
I'M WARNING YOU NOW,

317
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,750
I WON'T HOLD BACK...

318
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,791
OR LOSE.
-  ( Natsus growl )

319
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,125
READY OR NOT,
HERE I COME!

320
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,541
- IT'S A HOARD 
OF MINI NATSUS!

321
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,541
- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

322
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,583
- ( battle cries )

323
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,041
( screaming )

324
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,500
( groans, chatter )

325
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,041
( battle screams )

326
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,000
HA!

327
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,875
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!

328
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,875
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

329
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,875
- THEY'RE SO CREEPY.

330
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,791
- YOU'RE ANNOYING ME.

331
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,666
- YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS
GONNA BE EASY, DIDN'T YOU?

332
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,708
- TIME TO GO BACK
TO NORMAL, NATSU.

333
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,083
- ( high-pitched screams )

334
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,875
( chuckles )

335
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,500
HERE I COME!

336
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,500
DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART!
- UH-OH!

337
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,208
- FLAME LOTUS:
EXPLODING FLAME BLADE!

338
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,875
- DID HE GET HIM?

339
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,041
- ( pants )

340
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,208
( gasps )

341
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,250
- THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU ATTACKED AT FULL POWER

342
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,625
AND HE DIDN'T
EVEN FLINCH. 

343
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,166
LOOKS LIKE IT
DIDN'T FAZE HIM AT ALL.

344
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,500
- YEAH, IT DID.
YOU GOT TO TAKE

345
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,791
A CLOSER LOOK, HAPPY.

346
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,458
THE OLD MAN TRIED
TO STAND FIRM,

347
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,875
BUT MY BLAST MOVED HIM
BACK A FEW FEET.

348
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,541
( laughs )

349
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,708
NOT TO MENTION
HIS CAPE'S ALL MESSED UP.

350
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,166
- DID HE REALLY MOVE HIM?

351
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,750
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,
HE'S RIGHT.

352
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,708
GILDARTS DIDN'T
TAKE A SINGLE STEP.

353
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,666
( screams )

354
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,250
WAIT, THAT'S BAD NEWS FOR NATSU

355
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,416
'CAUSE GILDARTS
BARELY MOVED

356
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
AND HE STILL BEAT HIM.

357
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,375
- ( chuckles )

358
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,875
( weakly groans )

359
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,250
- YOU'RE WOBBLING LIKE
THE LAST TIME YOU GUYS FOUGHT.

360
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,791
- I'VE GOT THIS.
- YEAH, SURE YOU DO.

361
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,208
NOT!

362
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,041
- VERY IMPRESSIVE WORK, NATSU.

363
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,708
THIS GAVE ME A GOOD FEEL
FOR YOUR SKILL LEVEL.

364
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,750
YOU MAY NOT HAVE
DEFEATED ME IN BATTLE,

365
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,625
BUT AS YOUR EXAMINER,
I THINK YOU DESERVE

366
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,750
TO MOVE ON TO
THE NEXT ROUND.

367
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,666
- THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GIVING UP NOW.

368
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
I'LL BEAT YOU, GILDARTS!

369
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,958
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF MOVING UP TO S-CLASS

370
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,541
IF I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT?!

371
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,500
- I HAD A FEELING
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

372
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,750
- ( rumbling )

373
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,750
- ( wind rushes ) 
- BUT I DON'T KNOW

374
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,208
IF YOU'LL WANT 
TO KEEP THIS UP

375
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,666
ONCE I'VE FINALLY
UNLEASHED MY FULL POWER.

376
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,875
- ( gasps )

377
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,208
- THERE'S SOME KIND OF PRESSURE

378
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,250
BUILDING UP IN HERE.

379
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,916
- IN ORDER TO WALK
THE PATH OF MAGIC 

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,416
AND EVENTUALLY 
REACH ITS PEAK,

381
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,708
THERE IS ONE THING
YOU STILL LACK.

382
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,666
- ( wind rushes faster )

383
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,833
- LET ME SHOW YOU.

384
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,791
- ( gasping )

385
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,416
- WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S MAGIC POWER.

386
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,875
AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT.

387
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,333
- ( frightened gasping )

388
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,750
- HMM.

389
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,000
- ( whimpers )

390
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,375
( harsh breathing )

391
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,208
( growls )

392
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,708
( screams )

393
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,875
( yelps )

394
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
( panting )

395
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,875
( growls )

396
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,916
( whimpers )

397
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,125
( frightened gasps )

398
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,750
( shaky gasps )

399
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,083
I...

400
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,458
ACCEPT DEFEAT.

401
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,625
- NATSU.

402
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,041
- A WISE CHOICE.

403
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,541
I APPLAUD ANYONE
WHO HAS THE COURAGE

404
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,083
TO STAND UP AND
FACE THEIR ENEMIES.

405
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,416
HOWEVER, THE WIZARDS
WHO ARE THE MOST COURAGEOUS

406
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,458
ARE THOSE EXCEPTIONAL FEW

407
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,083
WHO KNOW WHEN 
TO STAND DOWN.

408
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,250
REMEMBER, NATSU.

409
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,583
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH FEELING FEAR.

410
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,125
AFTER ALL, HOW ELSE WOULD WE
COME TO KNOW

411
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,125
OUR OWN WEAKNESSES?

412
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,833
YOU NEED TO KNOW THEM

413
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:11,125
IN ORDER TO BECOME A STRONGER
AND GENTLER PERSON,

414
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,625
A NECESSITY FOR THOSE
WHO WANT TO BE S-CLASS.

415
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,500
NOW THAT I'VE SHARED
THIS KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU...

416
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,833
YOU PASS, KID.
- ( gasps )

417
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,708
BUT I DIDN'T BEAT YOU.

418
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,291
- DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

419
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,375
I'M YOUR EXAMINER
AND I SAY YOU'VE PASSED.

420
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,375
YOU'VE MADE IT THROUGH
THE FIRST ROUND,

421
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,291
BUT THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING.

422
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,041
YOU KNOW HOW
MASTER CAN BE.

423
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,583
I'M SURE THIS WAS
NOTHING COMPARED 

424
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,708
TO WHAT HE'S GOT 
IN STORE FOR YOU.

425
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.

426
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,333
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

427
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,000
NOW, THAT WE'VE FINISHED
UP YOUR TEST,

428
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,291
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
AS A FRIEND.

429
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,750
POSSESSING POWERFUL MAGIC
ISN'T THE BE-ALL END-ALL.

430
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,708
ONE THING I CAN 
TRULY APPRECIATE

431
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,583
IS YOUR HUNGER TO WIN,

432
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,041
YOUR BURNING DESIRE
FOR VICTORY.

433
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,708
I SAY THAT
'CAUSE I HAVE IT TOO.

434
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,958
LIKE YOU,
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE.

435
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,791
I'LL TAKE YOU ON
AGAIN ANYTIME.

436
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:25,000
NOW GO BECOME
AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

437
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,833
YOU HEAR ME?

438
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,708
- ( cries )

439
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,708
- ( theme music playing )

440
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

441
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,125
- Happy: YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

442
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,625
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I SAW THAT MEST GUY.

443
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,541
WHAT'S HIS DEAL AGAIN? - THEY
SAY HE WAS MYSTOGAN'S PUPIL.

444
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,791
SO, I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS
THEY TRAVELLED AROUND TOGETHER.

445
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,250
- HOW COME HE DIDN'T SHOW UP
DURING THE EDOLAS STUFF?

446
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,291
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
HE DIDN'T POP UP ONCE.

447
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,291
 WAIT, I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I'VE MET HIM BEFORE.

448
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,416
- OF COURSE YOU HAVE.
HE'S A MEMBER OF OUR GUILD.

449
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,458
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

450
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,125
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
THAT ONE TIME?

451
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,041
HE DID THAT THING.  UH...

452
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,125
- MAYBE HE USES
SOME KIND OF MAGIC

453
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,541
THAT MAKES US OVERLOOK HIM.
- THAT MUST BE IT.
