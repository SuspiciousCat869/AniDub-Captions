00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,208
[NARRATOR] At the end of last
year's Grand Magic Games,

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,791
Rogue traveled from the future

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,416
to unleash a swarm of
dragons and terrorize Fiore.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,166
It was revealed that Frosch's
death had been the catalyst

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,333
for the change in Rogue,

6
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,333
filling his heart
with an evil shadow,

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,000
and sending him on his
quest for vengeance.

8
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,375
Before fading away,

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,500
he told Natsu who was
responsible for the murder,

10
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:42,000
and that this tragic event would
occur in one year's time.

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,666
He implored the Dragon
Slayer to protect Frosch

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,208
at that crucial moment.

13
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,416
A promise that Natsu
intends to keep.

14
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,833
It looks like the rain is
concentrated on that village.

15
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,125
That must be it, huh?

16
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:27,875
[HAPPY gasps]

17
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,291
It's rainy over here!

18
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,250
But sunny over here.

19
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,541
And I'm back in the rain!

20
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,791
I guess.

21
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,541
But I see things just
a little differently.

22
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,833
Why not stand here and
get the best of both?

23
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,291
I like your style, buddy!

24
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,500
[CARLA]
They're so easily entertained.

25
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,708
Does anybody even
live in this place?

26
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,333
[WENDY] It seems
completely deserted to me.

27
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,625
Nah, I smelled Juvia
the second we showed up.

28
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,166
She's over there.

29
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,791
[gasps]

30
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,541
[NATSU]
Hey! Juvia!

31
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,208
[gasps]

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,083
You miss me, babe?

33
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,500
[JUVIA]
With all of my being.

34
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,416
We should blow this town.

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,583
[gasps]

36
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,250
[JUVIA]
My icy hunk!

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,166
How can you be so
cool and still so hot?

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,875
Simmer down.

39
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,208
But I am glad you're fired up!

40
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,166
Yeah, I gotta say, that was
a pretty energetic welcome.

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,916
It's so good to see
you again, Juvia!

42
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,791
[JUVIA]
Natsu, Lucy, and Wendy.

43
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,541
Don't forget Happy and Carla!

44
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,916
So, are you the only one
who lives in this village?

45
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,750
What's the matter with you?

46
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,458
[LUCY]
She fainted!

47
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,041
[WENDY]
She's burning up.

48
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,041
[CARLA]
Of course.

49
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,208
Everyone knows you
shouldn't spend

50
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,416
so much time
standing in the rain.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,625
I wonder if this is
even Juvia's house.

52
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,000
[NATSU]
Hmm.

53
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,333
I'm pickin' up a faint
whiff of Gray, too.

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,791
Is he hiding from us?

55
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,708
[JUVIA]
No.

56
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,458
You asked if I was
living here alone.

57
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,333
In truth, Gray and I shared it.

58
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,208
[BOTH gasp]

59
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,333
Just us two.

60
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,458
[LUCY]
She looks so smug.

61
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,166
[JUVIA]
After the guild disbanded,

62
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,333
we came across this
deserted village

63
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,000
and decided to stay
in one of the houses.

64
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,041
We took our meals together.

65
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,833
Trained together.

66
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,541
Worked together.

67
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,041
And at night we slept--

68
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,250
[LUCY]
Stop!

69
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,833
We get it, okay?

70
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,166
[JUVIA] ...in separate beds,
which was his idea.

71
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,125
[BOTH chuckle]

72
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,000
It was pure bliss.

73
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,000
Until one day...

74
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,500
[JUVIA]
Gray, my love.

75
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,291
Be careful about leaving
your clothes lying around.

76
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,666
Again.

77
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,708
[JUVIA]
Darling?

78
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,208
Are you okay?

79
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,083
You look like you have
a rash or something.

80
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,583
Don't worry about it.

81
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,666
Let's go eat lunch.

82
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,875
[JUVIA]
From that day on,

83
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,291
he insisted on leaving
the village by himself.

84
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,291
[JUVIA] And half a year ago,
he never came back.

85
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,125
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,541
What kind of a jerk up
and leaves like that?

87
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,708
[LUCY]
I can think of one.

88
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,666
At least I left behind a will.

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,541
[HAPPY] Pretty sure
that was just a note.

90
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,291
Still, you took off one day
without so much as a warning.

91
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,500
How do ya think
that affected me?

92
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,416
Honestly, it made me feel...

93
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,333
Do you have to flirt
with him in front of us?

94
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,916
I'm not flirting!

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,875
Are you trying to tell us
that you don't even know

96
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,208
where he ran off to?

97
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,875
Yes, that's precisely
what she's telling us.

98
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:01,375
I searched far and wide,
frantically, for days on end.

99
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,458
But... I never found him.

100
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,666
I decided to come back home.

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,000
This house may seem
empty, but it's not.

102
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,541
It's filled with every
memory we made together.

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,250
So I waited here,

104
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,750
foolishly hoping he'd return
to the life we'd built.

105
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,875
Sorry, guys. I wish
I had happier news.

106
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,041
I promise I'll find him.

107
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,250
For you and the rest of us.

108
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,083
We're gonna get
everyone back together.

109
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,416
And I ain't stoppin'
until we're a guild again.

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,916
I hope some rest will
help her feel better.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,375
[CARLA] Finding Gray would
be far more effective.

112
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,000
I tried my best, but I wasn't
able to keep tabs on him.

113
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,916
You're being unusually
quiet over there, Natsu.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,250
[NATSU] Just thinkin'
about our next move.

115
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,250
We're gonna pay
Sabertooth a visit.

116
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,541
[LUCY]
Huh?

117
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,625
[ARLOCK] The Oración Seis,
Grimoire Heart, and Tartaros.

118
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,875
The three powerful members

119
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,125
of the Bahram
Alliance have fallen.

120
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,541
The era of dark guilds is over.

121
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,541
Which means, now begins
the era of Avatar.

122
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:38,250
What we pray for, is a world
ruled by the dark lord Zeref.


123
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,916
The time is upon us.


124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,666
We must purify the world


125
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,083
of all who oppose our
demonic sovereign.


126
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,875
All we do, we do for Zeref.


127
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,833
All we do, we do for Zeref.


128
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,708
All we do, we do for Zeref.


129
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,250
[giggles]

130
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,541
All we do, we do for Zeref.


131
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,000
[WENDY]
This is bad.

132
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,625
For some reason,
my healing magic

133
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,791
isn't working on her fever.

134
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,583
We can only hope and
pray that the others

135
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,833
find some useful information
from Sabertooth.

136
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,458
We'll take care of everything
here as best as we can.

137
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,958
But they need to find Gray
and bring him back soon.

138
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,791
That's gotta be it.

139
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,791
[LUCY]
Whoa! That's huge!

140
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,625
Hey, what makes you
so sure Sabertooth

141
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,833
is gonna have any
info on Gray anyway?

142
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,125
I can't talk about it.

143
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,125
[LUCY]
Uh.

144
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,208
But why would that be a secret?

145
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,708
Listen real close, Lucy.

146
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,416
[LUCY] Hey, you need to
look where we're going,

147
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,291
and don't let go of the reins!

148
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,375
[NATSU]
I trust Gray, all right?

149
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,875
But the only way
we're gonna be able

150
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,041
to find out anything useful
is if we stop trusting him.

151
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,500
[LUCY]
I don't get it,

152
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,416
but can you talk and look at
the road at the same time?

153
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,208
[NATSU] I gotta stop
trusting him for now,

154
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,541
but only until we find him.

155
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,458
That's what I mean.

156
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,916
[LUCY]
That doesn't make sense!

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,541
I swear, I will find
Gray and bring him back.

158
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,000
You hear me?

159
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,625
[LUCY gasps]

160
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,625
But I can't say any more
until that happens.

161
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,583
Turn around, dummy!

162
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,166
[YUKINO]
Lucy?


163
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,375
It's you!

164
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,625
Well, this is certainly
a pleasant surprise.

165
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,375
[LUCY]
Hey, Yukino!

166
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,208
I hope everything's
going good with you!

167
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,125
[YUKINO]
Yeah, things are great!

168
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,250
Honestly, business picked
up for us when we stopped

169
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,041
having to compete with
you guys in Fairy Tail.

170
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,416
I can't remember a time the
guild's been this profitable.

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,416
[YUKINO] Um, sorry, Lucy,
that's not what I meant.

172
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,916
Don't worry about it.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,791
Besides, Fairy Tail is about
to make a big comeback!

174
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,208
[YUKINO]
Oh, really?

175
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,000
That's great! I'm so happy
that you guys are gonna...

176
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,750
That's not something
to cry about.

177
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,250
[STING] There's some faces
I haven't seen in a while!

178
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,833
[LECTOR] Oh, yeah.
It's been a long time.

179
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,291
Hey there, strangers,
thanks for droppin' by!

180
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,166
It's good to see ya!

181
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,500
[grunts]

182
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,166
You are...?

183
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,125
What's up, Sting?

184
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,208
[LUCY yelps]

185
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,166
Wow, man, you haven't
changed one bit!

186
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,125
Yeah, you either!

187
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,791
Are you blind?!

188
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,333
[chuckles]

189
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,166
[STING] So, what brings you
all the way to our guild?

190
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,583
If you came here to hang
out, then be our guests!

191
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,041
And if it so happens that you
came here to work with us,

192
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,000
then be our partners.

193
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,208
That's really sweet of you,

194
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,125
but we're a little too
busy at the moment.

195
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,625
[LECTOR] Hey, uh, did
Carla not come with you?

196
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,083
[HAPPY] Nah, not this time.
Is Frosch around?

197
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,500
Frosch went out on a job
with Rogue and M'lady

198
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,083
and I don't know when
they'll be back.

199
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,583
Where'd they go?!

200
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,875
Hey, man, get your
hands off Lector, okay?

201
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,958
Please calm down.

202
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,541
[grunting]

203
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,375
I don't know.
But they just left.

204
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,875
They're probably only as far
as the city gates by now.

205
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,416
Awesome! Thanks, little guy!

206
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,541
[LUCY]
Hang on, Natsu!

207
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,041
[HAPPY]
Wait for us!

208
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,083
How rude.

209
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,583
What the heck was
that all about?

210
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,958
[LECTOR]
No clue.

211
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,708
You're back to normal?!

212
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,083
He was a little out of balance,

213
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,791
so I had Libra even
the scales out for him.

214
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,708
Hey, Rogue!

215
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,083
[ROGUE]
Hm?

216
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,375
Is that Natsu?

217
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,916
[NATSU]
Let's have a chat!

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,750
[FROSCH]
Uh?

219
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,958
[ROGUE]
You're choking me!

220
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,416
[LUCY]
Hey! We're right behind you!

221
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,666
Don't just run off without us?

222
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,666
Why are they here?

223
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,166
If you guys wanna talk,
I'd be happy to!

224
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,250
Sorry, but this is a
private conversation

225
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,250
between me and Rogue only!

226
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,750
It's been some time.

227
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:56,375
Yeah. I'm glad to see you're
part of Sabertooth again.

228
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,375
[MINERVA] Oh, were you
just at the guild hall?

229
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,041
[LUCY]
We dropped by for a sec.

230
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,208
Is Sting okay? He looked
a little bit "plus-sized."

231
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,875
[MINERVA]
It's because we had our annual

232
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,291
"Tiger, Tiger, Tiger" eating
competition a few days ago.

233
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,208
[LUCY] Ah, and he went
overboard, did he?

234
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,083
[MINERVA] But I was the
one who tasted victory.

235
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,208
Is that why you skipped this
year's Grand Magic Games?

236
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, Sting is our
guild master now,

237
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,250
and he's of the opinion that
the games are too boring

238
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,750
without Fairy Tail in
the competition.

239
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,916
I think so, too!

240
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,291
Lucy.

241
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,916
I'd like to apologize for
my behavior last year.

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,291
Huh?

243
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,833
[LUCY]
Apology accepted.

244
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,625
I mean, both of us
only wanted our teams

245
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,291
to take home the grand prize.

246
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,750
That's true, but I
went way too far.

247
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,875
Listen, it's all water
under the bridge now.

248
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,916
I think it's a shame that Fairy
Tail had to disband like that.

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
You all made such
a wonderful guild.

250
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,166
But it's not really gone.

251
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,541
It'll always live
on in our hearts.

252
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,916
That's a guild's true home.

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,166
Check it, Happy!

254
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,958
Same place as mine!

255
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,375
Now what's so urgent?

256
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,750
Why the hell did you drag
me all the way out here?

257
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,750
[NATSU]
I wanna see your job request!

258
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,458
[ROGUE]
Huh?

259
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,208
Just show me the flier!

260
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,708
--Here you--
--Gimme

261
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,791
[NATSU]
"Destroy Avatar."

262
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,041
That must be it...

263
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm gonna take this one for ya.

264
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,416
[ROGUE]
Huh?

265
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,208
You can't steal my job!

266
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,625
And besides, you
don't even belong

267
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,541
to a guild anymore, do you?

268
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,458
[NATSU]
You bet I do!

269
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,875
I'm a member of Fairy Tail.

270
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,916
So like I said, I'm gonna
take over this job.

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,458
Only thing I want out of it
is to destroy this "Avatar."

272
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,375
The bounty's yours.

273
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,625
But you and Frosch can't
leave town until I get back.

274
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,958
I want you to swear
you'll stay put.

275
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,750
You've lost your mind.

276
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,958
Where are you going?!

277
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,291
[LUCY]
Whoa, wait! Natsu!

278
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,708
It's time for us to start
makin' tracks, you guys!

279
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,166
Minerva! Keep an eye
on those two, okay?

280
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,125
Don't let them leave town!

281
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,916
[ROGUE]
One year from now...

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,666
What's going on with them?

283
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,958
No idea.

284
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,833
That was weird.

285
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,291
[ROGUE] ...you must warn
the Rogue from your time

286
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,333
to protect Frosch
one year from now...

287
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,541
[HAPPY]
Hey, Natsu?

288
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,791
Do you have any idea what
this "Avatar" thing is

289
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,541
that Rogue is
supposed to destroy?

290
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,583
Beats me.

291
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,416
[LUCY]
They're a black magic cult.

292
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
[BOTH]
Huh?

293
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,583
After all of the dark
guilds were defeated,

294
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,791
Avatar rose up to
take their place.

295
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,958
They're fanatically
devoted to Zeref.

296
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,000
To Zeref?

297
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,208
[LUCY] I'm not sure if he has
anything to do with them,

298
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,166
but as I understand it,

299
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,708
the members of Avatar
worship him like a god.

300
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,875
So they're just a bunch
of Zeref's flunkies?

301
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,541
This is gonna be fun!

302
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,208
But I still don't get
why you think Gray

303
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,833
would ever join up with
a creepy group like that.

304
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,250
Yeah, it doesn't
make sense to me.

305
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,666
[NATSU]
Hm.

306
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,583
Hmm... Hmm...

307
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,791
[HAPPY]
Is that him trying to think?

308
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,791
[LUCY]
He really can't tell us, huh?

309
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,958
Naw, I'll tell you
what's goin' on.

310
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,500
It's all because of what
Future Rogue said to me.

311
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,625
When those dragons came?

312
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,166
And then, on that fateful
day that I lose Frosch,

313
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,791
it will finally happen.

314
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,166
I will be swallowed by
the darkness forever.

315
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,625
[NATSU]
That's not gonna happen.

316
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,708
It most certainly will.

317
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,666
One year from now...

318
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,625
...you must warn the
Rogue from your time

319
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,083
to protect Frosch one
year from now...

320
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,875
...from Gray Fullbuster.

321
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,916
[gasps]

322
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,666
[ROGUE]
He will kill Frosch.

323
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,500
[LUCY] Come on, Natsu,
don't keep us in suspense!

324
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,250
Are you gonna tell us what
Rogue said or what?

325
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:22,041
[NATSU] A year after that Grand
Magic Games, meaning right now,

326
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,916
Gray's supposed to be our enemy.

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,375
[LUCY, HAPPY]
No way!

328
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,208
[NATSU] So I thought if we
went where Rogue and Frosch

329
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,166
were supposed to go,
we'd run into him there.

330
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,791
But didn't we successfully
change the version of the future

331
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,416
that Rogue came from?

332
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,916
That shouldn't be
possible anymore.

333
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,416
[NATSU]
Yeah, I don't know for certain,

334
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,625
but right now, this is the only
lead that I have to go on.

335
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,875
I can't imagine him
being our enemy.

336
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,083
You heard what Juvia said.

337
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,541
Gray had those black
markings all over him.

338
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,416
They were on him when we
fought Mard Geer, too.

339
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,833
I'm not sure,

340
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,250
but I think the way he was given
his Demon Slayer magic

341
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,041
may have involved him
getting taken over

342
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,541
by some kind of demon.

343
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,250
Oh, no.

344
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,583
[LUCY] Why did he wait
so long to tell me?

345
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,416
Obviously, Gray and Rogue were
supposed to fight at some point

346
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,041
and Natsu knows what
the outcome will be.

347
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,375
Is that why he left?

348
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,208
It'll be okay, Lucy.

349
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,458
'Cause no matter what happens,

350
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,458
Gray's always gonna
be one of us.

351
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,583
You're right.

352
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,416
Aye-aye, Sir!

353
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,125
[ARLOCK] O Zeref, the day
of purification draws nigh,

354
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:41,166
when all souls are offered up
to you in a great reaping.

355
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,000
You shall be exalted on high
atop a grand world of magic,

356
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:49,166
heralding the death and rebirth
of this contaminated domain.

357
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,208
[JEROME]
Your Eminence.

358
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,625
Please excuse me.

359
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,041
But do you intend
to proceed soon?

360
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,500
We've received word
that the council

361
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,750
may have already learned
of the purification plan.

362
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,625
[BRIAR]
We may need to root out

363
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,041
any subversive
elements beforehand.

364
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,666
Isn't that right, Bushy?

365
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,916
Bushy?

366
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,125
I shall consider it.

367
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,125
[ARLOCK]
Leave me to my prayers.

368
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,958
I require solitude.

369
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,541
[MARY]
Okay.

370
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,750
We all know how grandfather has
a tendency to be hard-headed,

371
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,500
so I'd wager it
won't be too long

372
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,916
before we have some company.

373
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,791
[giggles]

374
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,875
Silence, Poison Tongue.

375
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,958
Hey, now!

376
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,500
I really don't
appreciate being given

377
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,000
one of your terrible nicknames.

378
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,666
Couldn't you at least
think of something cool

379
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,000
to call me instead?

380
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,708
If the Magic council
has caught wind

381
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,750
of the purification plan
we're brewing up,

382
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,333
that would be
might-TEA bad indeed.

383
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,458
[MARY] Ugh, first these
terrible nicknames,

384
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,916
then terrible TEA puns?

385
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,666
Give me a break. Ha!

386
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,375
[D-6] Which way will
the winds of fate blow?

387
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,750
As long as I can have a
little fun, I'm all good.

388
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,625
[JEROME] Our problem is
not with the council,

389
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,875
but rather how word of our
plan has reached their ears.

390
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,125
[GRAY]
What you're trying to say

391
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,458
is that they have
a spy in our ranks.

392
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,916
Right?

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,625
And you're trying to point
the finger at me, aren't ya?

394
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,916
[grunts]

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
Icy boy.

396
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, you did come to us

397
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,208
from the quote unquote "greatest
guild in the world," LOL.

398
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,375
[JEROME] We've done our
due diligence on you,

399
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,791
Gray Fullbuster.

400
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,708
You have quite an
interesting past.

401
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,208
Not only was your family
killed by Deliora,

402
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,125
a demon from the books of Zeref,

403
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,500
our dark lord also was
involved in the deaths

404
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,583
of your master and her daughter.

405
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,375
If you've been truly
that suspicious of him,

406
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,125
why wait to bring it up now?

407
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,041
[D-6] He's faithfully
served alongside us

408
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,750
for over half a year.

409
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,916
However, he still has no
reason to revere Lord Zeref.

410
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,500
Sounds to me like your
due diligence was spotty,

411
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,375
"Dark Sword" Jerome.

412
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,041
Master Ur's daughter is
still alive, for one thing.

413
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,583
So tell us, what did
draw you to our cause?

414
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,125
Lay off him, Bushy.

415
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:04,708
It's cool, Briar. I welcome
the chance to explain myself.

416
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,083
I joined you because I'm
after the Book of E.N.D.

417
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,750
Is that a good enough
reason for ya?

418
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,750
And that's all I want.

419
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,541
No matter what I have
to do to get it,

420
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,041
or who I gotta go through,
it will be mine.

421
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,000
[BRIAR]
Such darkness.

422
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,250
[GRAY] Yeah, I used to be in
a guild, you all know that.

423
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,625
But it's gone, and I've
found my true calling.

424
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,083
Now listen up closely so I
don't have to repeat myself.

425
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,458
The only thing I care
about is killing E.N.D.,

426
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,541
and I'm sure as hell
gonna make that happen.

427
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,083
[BRIAR] Revenge has cast a
dark shadow over his heart.

428
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,625
[GRAY] So if you can get
me there, I'm with ya.

429
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,875
Ooh, there's no way some
spy from the magic council

430
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,541
could give off that kind
of raw, dark energy.

431
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,208
And he's super hot.

432
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,708
[D-6]
Mhm.

433
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,333
[JEROME]
I wonder...

434
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,208
[JEROME] I've given it
careful consideration,

435
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,916
and yes, you may
call me "Bushy."

436
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,458
[BRIAR]
Uh?

437
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,291
Well, that's the place.
No doubt about it.

438
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,791
It's creepy. Like an old church
swallowed by the forest.

439
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,541
Okay, what now?

440
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,250
Trusty ol' Plan T, of course!

441
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,875
[SOLDIER A]
Captain.

442
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,250
We're getting close
to Mikage Forest.

443
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,000
Avatar's HQ is
somewhere in there.

444
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,375
[GAJEEL]
Roger.

445
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:44,083
But, sir, I have some
unfortunate news.

446
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:48,416
Our spy has confirmed...
that Gray Fullbuster

447
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,458
is in fact affiliated
with the cult.

448
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,958
[GAJEEL]
Gray?

449
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,416
I guess we'll just
have to arrest him

450
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,125
with all the other creeps.

451
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,625
Isn't that what the
"Custody Enforcement Unit"

452
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,500
is supposed to do anyway?


453
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,166
[chuckles]


454
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,500
[LUCY]
Inside those cold stone walls,

455
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,208
the battle against Avatar's
most powerful members begins.

456
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,875
And unfortunately,
Gray is on the dark side,

457
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,000
wielding his new-found
Demon Slayer Magic.

458
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,583
Just as Rogue predicted,

459
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,166
former comrades meet
again as enemies.

460
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,750
Has he forgotten
the bonds he formed

461
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,666
during his days in Fairy Tail?

462
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,083
I can hardly believe it.

463
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,583
Next Time: "Underground Clash."

464
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,541
The cry of a trusting heart
reverberates through the air.

465
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,833
But will it be returned
with silence?
