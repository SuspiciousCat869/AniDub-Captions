[NATSU groaning]

165
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,625
Natsu?

166
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,291
Are you gonna be okay?
What's wrong?

167
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,541
[LEVY]
You're hurt too?

168
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,541
It's because they're
Dragon Slayers.

169
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,250
Their bodies are
reacting to Acnologia.

170
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,916
Natsu. Gajeel.

171
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,916
I wonder.

172
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,333
Just what does his
arrival foretell?

173
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,791
It's quite the quandary.
Not even I can say.

174
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,750
[growls]

175
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:40,916
[roaring]

176
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:45,833
He's here!

177
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,250
He'll eat us!

178
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,666
What do we do? We can't
fight that thing!

179
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,125
We sure can't.
He'll roast us alive!

180
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,083
He will if we give up now.

181
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,041
But I don't plan to. Not ever!

182
00:16:56,125 --> 00:17:00,666
[ACNOLOGIA roaring]

183
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,958
[WIZARD A]
Everyone run!

184
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,166
[WIZARD C] Don't clump up,
it gives him a target!

185
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,958
[WIZARD B] Make sure
we have all the wounded!

186
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,916
[WIZARD D]
Find shelter wherever you can!

187
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,291
[VIJEETER]
He looks mad.

188
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,250

00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,458

[CROWD screaming]

191
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,458
[ROMEO]
This is crazy.

192
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,583
[WAKABA] He can do that much
damage just by flying by?

193
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,333
[MACAO]
I think we may be done for!

194
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,291
We're all gonna die.

195
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,916
We gave it all we had, but how
are we supposed to beat this?

196
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,291
Damn it!

197
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,625
I think I see it now.

198
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,125
You've come for E.N.D.
To hunt him down.

199
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:59,083
[roaring]

200
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,750
[MARD GEER] Then it's fear
that cracks your whip.

201
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,750
You know that once he's been
reborn, he'll be unstoppable.

202
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,625
So you'll kill him now,
before he grows.

203
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,625
[MARD GEER]
How amusing.

204

207
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,083
[IGNEEL]
Natsu.

208
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,666
It's been too long, my boy.

209
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,291
[NATSU gasps]

210
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,375
[LUCY]
Huh?

211
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,000
Igneel?

212
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,250
[IGNEEL] It must be
you who defeats E.N.D.

213
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,583
But I have absolute faith
you're up to the task.

214
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,750
[NATSU]
Igneel.

215
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,000
How can I hear your voice?

216
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,125
[gasps]

217
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,750
Igneel?

218
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,750
No one else is here.
Who're you talking to?

219
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:01,083
[IGNEEL] Fear not.
I will deal with Acnologia.

220
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:01,916
[NATSU gasps]

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083

[NATSU laughing]

224
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,625
[MIRAJANE]
When he was a little boy,

225
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,958
a dragon found him
wandering the forest.

226
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,375
He took Natsu in

227
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,666
and taught him all about
language, culture, and magic.

228
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,791
But...

229
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,583
[LUCY gasping]

230
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,791
[NATSU groaning]

231
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,583
[NATSU]
Why, Dad?

232
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,583
Why'd you go 'n why
didn't you take me?

233
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,791
[groaning]

234
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,875
He's not gone.
He'd never leave me!

235
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,291
Not on purpose! No!

236
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,583
I'll find him.
One of these days.

237
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:40,916
[NATSU screaming]

238
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,000
[LUCY yelps]

239
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,250
[IGNEEL] I'm sorry, son,
but I never did leave you.

240
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,833
[IGNEEL]
In fact,

241
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,291
I've been closer than you
ever could've guessed.

242
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,625
[IGNEEL] Please trust that
all will be explained in time.

243
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,041
Right now,

244
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,583
I must wipe the blight of
Acnologia from this world!

245
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:05,083
[IGNEEL]
Fight, Natsu! Fight to live!

246
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:10,166
[roaring]

247
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,541
I'm dreaming. I have to be.

248
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:32,333
[NATSU crying]

249
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,041
You're back.

250
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,125
[LUCY] Igneel,
King of the Fire Dragons,

251
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,750
rises up to stop Acnologia
and his wings of darkness.

252
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,375
We humans can do
nothing but stare in awe

253
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,916
at a battle that goes far
beyond our comprehension.

254
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,166
Till Natsu jumps into the
fray, his fists giving voice

255
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,791
to emotions far too
strong for words.

256
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:34,666
Once again, a promise is made
between father and son.

257
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,458
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
Fire Dragon Iron Fist."

258
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,333
His flames will burn
away the darkness.
