1
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,500
[LUCY] After being
disbanded for a year,

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,375
the Fairy Tail members
were finally reunited.

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,625
But we were still missing
Master Makarov,

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,791
who had been taken prisoner

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,625
by the Alvarez Empire,
an ocean away.

6
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,375
The ruler of this land was
none other than Zeref,

7
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,708
who is bent on obtaining
the Fairy Heart.

8
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,416
A sacred lacrima containing
the body of our founder

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
and first master,
Mavis Vermillion.

10
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,708
With it, he will be able to
harness unlimited magic power.

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,625
On the heels of
Makarov's rescue,

12
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:50,333
the Alvarez Army invaded
Ishgar, and the war began.

13
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,250
As we struggled against
the incredible might

14
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,166
of Zeref's elite force known
as the Spriggan Twelve,

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,458
our allies in guilds
across the land,

16
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,958
rushed in to join the fight.

17
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,041
Natsu took on Zeref himself.

18
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,500
During this intense clash,
he learned who he truly is:

19
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,458
Zeref's younger brother.

20
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,166
As well as E.N.D.,

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,916
the strongest demon from
the Black Wizard's book.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,958
This makes things more
difficult because it means

23
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,208
if Natsu were to kill Zeref,
he would die, too.

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,208
The war raged on at
a dizzying speed

25
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,333
as Acnologia entered the fray,

26
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:25,041
taking down a member of the
Spriggan Twelve, God Serena.

27
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,833
After seeing Natsu and Lucy
work together in battle,

28
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,291
Mavis devised a strategy
for defeating Zeref

29
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,541
once and for all.

30
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,791
She then asked Cana
to use Fairy Glitter

31
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,583
to attack her projection,
destroying her lacrima

32
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,500
and enabling her
to regain her body,

33
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,583
which had been trapped
for nearly a century.

34
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,416
Natsu's team traveled
with Brandish

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,458
as she tried to convince
her fellow Spriggan,

36
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,166
the "Wizard King" August,
to stop fighting,

37
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,666
but Mest's scheme ruined
any chance for peace.

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,375
Meanwhile, Acnologia
confronted Irene,

39
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,125
another powerful Spriggan,

40
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,875
who cast a spell known
as Universe One.

41
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,125
This restructured the
geography of Fiore

42
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,750
and displaced everyone
in the kingdom.

43
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,416
The guild members were
scattered throughout the land,

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,875
but the voice of Mavis'
childhood friend Zera

45
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,416
guided them back to
Fairy Tail's guild hall.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,541
Zeref has now captured Mavis,
and is waiting for our return

47
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,041
alongside every one
of the Spriggan Twelve.

48
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,250
Both living and dead.

49

I'm feelin' hungry.

00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,500
I wanna go back to the guild

I knew we'd see him
again someday!

That's what I call
serious backup.

I'll say!

64
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,125
Always been your style
to just show up

whenever you please, huh?

Don't I know it.

Hi, Cana. My sweet baby girl!

68
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,666
Ew. Let go of me!

69
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,083
And pay attention to the enemy!

Oh, yeah. This guy.

71
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,958
[GILDARTS]
His magic power feels weird.

72
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,333
Like it's coming from
a corpse or somethin'.

73

[GOD SERENA]
Say what?

Too bad, really.

75
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,416
If you were alive, you'd
be one hell of a wizard,

76
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,958
but like this,
you're a punchline.

You like to run your
mouth, don't you?

Soon you'll stand in awe

of the might of "Eight
Dragon" God Serena!

Hey, Romeo, are you okay?

Well, honestly? No, not really.

86
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,625
I was so pumped up before.

87

I thought I could handle this.

But now...

[ROMEO] I realize how horribly
we're outnumbered,

It's pathetic.

I feel like I can't even walk.

Don't feel bad,
we're all scared.

Yes, and he's using the
same spell as before!

and that's been stripped away.

162
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,500
Invel's Ice Slave spell robs a
person of their sense of self.

163
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,291
Your inner voice muffled
as if through a thick sheet

164
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,875
of impenetrable ice.

165
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,291
How long will it
take to complete

166
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,000
your separation enchantment?

167
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,500
You understand
more than anyone

168
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,458
this girl has a very
special power

169
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,291
and that this won't be quick.

170

[groaning]

171
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,708
I only wish to keep her
suffering to a minimum.

[IRENE]
Oh?

173
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,291
I never imagined
you would express

174
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,625
such sympathetic
feelings, Your Majesty.

175
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,625
This may come across
a bit insolent,

176
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,958
but I assure you I
mean no disrespect.

177
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,416
You won't beat
Acnologia with mercy.

178
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,208
Only with cunning
and brute strength.

He is the epitome of darkness.
The true Dragon King.

180

You have a gift for
speaking truth to power.

181
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,500
I'll take my leave.

Excuse me, my lady.

184

Clearly, I'm a bit occupied
at the moment, Neinhart.

185
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,583
Can you wait to discuss
your problem later?

186
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,458
It's about Erza. I've found her.

187
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,666
[IRENE]
So she survived. As I expected.

188
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
What do you advise I do?

189
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,125
I felt I had to consult
you before acting.

190
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,333
Kill her.

191
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,666
But--

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,583
You know I take no pleasure
in repeating myself.

I hear you.

194

However, my
Historias have proven

195
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,041
to be completely
ineffective against her.

196
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,583
Then you must go and fight
her yourself, obviously.

197
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,791
You do remember who
you are, don't you?

198
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,125

I didn't do anything!

It's weird. The air is changing.

I'm Invel Yura, Winter General.

A title I've earned
for obvious reasons.

No. How can this be happening?

He froze my ice spell?

252
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,250
I use ice magic in a
more absolute sense.

253
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,750
Not merely creating
objects from ice.

254
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,875
Instead, freezing everything
to its very core.

This "maker" magic you wield

256
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,875
is an inferior derivative
of true ice wizardry.

I can shatter your spells

[INVEL] He can use it to
create powerful magic weapons,

269
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,583
but it seems like there's
a steep cost involved.

As if it's taking something
away from him.

271
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,375
Perhaps this power
robs the wielder

of their very own humanity.

This is why His Majesty
uses it himself.

So that means you guys actually
see yourselves as villains, huh?

[INVEL] Our side has no
concept of good or evil.

Darkness is a powerful force

321
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,125
[GRAY]
Get back here!

322
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,291
What're we supposed to do now?

323
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,250
[gasps]

324
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,166
Juvia.

325
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,625
Gray, darling.

326
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,666
[gasps] I feel so weird.

327
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,583
Like my head is
spinning outta control.

328
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,250
I can't move at all.

329
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,291
It's like my body refuses to.

330
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,500
It's Ice Lock.

331
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:08,375
It constrains your mind, thus
turning you into my puppet.

332
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,500
Regardless how you may feel
inside, you will do my bidding.

333
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,208
You will fight to the death.

334
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,041
Kill each other?

335
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,208
[INVEL] Yes, and you will
remain in these shackles

336
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,000
until one of you dies.

337
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,500
This won't hold me.

338
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,625
Screw you!

339
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,833
[gasps]

340
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,541
[GRAY]
I can't...

341
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
[INVEL]
This is perfect.

342
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,541
I know Gray will
prevail in this fight.

343
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,958
And at the very moment
he kills his friend...

344
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,875
...the darkness in him
will take over.

345
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:46,125
His Majesty won't be
the one to defeat E.N.D.

346
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,416
Gray will do it, I've no doubt.

347
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,875
Juvia.

348
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,583
Gray, dear.

349
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,541
[JUVIA]
No. I refuse.

350
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,916
I can't hurt
the love of my life!

351
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Instead, while I still
have a little control...

352
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,666
...I'll have to kill myself!

353
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,000
[LUCY]
Invel, AKA "the Winter General,"

354
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,916
makes a move to force Gray into
releasing his inner darkness.

355
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,583
He begins by taking over
Gray and Juvia's minds,

356
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,666
making them fight to the death.

357
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,000
Struggle as they might,

358
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,208
their hearts freeze and
their thoughts slip away.

359
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,958
However, Juvia never loses touch
of her feelings for Gray,

360
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:59,083
and fights back the only
way she knows how.

361
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:02,125
Next time: "Gray and Juvia."

362
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,833
Their path to the
future is murky,

363
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,666
but will love light the way
through the shadows?
