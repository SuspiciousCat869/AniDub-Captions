EVERYTHING'S BACK TO NORMAL!

33
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,041
LET'S NOT GET
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

34
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,458
WE SHOULDN'T CELEBRATE
UNTIL WE KNOW EVERYBODY'S OKAY.

35
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,416
- THEY'RE JUST FINE.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,083
WE GOT HERE A WHILE AGO,

37
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,666
SO WE WENT AND
CHECKED ON 'EM FOR YOU.

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,125
- WE DECIDED TO FLY
THROUGH TOWN REAL QUICK.

39
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,291
- YOUR FRIENDS AND EVERYONE
IN TOWN ARE DOING GREAT.

40
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,208
- WHEN WE TALKED TO THEM,
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

41
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,833
THEY'D BEEN TURNED
INTO A LACRIMA.

42
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,916
- EARTH LAND IS TOTALLY AWESOME,
YOU GUYS.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,666
IT'S GOT TONS
OF MAGIC POWER.

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,875
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?
IT'S NOT RIGHT!

45
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,208
- ( cheering )

46
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,625
- Carla: THE EXCEEDS DON'T
BELONG IN EARTH LAND!

47
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,166
- ( Happy speaking )

48
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,458
- WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM
TO STAY HERE.

49
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,875
THEY'RE FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

50
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,541
THEY SHOULD
RETURN TO EDOLAS.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,375
- BE NICE.
- THEIR HOMELAND'S GONE

52
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,833
SO THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

53
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,291
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
FORGIVE THEM.

54
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,666
- NEVER!
- WE APOLOGIZE

55
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,041
FOR THROWING ROCKS
AT YOU, LADY.

56
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,250
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

57
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,708
- WE HAVE
NO PLACE TO GO NOW

58
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,333
THAT EXTALIA'S 
BEEN DESTROYED.

59
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,250
- WE PROMISE THAT
WE'LL BE NICER TO YOU, NOW.

60
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,666
- PLEASE SAY YOU'LL FORGIVE US.

61
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,791
- THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU KIDS!

62
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,250
IT'S HER! I'M ANGRY
BECAUSE EXTALIA'S QUEEN

63
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,708
AND HER LACKEYS
SENT ME TO EARTH LAND

64
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,375
ON A MISSION TO KILL
THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

65
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,791
- I KNOW!

66
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,166
THE QUEEN ORDERED US
TO GIVE UP ALL OUR EGGS.

67
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,125
HOW CAN SHE BE
SO HEARTLESS?!

68
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,208
GAH!
- CALM DOWN, DEAR.

69
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,083
- HEY THERE, MISTER.

70
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,083
- YEAH, NO JOKE.
SHE NEVER EVEN

71
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,916
TOLD US WHY, DID SHE?

72
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
- I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT SHE HAD

73
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,000
A MOST HONORABLE
REASON TO DO SO.

74
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,875
- I REMEMBER
THE MOMENT VIVIDLY.

75
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,125
IT WAS SIX YEARS AGO.

76
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,208
- Martam:
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE,

77
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,708
QUEEN CHAGOT
HAS THE ABILITY

78
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,458
TO GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE.

79
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,083
IT IS BOTH A GIFT
AND A CURSE.

80
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,750
ONE DAY...

81
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,083
- ( gasps )

82
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,083
- Mejeer:
EXTALIA WILL FALL?

83
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,166
- I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT
IF THAT'S QUEEN CHAGOT'S VISION,

84
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,625
I'M AFRAID IT'S BOUND
TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.

85
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
- THEN WE HAVE TO 
PROTECT OURSELVES.

86
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,583
BUT WHO WOULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

87
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,541
- WHO ELSE COULD IT BE
BUT THE HUMANS?

88
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,500
- Present-day Martam:
WE NOW REALIZE THAT EXTALIA

89
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,625
WAS BOUND TO FALL
THROUGH NATURAL MEANS

90
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,041
DUE TO THE EXHAUSTION
OF MAGIC POWER.

91
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,291
HOWEVER, AT THE TIME,
WE BELIEVED OUR HOMELAND

92
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,166
WOULD BE DESTROYED
BY THE HUMANS.

93
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,833
- WHAT SHALL WE DO,
YOUR MAJESTY?

94
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,958
- Chagot: WE CANNOT WIN A WAR
AGAINST THE HUMANS.

95
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,000
- ( all sigh )

96
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,333
- WE'VE NO CHOICE.

97
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,541
SAVE THE CHILDREN.

98
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,208
- SAVE THEM?!
- YOU DON'T MEAN--

99
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,875
- ( gasps ) 
- WHAT THE--

100
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,583
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S A WAY DIFFERENT STORY

101
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,250
THAN THE ONE 
WE WERE TOLD.

102
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,500
YOU AREN'T LYING TO US,
ARE YOU?

103
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,875
- NO, YOUNG MAN.

104
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,166
- TO PREVENT PANIC AMONG
THE EXTALIANS,

105
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,958
WE CARRIED OUT OUR PLAN 
WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE.

106
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,583
- THE QUEEN THEN ISSUED
A FALSE PROCLAMATION.

107
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,291
IT WAS MERELY A COVER-UP
FOR OUR PLAN.

108
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,083
- THIS OPERATION
IS TO PROTECT YOU.

109
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,500
THESE MONSTERS,
THE DRAGON SLAYERS

110
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,291
MUST BE ELIMINATED.

111
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,875
PLEASE, I ASK FOR 
YOUR UNDERSTANDING

112
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,791
AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME.

113
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,625
- Mejeer:
WE FELT HORRIBLE ABOUT

114
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,208
MAKING THE QUEEN
LIE TO YOU LIKE THAT.

115
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,375
- Muganto:
YES, BUT WE HAD NO CHOICE.

116
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,958
- Mysdroy: WE SIMPLY
COULD NOT GO PUBLIC 

117
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,500
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT OUR BELOVED EXTALIA

118
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,291
MIGHT COME CRASHING
TO THE GROUND.

119
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,666
- Martam: DESPITE 
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD,

120
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,291
I ASSURE YOU THAT
WE HAVE NO ILL-WILL

121
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,291
TOWARDS THE DRAGON SLAYERS
WHATSOEVER.

122
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,833
- Wendy: DON'T WORRY.
WE KNOW.

123
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,250
YOU JUST NEEDED
SOMETHING TO GO ALONG

124
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,458
WITH THE STORY
YOU TOLD THEM.

125
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,916
- YOU KNEW EVERYONE WOULD PANIC
IF THE TRUTH GOT OUT

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,166
SO YOU HAD TO MAKE UP
SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL THEM.

127
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,791
- WE GET IT.

128
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,708
- Chagot: WE MADE USE
OF THE HUMANS' ANIMA 

129
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,250
TO SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OUT
OUR OPERATION.

130
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,000
HOWEVER...

131
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,125
SOMETHING COMPLETELY
UNEXPECTED HAPPENED 

132
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,250
WITH ONE OF THE EGGS.

133
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,708
WE HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU, CARLA,

134
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,916
POSSESSED AN
INCREDIBLE POWER.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,250
- ME?

136
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,541
- YES, AS IT TURNS OUT,

137
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,875
YOU POSSESS THE SAME
PROPHETIC POWERS THAT I DO.

138
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,291
- ( gasps )

139
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,458
- ( gasps )
- UNFORTUNATELY,

140
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,666
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
CONSCIOUS CONTROL OVER IT.

141
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,166
AND AS A RESULT, IT CLOUDED
AND CONFUSED YOUR MEMORY.

142
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,791
OF THE 100 EXCEEDS
THAT WE SENT AWAY,

143
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,625
ONLY YOU HAD THIS GIFT.

144
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,291
I SUSPECT

145
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,958
THAT YOU BEGAN TO SEE
SCATTERED FRAGMENTS

146
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,125
OF EDOLAS'S FUTURE.

147
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,125
- Young Carla:
WE ARE DOING THIS

148
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,916
FOR THE GOOD
OF OUR KINGDOM.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,666
MAGIC POWER WILL COMPLETELY
VANISH FROM OUR WORLD.

150
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,833
WE ARE SENDING OUR CHILDREN

151
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,291
TO ERADICATE THE MONSTROUS
DRAGON SLAYERS.

152
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,708
IT IS OUR MISSION.

153
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,541
( gasps )

154
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,041
- Chagot:
YOUR GIFT

155
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,041
CAUSED YOU TO MISTAKE
THAT INFORMATION

156
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,458
AS YOUR PERSONAL MISSION.

157
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,583
- I WAS WRONG.

158
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,375
- Happy: WAIT,
DOES THAT MEAN...

159
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,958
- Chagot: THE TWO OF YOU
WERE NEVER GIVEN A MISSION.

160
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,125
IT WAS JUST YOUR WAY
OF TRYING TO MAKE SENSE

161
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,958
OF ALL THE STRANGE THOUGHTS
AND IMAGES IN YOUR HEAD.

162
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,916
YOU WERE SENT HERE
BECAUSE WE WANTED 

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,833
TO PROTECT
THE NEXT GENERATION.

164
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,416
NOTHING MORE.

165
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,333
- Carla: SO THOSE
WERE ALL PROPHESIES?

166
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,166
- FOR WHATEVER REASON,
WE THOUGHT YOU'D BE BETTER OFF

167
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,250
IF WE HID YOUR
PROPHETIC POWERS FROM YOU.

168
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,708
THEREFORE, WE HAD NO CHOICE,
BUT TO MAKE IT SEEM

169
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,375
AS THOUGH WE WERE
CONTROLLING YOU. 

170
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,166
WE BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS.
- AT THE TIME,

171
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,000
WE HONESTLY THOUGHT
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY

172
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,208
WE COULD EMBELLISH
THE QUEEN'S ILLUSTRIOUSNESS.

173
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,958
HOWEVER, NOW,
WE DEEPLY REGRET IT.

174
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,458
- THE SHOW OF FALSE BRAVADO
THAT I CHOSE TO PUT ON

175
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,083
FOR THE CITIZENS AND HUMANS
IN THE FACE OF HARDSHIP

176
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
IS WHAT CAUSED YOU TO SUFFER.

177
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:12,916
NO, I DIDN'T JUST
CAUSE YOUR SUFFERING.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,583
I BROUGHT ANGUISH
TO ALL OF THE FAMILIES

179
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,833
I TOOK EGGS FROM
SIX YEARS AGO.

180
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,958
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND.

181
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,166
THAT IS WHY I HANDED
THE SWORD TO YOU.

182
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,833
I SWEAR THAT EXCEED KIND
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

183
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,750
IT WAS MY FAULT ALONE.

184
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,708
- ( crying )

185
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,250
OH, MEOW!

186
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,041
- IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT,
YOUR MAJESTY.

187
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,333
NO ONE IS TO BLAME.

188
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,875
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE
HELD RESPONSIBLE

189
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,708
WHEN YOU WERE ONLY DOING
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS BEST

190
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,541
FOR THE CITIZENS
OF EXTALIA.

191
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,500
- YEAH, WE'RE JUST AS MUCH
TO BLAME AS YOU ARE,

192
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,166
QUEEN CHAGOT, 'CAUSE WE
WERE SO FULL OF OURSELVES.

193
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,458
- BUT NOW THAT
WE'RE IN EARTH LAND,

194
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,125
WE CAN MAKE
THINGS RIGHT AGAIN.

195
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,666
- LET'S GO OUT THERE AND
FIND ALL THE EXCEED CHILDREN

196
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,083
THAT WERE SENT AWAY
SIX YEARS AGO.

197
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,125
- ( Exceed cheering )

198
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,375
- THIS IS AWESOME.

199
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,041
WE'VE GOT NEW PURPOSE!
- LET'S DO OUR BEST

200
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,583
TO BECOME FRIENDS
WITH THE HUMANS. 

201
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,750
- HERE'S TO MAKING
A FRESH START, YOU GUYS.

202
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,041
- ( giggles ) THEY'RE
OPTIMISTIC, AREN'T THEY?

203
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,125
- THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

204
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,833
- ( cheers ) - WE SHOULD
ALL COUNT OUR BLESSINGS TODAY.

205
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,000
WE ARE LUCKY TO BE GRANTED
THIS NEW BEGINNING.

206
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,166
- WELL, OKAY.

207
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,416
THEN, IN THAT CASE,
I FORGIVE YOU.

208
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,208
- OH.

209
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,125
CARLA.

210
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,083
- BUT TELL ME
HOW DID I END UP

211
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,708
POSSESSING THE SAME
PROPHETIC POWER THAT YOU DO?

212
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,083
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
TO SAY. - ( coughing )

213
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,000
- WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD.
- ISN'T THE WEATHER LOVELY?

214
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,166
- WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING
MY QUESTION?

215
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,125
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- YEAH?

216
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,625
- IS IT JUST ME OR
DO QUEEN CHAGOT AND CARLA

217
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,583
LOOK A LOT ALIKE?
- YOU THINK SO?

218
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,833
- AYE, SIR.

219
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,833
ALSO, THEY ACT THE SAME.
- THEY DO?

220
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,625
- ( laughs )
- Happy: YEAH!

221
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,291
THEY DO ALL
THE SAME STUFF?

222
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,375
- Lucky: GAH!
GUESS I NEVER NOTICED.

223
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,750
- IT ALL WORKED OUT.

224
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,125
I'M GLAD EVERYTHING
ENDED UP OKAY.

225
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,791
- YES.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

226
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,625
YOU TOTALLY CAUGHT
HIS WEIRD ARM WAVING.

227
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,708
- SO HAVE YOU, GRAY.

228
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,833
- SNIFF, SNIFF, SNIFF.
- ( gasps )

229
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,583
- AREN'T YOU LOVELY?
SUCH A FRAGRANT <i>PARFUM!</i>

230
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,666
MHMM, I JUST
CAN'T GET ENOUGH!

231
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,791
- KNOCK IT OFF!
- PLEASE, MISS.

232
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,125
ALLOW ME TO ENJOY YOUR <i>PARFUM</i>

233
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,500
A LITTLE LONGER!
- NO, STOP IT!

234
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,708
GET AWAY!
- ( groans )

235
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,500
SO LOVELY,

236
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,875
YET SO CRUEL.

237
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,375
- I'M SORRY.
YOU JUST REMINDED ME

238
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,291
OF A VERY FORWARD ACQUAINTANCE.

239
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,833
- I THINK IT WOULD BE
BEST FOR US

240
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,750
TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE
SOMEWHERE NEARBY.

241
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,833
DON'T YOU? - YEAH, THEN
WE CAN VISIT EACH OTHER.

242
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,625
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU SO CHIPPER ABOUT?

243
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,791
- CARLA.

244
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,916
NOW WE'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE EACH OTHER

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,916
WHENEVER WE WANT.
- WAIT.

246
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,833
SHE'S SO WARM.

247
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,666
- FEEL FREE TO COME AND
VISIT US ANYTIME, OKAY?

248
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,208
- AYE, AYE.
- GAH!

249
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,208
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO VISIT, SEE?!

250
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,000
- OH, I PROMISE YOU
I WILL.

251
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,375
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I REALLY LIKE

252
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
THE WAY THAT
THE TWO OF YOU SMELL.

253
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,708
- ( whimpers )
- ( giggles )

254
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,458
- ( screams ) - IF YOU THINK
YOU CAN SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED,

255
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,166
YOU GOT ANOTHER
THING COMING!

256
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,000
BE POLITE! AND CHECK WITH
US BEFORE YOU VISIT!

257
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,958
YOU'RE NOT TOO OLD FOR ME
TO BEND YOU OVER MY KNEE!

258
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,125
- Exceeds: THANK YOU.
( chatter )

259
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,000
- BYE, WE'LL SEE YOU LATER!
- YEAH, TAKE CARE.

260
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,041
- BYE, FOR NOW.

261
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,916
- GOOD-BYE, I CAN'T THANK
YOU ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING.

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,458
- GAH! I CAN'T
TAKE MUCH MORE

263
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,500
OF THIS MUSHY CRAP.
- YES, YES, I KNOW, DEAR.

264
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,125
- WE'LL COME BACK AND VISIT.
- BYE-BYE.

265
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,875
DON'T BE STRANGERS.
- ( giggling )

266
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,541
BYE-BYE.
- WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

267
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,250
- BYE-BYE.
- I'LL MISS YOUR SWEET <i>PARFUM.</i>

268
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,458
- THANKS AGAIN.

269
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,875
- ( laughs )

270
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,791
- Lucky: GAH!

271
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,958
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T
JUST TELL CARLA

272
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,333
YOU'RE HER MOM.

273
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,875
- UNTIL WE CAN FIND
ALL OF THE CHILDREN

274
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,875
WE SENT TO EARTH LAND
SIX YEARS AGO,

275
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,625
I'M NOT FIT TO
CALL MYSELF A MOTHER.

276
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,250
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING?

277
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,166
- GAH! YOU GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

278
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,833
I DON'T NEED
NO SON THAT BLUE!

279
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,125
- I'M JUST GLAD WE CAN SEE HIM
WHENEVER WE WANT.

280
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,833
- THAT MAY SEEM
LIKE A GOOD THING,

281
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,125
BUT WAIT TILL
HE'S OVER ALL THE TIME.

282
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,083
I GOT TO SAY, QUEEN CHAGOT,

283
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,958
I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU'D SENT

284
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,875
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER 
TO EARTH LAND TOO.

285
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,791
- I AM MERELY A WOMAN 
WHO WAS NAMED A QUEEN.

286
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,250
AND JUST LIKE YOU,

287
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,041
I KNOW HOW MUCH CHILDREN
MEAN TO THEIR PARENTS.

288
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,875
- Lucky: GAH!
AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

289
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,875
- ( Marl laughs )

290
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,250
- ALL RIGHTY!

291
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,291
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE HEAD BACK TO THE GUILD?

292
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,583
- SOUNDS GOOD, BUT WHAT ARE
WE GONNA TELL EVERYONE?

293
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,458
- NOTHING.  SINCE THEY GOT
NO CLUE THAT ANYTHING HAPPENED,

294
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,833
WHY BOTHER TELLING THEM?
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT,

295
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,625
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
TELL THEM ABOUT MYSTOGAN,

296
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,166
DON'T YOU? -
HEY, WHAT'S WITH YOUR ARMS?

297
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,041
- UH, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
- IT AIN'T A PROBLEM!

298
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,166
IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF FUN.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

299
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,625
- YEAH, COME ON, DO IT.

300
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,125
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
YOUR FIST PUMPING,

301
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,125
YOU MORONS!

302
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,708
WHERE THE HECK IS MY CAT?!

303
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,375
DON'T TELL ME THOSE
FLYING FELINES

304
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,666
TOOK LILY WITH THEM?!
- WHO IS LILY?

305
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,416
- REMEMBER THAT BIG,
BRAWNY EXCEED WHO HELPED US?

306
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,791
- ARE YOU BLIND?
I'M RIGHT HERE. 

307
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,791
- All: SO TINY!

308
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,708
- All: SO TINY!

309
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,166
- YOU LOOK REALLY CUTE
THAT SIZE, THOUGH.

310
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,708
- UNFORTUNATELY, IT APPEARS
MY PREVIOUS PHYSIQUE

311
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,333
WASN'T WELL-SUITED
FOR EARTH LAND.

312
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,166
- OBVIOUSLY.
AND THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

313
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,250
- WELL, NORMALLY IT WOULD, YES.

314
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,916
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I WANT TO JOIN THE GUILD

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,625
THAT TOOK CARE
OF MY PRINCE.

316
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,416
YOU PROMISED ME.

317
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,833
YOU SAID YOU'D
GET ME IN, GAJEEL.

318
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,875
CAN YOU?

319
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,958
- HE HE!

320
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,833
CONSIDER IT DONE, BUDDY!

321
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,750
WELCOME TO FAIRY TAIL.
- WHOA.

322
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,916
HE'S CRYING?!

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,541
- NOW, ON AN UNRELATED NOTE,

324
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,125
I HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS
A SUSPICIOUS PERSON.

325
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,791
- WHAT AN OVERACHIEVER.

326
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,750
YOU'RE DEFINITELY MY CAT,
ALL RIGHT.

327
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,875
- Pantherlily: COME HERE.
- ( girl grunts )

328
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,041
HOLD ON!
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

329
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,625
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.

330
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,750
OWW, THAT HURT.

331
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,166
- ( gasps )

332
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,666
- I'M NOT SUSPICIOUS.

333
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,708
I'M A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL TOO.

334
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,083
- ( gasps )
IT'S LISANNA.

335
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,750
- DON'T BE SO
ROUGH WITH ME, CAT!

336
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,708
WAIT, ARE YOU AN EXCEED?

337
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,500
- THE NAME IS PANTHERLILY.

338
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,000
- IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH MY CAT,

339
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,708
YOU'LL HAVE TO
TAKE IT UP WITH ME, LADY!

340
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,500
WELL?! -
WHOA, SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE--

341
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,250
- LISANNA!

342
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,791
- NO WAY.
- IT CAN'T BE.

343
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,750
PERHAPS SHE'S THE ONE
FROM EDOLAS?

344
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,750
- HOW IN THE WORLD
DID SHE END UP HERE?

345
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,000
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

346
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,500
- NATSU!
( giggles )

347
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,666
- ( gasping )

348
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,666
- NATSU, IT'S YOU.

349
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,875
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN.

350
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,791
- OH, HAPPY!
YOU'RE HERE TOO.

351
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,416
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

352
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,291
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE I'VE SEEN EVERYONE.

353
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,750
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

354
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,500
- OH, YOU MUST BE THE TWO
NEW MEMBERS OF THE GUILD

355
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,833
I HAVEN'T MET YET.

356
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,541
THE LITTLE ONE
LOOKS LIKE WENDY.

357
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,625
AND THE BLONDE MUST BE LUCY.

358
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,291
- WAIT A SEC--

359
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,250
YOU-- ARE YOU...

360
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,291
OUR LISANNA?

361
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,125
- HM-HMM.

362
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,083
- ( gasping )

363
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,208
- FOR REAL?!
- ( gasps )

364
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,083
- SHE CAME BACK TO LIFE!
- HURRAY!

365
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,416
- ( both grunt )
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

366
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,125
YOU CAN'T BE OUR LISANNA.

367
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,083
SHE DIED TWO YEARS AGO.

368
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,291
AND SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE BEEN RESUSCITATED.

369
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:01,041
- THE TRUTH IS I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY DIE THAT DAY. 

370
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,125
- ( gasping )

371
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,208
- TWO YEARS AGO...

372
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,291
- Mirajane: LISANNA!

373
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,625
YOU HAVE
TO WAKE UP, LISANNA!

374
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,125
NO, WHY ARE YOU GLOWING?

375
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,916
WHAT'S HAPPENING?! 
NO, DON'T LEAVE ME!

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,541
( cries )
YOU CAN'T DISAPPEAR ON ME!

377
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,416
PLEASE DON'T GO, LISANNA!

378
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,958
STAY HERE WITH ME!

379
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,958
( screams )

380
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,875
- Lisanna: AT THAT MOMENT,

381
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,958
I MUST HAVE SUDDENLY BEEN
PULLED AWAY BY AN ANIMA. 

382
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,541
I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I ASSUME 

383
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,375
THERE WERE LITTLE ONES
ALL OVER EARTH LAND

384
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,041
BACK IN THOSE DAYS.

385
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,333
IT WAS A REAL SHOCK
WHEN I AWOKE IN EDOLAS.

386
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,750
IT'S MY GUILD.

387
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,083
- ( whispering )
- Lisanna: I WAS CONFUSED

388
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,041
BECAUSE EVERYONE
LOOKED SO DIFFERENT.

389
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,125
BUT I RECOGNIZED
ALL OF THE PEOPLE THERE.

390
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,916
THEY WELCOMED ME BECAUSE
THEY THOUGHT

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,750
I WAS THE EDOLAS
FAIRY TAIL'S LISANNA.

392
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,000
I CAN ONLY ASSUME
THAT SHE DIED.

393
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,625
EVERYONE SEEMED SO
SURPRISED TO SEE ME.

394
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,250
IT WAS AS THOUGH
I'D COME BACK FROM THE DEAD.

395
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,500
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

396
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,291
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
LISANNA'S COME BACK TO US.

397
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,750
- TO THINK SHE SURVIVED
THAT TERRIBLE FALL.

398
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,875
I THOUGHT I'D
NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

399
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,875
- ( gasps )

400
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,291
I WAS THOROUGHLY CONFUSED
AT THE TIME.

401
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,208
BUT LOOKING BACK ON IT,

402
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,125
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHY
THE ANIMA PULLED ME IN. 

403
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,041
IT WAS SIMPLY TRYING
TO FILL A VOID IN EDOLAS,

404
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,291
A VOID THAT WAS CAUSED
BY THE OTHER LISANNA'S DEATH.

405
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,916
- PLEASE DON'T EVER
LEAVE US AGAIN, OKAY?

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,416
- ( cries )
LISANNA!

407
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,750
- DON'T CRY.
I'M HERE.

408
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:47,000
I COULDN'T FIND IT IN MY HEART
TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

409
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,625
SO I PRETENDED
TO BE EDOLAS'S LISANNA.

410
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,000
( echoes )
I'M HOME. 

411
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,291
THERE WAS SOME
CONFUSION AT FIRST.

412
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,833
I WOULD APOLOGIZE AND
TELL THEM MY MEMORY WAS HAZY.

413
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,708
I TRIED MY BEST TO FIT IN

414
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,375
AND IT GOT EASIER
AS I LEARNED MORE ABOUT EDOLAS.

415
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,291
IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG

416
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,458
TO GET ACCUSTOMED
TO MY NEW LIFE THERE.

417
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,666
TWO YEARS PASSED QUICKLY.

418
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,791
AND THEN NATSU AND HAPPY

419
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,458
SHOWED UP OUT OF THE BLUE
SIX DAYS AGO.

420
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,083
- WHY, LISANNA?

421
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,333
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DIDN'T BOTHER

422
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,416
TO TELL US THE TRUTH THEN?!

423
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,208
- IT WASN'T THE RIGHT TIME.

424
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,708
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

425
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,416
YOU'RE SAYING YOU GUYS
ARE FROM ANOTHER WORLD

426
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,875
THAT'S CALLED EARTH LAND?

427
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,166
- HEY, LISANNA,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

428
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:58,125
- IT'S NATSU-- THE NATSU
AND HAPPY THAT I KNOW.

429
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:02,208
I CAN'T LET THEM FIND OUT.

430
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,000
I DON'T WANT MY POOR
BROTHER AND SISTER

431
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,125
TO GO THROUGH
THAT SADNESS AGAIN.

432
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,500
( cries )

433
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,041
I HAVE TO BE STRONG.

434
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,625
I HAVE TO LIVE
MY LIFE IN EDOLAS.

435
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,125
BUT THEN...

436
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,791
- WHOA, WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO YOU?

437
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,791
- YOUR BODY, IT'S GLOWING.

438
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,208
- UM, IT'S NOT 
WHAT YOU THINK.

439
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,833
- ( gasps ) 
- I'M SORRY.

440
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,041
- IT'S FINE.
WE'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG.

441
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,083
- WE JUST WANTED MORE TIME
WITH OUR LITTLE SISTER.

442
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,791
FORGIVE US.

443
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,083
- YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL,

444
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,625
JUST AS SWEET
AS OUR LISANNA.

445
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,625
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO.

446
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,083
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOUR REAL

447
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,666
BROTHER AND SISTER
CARE ABOUT ABOUT YOU.

448
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,333
SO PLEASE DON'T MAKE 
THEM SUFFER ANY MORE.

449
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,500
- BUT I...
CARE ABOUT YOU TOO.

450
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,000
- YOU STILL HAVE YOUR
SIBLINGS IN EARTH LAND.

451
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,541
GO TO THEM.

452
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,083
PLEASE GIVE THEM
OUR REGARDS.

453
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,083
WE'LL MISS YOU.

454
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,666
- ( screams )

455
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,250
- Narrator:
THE KARDIA CATHEDRAL

456
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,041
IN EARTH LAND.

457
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,250
- COME ON, SIS.

458
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,125
LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF THE RAIN.

459
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,125
- GIVE ME A SECOND.

460
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,833
- MIRA!
- ( gasps )

461
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,583
- MIRA, IT'S ME!

462
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,458
HEY, BIG BROTHER ELF!
- ( gasps )

463
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,166
- ( gasps )

464
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,375
( gasps )

465
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,333
IS THIS REAL?

466
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,291
- ( laughs )

467
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,583
- ( sobs )

468
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,000
- LISANNA.
( cries )

469
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,333
- ( all cry )

470
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,416
- I'M BACK, SIS.

471
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,416
- ( gasping )

472
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,458
- WELCOME HOME.

473
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,541
- ( theme music playing )

474
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

475
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:16,166
- Natsu: OKAY, THAT'S WEIRD.
WHERE THE HECK DID IT GO?

476
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,541
- Happy: IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

477
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,500
- I HAD A SPECIAL SNACK
THAT I WAS SAVING

478
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,708
FOR TODAY, BUT NOW IT'S GONE.
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

479
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,541
FOR LEAVING IT OUT,
YOU BIG DUMMY.

480
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,958
SO WHAT WAS IT, ANYWAY?

481
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,208
- WELL, I HAD SOME
LEFTOVER FIRE YESTERDAY

482
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,541
SO I PUT IT IN A CAN.

483
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,250
BUT I JUST LOOKED INSIDE
AND IT'S EMPTY.

484
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,416
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

485
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,458
- I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
MIRA PUT IT OUT

486
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,666
BECAUSE SHE WAS WORRIED
THE GUILD HALL

487
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,875
WOULD CATCH ON FIRE.

488
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,416
- OH, SHE DID, DID SHE?
- SORRY,

489
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,541
BUT I THINK SHE'S IN
THE RIGHT HERE, NATSU.
