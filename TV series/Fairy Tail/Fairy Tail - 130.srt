160
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,875
I don't see the appeal.

161
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,000
[PANTHERLILY] Coco.

162
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,333
No, it can't be her.

163
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,416
She absolutely hated violence.

164
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,416
The mere thought of harming
others made her physically ill.

165
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,791
But this girl...

166
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,041
[SUGARBOY] Alright,
little hound dogs.

167
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,875
Come home to papa!

168
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,333
[COCO] Game, set, and match!

169
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,208
Ya ready to give up yet?

170
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,291
[Laki and Max breathing heavily]

171
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,500
Damn.

172
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,458
I'm running low on magic.

173
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,000
[HAPPY] They weren't
this strong last time!

174
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,000
That's because these people
are completely different

175
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,625
from the ones
you met in Edolas.

176
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,416
They're the Coco,
Hughes, and Sugarboy

177
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,041
who have lived here in Earth
Land from the very beginning.

178
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,625
[WENDY] I see!

179
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,125
It's just like how Edolas had
its own crazy versions of us.

180
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,291
Guess we should
have expected to

181
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,791
run into someone
sooner or later.

182
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,416
You're wasting
too much time, Lucy.

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,041
Hurry up, or we'll
show your little friends

184
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,916
what we're really capable of.

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,541
[MARY] Sugarboy would
love to play another solo.

186
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,125
[Mary chuckling]

187
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,250
Don't listen to her, Lu!

188
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,583
[MICHELLE] You can't
give yourself up!

189
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,541
[NATSU] They still don't
know who Lucy is yet.

190
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,375
The three of you
go try to find gramps

191
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,958
and I'll deal
with them somehow.

192
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,833
Just don't keep
me waitin' long.

193
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,916
We can't.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,375
We'll stay and fight with you!

195
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,583
Don't leave now.

196
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,958
Don't ya wanna
play with us too?

197
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,458
Natsu. Take this!

198
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,625
Thanks, Romeo.

199
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,333
[Natsu swallows and farts]

200
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,416
Aw, nasty!

201
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,708
Sorry 'bout that. Wrong flame.

202
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,041
[NATSU] Whatever.
It'll do the trick for now.

203
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,041
[SUGARBOY] Uh huh.

204
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,291
[NATSU] Feel the burn!

205
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,500
[SUGARBOY] Spicy!

206
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,875
[MARY] He's using Fire Magic?

207
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,500
Lame. Conducting Art!

208
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,208
[LAKI] Hey!
[MAX] Hey!

209
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,958
He attacked them!

210
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,875
But why?

211
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,166
Wait a minute, is she--?

212
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,625
[NATSU] Eat this!

213
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,083
Nope.

214
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,666
[screaming]

215
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,125
[Michelle and Lucy screaming]

216
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,583
Oh no!

217
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,833
[Mary laughing] Nothing like
a little "friendly fire".

218
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,416
Give us Lucy or the rest
of your guild gets cooked!

219
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,416
Sorry to break it
to you, sweetheart,

220
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,333
but things are
gonna get real cruel.

221
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,833
Totally. Get
ready, top heavy.

222
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,291
I'm about to make
you eat those rocks.

223
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,166
Run away, Kinana!

224
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,208
So the wittle
kitty wants to play.

225
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,541
[WENDY] Sky Dragon Wing Attack!

226
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,708
Bad move, kid.

227
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,541
[NATSU] Ahhhh!

228
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,166
Natsu!

229
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,916
It's 'cause of
that weird stick!

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,083
You may be right.

231
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,416
Perhaps it can take
control of people?

232
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,125
[Lucy wimpering]

233
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,625
[LUCY] I can't just
stand by and watch.

234
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,916
Maybe I should call
a Celestial Spirit.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,916
I'd use the Fleuve
d'étoiles that Virgo gave me,

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,541
but I can't seem to
make it work anymore.

237
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,458
[HAPPY] How are you sick?

238
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,958
I'm sorry, it's all my fault!

239
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,208
That slime
really took it out of me.

240
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,416
You're crushing
me, I can't breathe.

241
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,958
Oh no! Everyone
else is drained, too!

242
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,125
That sucked.

243
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,083
Think I'll stay here a bit.

244
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,833
I can barely stand up!

245
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,833
All of our magic
was sapped away.

246
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,541
What do you
want with Lucy?

247
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,000
None of
your business, flea bag!

248
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,333
[MARY] Show yourself, Lucy.

249
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,958
We're, like, totes
getting bored!

250
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,250
[LUCY] Just stop it!

251
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,208
You have what you want now!

252
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,083
[LUCY] Okay.

253
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,083
I'm the Lucy Heartfilia
you're looking for!

254
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,291
[Lucy gasps]

255
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,541
Mhmmm. You, huh?

256
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,916
Be a good girl and
park it right here.

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,750
Don't do this!

258
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,541
I think there's been enough
violence for one day.

259
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,958
[MICHELLE] What exactly
do you want with me?

260
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,625
[SUGARBOY] That's her, mama.

261
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,208
You know a little darlin'
like this one grew up

262
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,666
playin' house at the
Heartfilia Mansion. Uh-huh.

263
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,583
[COCO] She certainly
looks the part.

264
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,916
[MARY] Well, this is,
like, disappointing.

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,833
I was expecting a total ditz.

266
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,166
[LUCY] What kind of messed
up plot twist is this?

267
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,166
[MARY] Lucy Heartfilia.

268
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,375
Once the daughter of
the Heartfilia Concern,

269
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,375
and now a Celestial Wizard
for the Fairy Tail guild.

270
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,708
That about right?

271
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,166
Indeed, that is correct.

272
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,916
I am the girl
of which you speak.

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,125
What is she doin'?

274
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,458
What if Michelle was
the real Lucy all along?

275
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,791
This is ridiculous;
I'm the real Lucy!

276
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,250
Huh?

277
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,625
[MICHELLE] Miss Michelle,
it means the world

278
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,583
that you're willing
to protect me from them.

279
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,750
But it's far too late for such
a deception to help us now.

280
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,625
Have you gone
completely crazy?

281
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,458
[MICHELLE] They're so
perceptive, I'm sure they'd

282
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,166
figure it out instantly!

283
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,875
And I'd hate for anything
to happen to you on my account.

284
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,166
Please, don't try to be a hero!

285
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,791
She's not bad,
but her performance

286
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,208
is a little over-the-top.

287
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,916
Yeah. She's really into it.

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,458
So beautiful! So manly!

289
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,166
I tell you, I'm
Lucy Heartfilia!

290
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,250
Don't listen
to her, I'm Lucy!

291
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,666
[COCO] Now what?

292
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,541
[SUGARBOY] Mhmmm.

293
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,958
The real Lucy
Heartfilia is supposed to

294
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,125
be over twenty years
old, ain't that right?

295
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,416
[SUGARBOY] Isn't Pigtails
a little on the young side?

296
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,083
That's because
we spent seven years

297
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,333
sealed away on an island!

298
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,666
[NATSU] Lucy, get back!

299
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,916
I'll make sure they
don't lay a finger on ya!

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,666
Right, because I'm Lucy!

301
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,666
Uhhh...

302
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,541
You mean her
name's Lucy, too?

303
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,958
You ready for
another round, Lucy?

304
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,458
[LAKI] Yep! Let's do this!

305
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,833
[COCO, MARY, AND SUGARBOY]
What's goin' on here?

306
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,333
Can you stand up
on your own, Lucy?

307
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,625
Yeah, I think so.

308
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,083
Just take it
easy for a bit.

309
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,250
There's another one?

310
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,333
Wow. I don't believe it.

311
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,208
How wonderful.

312
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,958
I can't tell which
is the real one!

313
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,500
What are we gonna do?

314
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,833
[COCO] Come on!
[MARY] This is so stupid!

315
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,500
Is your magic
back too, Lucy?

316
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,458
Yep, fresh as a daisy, Lucy!

317
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,500
The Devil in Disguise.

318
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,333
Game over, I'm Lucy!

319
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,791
No you're not!

320
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,416
They're totes annoying.

321
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,333
Why don't we just
capture the lot of 'em

322
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,708
and sort 'em out later?

323
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,333
[SUGARBOY] C'mon, hound dogs!

324
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,666
Your captive audience
wants an encore!

325
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,500
[NATSU] They're
not goin' anywhere!

326
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,750
Fire Dragon Brilliant Flame!

327
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,791
Lucy! Leave now!

328
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,875
No.

329
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,791
Let's go! He's distracting them.

330
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,458
[MICHELLE] This is our
chance to slip away unnoticed!

331
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,875
[LUCY] Guys, I'm sorry!

332
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,750
And thank you.

333
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,250
Ya see that Coco?

334
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,541
We got runners.

335
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,500
Fetch 'em for me.

336
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,666
On it!

337
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,375
We're just gettin' started!

338
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,833
[power yells]

339
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,416
Free Run: Unlock!

340
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,291
[LEVY] She's airborne!

341
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,333
Eight, nine, nine,
and ten points!

342
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,958
[MACAO] What'd she do?

343
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,833
[LEVY] It looked like Free Run!

344
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,416
[WAKABA] It's a special
athletic magic.

345
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,333
It was banned 'cause so many
wizards got hurt usin' it.

346
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,625
I'll weigh her down.

347
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,125
Solid Script!

348
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,291
[LEVY] Iron!

349
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,750
[MARY] Nope.

350
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,041
Sand Slash!

351
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,333
Wood Make: Violent Approach!

352
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,750
[SUGARBOY] Uh-huh.

353
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,250
I gotta decline, baby.

354
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:15,166
Sand and wood aren't a
good match for my 'lil pups.

355
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,375
We didn't even faze it!

356
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,791
It's just too strong!

357
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,416
On the other hand, you
could walk a mile in my shoes.

358
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,625
What's your star sign?

359
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,083
It's no fun being lonely.

360
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,541
Huh?

361
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,416
[MICHELLE] They don't seem
to be following us, so I think

362
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,000
we should start trying to find
out where your master went.

363
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,875
[LUCY] Yeah, good idea.

364
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,375
But first, you wanna
tell me what that

365
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,125
crazy stunt
back there was about?

366
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,208
You were in danger. I was
only trying to help you out.

367
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,875
[LUCY] I'm a Celestial
Wizard, Michelle.

368
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,625
If they had caught me, I would
have been able to defend myself.

369
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,833
But what would
you have done if they

370
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,000
managed to take
you away instead?

371
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,833
[MICHELLE] I-- I don't know.

372
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,333
I'm sorry.

373
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,291
I didn't really
think that far ahead.

374
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,250
I just did what I thought
would be the most helpful.

375
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,208
I didn't mean to
cause you any trouble.

376
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,833
[LUCY] It's okay,
I'm not angry!

377
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,666
No need for the waterworks!

378
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,041
[LUCY] Actually,
it meant a lot.

379
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,791
Even if it was a bit dramatic.

380
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,416
Thanks for protecting me.

381
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,125
I owe you one.

382
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,833
You're welcome!

383
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,708
[LUCY] Dramatic's
an understatement.

384
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,083
But, then again, I'm pretty
sure I was the same way

385
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,541
when I first
joined Fairy Tail.

386
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,750
[LUCY] I did
some crazy things.

387
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,625
But everyone always went
with it and made it work out.

388
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,041
[LUCY] It'd be unfair if
I didn't do the same for her.

389
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,000
[LUCY] While we're here,
help me brainstorm.

390
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,458
What do these creeps want?

391
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,916
[MICHELLE] Do you think
they're the scoundrels

392
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,833
behind the church fires
like Kinana suspected?

393
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,958
[LUCY] Maybe but
I'm not a part of that.

394
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,708
It doesn't add up.

395
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,833
[LUCY AND MICHELLE] Huh?

396
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
I finally caught up with you!

397
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,500
You won't get away again!

398
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,416
[LUCY] Coco's gone coo-coo!

399
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,708
Follow my lead. We got this.

400
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,875
'Kay.

401
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,000
Just in time, I was
holding her for you!

402
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,333
I'm tired of running, so here's
the real Lucy Heartfilia.

403
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,458
No, wait.

404
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,958
Don't let her
fool you like that.

405
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,250
She's the honest to
goodness Lucy in the flesh.

406
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,250
What?

407
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,875
Real Lucy, you're so naughty!

408
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,958
I can't believe you'd
lie to save your own skin.

409
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,916
Oh, don't be silly!
You're the really real one!

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,750
[LUCY] Okay, you got me. I've
been lying this whole time.

411
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,958
I really am the
really real Lucy!

412
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,166
[MICHELLE] Or so you'd
think! But you're wrong!

413
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,333
'Cause in reality I'm
really the really real

414
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,083
Lucy Heartfilia, so there!

415
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,333
[COCO] I can't.
Brain not working.

416
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,875
Don't listen to them.
I'm the real Princess

417
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,958
you're searching for.

418
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,333
[Lucy squeal]

419
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
Hey, what are you doing
here, "Princess"?

420
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,083
Helping you get out of this
sticky situation, of course.

421
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,666
What's with all
the "Princess" talk?

422
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,833
Do you mean Lucy?

423
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,916
You're exactly right.

424
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,791
I'm the real Princess,
so take me away.

425
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,916
Then again, I might
be Lucy after all.

426
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,208
Or has it been me
from the very beginning?

427
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,166
[ALL THREE] The truth is you've
been Lucy this entire time!

428
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,958
I can't take this!

429
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,375
That should keep her
busy for a little while.

430
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,041
Let's hope so!

431
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,958
Yeah, but I can't help
feeling kinda guilty,

432
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,416
ya know what I mean?

433
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,791
[SUGARBOY] It's
now or never, baby!

434
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,708
Unless you want my hounds
to keep lovin' you tender,

435
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,250
you'll tell me where I
can find Lucy Heartfilia.

436
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,041
[Pantherlily power yell]

437
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,875
[SUGARBOY] Mhm. Your Mode Change
almost caught me off guard.

438
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,916
Lucky for me
I've seen it before.

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,291
What?

440
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,791
[NATSU] It's not me, I swear!

441
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
Beast Arm.

442
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,208
You're pissin' me off!

443
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,291
It's totes hard to fight with
all of these control spells!

444
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
Hey, "totes" is
my word, chump!

445
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,666
So, like, find your own slang!

446
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,041
Like, learn to
fight fair instead of

447
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,958
using live
boogers and a stick!

448
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,541
Let's get this
show on the road.

449
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,250
I gotta feelin' that
Coco's chasin' after

450
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,833
the real deal Lucy.

451
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,083
[MARY] Ya hear that, poser?

452
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,083
Your friend is
totes as good as ours.

453
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,333
We're not lettin'
you get away.

454
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,666
You're funny.

455
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,500
You aren't gonna have
any choice in the matter.

456
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
My Conducting Art
lets me control anyone!

457
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,750
There ain't no way I ain't
ever let you control me!

458
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,041
Natsu's in big trouble, Carla!

459
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,208
You should worry
about yourself, child!

460
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,083
[MARY] Bring it home, puppet!

461
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,208
[JET] Who'd have thought Gajeel
would be so good at hiding?

462
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,708
[DROY] Watch, he's gonna
be back at the guild

463
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,375
relaxing with everybody else.

464
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,208
I was hoping we'd
find him on our own

465
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,041
so we could impress
Levy with our skills.

466
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,333
Just have to
try again tomorrow.

467
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,916
[citizens gasping]

468
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,958
[JET] What was that?

469
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,041
[DROY] Hey!
That's the guild hall!

470
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,666
[both gasp]

471
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,708
[DROY] What in the
world happened here?

472
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,291
[JET] Looks like
all hell broke loose!

473
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,916
[WENDY] Lucy! Michelle!

474
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,750
Where are you?

475
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,583
[CARLA] Even if they went
looking for the master,

476
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,208
we have no way of
knowing which way they went.

477
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,750
Has your nose picked
up anything? Even faint?

478
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm sniffing
like crazy, but I can't

479
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,083
sniff them out
for some reason.

480
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,500
That she-witch!

481
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,833
Nobody uses me like their
own personal firecracker!

482
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,375
Nobody!

483
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,750
[HAPPY] You'd better calm down
unless you want me drop you.

484
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,208
[LEVY] Then
they both took off.

485
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,375
Natsu and Wendy went
after them a while ago.

486
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,291
We're pathetic. I can't
believe we let those

487
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,208
clowns take control
of us like that.

488
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,666
Yeah, there were
only three of them

489
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,041
and we were all
completely at their mercy.

490
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,791
Somehow I doubt we've
seen the last of them.

491
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,791
Huh?

492
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,833
[COCO] Get back here!

493
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,291
[PANTHERLILY] Coco?

494
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,791
[CARLA] Wendy!

495
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,708
Nine, eight, ten points!

496
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,333
This isn't some
kinda game, Coco!

497
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,916
You could have killed her!

498
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,541
[COCO] I've lost track of Lucy
so tell me where she's hiding!

499
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,583
Unless you'd like
to eat my foot again.

500
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,083
Oh, and while we're at it,

501
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,708
[COCO] I hate cats!

502
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,958
So please quit talking
like we're best friends.

503
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,958
[Coco echoed] I hate cats!
I hate cats! I hate cats!

504
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,375
Hey, Natsu. Can't you find
Lucy just by sniffin' her out?

505
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,875
No, I tried.

506
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,750
There's a real funky smell
that keeps gettin' in the way.

507
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,291
[NATSU] It smells a lot
like that weird stick thing!

508
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,166
[NATSU] Woah!

509
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,416
Natsu, down there!

510
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,625
It's Sugarboy!

511
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,916
Mhmmm.

512
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,458
♪ If you're
lonesome tonight, ♪

513
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,958
my hound dogs would
love to keep you company!

514
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,333
[NATSU] Bring it on!
I owe you for earlier!

515
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,166
Hope you're in the mood for
deep fried loogies, ya jerk!

516
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,291
[SUGARBOY] Hm, you're
so sweetly naïve, hot boy!

517
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,708
But I happen to hate sweet
food and sweet people,

518
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,916
so I'm afraid
this convo's over.

519
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,166
How does he feel about
people that have sweet names?

520
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,333
[BYRO] Sugarboy, you
mustn't let short-term matters

521
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,125
distract you from
the task at hand.

522
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,708
Where did that come from?

523
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,583
No clue.

524
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,833
[LUCY] I'm sorry, Virgo.

525
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,416
I think I broke it somehow.

526
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,625
[VIRGO] Don't worry.

527
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,916
I'm sure it was just
affected by the magic

528
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,708
that sealed you
away for seven years.

529
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,541
I'll return to the celestial
spirit world and try to fix it.

530
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,708
Please excuse me.

531
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,916
Hope to see you soon!

532
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,541
That was a Celestial Spirit?

533
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,416
Yeah! Plue and Virgo
are just a couple of

534
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,041
the ones I'm contracted with.

535
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,666
They both seem very nice.

536
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,000
How're the mermaid
and the crab?

537
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,583
[LUCY] How do you
know about those two?

538
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,208
[MICHELLE] Huh?
You told me about them,

539
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,416
don't you remember?

540
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,541
[LUCY] No, I don't.

541
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,125
[MARY] Well looky here.

542
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,333
It's, like, exactly how Samuel
calculated this would go down.

543
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,375
Color me impressed.

544
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,458
[LUCY] Hughes!

545
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,416
Dance, monkey, dance.

546
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,291
Hey, where are you going?

547
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,666
[MICHELLE] My legs. They're
moving all by themselves!

548
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,708
Stop, Michelle!
You're gonna fall!

549
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,208
[MICHELLE] Believe me.
That's the last thing

550
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,416
I wanna do right now!

551
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,666
[LUCY] Wait a minute, Hughes!

552
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,750
What happened to
taking us with you?

553
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:28,833
[Mary chuckling]

554
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,875
I figure you two
bimbos won't be able to

555
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,916
run away from me
if I injure you first.

556
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,250
[MICHELLE] Let go, big sister.

557
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,791
I don't want you to
get hurt because of me!

558
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,166
[Lucy struggling]

559
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,333
[BYRO] Have you found
Lucy Heartfilia yet?

560
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,625
[SUGARBOY] I think the
little chickadee will be

561
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,583
ours momentarily, Lord Byro.

562
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,666
[NATSU] Byro?

563
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,958
He's the creepy
dwarf who tried to

564
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,041
drain me and Wendy's
magic in Edolas!

565
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,541
[HAPPY] He's an octopus?

566
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,875
[NATSU] Earth Land Byro is
nothing like the Edolas one.

567
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,375
Now don't be a fool, hot boy!

568
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,916
Lord Byro's the one standing
on top of the octopus!

569
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,625
Huh? On top of it?

570
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,375
[NATSU AND HAPPY] He's way
different than the other guy!

571
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,583
We're here to
obtain the Heartfilia girl,

572
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,000
not play with
this boy and his cat.

573
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,541
Eliminate them at once.

574
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,333
When you're done, return to
the mission at hand, or else.

575
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,208
[SUGARBOY] You
got it, boss man!

576
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,208
[MICHELLE] Lucy,
please! Save yourself!

577
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,458
[LUCY] That's not happening!

578
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,875
I'm gonna stick with you!

579
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,000
[MARY] I'm likin' this
friendship thing you got goin'.

580
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,291
It saves me the
trouble of having to

581
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,708
control you at the same time.

582

[NATSU] Whatever, they'd
be a piece of cake

00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,875
if I was takin'
things seriously.

595

aren't you serious now?

win this with my arms tied!

604
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,333
[HAPPY] You'll feel a
lot better if you just

605
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,875
admit the truth, Natsu.

606
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:39,791
[NATSU] Would you
quit talkin' to me

607

like you know everything?
