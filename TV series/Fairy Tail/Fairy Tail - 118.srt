166
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,250
Those two makin' out?

167
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:40,958
Yeah, right!

168
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,458
Get real!

169
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,416
So, is it just me.

170
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,666
Or do we have
a lot of new members?

171
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,375
Yep.

172
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,833
And that's a good thing.

173
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,750
We need a bunch more folks
to handle all these requests

174
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,583
we've been getting.

175
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,500
Yeah, no joke!

176
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,791
Just look at all these fliers!

177
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,291
Why do you
sound so excited?

178
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,958
You never go on any jobs.

179
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,333
Check it out, guys.

180
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,208
I've finished
my latest routine!

181
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,166
I call it.

182
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,583
the "Supreme Dance"!

183
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,541
Way to go.

184
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,833
Dance your heart out.

185
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
Whoa, Droy!

186
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,208
If you don't stop eating
you're gonna blimp out!

187
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,375
Nah, it's fine!

188
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,000
I eat a lot but
I never gain weight!

189
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:16,750
Laki!

190
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,041
Long time, no see!

191
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,125
Yeah, I've had a lot
of long-term jobs lately.

192
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,875
I'd stop
binging if I were you.

193
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,250
Unless you wanna
look like Reedus here.

194
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,750
Oui.

195
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,958
But the only reason I'm this
big is because of my magic.

196
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,541
Hey Dad, I'm back!

197
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,291
Good!

198
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,291
About time!

199
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,666
Geez!

200
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,041
I can't even keep track
of how many jobs you've been

201
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,666
tagging along on lately.

202
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,041
Well, What do you expect?

203
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,375
He is the son of a wizard.

204
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,041
It's sad to see that
his dad's not the one

205
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,375
he looks up to, though.

206
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,083
Get off my case!

207
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,458
Aw, man.

208
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,166
It's boring around here
without Natsu and the gang.

209
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,875
You wanna be just like
Natsu when you grow up, dontcha?

210
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,500
No matter how
many members we gain,

211
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,875
it always seems
so quiet when they're gone.

212
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,166
Yeah, you can say that again.

213
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,083
We're without our best
team the S-Class wizards.

214
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,833
and the Dragon Slayers.

215
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,583
We're still the strongest
guild in Fiore but right now

216
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,416
we're missing our main forces.

217
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,250
No wonder it's quiet.

218
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,833
[NAB]
S-Class, huh?

219
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,583
Do you think they might have
a job only I could pull off?

220
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,333
I'd like to find something
that really suits me.

221
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,791
Maybe you should
just try one of the jobs

222
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,125
in front of you first!

223
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,750
It's time to quit
staring at the board

224
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,583
and just pick one already!

225
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,916
Okaaay!

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,416
[ROMEO] I can't believe
the S-Class trial

227
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,958
is happening right now!

228
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,541
I wonder how it's going.

229
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,041
[WAKABA] We've got another set
of good contenders this year!

230
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,250
Which reminds me.

231
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,208
why did Wendy
go along with them?

232
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,416
She was someone's
partner, wasn't she?

233
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,291
No, wait.

234
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,416
That's not right.

235
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,291
Did master choose
seven candidates?

236
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,000
Wow, you guys are getting old!

237
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,791
You've already forgotten
who's competing this year?

238
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:45,541
Hey Dad.

239
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
You think Natsu'll win?

240
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,833
I can't wait
for the next trial!

241
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,125
'Cause I'm gonna be
an S-Class wizard for sure!

242
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,833
[MACAO]
Hold your horses, kiddo.

243
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,958
You've gotta become
a regular wizard first.

244
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,000
[ROMEO]
Oh, I will!

245
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,583
I'm all fired up!

246
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,958
I'm afraid that
searching as a group

247
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,625
isn't going to get us anywhere.

248
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,750
I think it would
be best to split up.

249
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,750
[HAPPY]
Good idea!

250
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,500
You're as smart
as you are pretty!

251
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,750
By "split up".

252
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,166
Do you mean each
of us search alone?

253
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,208
[HAPPY]
Are you scared?

254
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,750
[PANTHERLILY]
Absolutely not!

255
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,833
Let's split up!

256
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,291
[HAPPY]
Alright!

257
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,666
I'm sorry!

258
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,041
[HAPPY]
Uhhhh!

259
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,416
Maybe in here?

260
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,791
Geez!

261
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,166
What kind of
freaky ship is this?

262
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,500
I am not afraid.

263
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,833
Not at all.

264
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
This one looks suspicious.

265
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,625
No luck.

266
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,416
So much for splitting up.

267
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,833
It was worth a shot.

268
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,416
I Guess we might as well
continue searching as a group.

269
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,083
Sure.

270
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,041
That's fine with me.

271
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,916
Not too shabby.

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,541
You guys really know how
to put up a fight, dontcha?

273
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,583
Mess with Grimoire
Heart and you'll find yourself

274
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,250
in a world of pain, bok-kah!

275
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,083
It's time
to finish you off!

276
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,583
Prepare to die!

277
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,916
Who did that?

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,208
[CANA] I've had
enough of you guys.

279
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,208
You've disrupted the trial.

280
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:19,333
You've hurt my friends, and now
you're attacking the injured.

281
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,666
If anyone's gonna find
themselves in a "world of pain"

282
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,333
it'll be you two!

283
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,291
[FRIED]
Hurry to Lisanna's side.

284
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,416
Hold on,
what about the Enchantment?

285
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,583
[FRIED] I've already enabled
its minimum level of defense.

286
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,250
Right now getting rid of
these scoundrels should be

287
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,166
our number one priority.

288
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,083
You ready?

289
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,500
You know it!

290
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,833
[FRIED]
Ah, so that's it.

291
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,125
They worked together
to attack Gahjeel.

292
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,208
I wondered how such inferior
wizards could defeat him.

293
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,750
[BIXLOW] Neither of these
clowns could've pulled it off

294
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,291
in a one on one fight!

295
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,333
Hang in there, Bro!

296
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,583
You gotta stay strong!

297
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,625
I'm tryin'.

298
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,333
Now listen up.

299
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,166
There's only one way
you're ever gonna be able

300
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,416
to beat these jerks.

301
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,458
and that's with a
coordinated team attack.

302
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,916
You've just gotta
trust me on this one.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,125
They're too strong for you alone
but you can take 'em as a team!

304
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,333
I really wish
I could walk right now.

305
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,625
Oh crap!

306
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,416
Is that an
Amaterasu Spell?

307
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,833
Now die!

308
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,916
What the hell?

309
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,916
[HADES] Those hit by the
Amaterasu Formula lose

310
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,166
all strength in their limbs
and become immobilized.

311
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,833
Simply blocking it
consumes so much magic power

312
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,458
it can be fatal.

313
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,916
He's awesome!

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,916
[ERZA] I had no idea
Laxus was this powerful.

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,958
[LAXUS] To think,
that was only one leg.

316
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,583
I still have the other one
and both my hands.

317
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,791
Not to mention
the rest of me.

318
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,958
If I combined 'em
into one attack.

319
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,875
it'd be a hell of a lot
stronger than the kick that

320
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,750
just took you down.

321
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,000
You wanna try me?

322
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,583
[HADES]
You talk big.

323
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,500
Although I can't blame you.

324
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,958
There's an air of confidence
that comes with youth.

325
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,666
but it's not
indicative of your skill.

326
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,041
You can't beat me!

327
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,666
Just watch me!

328
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,375
[KAIN]
I've got you now.

329
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,791
You're in a
sorry state, aren't ya?

330
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,458
Well, that's what you get
for trying to seduce

331
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,250
a pure heart like mine.

332
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,125
What?

333
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,666
I wasn't trying to seduce you!

334
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,000
Now then.

335
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,083
I think it's about time
for me to finish you off.

336
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,083
I promise I'll do my
best to make it quick so

337
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,916
you don't have to suffer-

338
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,458
[LISANNA]
Cana!

339
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,041
[KAIN]
Hot!

340
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,041
Hot!

341
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
Why did you burn
my bristles, lady?

342
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,166
To teach you
a lesson, fatty!

343
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,416
You need to drop
that cocky attitude!

344
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,250
I'm not a fatty,
I'm just big-boned!

345
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,541
[CANA]
Card Magic.

346
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,541
Summoned Lightning!

347
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,083
[KAIN]
That tingles.

348
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,250
[CANA]
What the-?

349
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,041
[KAIN] You're overwhelmed by
my manliness, aren't ya?

350
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,125
Y'know, I don't have a "type" so
I'm an equal opportunity lover.

351
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,541
I never turn a lady down.

352
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,041
Does that surprise you?

353
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,250
[CANA]
No.

354
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,958
I'm surprised my
attack's not affecting you.

355
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,666
That's 'Cause Cursy
the Second is a generator!

356
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,958
Self-Reinforcement.

357
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,291
Lightning Bolt!

358
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,208
Why don't
you bolt outta here!

359
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,166
Nice try!

360
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,500
But your attack was easily
dodged by changing the-Whoa,

361
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,708
that's cold!

362
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,625
You need a cold shower!

363
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,416
No!

364
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,750
When cotton absorbs water.

365
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,958
it gets heavy!

366
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,625
[CANA] I'm not
finished with you yet!

367
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,541
Icicles!

368
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,500
[KAIN]
Self-reinforcement.

369
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,666
Heat!

370
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,125
[LISANNA]
Cana's amazing!

371
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,375
She's holding her own
against this guy!

372
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,000
I think she could win
the S-Class trial this year!

373
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,166
It's been quite a while
since I had two beautiful women

374
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,250
fight over me like this.

375
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,666
It's kinda like
high school all over again.

376
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,250
I'm flattered, ladies.

377
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,833
[CANA] So Are you trying
to distract us or are you

378
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,458
just that clueless?

379
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,875
Is this guy
bothering you?

380
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:37,875
He was.

381
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,458
Let's all
take him out together!

382
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,750
[KAIN] Wait a sec,
lemme get this straight.

383
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,541
If I heard right you lovely
ladies all wanna go out

384
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,875
on a date with me?

385
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,333
A confession of love
from three beauties at once?

386
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,458
This isn't anything
like high school at all!

387
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,125
I'm the maaan!

388
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,333
Now Listen up!

389
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,833
I'm not a flirt, okay?

390
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,958
I'm an old-fashioned gentleman!

391
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,000
I hate to say this
but I can only go steady

392
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,250
with one of you!

393
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,125
So Will the lady who
really wants to date me

394
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,750
please step forward?

395
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,041
[ALL THREE]
Don't look at me.

396
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,291
I'm crying tears of joy!

397
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,666
Everybody knows that I'm single
and lovin' every minute of it!

398
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,583
Solid Script: Hole!

399
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,291
[CANA]
Explosive Flame!

400
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,250
[LISANNA]
Penguin!

401
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,916
[KAIN]
Heavy!

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,625
Oh no!

403
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,500
Lisanna!

404
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,083
Hey!

405
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,250
Look down!

406
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,833
How'd he
turn into my brother?

407
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,500
[ELFMAN]
Ow.

408
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,750
You're So heavy.

409
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,166
[KAIN]
Did you like that?

410
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,916
I call it
Self-Reinforcement Overlap!

411
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,166
a taboo technique
using Cursy the Third!

412
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,458
By attaching both mine
and the big lug's bristle,

413
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,000
I can switch bodies with
him whenever I want!

414
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,666
You're screwed now
that I've self-reinforced

415
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,958
into a mist!

416
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,958
It'll be even more
frustrating than trying

417
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,750
to attack a big, fluffy,
thunder cloud in the sky.

418
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,791
What the.

419
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,583
You tricked me!

420
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,916
Where'd that come from?

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,916
Well, Fried had a
feeling that this might happen.

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,625
So he went ahead and set up
a few of 'em before

423
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,750
the fighting got started.

424
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,166
This Enchantment
trap keeps wizards

425
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,708
from using their magic!

426
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,875
[CANA]
Nice!

427
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,416
[KAIN]
Lemme out.

428
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,291
We can overlap
techniques too, y'know!

429
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,500
Let's do it!

430
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,250
Lisanna!

431
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,291
[LISANNA]
Ready!

432
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,583
Flames in my right
hand and storms in my left!

433
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,916
Triple Unison.

434
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,666
Explosion!

435
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,458
No!

436
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,875
I got beat by a girl again!

437
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,625
Where's the fun in that?

438
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,333
Bahk.

439
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,625
Somethin' tells me he lost.

440
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,375
Yeah.

441
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,583
good news for us.

442
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,250
Our chances at a
promotion just skyrocketed,

443
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,583
bok-kah!

444
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,500
Those losers are happy
their buddy got beat down?

445
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,583
That's how
it works in a dark guild.

446
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,083
I doubt we'd ever
be able to understand.

447
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,541
[BIXLOW]
Only two left.

448
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,416
[FRIED] Let's make
quick work of them.

449
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,958
[BIXLOW]
Right on!

450
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,916
[HADES] Well, would you
look what we have here?

451
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,958
I knew you were full of bravado
but I didn't expect you to fall

452
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,583
to your knees so soon.

453
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,583
Laxus!

454
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,583
Come on.

455
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,041
Please get up!

456
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,541
[LUCY] He was hit by
that spell after all!

457
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,041
[LAXUS] I've traveled
almost everywhere,

458
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,166
all over this world of ours.

459
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,958
But this is the
first time I've ever met

460
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,791
such a monster.

461
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,000
I've got a long way to go.

462
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,458
What're you saying?

463
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,041
You've gotta pull
yourself together, man!

464
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,041
[HADES] I'm glad I could help
you come to that realization.

465
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,625
"Laxus" was it?

466
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,041
But this is the end.

467
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,541
Prepare to die!

468
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,791
Hurry and get up!

469
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,416
[LAXUS]
I realize.

470
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,791
I'm not a member
of Fairy Tail anymore.

471
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,125
Look out!

472
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,291
Move or it's gonna hit you!

473
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,333
[GRAY]
Laxus!

474
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,625
[LAXUS] But this bastard
took out my grandpa.

475
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,291
So I'm allowed
to take revenge, right?

476
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,708
Yeah, of course you are!

477
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,208
[NATSU]
Lightning?

478
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,541
Laxus!

479
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:05,166
[LAXUS]
This one's my treat.

480
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,916
Natsu.

481
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,041
What's happening to him?

482
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,916
[NATSU]
Hey.

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,375
Thanks for the meal.

484
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,375
[HADES]
An electric charge?

485
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,458
[LAXUS]
I gave him all my magic power.

486
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,541
He what?

487
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,458
He transferred
his power to Natsu!

488
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,375
[GRAY]
Are You kiddin' me?

489
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,250
Does that
mean he ate lightning?

490
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,375
If he eats anything other
than fire it makes him sick!

491
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,041
[GRAY] But if that's the
case then Laxus didn't have

492
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,375
any magic power left
when he was hit!

493
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,791
[WENDY] He was willing to risk
his life in order to help us.

494
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,041
[NATSU] Why did
you give it to me?

495
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,625
You know that
I'm weaker than you.

496
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,458
[LAXUS] It has nothin' to do
with who's weaker or stronger.

497
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,333
He wounded Fairy Tail's master.

498
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,625
It's only right
that someone with

499
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,916
the guild's emblem
take him down!

500
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,666
Anyone who hurts
the guild deserves

501
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,750
what's comin' to 'em!

502
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,416
So go get him, Natsu.

503
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,000
[NATSU]
Okay!

504
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,500
It's a fusion
of flame and lightning.

505
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,916
[WENDY]
A lightning flame dragon!

506
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,916
[NATSU] You're gonna pay
for what you've done.

[HAPPY]
 "Lightning Flame Dragon"?

509
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,041
Showing off much?

510
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,375
[NATSU]
No!

511
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,958
I mean, it's not like
I'm trying to or anything.

512
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,416
[HAPPY] If you were a real
pal you would've shared

513
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,250
some of Laxus' power with me!

514
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,750
[NATSU]
Whatever!

515
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,458
Even if I had, you'd still be
nothin' more than a flyin'

516
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,958
"lightning cat".

517

[HAPPY]
Yeah, right!

518
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,750
That's what you think!

519
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,041
I'd be a thunder cat!

520

[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next time: Realm of the Abyss!

521
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,208
[HAPPY] Lily's scared of
thunder, so that would keep him

522
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,708
far away from me!

523
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,041
And then he couldn't
copy me anymore!

524
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,791
[NATSU] You think
Lily's copying you?

525
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,000
Keep dreamin'!
