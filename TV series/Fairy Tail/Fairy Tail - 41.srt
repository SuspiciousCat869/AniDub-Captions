1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,416
HEY GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,416
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,250
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,875
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV!

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:30,958
- Erza:
AM I STILL INSIDE THE LACRIMA?

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:35,083
NO, THIS FEELS DIFFERENT.

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,958
DOES THIS MEAN?

8
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,541
IT CAN'T BE.

9
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,875
I'M DEAD?

10
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,000
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,916
- Makarov: ERZA SCARLET TOUCHED
MANY LIVES IN THIS WORLD,

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,625
WITH A HEART AS HUGE
AND BOUNDLESS AS THE SKY ABOVE.

14
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,375
HER NOBLE SWORD
SHONE VIBRANTLY

15
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,000
AS SHE PROTECTED THOSE 
SHE DEARLY LOVED.

16
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,208
SHE MOVED WITH THE GRACE
OF A FLUTTERING FAIRY,

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,750
AND HER EXQUISITE BEAUTY RIVALED
THAT

18
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,958
OF MOTHER NATURE HERSELF.

19
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,416
IT'S A PAINFUL REMINDER THAT
LOVE CAN GIVE YOU STRENGTH,

20
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,916
BUT LOSING LOVE
CAN RENDER YOU POWERLESS.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,916
( sobbing )

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,791
WE'LL MISS HER.

23
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,833
- MASTER.

24
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:06,291
- OUR FAIRY TAIL FAMILY
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.

25
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,875
- Org:
IN THE WAKE OF THIS TRAGEDY

26
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,291
WE HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH TWO EMPTY
SEATS ON THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

27
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,541
WE HAVE UNANIMOUSLY VOTED

28
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,750
TO AWARD ONE OF THOSE SEATS
TO HER POSTHUMOUSLY.

29
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,958
I AM PROUD TO DECLARE
MISS ERZA SCARLET

30
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,083
AN ETERNAL MEMBER
OF THE TEN WIZARD SAINTS.

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,083
- ( Happy speaking )

32
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,250
- Natsu: I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

33
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,583
I CAN'T JUST STAND BACK AND
WATCH YOU GO THROUGH WITH THIS!

34
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,458
- NATSU.

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,125
- ( grunts )

36
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,750
- JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, YOUNG MAN?

37
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,125
- PLEASE!  CALM DOWN.
- HOW DARE YOU?

38
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,125
- WE ALL KNOW ERZA ISN'T DEAD!

39
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,958
- THIS IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH.
PLEASE STOP!

40
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,625
- THERE'S NO WAY
THAT SHE COULD BE!

41
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,125
- WHY CAN'T YOU FACE THE TRUTH,
NATSU?

42
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,333
SHE'S GONE!
- LET GO OF ME!

43
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,500
I KNOW ERZA'S STILL ALIVE!

44
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,000
- I SACRIFICED MYSELF

45
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,375
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE
THE FUTURE BETTER FOR THEM,

46
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,416
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

47
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,250
I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS
WOULD TURN OUT THIS WAY.

48
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,208
I WANTED TO SAVE THEM

49
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,208
SO THAT THEY COULD
GO ON LIVING HAPPILY.

50
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,875
- AHH!

51
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,000
- I NEVER MEANT TO HURT THEM
LIKE THIS.

52
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,500
- ( waves crashing )

53
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,125
- WHERE AM I?

54
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,875
- All: ERZA!

55
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,041
- BUT THIS DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

56
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,125
DOES THIS MEAN
I'M STILL ALIVE?

57
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,458
NATSU.

58
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:01,208
YOU SAVED ME AGAIN.

59
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,250
I WAS LOST IN THAT SEA
OF MAGIC ENERGY,

60
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,291
AND YOU WERE STILL ABLE
TO FIND ME.

61
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,041
- I FEEL THE SAME WAY YOU DO.

62
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,416
- NATSU, I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE
WITHOUT FAIRY TAIL.

63
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,125
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU
AND THE OTHERS,

64
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,666
I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY.

65
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,458
- Natsu: AND I KNOW
EVERYONE ELSE DOES TOO.

66
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,416
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN.

67
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,166
- I WON'T.
- PROMISE!

68
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,541
- I PROMISE.

69
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:48,250
THANK YOU, NATSU.

70
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,708
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME
A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON.

71
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,708
YOU DON'T DIE
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

72
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,041
YOU LIVE FOR THEM.

73
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,208
BECAUSE THEIR FUTURE
WOULDN'T BE AS HAPPY

74
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,416
WITHOUT YOU IN IT.

75
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,666
- ( yawning, gurgling )

76
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,500
- YA THINK HE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

77
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S BEEN SLEEPING

78
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,541
FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS.

79
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,208
- YEAH, WELL THAT'S WHAT HE GETS
FOR EATIN' ALL THAT ETHER-NANO.

80
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,208
- SAY THAT AGAIN
AND I'LL SMACK YA!

81
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,541
- YOU'RE AWAKE!

82
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,291
- THAT PUNK WOKE UP
JUST TO PICK A FIGHT WITH ME?

83
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,000
- ( laughs )

84
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,666
- I KNOW I'VE ALREADY
SAID THIS,

85
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,791
BUT I'M SORRY
FOR CAUSING SUCH TROUBLE.

86
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,291
- AW.  YOU DON'T
HAVE TO KEEP APOLOGIZING TO US.

87
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,416
- WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?
I WANTED TO THANK HER.

88
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,333
- YOU TALKIN' ABOUT JUVIA?
SHE LEFT A WHILE AGO.

89
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,541
SHE WANTED TO GO TO FAIRY TAIL
AND TALK TO GRAMPS

90
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,375
ABOUT SIGNIN' UP
WITH THE GUILD.

91
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,500
I SEE.

92
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:50,666
- Wally: IT'S NOT LIKE WE EVER
MEANT TO HURT YA OR NOTHIN'.

93
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,791
- Millianna: WE'RE REALLY SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

94
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,916
- I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,958
I LEFT YOU IN THE TOWER
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

96
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,458
I HOPE
THAT YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

97
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,291
- WE'VE ALREADY
FORGIVEN YOU, SIS.

98
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,375
- BUT IF I HAD GONE BACK,

99
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,541
THEN SIMON
MIGHT STILL BE HERE WITH US.

100
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,666
- I GOTTA TELL YA,
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

101
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,416
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT

102
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
'CAUSE HE ALWAYS LOVED--
- SHUSH, WALLY!

103
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,750
- IT'S OKAY,
I ALREADY KNEW HOW HE FELT.

104
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,500
HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO SAVE MINE.
I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL.

105
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,875
I KNOW IT'S HARD, BUT WE HAVE
TO TRY TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

106
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,291
THAT'S WHAT SIMON
WOULD'VE WANTED US TO DO.

107
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,625
YOU COULD JOIN FAIRY TAIL.
GIVE GUILD LIFE A TRY.

108
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,250
- REALLY?

109
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,416
- MEOW, YOU SURE THAT'S OKAY?

110
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,000
- OF COURSE, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO PUT ANY PRESSURE ON YOU,

111
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,125
SO I'LL LET YOU THINK IT OVER
FOR A BIT.

112
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,875
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

113
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,583
BUT I'M PRETTY SOLD ON
THE IDEA ALREADY!

114
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,083
- THERE'D BE
A NEW ADVENTURE EVERY DAY!

115
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,583
- IF WE COULD ALL
STAY TOGETHER,

116
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,833
THAT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY.

117
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,416
LET'S HEAD BACK TO THE HOTEL.

118
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,791
I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO
PROPERLY INTRODUCE YOU

119
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,541
TO NATSU.

120
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,708
- Jellal:
YOU'VE GROWN STRONG, ERZA.

121
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,166
- JELLAL?

122
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,916
IT MUST'VE BEEN
MY IMAGINATION.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,625
- Lucy: ONCE WE WERE
ABLE TO RELAX A LITTLE

124
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,750
BACK AT THE RESORT,

125
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,416
ERZA OPENED UP TO ME
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

126
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
SHE SAID SHE HAD A FEELING
THAT JELLAL

127
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,458
MIGHT'VE BEEN THE ONE WHO KEPT
THE TOWER FROM EXPLODING.

128
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,041
I WAS SKEPTICAL, BUT I SUPPOSE
HE COULD'VE GONE BACK

129
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,250
TO HIS OLD SELF ONCE HE WAS FREE
FROM ZEREF'S POSSESSION.

130
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,166
SHE SAID HE MUST'VE FUSED
HIS BODY WITH THE ETHER-NANO

131
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,458
IN HER PLACE AND CHOSE TO SHOOT
THE MAGIC ENERGY INTO THE SKY.

132
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,208
AT FIRST I WASN'T SO SURE,
BUT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

133
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,291
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.

134
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,375
IT'S WEIRD, BUT I ACTUALLY
FEEL BAD FOR JELLAL.

135
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,833
IN THE END, HE WAS JUST ANOTHER
ONE OF ZEREF'S INNOCENT VICTIMS.

136
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,333
- LUCY!
- YEAH?

137
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,166
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHO
AND THE OTHERS ARE?

138
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,500
- I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM
SINCE DINNER.

139
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,416
- I CAN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE.

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,458
- YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'D JUST UP AND LEAVE

141
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,041
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE, DO YOU?

142
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,083
- I'M SURE THAT'S IT.
- WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

143
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,750
- TELL NATSU AND GRAY
TO GET THE "FIREWORKS" READY

144
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,750
AND MEET ME ON THE BEACH.
- HUH? ERZA.

145
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,416
- Wally: ARE YOU SURE
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE

146
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,083
TO MAKE IT
IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD?

147
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,416
WE NEVER BEEN
ON OUR OWN BEFORE.

148
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,000
- MEOW.
- Sho: WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRY.

149
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,875
ERZA'S GOT HER OWN PROBLEMS.

150
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,625
SHE DOESN'T NEED US
TO WEIGH HER DOWN.

151
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,125
- THERE YOU ARE!
- YOU FOUND US!

152
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,833
- PLEASE DON'T TRY TO STOP US
FROM LEAVING.

153
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,833
WE'VE MADE UP OUR MINDS.

154
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,666
ALL WE'VE EVER KNOWN
IS THE INSIDE OF THAT TOWER.

155
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,666
IT'S WHERE WE GREW UP.

156
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,708
NOW WE'RE ADULTS
AND WE DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING

157
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,750
ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

158
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,791
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.

159
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,333
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR LIVES,

160
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,166
WE'RE FREE TO DO
WHATEVER WE WANT!

161
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,291
WE WANNA FOLLOW OUR DREAMS
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

162
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,375
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO DO ON OUR OWN.

163
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,333
WE WANNA KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FREE.

164
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,541
- WELL, I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH
IN YOU,

165
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,833
AND I KNOW YOU'LL DO FINE
OUT THERE.

166
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,458
I'M NOT WORRIED.

167
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,458
HOWEVER, THERE ARE THREE RULES
THAT ANY MEMBER

168
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:21,666
WHO CHOOSES TO LEAVE THE
FAIRY TAIL GUILD MUST ABIDE BY.

169
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LEAVE"? WE
NEVER EVEN OFFICIALLY JOINED IT.

170
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,083
- #1, NEVER SHARE SENSITIVE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUILD

171
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,458
WITH ANYONE
SO LONG AS YOU LIVE.

172
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,833
#2, NEVER CONTACT ANY CLIENTS
YOU WORKED FOR

173
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,416
WHILE IN THE GUILD
FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAIN.

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,583
#3, ALTHOUGH OUR PATHS
MUST STRAY,

175
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,541
PROMISE TO LIVE THE REST
OF YOUR LIVES TO THE FULLEST.

176
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,041
THAT MEANS
YOU MUST TREAT EVERY DAY

177
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,291
AS THOUGH IT WERE YOUR LAST
IN THIS WORLD.

178
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,166
NEVER FORGET
YOUR FAIRY TAIL FRIENDS.

179
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,583
TREASURE THEM
FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.

180
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,541
- ( all whimpering )

181
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,208
- LET THE FAIRY TAIL FAREWELL
BEGIN NOW!

182
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,541
- YES, MA'AM.

183
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,083
- MAY ALL YOUR JOURNEYS
BRING YOU JOY.

184
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,166
- HERE GOES.

185
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,625
- WATCH THIS!

186
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,125
- I WISH WE COULD
STAY TOGETHER FOREVER,

187
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,000
BUT DEEP DOWN
I KNOW I'D ONLY HOLD YOU BACK.

188
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,708
I DON'T WANT THAT.

189
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,458
AFTER ALL THE YEARS
YOU SPENT STUCK IN THAT TOWER,

190
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,041
YOU DESERVE
TO FINALLY BE FREE.

191
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,125
- WE'D NEVER THINK
YOU'D HOLD US BACK!

192
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,916
- IF WE WERE TO STAY WITH YA,

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,291
WE'D DO NOTHIN' BUT REMIND YA
OF PAINFUL MEMORIES.

194
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:48,125
- BUT I HAVE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST PAINFUL MEMORIES

195
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,458
WITH YOU.

196
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,000
BESIDES, WHAT WE WENT THROUGH
MADE US STRONGER.

197
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,458
IT BROUGHT US CLOSER.

198
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,666
I WILL ALWAYS HOLD ON
TO THOSE MEMORIES--

199
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,666
BOTH THE GOOD AND THE BAD.

200
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,666
I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK

201
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,666
AND HAPPINESS
IN YOUR NEW LIVES.

202
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,416
THIS ISN'T GOODBYE.
I KNOW WE'LL MEET AGAIN.

203
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,041
- WE'LL MISS YOU, SISTER!

204
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,125
- HOPE TO SEE YA SOON,
ERZY-WERZY!

205
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,666
- YEAH, WE'LL MEET
AGAIN SOMEDAY.

206
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,500
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU OF THAT.

207
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,541
- I'LL BE WAITING.

208
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,666
- AH.

209
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,166
- Lucy: WOW.

210
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,375
- Erza:
WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE.

211
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,458
- All:
THEY FINISHED BUILDING IT?

212
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,166
- Gray: THERE IT IS,
FAIRY TAIL'S NEW GUILD HALL.

213
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,125
- ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?
WE'VE GOT A CAFE NOW?

214
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,625
- ( man laughing )

215
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,791
- DO WE REALLY NEED
A GIFT SHOP TOO?

216
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,708
- HEY, THERE! GLAD YOU GUYS
MADE IT BACK OKAY. WHAT'S NEW?

217
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,083
- THEY GOT YA WORKING
THE GIFT SHOP, MAX?

218
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,125
IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE
WE'VE SEEN YOU AROUND THE GUILD.

219
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,916
- WELL, MASTER MADE ME GO
BACK TO SCHOOL

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,708
'CAUSE HE WANTED ME TO TAKE
SOME BUSINESS CLASSES.

221
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,458
- YOU'RE MAX ALORS!
I'VE READ ALL ABOUT YOU

222
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,500
IN "SORCERER WEEKLY."

223
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,083
- YES MA'AM, THAT'D BE ME.

224
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,375
AND YA KNOW, I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU, LUCY.

225
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,000
- I DON'T WANNA THINK
ABOUT THE CRAZY THINGS

226
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,333
THEY PROBABLY TOLD YA.

227
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,000
- SO WHAT KIND OF STUFF
ARE YOU SELLIN' HERE?

228
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,000
- WE'VE GOT T-SHIRTS,
WRISTBANDS, MUGS, TOWELS,

229
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,250
AND OF COURSE
THERE'S OUR MOST POPULAR ITEM.

230
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,375
- WOW, A LUCY ACTION FIGURE?

231
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,958
- NOBODY EVER ASKED ME
IF I WAS COOL WITH THAT!

232
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,875
- SHE'S POSE-ABLE
AND HER CLOTHES COME OFF.

233
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,916
- ( screams )

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,958
- PRETTY.

235
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,500
- MMM.
I COULD GET USED TO THIS.

236
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,250
- HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S WRONG?

237
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,708
- I'M NOT GOOD WITH CHANGE.

238
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,750
- IT'S SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU BACK, LU.

239
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,333
- OH, HI, LEVY.
- ISN'T THIS AWESOME?

240
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,666
GUESS WHAT? NOW WE'VE GOT A
SWIMMING POOL BEHIND THE BAR.

241
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,375
- WELCOME BACK.
- THAT'S KINDA WEIRD.

242
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,291
- IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME.

243
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,833
- AND WE'VE EVEN GOT A GAME ROOM
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

244
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,750
- YOU'RE BACK.
- TOOK YA LONG ENOUGH.

245
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,250
- DOES IT NEED TO BE THIS BIG?
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

246
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,333
- BUT THE BIGGEST CHANGE
IS UPSTAIRS.

247
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,458
'CAUSE NOW EVERYBODY'S ALLOWED
TO GO UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR.

248
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,875
YO.
- OH, WOW.

249
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,541
- MASTER ACTUALLY LETS
MORE OF US GO ON S-CLASS QUESTS,

250
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,291
BUT ONLY IF AN S-CLASS WIZARD
AGREES TO GO ALONG.

251
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,541
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DUNDERHEADS
MADE IT BACK SAFELY.

252
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,750
- MASTER.

253
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,083
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET FAIRY
TAIL'S NEWEST MEMBER, JUVIA.

254
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,416
ISN'T SHE A CUTIE?

255
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,166
- I CAN'T WAIT TO WORK WITH YOU.

256
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,166
- ( laughs )
SO YOU ACTUALLY MADE IT IN, HUH?

257
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,541
- THANKS SO MUCH
FOR HELPING US IN AKANE.

258
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,458
- NO, I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU

259
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,416
BECAUSE NOW
I'VE FOUND A NEW GUILD.

260
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,833
- HEY, GIRL.

261
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,791
- WE WILL FIGHT FOR GRAY!
- THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

262
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,500
- WE'VE ALSO ADDED
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER TO THE GUILD.

263
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,250
SOMEONE YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE.

264
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,791
- Happy: I WONDER WHO IT IS.

265
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,291
- AH!
- WHAT?  HIM?

266
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,541
ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?

267
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,000
- Both: GAJEEL!

268
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,333
- WHY'D YOU LET HIM
IN HERE, GRAMPS?

269
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,291
- CALM DOWN.  I ASKED HIM
TO COME ALONG WITH ME.

270
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,500
- I DON'T MIND JUVIA,

271
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,125
BUT HE'S THE ONE RESPONSIBLE
FOR DESTROYING OUR GUILD HALL.

272
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,208
- NOW NOW, REMEMBER
WHAT I'VE TAUGHT YOU.

273
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,083
YESTERDAY'S ENEMY
CAN BE TODAY'S FRIEND, RIGHT?

274
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,666
- YEAH. IF I'M OKAY WITH HIM
HERE, THEN YOU SHOULD BE TOO.

275
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,458
- THERE AIN'T NO WAY!

276
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,583
I CAN'T WORK WITH SOMEBODY
I CAN'T TRUST.

277
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,375
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

278
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,916
IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANNA BE YOUR BUDDY.

279
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,958
- MAN, THAT'S COLD.

280
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,375
- THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE
IS TO GET WORK.

281
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,041
I HATE THIS STUPID GUILD
AND EVERYONE IN IT,

282
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,125
BUT TIMES ARE TOUGH,
SO I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO JOIN.

283
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,750
- SHUT UP, LOSER!

284
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,791
- SORRY, BUT GAJEEL WAS HAVING
A HARD TIME FINDING WORK

285
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,958
AND I COULDN'T
JUST TURN MY BACK ON HIM.

286
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,083
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I
HAVE A CRUSH ON HIM OR ANYTHING!

287
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,250
- I KNOW YOU KIDS DON'T LIKE IT,
BUT AS THE MASTER OF THIS GUILD,

288
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,208
IT'S MY DUTY TO HELP THOSE
WHO'VE GONE ASTRAY

289
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,500
FIND THE RIGHT PATH.
GIVE HIM A SHOT.

290
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,791
YOU MIGHT FIND HE'S A NICE GUY.
AT LEAST I HOPE SO.

291
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,500
- WHILE I MAY
NOT AGREE WITH YOU,

292
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,041
I WILL RESPECT YOUR DECISION.
BUT I'LL WARN YOU--

293
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,750
I'M GOING TO BE KEEPING
A VERY CLOSE EYE ON HIM.

294
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,750
- FINE.

295
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,625
- THEY ACT MORE LIKE DOGS
THAN DRAGONS, DON'T YA THINK?

296
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,666
- AYE, SIR. YA MIGHT WANNA BREAK
OUT THE MUZZLES TO BE SAFE.

297
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,875
- THIS NEW GUILD HALL
JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

298
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:04,291
- ( all reacting, gasping )

299
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,541
- HEY!
WE MADE IT BACK, MIRA.

300
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,500
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

301
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,708
I'D LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS SONG
TO FAIRY TAIL'S STRONGEST TEAM,

302
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,250
AND CONGRATULATE THEM
ON THEIR SAFE RETURN.

303
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,541
- KNOCK 'EM DEAD, MIRAJANE!
- ALL RIGHT, MIRA!

304
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,333

GEEZER LET YOU JOIN THE GUILD

ON MY WAY BACK
FROM MY LAST JOB,

394
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,833
I STOPPED OFF AT A FEW PUBS

395
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,208
AND I HEARD SOME THINGS
THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

396
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,333
EVERYBODY WAS TALKIN'
ABOUT HOW WEAK

ALL, BUT SOMETHIN'S NOT RIGHT.

00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,333
IT SEEMS LIKE GAJEEL'S
GOING DOWN TOO EASILY.

404
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,458
- I DIDN'T REALIZE IT TILL NOW--
HE'S NOT FIGHTING BACK.

405
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,250
- HE'S LETTING THEM
GET THEIR ANGER OUT ON HIM.

406
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,541
I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO GAIN OUR ACCEPTANCE.

407
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,458
- YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE MESSED
WITH FAIRY TAIL, PUNK!

'CAUSE NOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME!

409
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,000
- GIVE IT A REST, LAXUS!
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

410
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,625
- I'M NOT TAKIN' ORDERS
FROM YOU!

411
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,375

412

- YOU THROUGH WITH ME NOW?

413
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,250
'CAUSE I GOT OTHER THINGS
TO DO.

414
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,208
- UM, GAJEEL, I--
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

415
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,375
- I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE
OF THIS.

416
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:30,000
FAIRY TAIL
HAS BECOME TOTALLY PATHETIC.

417
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,291
IT'S NOTHING BUT A JOKE NOW.

THE STUPID OLD GEEZER'S
RUNNIN' IT INTO THE GROUND.

419
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:40,791
WHEN I TAKE OVER THE GUILD,
THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE!

420
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,166
- ( end theme playing )

421
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

422
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,958
- FAIRY TAIL'S GONNA HAVE
A FIGHTING TOURNAMENT?

423
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,250
AW, MAN, I CAN'T WAIT
TO KICK EVERYBODY'S BUTT.

424
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,916
- HOLD ON, BUDDY. I THINK YOU'RE
FORGETTING ABOUT ERZA AND LAXUS.

425
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,666
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO BEAT THEM.

426
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,416
- YOU JUST WATCH.
WHEN I'M DONE WITH 'EM,

427
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,125
THEY'LL BE CRYIN' FOR MERCY.

428
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,500
- "A SMART MAN GAINS WISDOM
FROM ANOTHER'S MISHAP,"

429
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,833
SAYS THE WISE MAN.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

430
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,833
- Both: NEXT TIME:
"BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL."

431
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,083
- Natsu: YOU CAN'T JUST START
CALLIN' YOURSELF A WISE MAN.

432
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,166
BE COOL OR I'M NOT SHARIN'
MY WINNINGS WITH YA.

433
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,291
- Happy: "PEOPLE WITH NARROW
MINDS HAVE BROAD TONGUES."

434
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,541
- SHUT UP, HAPPY!
