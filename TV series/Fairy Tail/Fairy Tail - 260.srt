[IGNEEL] Make sure you get
a good look at that guy.

00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,791
See that book?

00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,333
That's the Book of E.N.D!

Steal that book.

6
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,083
Because you're the only
one who can, Natsu.

Now listen, you are not to
open or destroy that book

Just take it. You understand?

For payment, I will tell you
everything you wish to know.

[IGNEEL roars]

[MARD GEER] I find that
cocky attitude of yours

17
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,750
to be rather annoying,
"Dragon spawn."

18

[MARD GEER] I only consider the
actual dragons worth my worry.

Not pathetic humans.

Face the facts,
you're no dragon,

00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,000
It would appear that the
dragons are still alive.

27
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,875
Unfortunate.

28

Well, you finally
decided to speak.

29
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,000
Any final words?

30
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,208
I thought I would "bid
farewell" to my enemy.

We thought you might
like some backup.

Hey! I knew I smelled you two!

It's cool that you guys
wanna help out and all,

Yeah, but Minerva told us--

45
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,250
[NATSU]
Yeah.

46
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,916
How about we save that story
for another time, 'kay?

[sighs]

48
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,708
[NATSU] What happened
to Lector and Frosch?

[ROGUE]
They're with Erza.

I knew she was gonna be okay!

51

[ROGUE] They were on their
way to the control room

52
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,166
to stop the Faces.

[NATSU] Glad to hear it.

55
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,708
But, I mean, I wasn't
worried about 'em.

56
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,166
They can handle anything.

57
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,666
Let's go!

58
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,458
We can beat him faster
if we work together.

59

[ROGUE] With all three of us,
he won't stand a chance!

I gotta admit, you
make a good point.

What?!

My Dad gave me this job,

64
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,666
and I'm gonna make
him proud of me.

65
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,458
And I'm gonna do it alone.

Look Natsu, we don't
have time for this.

All right, have it your way.

But what do you think
about this plan?

70
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,333
Let's race to see who can
beat him first: you or us!

lose to you! It's on!

And that's how you get
what you want from Natsu.

75
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,500
He is rather simple.

there are even more.

Seeing you fly about my
castle, disturbing my peace,

I am reminded of a feeling...

One that I had
forgotten so long ago.

moment for so long, Acnologia!

Years ago, you slaughtered
dozens of dragons

and to this day,
you show no remorse.

I will take great joy
in making you pay.

Don't you see I've
already paid my price?

All I care about
is destroying you.

One more direct line and
we'll be in the thick of it.

00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,208
we have what Porlyusica
needs to make that antidote.

164
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,833
We just have to get that demon
blood to her, and quickly.

165
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:40,750
Gajeel.

166
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,833
[GAJEEL]
Yeah?

167
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,125
[LUCY]
We need you to take that blood

168
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,833
and get Laxus and Juvia
out of here asap.

169
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,083
Are you crazy? I'm not
gonna go anywhere.

170
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,791
I'm a Dragon Slayer, and it's
my job to protect you guys.

171
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,166
So that's what I'm gonna do.

172
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,833
Yeah, but these two
need you more now.

173
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,625
Besides, I think Natsu
and the others

174
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,916
can handle Acnologia
until you get back.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,791
[LEVY]
I can do it!

176
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,041
[LUCY]
Uh?

177
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,791
Gajeel should stay here.

178
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,708
Don't worry, I can carry Laxus.

179
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,208
And then you can take
Juvia, okay, Lu?

180
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,208
Wait, are you sure about that?

181
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,208
This is nothing...
I can do this all day!

182
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,250
[LUCY] Uh! Levy!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

183
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,333
[LEVY]
I'm... good.

184
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,833
He isn't heavy at all.
I... swear. Ah!

185
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,208
[LEVY gasps]

186
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,208
[LEVY]
Uh?

187
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,208
Okay, you made your point.

188
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,583
But, Gajeel.

189
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,625
[gasps]

190
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,250
I'll take Laxus. Why don't
you just worry about Juvia?

191
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,958
Now we've got to hurry if we're
gonna get 'em to Porlyusica

192
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,500
so she can make that antidote.

193
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,208
[inaudible]

194
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,833
[GAJEEL]
I gotta purpose.

195
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,416
To protect the ones who've
always had my back.

196
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,875
Isn't that right?

197
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,916
[GAJEEL] Hey Lucy, give
Salamander a message for me.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,583
[LUCY]
Sure, what is it?

199
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,708
Tell him to "get
started on that song."

200
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,583
He'll know what you mean.

201
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,750
You got it!

202
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,916
We're almost outta time, Erza!

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
She sped up the
countdown and now

204
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,625
we've got less than 20 minutes!

205
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,583
[ERZA grunts, yells]

206
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,708
You gave it your all,

207
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,000
but it's time you face
the facts Titania.

208
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,416
You don't stand a chance
against this form.

209
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,583
Her power just increased!

210
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,500
She wasn't nearly
this strong before!

211
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,458
Where's it coming from?

212
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,208
[HAPPY] You can do this!
Hang in there!

213
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,333
[ERZA]
Come on.

214
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,875
She's strong, but
she's not immortal.

215
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,458
There must be some way
for me to defeat her!

216
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,875
[LUMMY laughing]

Nice work!

00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,291
[DROY]
Now... eat... this!

[LUMMYS scream]

225
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,833
You guys are doin'
a really great job!

226
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,500
You're supposed to be
fighting with us, Warren!

227
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,000
[WARREN]
Do I need to remind you

228
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,083
that my magic isn't exactly
useful in these situations?

229
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,708
Get it together
and do something!

230
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,208
[WARREN]
I'm still feeling the rejection.

231
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,125
Seriously?!

232
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:37,958
[LUMMY groans]

[LUMMY gasping]

235
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,833
[ELFMAN]
Real men always...

236
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,375
let ladies finish first!

237
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,208
My only regret...

238
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,416
is that the one who beat me
was not more attractive.

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,750
[sighs]

240
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,375
Well. Looks like that's
one headache gone.

241
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,625
[LISANNA]
I won't be missing those voices.

242
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,083
[LUCY]
Uh? What happened here?

243
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,083
You're all safe! Oh,
I'm so glad you're okay!

244
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,916
--[LISANNA] Hi Lucy!
--[WARREN] Man. She is so hot!

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,666
Dude, just so you know,
your thoughts are leaking.

246
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,416
It's a long story, but yeah.

247
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,041
Now I'm... alone.

248
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,000
[inaudible]

249
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,750
What's the matter?

250
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,375
It's nothing, really.
I'm all good.

251
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,500
[ELFMAN]
How is everybody else doing?

252
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,875
Gajeel and Levy are on their
way to give Porlyusica

253
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,291
the demon blood.

254
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,375
She says she can make a potion
to help heal the others.

255
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,416
[JUVIA]
Where is Gray?

256
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000
We'll see him soon, I promise.

257
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,125
Do you know which way
to go from here?

258
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,750
Yeah. I think it's
down this path.

259
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,208
We just have to
follow the markers.

260
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:14,250
Hey. That's really weird,
how did this get here?

261
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,875
[LUCY]
I haven't seen Gray,

262
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,666
but I heard he gained
this crazy strong power.

263
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,583
And Natsu's, well...

264
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,750
I guess you could say

265
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,291
he's sorting through
stuff with his Dad.

266
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,750
[ALL gasp]

267
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,125
[LISANNA]
Wait a second.

268
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,958
Could that red dragon
really be who I think it is?

269
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,208
[LUCY] The one Natsu
never gave up looking for.

270
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,541
His father, Igneel.

271
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,833
[ELFMAN] So where's he
been all this time?

272
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,625
[LUCY]
That's the weird part.

273
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,458
But if this dragon's
Natsu's dad,

274
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,125
then he's gotta be
on our side, right?

275
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,500
That would definitely explain
why he's takin' on Acnologia!

276
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,500
Guess this means our luck might
finally be turning around.

277
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,666
We still have the Faces
to worry about.

278
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,916
Wendy?

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,458
Carla! And you brought
that one Council guy!

280
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,666
[JET, DROY, WARREN]
Whoa!

281
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,291
What in the world have
you done to your hair?!

282
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,750
Never mind that!

283
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,916
What we need to focus on is
how to stop all the Faces.

284
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,750
[ALL]
Wait, "all the faces"?

285
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,000
Unfortunately, thousands of
Faces have been activated.

286
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,541
And unless we find
a way to stop them,

287
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,750
magic will vanish from
our world forever.

288
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,375
If that happens, the curse
power that Tartaros uses

289
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,208
will become the ruling
force on this planet.

290
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,541
[ALL gasp]

291
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,708
How could you even lift him?

292
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,458
This guy's freaking heavy.

293
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,125
And he's gonna owe
me a song, too,

294
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,458
after all this
saving his life BS.

295
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,333
[LEVY] Yeah, I wanted
to ask you something,

296
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,333
what are these songs
you keep talking about?

297
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,375
It's kind of an
inside joke we have.

298
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,875
Salamander's gonna write
one about how great I am.

299
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,250
And this dude?
Don't get me started.

300
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,958
He may as well write an album
of all the songs he owes me.

301
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,208
Well, if that's how it works,

302
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,875
then maybe you should
get to work on a song

303
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,541
about the person
who saved your life.

304

[GAJEEL]
Huh?

305
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,458
Don't try to act like
you don't remember.

306
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,458
It's time to pay up!

So a long time ago,

[MARD GEER] Anger is an
especially powerful emotion.

00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:52,125
For it has the potential to
transform a person entirely.

340
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,041

who exactly would this
"transformed" me be?

I admit it's quite a terrifying
thought to be sure.

That is who I must remain.

So I'll banish these
