00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,125
Long time, no see, Juvia!

161
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,083
[JUVIA] She's grown into a
beautiful and happy young woman.

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,750
Jellal broke out of prison?

163
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,833
And with Grimoire
Heart, no less.

164
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,791
[GRAY] Chill out.

165
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,958
They're not our
enemies anymore.

166
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,291
[GRAY] Isn't that right?

167
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,541
I committed many sins as a
member of Grimoire Heart.

169
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,208
So many, I doubt I could
ever atone for all of them.

170
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,291
[ULTEAR] So...

171
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,833
I've dedicated myself
to bringing some

172
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,750
measure of peace
to the people I've hurt.

173
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,583
'Til the day I die.

174
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,708
You risked so much
to rescue him from prison.

175
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,875
Because Jellal's one of them.

176
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,500
You don't owe
me anything Ultear.

177
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,916
We were both
possessed by darkness.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,375
It's in the past now.

179
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,166
 Jellal. Has your
memory returned?

180
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,916
Every bit of it.
Including my sins.

181
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,291
[JELLAL] Six whole years.

182
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,208
I've been living with the guilt
of all the things I've done.

183
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,958
[JELLAL] Erza.
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,458
But words can't
erase your pain.

185
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
I was the one
controlling Jellal

186
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,250
during the Tower
of Heaven incident.

187
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,083
The blame is mine
so don't punish him.

188
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,291
[ULTEAR] Besides.

189
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,833
I think he's been
through enough as it is.

190
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,916
[JELLAL] I could either spend
the rest of my life in prison.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,041
Or lose my life
and be done with it.

192
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,666
Whatever happened, at least my

193
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,666
penance would have been paid.

194
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,125
But now that you're
free you have a chance

195
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,750
to find a positive
purpose in your life!

196
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,375
[JELLAL] Wendy.

197
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,416
There's no easy way to explain
this, but the Jellal you knew...

198
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,375
He's someone else entirely.

199
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,583
[WENDY] Oh, yeah, don't worry.

200
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,250
We cleared that up a while back.

201
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,916
I found a purpose.

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,125
But, I'm not sure that I'd
call it completely positive.

203
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,000
The three of us have
formed a guild of our own.

204
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,625
[ULTEAR] It's an independent
guild, neither officially

205
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,958
recognized nor
aligned with anyone.

206
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,916
[ULTEAR] Its name is Crime
Sorcière, or "witch's crime."

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
[LEVY] An independent guild?

208
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,833
[HAPPY] What does that mean?

209
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,458
[CARLA] You're not
affiliated with any alliances?

210
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,875
[DROY] Crime Sorcière.
I've heard of you before!

211
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,666
[JET] Yeah, me too.

212
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,083
You guys have taken
down a bunch of

213
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,041
dark guilds over
the past few years.

214
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,541
Unfortunately our
one true goal eludes us.

215
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,083
Zeref.
Dark guilds.

216
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,041
And any evil force
in the world that seeks

217
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,750
to destroy the
lives of innocents.

218
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,875
We'll purge every
one of them so no wizard

219
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,416
will be possessed
by his darkness again.

220
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,958
That's a seriously
righteous cause!

221
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,666
With all the good you've
done, I'm surprised

222
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,500
the Magic Council
won't accept you.

223
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,958
I am a convict.

224
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,833
And Ultear and I used
to be in Grimoire Heart.

225
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,083
[JELLAL] Besides, if we
were to become official,

226
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,708
we wouldn't be able to go
after dark guilds anymore

227
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,291
because of the
Inter-Guild-Conflict Ban Treaty.

228
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,291
[JELLAL] We're far more useful
if we remain as we are now.

229
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,666
[ULTEAR] Anyway,
as much as we'd love to keep

230
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,458
catching up, we brought
you here to ask a favor.

231
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,833
[ULTEAR] Is it true
you'll be entering

232
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,708
the Grand Magic
Games this year?

233
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,208
[NATSU] Yeah.
Why?

234
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,541
[ULTEAR] We can't get near
the coliseum without trouble.

235
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,208
If all of you are willing,

236
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,791
we'd like you to do
something while you're there.

237
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,166
Oh, I get it. You want
someone's autograph.

238
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,666
I'll pretend you
didn't say that.

239
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,375
Every year
we sense unusual

240
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,791
magic power during the games.

241
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,541
We want you to find
out what's behind it.

242
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,458
[NATSU] Are you guys for real?

243
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,666
[LUCY] Guilds from all over
Fiore gather for the games;

244
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,500
the place is full of magic!

245
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,000
[LEVY] Don't you think you
might be a little paranoid?

246
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,166
[JELLAL] We wouldn't
be asking you

247
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,583
if we weren't
absolutely certain.

248
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,333
What's more, the power
we've been sensing

249
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,791
is not only evil but
reminiscent of Zeref.

250
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,875
[ERZA] Zeref? Are you
sure that it's related?

251
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,875
[JELLAL] We believe our
prior involvements with him

252
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,291
have given us the
ability to perceive

253
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,333
any trace of his powers.

254
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,000
I dunno.

255
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,333
Now do you
understand why

256
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,583
ascertaining the
truth is paramount?

257
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
If you can track
down the source of

258
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,500
the mysterious energy,
it may help us locate him.

259
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,583
And you'll be compensated,
just like any other job.

260
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,083
[MELDY] Discretion is important.

261
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,333
We don't want the culprit
to know that we're on to them.

262
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,166
So we'll be rooting for you
from behind the scenes.

263
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,833
It sounds like a wild
goose chase, but we'll do it.

264
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,875
[ULTEAR] Thank you.

265
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,583
You sure about this, Erza?

266
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,166
We don't have much choice.

267
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,291
Guilds from all over Fiore will
be gathering around this power.

268
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,375
It could be trouble for us too.

269
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,708
Did we mention we'll
be paying up-front?

270
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,833
[NATSU AND HAPPY]
Food money!

271
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,958
Oh no, nothing
so material.

272
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,291
I've had years to improve
upon my Arc of Time magic,

273
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,416
and can use it to
enhance your abilities.

274
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,458
A "Power Up."

275
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,291
At least, that's
one way to put it.

276
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,458
Though it's not
entirely accurate.

277
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,166
[ULTEAR] Wizards possess
something like an internal

278
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,916
container that determines how
much magic power they can have.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,583
[ULTEAR] Though it's depleted
with every spell you cast,

280
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,041
your body naturally draws in
ether-nano from the surrounding

281
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,458
atmosphere all on
its own and continues

282
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,416
to do so until the
container is full again.

283
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,708
[ULTEAR] But recent research has
revealed that there is a part

284
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,958
of this container, and the magic
it holds, that goes unused.

285
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,041
A "reservoir" of dormant power.

286
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,416
[ULTEAR] They've come
to call these hidden

287
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,250
troves of magic
the "Second Origin."

288
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,916
[NATSU] Seriously?

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,625
[ULTEAR] Not only can
my Arc of Time force

290
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,083
your containers to grow,
but I can also grant

291
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,208
you access
your Second Origin.

292
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,916
[ULTEAR] Simply put,
you'll not only be able

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,583
to use more powerful magic,

294
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,666
you can keep using it
for longer periods of time.

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,250
Whatever you
just said, I liked it!

296
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,791
Be ready.

297
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,916
Unlocking your Second Origin
will involve unimaginable pain.

298
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,375
[LEVY] What's with her eyes?

299
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,750
[NATSU] Dude,
that's totally awesome!

300
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,833
I know we've had
our differences,

301
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,208
but that's water
under the bridge!

302
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,500
By the way,
I'm totally cool with

303
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,583
you pretending to be a chick!

304
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,500
[ULTEAR]
What do you mean pretending?

305
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,875
He still thinks
she's an old man?

306
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:57,958
[members wildly talking]

307
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:14,416
[Natsu cries out in pain]

308
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,875
[GRAY] Man I hope
whatever the hell

309
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,875
we just signed up
for is worth it.

310
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,125
[LUCY]
I don't think this is a

311
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,333
very persuasive
advertisement for it.

312
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,958

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,875
the Flower-Blooming Capital!

471
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,708
[HAPPY] Y'see those
weird talking cats with 'em?

472
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,833
They keep calling me
names and being big ol' jerks!

473
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,500
Can I please scratch
their eyes out?

474
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,916
[NATSU] Uh, you're a
"weird talking cat" too, bud.
