1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,458
[NATSU] Previously,
on Fairy Tail!

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,625
[LUCY] After an intense
battle on Tenrou Island,

3
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,083
our founding master,
Mavis Vermillion,

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,500
saved our lives by sealing
us away for a while.

5
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,666
[HAPPY] "A while"?

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,125
That's putting it lightly!

7
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,875
When we came back we found
out seven years had passed!

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,541
[NATSU] As for what
happened to the Fairy Tail guild

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,125
while we were gone, well...

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,875
[HAPPY] We're still
tryin' to figure that out.

11
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,750
We know a lot has
changed in seven years.

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,291
We're not even Fiore's
strongest guild anymore!

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,583
But we've got a chance
to get our top spot back

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,833
and we're gonna do it!

15
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,500
[LUCY] In three months,
a major event is being held

16
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,125
to determine which guild
is the strongest in Fiore.

17
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,291
The Grand Magic Games!

18
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,291
From what I've heard,
it's a festival of wizardry

19
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,041
that's filled with all
sorts of magic competitions.

20
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,333
Unfortunately,
while we were stuck

21
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,333
on Tenrou Island
for seven years,

22
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,666
Fairy Tail went from being

23
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,458
Fiore's strongest
guild to the weakest.

24
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,916
We wanna change that 

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,875
so we're gonna enter
the Grand Magic Games!

26
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,916
The only problem
is the Tenrou Team

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,458
has missed out on
seven years of training.

28
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,000
Everyone else has
gotten a lot stronger

29
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,958
and we can't compete
with them as we are now.

30
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,541
We've got three
months until the games begin.

31
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:01,375
So we've decided to have
a training camp at the beach!

32
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,708
[HAPPY] Song of the Stars!

33
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,625
[CARLA] Listen! We're
not here to play.

34
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,541
We're here
to train!

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,916
Let's get to it!

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,708
It's hard
to take you seriously

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,958
when you're
dressed like that.

38
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,666
There's plenty
of time for training.

39
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,041
but it's important to
balance work and pleasure.

40
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,041
We'll play hard!

41
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:33,916
Eat hard!

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,708
Sleep hard!

43
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,208
Hey wait just a minute,
what about "train hard"?

44
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,666
Yeah, that's
why you're here!

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,875
By the time
we're done with you.

46
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,375
Ya might stand
a chance of beatin' us,

47
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,833
'cause there ain't no
way you could right now.

48
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,208
The ocean!

49
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,625
Last one there's
a rotten egg!

50
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,416
Swimming contest!

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,666
Sand castle contest!

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,000
Eating contest!

53
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,416
Sun tan contest!

54
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,958
[NATSU] That was fun.

55
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,166
I'm ready for a nap.

56
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,416
Look at 'em, they're
kickin' back and relaxin'.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,625
Well, it's only
the first day so

58
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,958
I guess we can
let 'em enjoy it.

59
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:11,250
My beloved Gray
looks so handsome with a tan!

60
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

61
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,000
Aw man.

62
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,291
This is gonna be super tough 

63
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,625
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the other Fairy Tail members

64
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,875
have started their training for
the Grand Magic Games as well.

65
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,291
However, they've chosen
less tropical locations.

66
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,541
[HAPPY] Whoa,
Natsu's really incredible!

67
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,291
I'm amazed that he can
still do his Fire Dragon Roar

68
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,916
with all the water
pressure down there.

69
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,125
[HAPPY] That was awesome!

70
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,208
[NATSU] You ain't
seen nothin' yet, buddy!

71
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,625
I'm just gettin' started here!

72
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,541
Just watch!

73
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
I'm gonna up my
power even more!

74
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,958
Better train or
he'll show me up.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,958
As for me, I always
seem to run out

76
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,291
of magic power
at the worst time,

77
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,875
so I wanna learn
how to sustain it.

78
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,541
To do that,
you must first

79
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,000
strengthen your mind,

80
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,458
thereby enhancing
the vessel

81
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,250
which holds
your magic power.

82
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,000
Feel the land.

83
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,375
The wind.

84
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,583
The air.

85
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,125
Focus on that sensation.

86
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,166
You must
control your breathing

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,041
and try to become
one with nature.

88
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,250
There you go.

89
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,250
That's it, Lady Lucy.

90
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,750
Nice work.

91
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,666
Keep going

92
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,750
you need to release
more magic power.

93
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,583
That's tough.

94
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,500
This takes me back

95
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,375
to times I spent
with Lady Layla.

96
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,791
I assisted her with
her training as well.

97
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,458
Say, have you ever
heard of "primordial magic"?

98
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,291
It's the magic from which

99
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,166
all others were created.

100
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,625
The origin.

101
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,875
I remember Hades saying

102
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,583
that he wanted to
get his hands on it.

103
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,250
I guess my
mom must've left out

104
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,750
some stuff when
she told me about it.

105
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,458
She never mentioned Zeref
or the Grand Magic World.

106
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,750
In fact, she didn't bring
up anything scary at all.

107
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,458
What are
you trying to say?

108
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,666
It's hard to explain,
but if the "primordial magic"

109
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,000
my mom told me about
when I was little is real,

110
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,125
then it's not
something that Hades

111
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,958
would ever be able
to get his hands on.

112
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,541
'Cause it's not
something tangible.

113
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,666
[LUCY] From what I
understand, it seems easy to get

114
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,125
but it's actually
very hard to obtain.

115
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,083
[LUCY] And it's
contradictory because

116
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,208
even though it's more
powerful than anything

117
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,625
in this world, it can
also be incredibly weak.

118
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,583
My mother once told me

119
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,750
that all forms of magic
began with the power of love.

120
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,791
So, that's why
I think "primordial magic"

121
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,708
actually refers to "love".

122
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,541
I like the
way you think, Lady Lucy.

123
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,125
If only Hades had been
able to see it that way, too.

124
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,708
Maybe he could've avoided
the depths of darkness.

125
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,625
Gotta get stronger!

126
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,166
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

127
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,500
Stronger and stronger!

128
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,375
Aye-aye, Sir!

129
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,083
Anybody who looks down
on our guild is gonna regret it!

130
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,583
'Cause we're still number one!

131
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,916
[HAPPY]
Aye!

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,375
I'm gonna show those
good for nothin' jerks

133
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,166
the power of Fairy Tail!

134
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,541
Heck yeah!
You show 'em!

135
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,083
Look! The stars
are so pretty!

136
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,791
[LEVY] Yeah, they are.

137
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,750
Hey, I wonder how training
is going for the others.

138
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,416
Do ya think they
might be out there

139
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,541
looking up at the same
stars that we are right now?

140
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,291
We can do it.

141
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,083
I know we can.

142
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,250
[NARRATOR] It is now day
two of beach training camp

143
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,458
and there are three months
until the Grand Magic Games.

144
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,666
Oh man, I already
feel stronger!

145
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,416
Me too, but
we can't get lazy.

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
We've gotta
keep training.

147
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,166
I can't believe
that our magic power's

148
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,416
increased so much and
it's only the second day!

149
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,875
Ahh!

150
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,375
Standing close to my darling
while we do the same stretches

151
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,291
has my heart all aflutter!

152
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,041
If we keep
training this hard

153
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,375
for the next three months.

154
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,833
I have no doubt
that we'll be able

155
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,708
to catch up
with everyone else.

156
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,791
All of you other
guilds had better watch out

157
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,416
'cause Fairy Tail
is comin' for ya!

158
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,208
And we're gonna be
Fiore's number one again!

159
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,416
At first I thought,
"We've only got three months?

160
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,583
That's not enough time!" 

161
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,125
But now that we've
really started training,

162
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,333
it's more like,
"We've got three months?

163
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,916
This'll be easy!" 

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,375
Aye!

165
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,375
Princess!
Terrible news!

166
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,666
What the?

167
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,958
Would you please
watch where you pop up?

168
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,416
Do you
want to punish me?

169
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,208
No thanks!

170
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,625
I will if you
ask again.

171
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,291
I'm glad you're
here Virgo

172
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,750
'cause I've been
wondering about something.

173
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,291
What happened to you and
the other Celestial Spirits

174
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,500
when Lucy got stuck in the
Fairy Sphere for seven years?

175
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,083
Did you get
trapped in your world

176
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,166
because she
couldn't summon you?

177
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,708
I'm sorry,
I didn't even think

178
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,250
about how that
might've affected you guys.

179
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,750
I just went ahead
and summoned you during

180
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,625
the Key of the
Starry Heavens incident

181
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,750
like it was no big deal.

182
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, you poor
things, I can't imagine

183
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,500
how dreadfully bored you
must've been because of Lucy!

184
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't cry.

185
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,666
I appreciate your concern but
we were never all that bored.

186
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,541
Is there something
wrong, Virgo?

187
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,375
The Celestial
Spirit World

188
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,916
is on the brink
of destruction.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,208
I beg you.

190
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,416
We really need Fairy
Tail's help right now.

191
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,875
That's horrible.

192
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,916
Is there anything
that we can do?

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,666
I've been asked to
bring you to our world at once.

194
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,666
The king would like to explain
the situation to you himself.

195
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,500
Alright then,
you lead the way Virgo!

196
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,291
If our friends need
help we won't let 'em down!

197
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,458
Wait a minute.

198
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,250
I thought humans
weren't able

199
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,666
to enter the
Celestial Spirit World.

200
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,750
Well there is one way

201
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,166
in which it's
possible, Princess.

202
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,875
You'll simply have to wear
Celestial Spirit garments.

203
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,833
Here we go.

204
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,125
Hang on! We're
going right now?

205
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,083
Whoa, they just
vanished into thin air!

206
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,208
How come we
don't get to go, too?

207
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,583
This is the Celestial
Spirit World?

208
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,458
Wow! It's so pretty!

209
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,541
And so we meet again,
human girl.

210
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,750
I bid you
welcome to our world.

211
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,625
Massive.

212
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,125
Mustache!

213
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,458
Celestial Spirit King!

214
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,375
So, you're the
ruler of this kingdom?

215
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,708
Does she have
to be so rude?

216
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,916
Indeed, I am.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,916
Is it true
that your world

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,208
is on the brink
of destruction?

219
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,875
Smile!

220
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,583
Lucy and friends,
I have requested your presence,

221
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,166
so that we might honor
your remarkable return

222
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,750
from the prison of time.

223
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,916
[KING] Now, let us celebrate!

224
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,416
[LUCY] I thought you
were facing destruction?

225
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,833
[VIRGO] I lied.

226
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,708
[LUCY] What?

227
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,416
[TAURUS] Sorry for tricking
you like that Miss Lucy.

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,750
But let me tell ya,
it's worth it to see your face

229
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,000
and udderly
rockin' body right now,

230
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,166
cause that
Celestial World dress

231
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,166
has got my
moo of approval.

232
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,291
[CANCER] We wanted to surprise
you and your friends, baby!

233
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,833
[CANCER] By the way,
if any of you ladies

234
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,708
would like to sport a new
hairstyle for the party,

235
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm your man, baby!

236
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,541
[CAPRICORN]
We were extremely happy

237
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,833
when we heard
you had returned

238
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,916
and we wanted to
celebrate with you.

239
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,083
[LYRA] But there's no way
all of us could manifest

240
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,208
in the human world
at the same time

241
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,791
so we decided
to bring you here!

242
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,458
[ARIES] Everyone
wanted to attend the party

243
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,958
and that's the only way
we could make it happen.

244
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,833
Sorry about that!

245
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,333
[SCORPIO] Not many humans get
to come here, but you're wicked!

246
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:55,125
[AQUARIUS] This is a one-time
thing, so don't get cocky.

247
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,750
[GEMI] Piri piri.

248
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,041
[MINI] Piri piri.

249
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,708
[NATSU] Thanks for
invitin' us over, everybody!

250
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,458
[SAGITTARIUS]
Okily-dokily, let's party!

251
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,000
Are you gentlemen
with me?

252
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,833
[GRAY] Yeah, now that we know
your world's not in danger!

253
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,666
[LOKE] Y'know Lucy,
I wouldn't mind it

254
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,333
if you were to
jump into my arms.

255
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,958
Just sayin'.

256
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,541
[LUCY] Oh, you.

257
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,125
[KING] Let the
merriment begin!

258
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,500
Tonight we shall eat,
drink, and sing with abandon,

259
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,416
as we celebrate the
return of our old friend,

260
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,375
the human girl Lucy,
and her colleagues.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,666
[GRAY] It's been
a while, man.

262
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,958
[LOKE] Shame about
the S-Class trials.

263
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,833
[WENDY] Hello Horologium!

264
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,500
[HOROLOGIUM]
Good to see you, my dear!

265
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,333
[WENDY] I just wanted to say
thanks again for saving my life.

266
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,541
[HOROLOGIUM] You're too kind.

267
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,958
There's no
need to thank me.

268
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,375
[WENDY]
Although I have to say.

269
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,875
It was kinda embarrassing
when my clothes came off.

270
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:55,500
[HOROLOGIUM] Oh my!

271
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,750
I'm sure it was!

272
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,958
[LUCY]
"My apologies.

273
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,958
Please forgive me,"
he says sincerely.

274
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,416
[AQUARIUS] Excuse me,
but aren't you the girl

275
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,833
who once joined with Lucy?

276
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,458
[JUVIA] What do you
mean by "joined with"?

277
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,166
[AQUARIUS] You got
a boyfriend, dontcha?

278
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,916
[JUVIA] Um, well, no.

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,166
[AQUARIUS] Seriously?

280
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,125
A cutie like you?

281
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,208
You'd better step
up your game

282
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,833
or you're gonna
end up like Lucy!

283
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,375
[LUCY] Hey, what's
that supposed to mean?

284
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,125
[LEVY] Wow!

285
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,625
This is incredible!

286
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,916
There are so many books that
I've never even seen before!

287
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,916
[CRUX] Oh Really?

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,750
Then please take
one as a souvenir.

289
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,666
[LEVY] Yeah?

290
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,333
[LEVY] He's asleep?

291
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,541
[LUCY] Nah, it just
looks that way.

292
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,833
He's actually thinking.

293
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,375
[HAPPY] Oh hey, Plue!

294
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,750
[CARLA] I always forget that
you're a Celestial Spirit, too.

295
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,875
[HAPPY] Whoa!

296
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,708
There's a ton of 'em!

297
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,083
[GEMI] Nicolas come in
all shapes and sizes!

298
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,833
[MINI] Nicolas come in
all shapes and sizes!

299
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,208
[TAURUS] Wow Erza!

300
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,166
I'm over the moon about your
amazingly shapely body!

301
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,750
[ERZA] Really?

302
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,875
[TAURUS] Ya mind jumpin' up and
down a few times, pretty please?

303
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,083
[ERZA] What for?

304
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,250
[LEVY] Ugh, I really
don't like that Spirit.

305
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,875
[WENDY] I kinda don't either.

306
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,333
[NATSU] Yummy!

307
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,500
What is this food I'm eatin'?

308
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,500
[CANCER] That's crab pescatore
with stardust butter, baby!

309
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,333
[ARIES] As well as a
tender and juicy lamb steak

310
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,916
drizzled with Hamal sauce!

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,333
[NATSU] I had no idea I
was eating your kind!

312
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,791
[GRAY] This place
is pretty weird

313
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,166
but I think it's
kinda cool too.

314
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,166
[LUCY] Yeah, right?

315
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,333
When I pictured
the Celestial Word

316
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,041
in my head it wasn't
anything like this!

317
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,750
[LUCY] I wonder
which one is my Plue.

318
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,083
[KING] It's only
natural that our world

319
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,625
would surprise you, for it
is a mystery to mankind.

320
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,041
We've had many human
friends over the years

321
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,541
but you are the first
I've invited here.

322
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,541
[GRAY] Wow, that's awesome

323
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,625
but don't you let it go
to your head, okay?

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,125
[JUVIA] Hands off!

325
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,000
What do you think you're doing?

326
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:57,041
♪ I can see you there,
right by my side as always. ♪

327
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:04,708
♪ You never left or let
me down my friend. ♪

328
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:12,708
♪ I can feel you there,
close to my heart as always. ♪

329
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:21,416
♪ Your soul and mine
share a bond made of love. ♪

330
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:32,208
♪ So as the skies turn grey
and the clouds gather above. ♪

331
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,000
Trying to fight back your tears,

332
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,916
♪ feeling so lost
and alone. ♪

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,583
♪ I am the star that
burns for you, ♪

334
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,541
♪ shining through
the night. ♪

335
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:56,041
♪ Just follow me,
I will guide you home. ♪

336
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,000
♪ And when you're
feeling lost at sea, ♪

337
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,500
♪ listen for my song, ♪

338
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:14,541
♪ calling you
back to the shore. ♪

339
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,916
[LUCY] That was beautiful.

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,333
Thank you.

341
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,375
I love you all!

342
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,250
[KING] Smile!

343
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,916
[ERZA] Wow.

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,291
You Spirits certainly
know how to throw a party.

345
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,166
[GRAY] I've never eaten
such tasty food in my life.

346
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,250
[NATSU] I can't believe
that you actually ate the food!

347
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,000
How could you?

348
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,833
[LEVY] Are you sure it's
okay if I take this one?

349
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,791
[WENDY] Hey guys?

350
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,916
Can we keep
these outfits, too?

351
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,666
[HAPPY] This creepy Plue
doesn't wanna let go of me!

352
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,583
[CARLA]
Who'd have thought

353
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,000
that those two would
get along so well?

354
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,166
[AQUARIUS] You've
really got it rough.

355
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,375
Stay Strong!

356
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,000
[JUVIA] No, you have
it much worse than me!

357
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,166
[KING] Take care of
yourself, old friend.

358
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,583
Remember, no
matter where you go,

359
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,291
we will always be with you.

360
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,916
[SCORPIO] Lookin' forward
to workin' with ya again!

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,666
[CAPRICORN] Yes, indeed.

362
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,458
Feel free to
call on us anytime.

363
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,000
[LOKE] Tell the guild
I'll visit them soon.

364
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,000
[ARIES] Good bye.

365
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,333
We've enjoyed
having you here

366
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,375
and we appreciate you
looking after Lucy for us.

367
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,125
[LYRA] Bye!

368
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:53,916
[HOROLOGIUM] Bye!

369
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,125
[KING] This is
goodbye for now.

370
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,416
May the guidance of
the stars keep you well.

371
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,208
Until we meet again!

372
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,875
[ERZA] It's obvious that all

373
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,583
the Celestial Spirits
love you dearly.

374
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,416
[LUCY] Yeah, they're the best
friends a wizard could hope for!

375
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,416
[NATSU] Alright, guys!

376
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,791
We've had our fun;
now it's time

377
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,041
for us to get back
to the beach and train

378
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,375
for the Grand Magic Games!

379
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,875
[GRAY] Right on!

380
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:18,875
We're in a good place 'cause
we've still got three months

381
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,375
to catch up to
the other guilds!

382
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,458
[HAPPY] Fairy Tail's
gonna take Sabertooth down!

383
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,791
[VIRGO] Oh.

384
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,083
There's something I
probably should've mentioned

385
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,708
before we came here.

386
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,958
[VIRGO] In our world,
time flows a bit differently

387
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,791
than it does in yours.

388
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,833
[NATSU] Wait, are you serious?

389
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,791
I bet it moves slower,
so a year in your world

390
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,833
is the same as a day
back home, huh?

391
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,125
[GRAY] If that's true,

392
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,041
then we should do all
of our training here!

393
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,250
[VIRGO] Not quite.

394
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,000
[VIRGO] It moves faster.

395
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,458
[VIRGO] You see, just one day
in the Celestial Spirit World

396
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,291
is the same as
three whole months

397
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,208
in the human world.

398
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,291
[JET] What took ya so long?

399
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,791
We've been waitin' forever!

400
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,416
[DROY] There's only
five days to go

401
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,916
until the Grand Magic Games!

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,375
Hope you guys got lots of
training in while you were gone!

403
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,625
[EVERYONE] It's all over.

404
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,750
Give us our time back,
Mustache Face!

405
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,125
[NATSU] Man, this sucks!

406
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,125
We lost all that time we
were gonna spend trainin'!

407
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:16,833
[HAPPY] There's
no need to worry!

408
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,000
Apparently, we all have

409
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,250
"Second Origin"
abilities inside us.

410
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,041
If we can draw 'em out
we'll be super strong!

411
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,208
I heard it
kinda hurts though.

412
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,500
[NATSU] I'm willing
to give it a shot!

413
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,000
Wait a second,
where did Erza go?

414
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,375
[HAPPY] Don't
worry about her.

415
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,250
She's busy battling it
out with her own heartache.

416
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:35,166
[HAPPY] Next time: For All the
Time We Missed Each Other!

417
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,916
for bein' such a baby?

418
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,375
[NATSU] You can
count me out!

419
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,500
And don't come cryin' to me
when she kicks your butt!
