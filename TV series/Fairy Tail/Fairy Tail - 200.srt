1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,041
Would you like a little warm
up on your coffee, ma'am?

2
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,541
As a matter of fact,
I'd love one, please.

3
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,583
Were you able to sleep through
all that craziness last night?

4
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,458
Ah, yes. I slept as
soundly as a newborn baby.

5
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,458
So, did you watch the
Grand Magic Games this year?

6
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,250
Of course, dearie.

7
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,666
I wouldn't have missed it.

8
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,958
[WAITRESS] I think this
one was the best one yet!

9
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,875
I just wish Mermaid Heel
would've won, though.

10
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,208
They're my favorite.

11
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,083
Is that so?
Well, perhaps next year.

12
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,583
[WAITRESS]
Who were you rooting for?

13
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,208
Oh, I don't know.
No one in particular.

14
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,458
But if I had to choose.
I suppose I'd say Fairy Tail.

15
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,458
Yeah, I absolutely love them!

16
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,958
Especially that hunk,
Gray Fullbuster.

17
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,583
He's just the coolest guy!

18
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,208
[OLD WOMAN]
Ah, yes. Yes he is.

19
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,000
[HAPPY]
Droplets of Time

20
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,458
[OLD WOMAN gasps]

21
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,625
Whoopsie daisy!

22
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,500
[OLD WOMAN]
My word. I must've tripped.

23
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,708
Thank you, sir.

24
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,166
Of course.

25
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,500
These streets around here
sure have seen better days.

26
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,458
You really have
to watch your step.

27
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,916
[OLD WOMAN]
I know you.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,458
You're the announcer for the
Grand Magic Games, right?

29
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,583
Yep. On my way to
my next gig, in fact.

30
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,416
[OLD WOMAN]
All that travelling around.

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,250
It must be rough on you.

32
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,291
I get to see the world.
Meet new people.

33
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,291
Well, that does sound nice.

34
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
[CHAPATI]
Where are you headed?

35
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,125
I could walk you there,
if you'd like.

36
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,375
[OLD WOMAN] Thank you.
But I'm just out for a stroll.

37
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,208
You needn't worry about me.

38
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,541
[CHAPATI]
Bye!

39
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,750
[NATSU groaning]

40
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,625
You guys about ready to go?

41
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,666
[HAPPY] I'm ready to go
to anther royal party!

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,125
[NATSU] Yeah! I wouldn't
mind being the king again!

43
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,291
I wish we could
stay here longer.

44
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,375
Yes, in a strange way,
it's starting to feel like home.

45
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,250
I guess master and
the rest of the guild

46
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,166
left earlier, huh?

47
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,500
[ERZA]
He did.

48
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,291
He said that he was ready
to get back to Magnolia.

49
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,541
But I think some of them
may still be celebrating.

50
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,416
[LUCY] That wouldn't
surprise me all that much.

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,041
[HAPPY] I bet you-know-who
is still up drinking.

52
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,541
[GRAY]
Yep, That's a pretty safe bet.

53
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,166
I know, right?

54
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,333
[WENDY]
Hey, guys!

55
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,333
Come look!

56
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,500
We're gonna get to travel
back to Magnolia in style!

57
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,166
And in supreme
comfort, I might add!

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,416
[ERZA] It's certainly
a lovely carriage.

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,791
[WENDY] Yeah, The Hungry Wolf
Knights actually got it for us.

60
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,291
[CARLA] The men had
no fashion sense,

61
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,083
so perhaps it was the ladies.

62
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,208
[NATSU groans]
No please. Don't make me.

63
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,416
It probably looks like a
death trap to you, though.

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,916
[HAPPY]
Aw, you'll be fine.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,458
'Cause Wendy has that spell that
can keep you from hurling.

66
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,708
Yeah! I love that one!

67
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,083
[NATSU]
C'mon Wendy! Hook me up!

68
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,375
[WENDY]
I am so sorry about this.

69
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,541
[NATSU]
Wha--?

70
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,666
The games and the
dragons and everything

71
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,375
has just taken it out of me.

72
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,041
I don't know when
I'm gonna have enough

73
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,875
magic power to do
anything again.

74
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,916
Oh, no sweat.
I can hack it.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,375
Sure, but you know.

76
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,416
You can always take
the ankle express.

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,750
Confront your fear
and conquer it.

78
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,916
Instead of solving
your own problem,

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,416
you've just made it
everybody else's.

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,583
Motion sickness,
I will defeat you!

81
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,166
Told ya.

82
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,000
[GRAY] You should've just hoofed
it back to town, you idiot.

83
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,791
[ERZA]
Weak mind, weak stomach.

84
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,875
Goodbye Crocus.
What a crazy time.

85
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,541
[HAPPY]
Bye-bye, Crocus!

86
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,708
We'll check you later!

87
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,166
[MELDY]
I'm worried. Where could she be?

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,041
[JELLAL]
I wish I knew.

89
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,833
I hope she's not
hurt somewhere.

90
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,458
Her time magic does take
quite a toll on her body.

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,291
The Eclipse was destroyed.

92
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,125
At least the future
may be salvageable.

93
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,750
[JELLAL] The dragons
returned to the past.

94
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,666
As for the Rogue and Lucy
that came from the future,

95
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,208
I cannot say.

96
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,291
Just look around and you
can see the present

97
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,000
has been greatly affected.

98
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,708
All this carnage
and devastation.

99
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,375
I'd hoped that destroying
the gate would

100
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,291
revert it all back somehow.

101
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,500
Time had been
turned on its head.

102
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,958
It had become impossible to
return things as they were.

103
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,833
I am grateful that I seem
to have my memory intact.

104
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,500
But that could
pose a problem.

105
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,916
[MELDY]
Why?

106
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,541
[JELLAL] Because the Council
must certainly be aware

107
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,750
of the Royal Family
dabbling in Black Magic.

108
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,250
This is what wars are built on.

109
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,666
[JELLAL]
What does he want?

110
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,041
[LAHAR]
I see.

111
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,958
Then cross-check those
reports with regional data

112
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,958
and analyze the results.

113
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,875
Look for any sudden
spikes in the levels

114
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,958
of recorded magic
power in the city.

115
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,250
Understood.

116
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,500
[ORG]
Lahar.

117
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,000
[LAHAR]
Master Org.

118
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,916
[ORG] You've done the
Council a great service,

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,541
by monitoring the games.

120
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,625
[LAHAR] Honestly sir,
I was honored just to be part

121
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,166
of the festivities.

122
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,208
[ORG] I'd heard the king's
fondness for wizards

123
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,500
was put on prominent display.

124
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,041
[LAHAR]
That's putting it lightly.

125
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,250
[ORG] They say he ended the
final night's events by staging

126
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,291
massive illusions of
fire-breathing dragons.

127
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,375
Doranbolt got to see
all of it happen.

128
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,041
I had unfortunately already
fallen asleep by then.

129
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,375
If only some of these bull
headed council members

130
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,125
could've seen them as well.

131
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,583
[LAHAR] That may only
make their opposition

132
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,083
to the games stronger.

133
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,625
[ORG] I'd just love to
have seen their faces.

134
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,833
[ORG laughs]

135
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,708
So you erased the
Council members' memories?

136
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,333
[DORANBOLT] I did.
As far as they're concerned.

137
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,666
It never happened.

138
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,541
I'm surprised. I didn't
know you had that skill.

139
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,250
That's how I conduct all
my deep cover operations.

140
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,083
It's just a tool of the trade.

141
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,291
[JELLAL]
But still.

142
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,583
What compelled you to
go to such extremes?

143
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,666
[DORANBOLT] Eclipse is a spell
directly from the pages

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,666
of the Book of Zeref.

145
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,750
If the public were ever
to find out about that,

146
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,000
there would be some
serious hell to pay.

147
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,750
Tell no one! Or kiss
the throne goodbye!

148
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,666
[MELDY]
You said that to the king?

149
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,250
[DORANBOLT] Sometimes speaking
truth to power is necessary.

150
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,333
They came to the brink of
losing the citizens' trust,

151
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,416
and then the kingdom.

152
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,958
[MELDY]
Oh wow.

153
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,583
[DORANBOLT] I have absolutely
no interest in a revolution.

154
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,750
And although it does go
against certain values

155
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,583
that I'm sworn to uphold,

156
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,666
looking the other way
was the only real option

157
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,416
I had to avoid one.

158
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,083
[JELLAL] You were able to
convince Lahar of the same?

159
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,958
That guy? Let's just say
he forgot it all, too.

160
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,333
[MELDY gasps]

161
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,458
He's one of the
Council's rising stars.

162
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,000
He doesn't belong
down in the mud.

163
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,583
[JELLAL] For someone
who works for the council,

164
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,250
you like to do
things your own way.

165
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,500
[DORANBOLT]
Before your stint in prison,

166
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,666
weren't you a
full-fledged member?

167
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,125
[MELDY sighs]

168
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,000
[DORANBOLT] Your companion.
You haven't found her yet?

169
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,583
[MELDY]
Mm-mm.

170
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't imagine that she'd just
leave without saying anything.

171
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,208
[DORANBOLT] Well, best
of luck to you with that.

172
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,083
I seriously must
be losing my edge,

173
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,166
if I'm starting to worry
about the lot of you.

174
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,333
Hold on.

175
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,625
Sorry, but I'm done.
We never met, okay?

176
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,208
But, you are in my debt!
Don't forget about that.

177
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,750
[JELLAL]
You have my gratitude.

178
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:16,875
Just stay out of trouble.
And don't test me.

179
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,625
Cobra. What became of him?

180
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,958
He walked straight
back to prison.

181
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,750
[JELLAL]
What?

182
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,750
[DORANBOLT] Almost immediately
after the dragons vanished.

183
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,416
[COBRA] These bracelets
are nice, but ya don't have

184
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,875
to make me wear 'em ya know.

185
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,625
[LAHAR]
I appreciate the sentiment.

186
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,333
But we must follow protocol.

187
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,916
Yeah, right.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,291
Gotta lock up that dragon
slayer that can't actually

189
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,708
live up to his name.

190
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,500
I got no fight left
in these hands.

191
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,333
Now I see. That's why
you've decided to return.

192
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,000
Your pride took
a hit so you came

193
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,791
slithering back to us, eh?

194
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,333
Fresh air's nice.

195
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,625
And so is taking in all
of those sweet voices.

196
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,125
Cubellios. I heard
her out there, too.

197
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,625
Voices?

198
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,333
[COBRA]
But I've had my fill.

199
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,041
So it's back to the
old peace and quiet.

200
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,208
[COBRA] So I can work on
busting out the Seis.

201
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,375
[DORANBOLT]
Tell me!

202
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,250
What did you hear?

203
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,583
[COBRA]
You wanna know?

204
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,166
The gate to the
netherworld's gonna open.

205
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,583
Something like that.

206
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,750
Still trying to remember it all,
so stay out of my head.

207
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,791
That's it.

208
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,125
Those are the last words
that he spoke to me.

209
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,333
I don't quite understand
what he meant by it.

210
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,583
But it doesn't sound good.

211
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,250
Be safe.

212
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,458
I understand.

213
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,750
It's Tartaros.

214
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,250
Oh man.

215
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,083
My guts are still all
tied up in knots.

216
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,083
Would you stop
being such a baby?

217
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,458
[NATSU]
I can't help it!

218
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,916
All that bumping and
jumping' just slays my belly.

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,375
[HAPPY] I'm sorry.
The road is pretty rough.

220
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,041
We'll be home before
you know it, Natsu.

221
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,375
I'm feeling better.

222
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,541
I think I'll probably have
some magic power back

223
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,541
in just a couple hours or so.

224
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,791
[NATSU]
Well, when that happens,

225
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,791
can you hit me with
that spell of yours?

226
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,291
[WENDY]
Sure!

227
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,958
Question for ya, pal.

228
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,625
[NATSU]
Huh?

229
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,000
What are you gonna do
when we get back home?

230
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,666
Take some jobs.

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,916
Sign up for something
exciting that pays a lot!

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,166
I just wanna go fishing
all day and relax!

233
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,625
To be totally honest,
I think going on some more jobs

234
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,083
with you guys would really
help me to grow as a wizard.

235
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,541
What about you, Lucy?

236
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,916
When I get home...

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,625
[LUCY] I'm feeling
really inspired after

238
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,875
everything that's happened.
the people, the experiences.

239
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,291
So, I see quite a bit
of writing in my future.

240
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,541
[WENDY] Oh! What kind
of story are you writing?

241
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,458
[LUCY]
Let's just say 'a secret' one.

242
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,958
My, you've been working on that
drawing for quite some time now.

243
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,833
Yes, I'm designing some new,
custom armor for myself.

244
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,541
I don't see how you
could possibly need

245
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,583
any more armor than
you already have.

246
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,750
[ERZA] Well, the design I'm
working on will bring together

247
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,666
the ultimate strength
needed for battle,

248
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,833
with the elegance
of a ball-gown.

249
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:13,958
You Like it?

250
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,333
[CARLA]
Oh. Uh. It certainly is unique!

251
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,291
[ERZA]
Aw, you flatter me.

252
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,708
Hey. Do you know what
the deal is with Gray?

253
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,250
[HAPPY]
Don't know.

254
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,291
[HAPPY] He looks like he really
needs a fish, if you ask me.

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,125
Is there something
bothering you?

256
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,125
[GRAY]
Huh?

257
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,500
[WENDY]
You're quiet.

258
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,458
The rest of us were all
talking about what we wanna

259
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,958
do when we get back home.

260
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,000
[GRAY]
Ah, yeah.

261
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,750
You need some more
time to recover?

262
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,375
No. I'm fine.
It's nothing like that, really.

263
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,375
Near the end of the
battle with the dragons,

264
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,208
I suddenly got
this eerie feeling.

265
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,666
[WENDY] Like, you were
seeing into the future?

266
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,458
Like a dream, but you
were awake the whole time?

267
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,708
[GRAY]
Yeah.

268
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,833
But it feels too
real to be a dream.

269
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,875
I remember myself getting
shot and then dying.

270
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,333
And I could almost swear that
it had actually happened to me.

271
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,250
[GRAY] I don't know,
I guess it sounds crazy.

272
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:33,250
But it's not the first time in
my life that I've felt this way.

273
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,625
I was young.

274
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,500
When the single biggest
event in my life went down.

275
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,916
And nothing was
ever the same again.

276
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,125
[GRAY] A demon from the Book
of Zeref attacked my village.

277
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,166
Its name was Deliora.

278
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,166
My whole family was killed.

279
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,833
I barely survived.

280
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,375
But Ur saved me.

281
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,416
She took me in. She trained me.

282
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,708
Everything I know about Ice
Magic, I learned through her.

283
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:14,791
Later, she saved my life again.
By sacrificing her own.

284
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,166
And the way I feel now.

285
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,291
Is exactly like I felt
when that happened.

286
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,708
[GRAY]
I saw myself die in that battle.

287
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,500
It was so real.

288
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,666
But the strangest
thing about it,

289
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,125
was that it filled me with
this "Warm" sensation.

290
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,166
It was comforting.

291
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,583
[WENDY]
What do you think it means?

292
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,291
No idea.

293
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,666
I told you it was
really weird, right?

294
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,875
[WENDY]
It's okay.

295
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,708
[GRAY]
Lyon from Laymia Scale.

296
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,583
He was one of
Ur's students, too.

297
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,625
And Ultear of Crime Sorcière.

298
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,500
That's her daughter.

299
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,666
[GRAY]
I wonder how she's doing.

300
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,375
I bet she made it through
the fight with the dragons.

301
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,500
She was probably somewhere
fighting right along with us.

302
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,416
An evil guild shows its face.

303
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,666
Tartaros is another member
of the Baram Alliance

304
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,375
alongside Oración Seis
and Grimoire Heart.

305
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,666
[JELLAL] I don't know what
Cobra may have learned.

306
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,291
but I assume he's going
to try to use his information

307
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,416
to negotiate a pardon.

308
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,000
[MELDY]
What are they up to?

309
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,666
[JELLAL] If they are
as sinister and vile

310
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,791
as the rumors say,
this doesn't bode well.

311
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,833
[OLD WOMAN]
Hello.

312
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,791
Not good. We can't be seen.

313
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,041
Right.

314
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,458
[OLD WOMAN]
Excuse me!

315
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,000
Your names wouldn't happen to
be Jellal and Meldy would they?

316
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,666
A woman gave me
a letter for you.

317
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,541
She said that I might run
into you on this road.

318
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,541
A letter?

319
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,125
It's from her!

320
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,875
[MELDY]
Oh my gosh!

321
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,500
Maybe she is waiting for us!

322
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,625
[ULTEAR]
My dear Jellal, and sweet Meldy.

323
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:22,458
Please forgive me. In the battle
for the future of humanity,

324
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,291
I used a spell that
forfeit my own future.

325
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,875
If I could do it
over again I would.

326
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,000
And I am so thankful that
I have this opportunity.

327
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,708
This chance, to bid you farewell

328
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,375
before my final
breath escapes me.

329
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,208
[MELDY gasps]

330
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,416
[ULTEAR]
My life's path ends here.

331
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,458
I wasn't able to achieve the
ultimate goal of Crime Sorcière.

332
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,625
So I ask that you continue on.

333
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,833
Keep the spirit that
brought us together alive.

334
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,500
Don't forget your sins.

335
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,750
Learn from them.
Don't let them destroy you.

336
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,125
Never give up hope that
a day will finally come

337
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,208
when you will be forgiven.
And most importantly.

338
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,666
Regard every single
person you meet.

339
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,958
with love and compassion
in your hearts.

340
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,791
[ULTEAR] You have many
battles still ahead of you.

341
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,958
If Zeref is not defeated.

342
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,166
mankind will once again
be awash in grief.

343
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,208
So please, you have
to keep going.

344
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,083
You have to live, for me.

345
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,416
I pray,

346
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,375
that this long, tumultuous
journey we've been on

347
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,833
will ultimately bring
happiness to everyone.

348
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:40,333
[MELDY sobbing]

349
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,500
She's gone.

350
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,833
[JELLAL]
Excuse me.

351
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,083
But when did you
get this letter?

352
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,833
Huh?

353
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,333
[NATSU moaning]
My tummy hates me.

354
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,916
It's my fault.

355
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,458
The Troia spell just seems like
it gets less and less effective

356
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,833
the more times that
I use it on somebody.

357
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,458
Well that can't be helped.

358
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,875
With all your
moaning and groaning

359
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,541
it's impossible to take a nap.

360
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,583
[HAPPY] Can you do me a favor
and draw a yummy looking

361
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,000
fishy for me?

362
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,958
Yes, I'd be happy to.
In fact, drawing is my forte!

363
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,708
You think so?

364
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,916
Strange as it sounds.

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,208
I think I'm missing
that rickety old pub.

366
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,583
Yeah, I guess I kind of am too.

367
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,666
[LUCY] But you got to wonder
where Jellal and his group

368
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,458
were going after all this.

369
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,000
[ERZA]
I don't know.

370
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,500
[GRAY] No way!
You're not gettin' that on me!

371
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,583
[WENDY] Do we need
to pull over again?

372
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,875
[CARLA] If we stop this
carriage every time he whines,

373
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,416
we'll never reach Magnolia.

374
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,875
[ERZA]
I'm done, Happy! Look!

375
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,625
[HAPPY]
Whoa! What the?

376
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,208
[LUCY]
Oh! Let me see it!

377
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,416
[LUCY screams]

378
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,166
[ERZA]
Ah! Screams of joy.

379
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,083
That's the highest compliment
an artist can hope for!

380
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,125
[HAPPY]
Here, use this!

381
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,291
[LUCY]
No! Don't! That's my purse!

382
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,541
[HAPPY]
But he needs it!

383
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,125
[LUCY] No way! A bunch
of my stuff is in there!

384
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,000
Why don't you just
let him use...

385
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,041
[ULTEAR] I had always
cursed my lot in life.

386
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,041
Felt cheated by the
hand fate had dealt me.

387
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,583
The rage that burned inside

388
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:19,416
was eating away my spirit.
It seemed huge and insatiable.

389
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,791
But once I opened my eyes,

390
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,416
and looked at the
limitless skies above.

391
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,416
I had a revelation.

392
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,583
I saw how small I
was in comparison.

393
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,833
The world around
me was infinite,

394
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,375
full of more wonders than
I could ever imagine.

395
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,250
Huh?

396
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,791
[ULTEAR]
And through the clouds.

397
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,250
Golden rays of sunlight
shone down on me.

398
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,875
Like a gentle shower
washing away the darkness.

399
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,208
It warmed my soul.

400
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,916
I've never felt more at peace.

401
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,166
[ULTEAR] It was the first time
I'd experienced true joy.

402
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,500
At last, I was thankful for
the gift of life I'd been given.

403
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,500
[GRAY] Hey stop! We got
to stop the carriage!

404
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,750
Is there something wrong, Gray?

405
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,583
[LUCY]
Yeah, what's the matter?

406
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,791
[ULTEAR]
At the end of my journey.

407
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,041
I found what had
eluded me all along.

408
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,625
I was happy.

409
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,583
No, I'm okay.

410
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,541
[ULTEAR]
I was able to forgive myself.

411
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,166
I could finally let go.

412
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,625
[GRAY]
Her life for mine.

413
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,750
[MELDY sobbing]

414
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,625
She gave away all she had.

415
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,000
Time.

416
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:29,500
[GRAY] Why did they
both have to die for me?

417
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,583
Why?

418
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,375
[ULTEAR]
Goodbye, my friends.

419
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:40,333
But don't cry. I love you all.

420
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,291
[NATSU] Holy cow, is it good
to be back in Magnolia, or what?

421
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,416
[HAPPY]
Yeah, no kidding!

422
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,041
It feels like we've
been gone forever!

423
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,625
[NATSU] So much stuff
happened in Crocus,

424
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,500
I can't believe it was
just over a week!

425
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,250
[HAPPY] I hope things aren't
as intense next week!

426
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,125
I need a break!

427
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,666
[NATSU]
Check it out, Happy!

428
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,458
I heard the townspeople have
a present for us or something!

429
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:31,083
[HAPPY] Oh! Awesome!
I wonder what it is!

430
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,958
[NATSU] You'll just have
to wait and find out,

431
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:33,958
like the rest of us!

432
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,666
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: A Gift

433
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,791
[HAPPY] Whoa, it's like the
best gift we could've gotten!

434
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,958
This rules!

435
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,333
[NATSU] The people
of Magnolia really know

436
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,833
how to make you feel special!
