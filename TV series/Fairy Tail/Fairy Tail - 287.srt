[BOTH gasp]

167
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,000
[BRANDISH]
I'm down one, too.

168
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,041
Now we're even.

169
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,083
Does that make things better?

170
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,000
I hate dealing with this.

171
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,083
There's so much else
I'd rather be doing.

172
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,291
He was your guy.

173
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,625
How could you?

174
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,291
[BRANDISH] Why would I waste
any more of my time?

175
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,791
It's way easier for all of us
if I tell everyone back home

176
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,875
I got rid of the spy
and her little friends.

177
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,791
So just stay away
from Alakitasia, okay?

178
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,791
[ERZA]
Wait.

179
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,125
How could she know
why we're here?

180
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,083
[BRANDISH]
Makarov's alive, by the way.

181
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,541
[gasps]

182
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,708
[BRANDISH] But if you guys
don't behave yourselves,

183
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,250
that could easily change.

184
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,666
So this is your warning.

185
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,208
You'd better run
along home, or else.

186
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,083
[BOTH gasp]

187
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,750
What is she doing?

188
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,750
What the--?

189
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,166
[CROWD yelling]

190
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,041
[TOURIST A]
Whoa!

191
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,708
The island got bigger earlier!

192
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,250
[TOURIST B]
And now it's completely gone!

193
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,416
[BRANDISH]
Alvarez has 11 other wizards

194
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,541
just as powerful as I am.

195
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,708
So don't be stupid and
start a fight you can't win.

196
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,583
Got that, Fairy Tail?

197
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,916
[LUCY]
There are that many like her?

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,291
[GRAY] So they've already got
our whole mission figured out.

199
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,916
[ERZA]
We can't beat or fool them.

200
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,541
We'll save Gramps.

201
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,500
[SAILOR C]
Get on! Hurry!

202
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,958
[SAILOR D]
I need ropes over here!

203
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,833
Make sure that every
citizen is accounted for!

204
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,333
It looks like they'll
actually be able

205
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
to get everybody on the boats.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,625
Yeah, if those fishermen
weren't around,

207
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,125
this could've been
a lot worse.

208

[groans]

209
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,583
[SAILOR E]
What just happened?

210
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,250
[SAILOR A]
Man, that was freaky.

211
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,000
[SAILOR B] The island was
just here and then "poof."

212
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,083
[ERZA]
Did it just vanish?

213
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,625
No.

214
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,666
I think that's it there.

215
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,166
She shrank it.

216
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,458
So her magic can
shrink or enlarge things.

217
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,791
It's as if she has
control of their mass.

218
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,791
Quite an effective skill.

219
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,916
And it can work on an
extremely large scale.

220

I'm so sorry, you guys.

But I can't.

I can't use my
healing magic right now.

Hey, Happy.

228

Were you able to track
down that kid's dad?

Aye!

seen some girls with cats?

for their help.

All right.

So, what's our next move?

00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,000
Good question.

236
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,333
We should start by finding out--

It's my magic.

the considerate thing to do!

Yes! We stopped moving!

So then, where have
you taken us?

Not far.

249
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,000
It's near Caracol Island.

250
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,208
But underwater.

[CARLA]
But why here?

255
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,250
I was able to get in
contact with our spy.

00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,208
She gave me a set of
coordinates for a rendezvous.

[ERZA]
What a strange place.

Like an underwater temple.

How is there no window here?

Wow, this is so awesome!

00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,958
I can just dive right in...

I'm not sure that's
a good idea, Natsu.

[GRAY]
Why are you in a swimsuit?

284
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,875
[CARLA]
Because we're in the water.

Uh-huh, that would be me!

289
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,250
[MEST] As you know,
the former Oracion Seis

are working with Jellal
as part of Crime Sorciere.

291
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,416
So we asked for
their help with this.

292
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,666
There a reason you
didn't call on Cobra?

293
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,416
We couldn't risk him
hearing certain things

294
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,416
that need to
remain confidential.

295
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,041
I don't believe our
paths have crossed

296
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,291
since that
Infinity Clock ordeal.

297
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,791
It's so nice to see you all.

Oh?

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,208
You do realize
your cover was blown....

300
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,458
...so you fled to
Caracol Island...

301
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,458
...which was promptly wiped out.

302
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,708
It's not my fault!

303
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,083
I barely escaped alive, ya know?

304
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,708
That's quite surprising,
coming from you.

305
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,583
Well, as it turns out, I owe
Mest a little favor now.

306
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,291
So I'll help you this time,

307
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:47,041
but don't be fooled into
thinking we're partners.

308
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,375
We appreciate it, Angel.

309
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,083
I mean, Sorano.

310
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,583
Don't forget, I'm the
one who killed Karen.

311
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,166
She tested my nerves, too.

312
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,666
[ERZA]
Calm down, Sorano.

313

Okay, fine.

00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,250
[WENDY]
I have a question.

315
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,083
Does anyone know where
this thing is taking us?

316

Straight to Hell.

317
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,625
[ANGEL] We're going
to your master, Makarov.

00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,958
[ERZA] Wait, you really know
where they're keeping him?

319
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,416
Aren't I the best?

320
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,000
[YAJEEL]
I must ask, Makarov.


321
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,041
Have you heard the chatter
of late regarding Fairy Tail?


322
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,041
To be quite honest,

323
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,291
I do find it all shocking.

324
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,458
But surely you expected that?


325
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,125
[MAKAROV]
Oh, you misunderstand.


326
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,916
I'm not referring to the guild.


327
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,791
What I'm surprised by is
your Emperor's disposition.

328
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,250
Because my preconceived
notions led me to believe

329
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,416
that he'd be more of a...

330
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,125
More of a harsh dictator?

331
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,875
Perhaps not those words exactly,

332
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,583
but I think you get my drift.

333
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,583
Always got diplomacy
on your mind, eh?

334
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,708
A year ago, I would
never have imagined

335
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,041
I'd be formally accepted
as a guest of the Empire.

336
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,041
Much less given
any chance to negotiate.

337
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,583
Although, to be fair,

338
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,666
I've only dealt
with you as of yet.

339
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,000
His majesty has been
away from the castle

340
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,333
for a long time indeed,

341
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,416
indulging his wandering nature.

342
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,875
[MAKAROV] Yes, his agreeance
to speak with an old man

343
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,041
who has no influence
struck me as unique.

344
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,916
[YAJEEL] I'd say your
influence is evidenced

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,958
by the value of
the cards you hold.

346
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,875
[MAKAROV] You've told me
his so called "shields"

347
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,875
are hot-tempered,

348
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,000
but he can quell
their aggression.

349
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,666
That he could see a way forward
without any blood being shed.

350
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,458
Our Majesty is nothing
if not gracious.

351
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,375
I must say,
it's a stark contrast

352
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,375
to his reputation throughout
Ishgar as a fearsome warrior

353
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,083
who conquered
Alakitasia's guilds by force.

354
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,458
It's typical for those who make
history to have many facets.

355
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,833
After all, he is our ruler.

356
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,875
No matter how hard
I try, Yajeel,

357
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,666
I just can't seem to beat
you at a hand of Regenca.

You should know better, Makarov.

he's been gone a whole year!

Ah. I've waited
so long for this.

368
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,416
It's as I've told you.

369
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,250
Emperor Spriggan
has been made aware

370
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,333
of Ishgar's appeal
for non-aggression.

371
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,583
And when he gives
his formal endorsement,

372
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,250
his 12 "shields"
will fall in line.

Good to see you too, Invel.

could you assemble the Twelve?

[INVEL]
That will take time.

If only I could predict

of spring's first breeze,

Gale force. Or a dark cloud.

00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:26,125
No. More like a
thunderstorm of death.

But a spring breeze?

That doesn't begin to
capture the gravity.

He's like a desert!
That's what I'd say!

Good to hear, my Lord,

exercise proper caution

of such greatness.

as soon as possible,

You know there is a
proper protocol for this.

[ZEREF] I wish to speak
with this man in private.

I confess I'm a bit puzzled
regarding your true identity.

00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,583

To those in Ishgar, I am Zeref.

441
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,416
In Alakitasia, I am Spriggan.

442
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,875
Though, if I had to choose
between the two, I'd say Zeref.

443
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,875
[ZEREF] For 400 years,
I wandered far and wide,

searching to find my purpose
for living in this world.

445
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,791
But during that time,
I also prepared

446
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,916
for the Dragon King Festival.

447
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,458
A few hundred years ago,

448
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,750
I made a decision to create
a country here in Alakitasia.

449
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,791
It was a small,
fledgling thing at first,

450
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:03,000
but gradually, we absorbed
one guild after another.

451
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,500
Before too long,
it had grown into

452
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:09,208
the kind of vast amalgamation
one might call an empire.

453
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,666
All of this was with the goal of
obtaining the Lumen Histoire?

454
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
There's no use in trying
to deceive me.

its official name.

Yes, that's true.

00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,500
But I've only recently decided
that's what I truly want.

466
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,791
Initially, I built this
empire to be strong enough

467
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,833
to go against Acnologia.

468
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,750
To kill him.

469
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,916
The attempted invasion a
decade ago was not my doing.

470

As master of your own guild,

471
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,083
I'm sure you're familiar
with "unruly children."

472
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,875
However, I made the
decision to stop them,

473
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,958
because I knew that
it was not yet time.

474
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,916
So you're saying the

the Etherion Cannon

weren't what turned you away?

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,750
[ZEREF] Oh, they were
factors, of course.

Our side would've suffered
heavy losses for sure.

479
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,875
But I'm positive that the
Alvarez Empire I've built today

480
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,166
could confidently take on
Ishgar, as well as Acnologia.

[MAKAROV grunts]

482
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,166
That's to say, there's no
room for negotiation?

483
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,791
Unfortunately, no.

484
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:32,000
For the real Dragon King
Festival is about to begin.

485
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:36,375
The Black Wizard, the King of
the Dragons, and you mortals.

486
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:41,208
The time has come to decide who
will live... and who will die.

487
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,000
[MAKAROV]
So your plan is to start a war?

488
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,833
No, an extermination.

489
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,083
I will not allow you to
have our first master!

490
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,875
[MAKAROV groans]

491
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,458
I'd be remiss if I didn't
offer you my sincere gratitude.

492
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,000
I truly appreciate you
raising Natsu for me.

493
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,041
[ZEREF] So I'll put an end
to your suffering quickly,

494
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,458
then I'll deliver your body
unto Natsu, himself.

495
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,125
He'll be so angry.

496
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,750
Perhaps it'll be enough
to destroy me.

497
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,583
[MAKAROV groaning]

498
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:22,000
Are there any last words
you'd like me to pass along?

499
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,375
You hideous soul.

500
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,666
You demon!

501
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,125
Close, old man.

502
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,875
But the meaning of
the name "Spriggan"

503
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,291
is much more akin
to "hideous fairy."

504
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,458
--It's gramps!
--He found him!

505
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,250
[ERZA, LUCY]
Master!

506
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,708
Hey, gramps!

507
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,250
My children are here.

508
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,458
Guys, I saw Zeref.

509
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,833
He was with Zeref!

510
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,208
[gasps]

511
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,166
You sure?

512
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,875
[ZEREF]
Natsu, after all this time...

513
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,416
...you've come.

514
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,708
[LUCY] After a tearful
reunion with Makarov,

515
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:44,208
it's time to escape the Alvarez
Empire and get back home.

516
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,833
But Ajeel of the
Spriggan Twelve,

517
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,875
AKA "The King of the Desert,"
is in hot pursuit.

518
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,125
As walls of burning sand
threaten to swallow

519
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,500
everything whole,
they begin to close in

520
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,833
and trap the rescue team
in a dangerous corner.

521
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:00,500
Next time: "To the
God-Forsaken Land."

522
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,333
Knowing that we have
friends to protect

523
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,125
is what pushes all
of us forward.
