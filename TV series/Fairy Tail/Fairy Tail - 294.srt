And who would that be?

159
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,291
I assume that we're
in contact, Warren?

160
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:34,791
Yes, ma'am! Fiore's mightiest
are ready for action!

161
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,250
The Four Emperors of Ishgar!

162
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,416
That's so cool!

163
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,083
I never saw this coming!

164
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,791
I feel kinda bad for them since
they've all been working so hard

165
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,041
to avoid going to war.

166
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,708
But it seems to me like
there was nothing

167
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,333
they could really do about it.

168
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,791
A pretty awkward
position to be in.

169
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,083
If the enemy is somehow able
to fight their way past them,

170
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,958
there isn't a soul in Fiore that
can hold back the invasion.

171
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,958
[MAVIS]
We're counting on you, Warrod.

172
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,916
[WIZARD M]
Whoa! Look! Do you see that?

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,458
[WIZARD H]
It's gotta be Natsu!

174
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,791
It looks like we found him!

175
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,541
[WIZARD I]
Check out how fast he's moving!

176
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,583
Really? Come on.

177
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,000
Stop, you fool!

178
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:47,958
My lord. There is an object
approaching at high speed.

179
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,458
You ready to finish
this, Zeref? Let's go!

180
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,791
[LISANNA]
Oh, no.

181
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,833
Does Natsu think he can take
on Zeref all by himself?

182
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,833
That's manly, but reckless!

183
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:05,958
What an idiot.

184
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,375
We should go back
him up. He needs us!

185
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,083
You're right! I'll go, too!

186
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,916
[ERZA]
Hold on!

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,125
We're all concerned,

188
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,583
but we must stick to
the First Master's plan.

189
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,583
Leave Zeref in Natsu's hands.

190
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,333
You gotta be kiddin' me.

191
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,458
Zeref's power is legendary.
And he's got the Book of E.N.D.

192
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,875
That may be true,

193
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,833
but Natsu told us that he has
the means to defeat him.

194
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:32,541
Because my right arm...
is a secret weapon, too.

195
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,041
I have no doubt he will.

196
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,125
As usual, you're putting too
much faith in that hot head!

197
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,833
Get real!

198
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,458
You guys?

199
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,333
Oh, Gray.

200
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,625
[ERZA]
That so?

201
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,291
Meaning you don't
have faith in him?

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,416
All right! The two of you
need to cool it down!

203
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,666
So then, what do we do?

204
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,166
We'll trust in Natsu.

205
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,208
I realize that it might seem
like a reckless strategy,

206
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,833
but there is some
logic at its core.

207
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,250
At the moment, we're
completely surrounded.

208
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,458
Dispatching their leader

209
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,791
and ending the battle
as early as possible

210
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,458
might prove to be an effective
way out of this situation.

211
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,375
So, Gray. I want you
to believe in him, too.

212
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,541
[GRAY] Ugh. It's not
like I don't, ya know?

213
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,958
I'm worried 'cause I don't
like him goin' alone.

214
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,333
Did you actually admit to
being worried about Natsu?

215
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,208
[CARLA]
He isn't alone.

216
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,208
He's got somebody with him.

217
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,041
Happy.

218
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,416
[HAPPY] All right,
Natsu. There they are.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,583
Yeah.

220
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,375
[HAPPY]
There's so many of 'em!

221
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,625
[NATSU]
Looks like a big black carpet.

222
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,458
And they're tryin' to roll
the thing right into our house.

223
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,958
Hey, that reminds me.

224
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,333
Whatever happened to that
dirty ol' rug we used to have?

225
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,500
What do ya think happened?
You burned it up.

226
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,791
Oh, yeah!

227
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,625
Not a bad idea!
Take us in, Happy!

228
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,666

Aye, Sir!

Let's do another one!

233
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,750
[HAPPY] You seriously
wanna fight all of 'em?

234
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,083
Yeah! If that's what it
takes to drag Zeref out!

You're dead!

I'll kill you myself!

[NATSU]
I'm fine!

245
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,458
I gotta protect all our friends.

246
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,125
So that means I gotta fight!

00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:56,708
Fire Dragon King... Roar!

[ALVAREZ SOLDIER K]
He just burned away the ground!

250
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,958
[ALVAREZ SOLDIER L]
That guy is a monster.

251
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,416
[ALVAREZ SOLDIER K] No one said
anything about fighting someone

252
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,166
with that much power!

of ours did he take out?

[ZEREF] Nine hundred
and seventy-three men.

[ALVAREZ SOLDIERS chattering]

259
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,500
You got here quickly.
That works for me.

260
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:09,125
I was quite eager to come
and say hello, Natsu.

261
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:13,666
You're just in time
to say goodbye, Zeref.

262
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,791
[ALVAREZ SOLDIER N]
Did you hear that?

263
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,583
I think he called
His Majesty "Zeref"?

264
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,208
[ALVAREZ SOLDIER O]
Zeref?

265
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,833
That's His Majesty's
name in Ishgar.

266
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,625
[ALVAREZ SOLDIER O]
General Invel.

267
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,458
[INVEL] They call him
the Black Wizard Zeref.

268
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,000
Perhaps that is his true name.

269
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,666
Sorry, but you'd better
give us some space.

270
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,541
You should get back, Happy.

271

[HAPPY]
Aye.

272
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,458
[HAPPY] He's planning to
use it right off the bat.

273

Good luck, Natsu!

274
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:56,208
In fact, you should all retreat
several kilometers to the west.

275
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,666
Are you going to
engage this fool?

Your power is wasted
on one such as him.

I am the only one who can.

Now, men! Retreat to the west!

00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,291
His Majesty will clear
the path for us!

You're not gonna get Mavis.

[ZEREF] The only reason
we've reached this point

to make it count.

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
[ZEREF] He's turned the
ground itself to fire!

315
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,708
Incredible!

316
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:25,250
This is the end, Zeref! Goodbye!

317
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,541
[ZEREF] After what's
felt like an eternity,

318
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,208
my wish shall be granted.

319
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,583
[ZEREF]
Thank you.

320
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,541
Igneel...

321
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,625
Anna...

322
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,333
Layla...

323
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,416
Mavis...

324
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,750
And...

325
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,416
...my dear little brother...

326
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,541
[ZEREF]
Natsu.

327
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,541
[LUCY] The tenacious
flame given to Natsu

328
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,250
by his father, Igneel,
King of the Fire Dragons,

329
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,375
burns the black wizard's body.

330
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,916
Sensing death's arrival,

331
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,125
Zeref begins to reveal the
Dragon Slayer's secret origin,

332
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,125
a tale Natsu has never heard.

333
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,958
This shocking truth sends
Natsu into a frenzy,

334
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,833
fists swinging with
uncontrollable rage.

335
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:00,000
But is his goal to
protect or destroy?

336
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,916
Next Time: "Across 400 Years."

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,916
A demon of the Book of Zeref
returns to his creator at last.
