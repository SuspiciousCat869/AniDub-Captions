1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,333
- HEY, GUYS.

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,958
READY FOR SOME
MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,291
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,916
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

6
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,583
- ( laughter )

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,541
WAS THAT AN AWESOME JOB,
OR WHAT?

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,750
- WELL, THE CLIENT
SURE SEEMED TO THINK SO.

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,916
- FACE IT, YOU GUYS
ARE JUST LUCKY

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,958
THAT I DECIDED
TO COME ALONG.

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,458
- WE'RE LUCKY THAT YOU 
BEGGED TO COME WITH US?

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,416
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?
- BECAUSE YOU WERE ABOUT

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,875
AS HELPFUL AS ONE
OF ERZA'S SUITCASES.

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,291
- YOU BETTER
WATCH YOUR MOUTH

15
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,125
OR I'LL PACK YOU
LIKE A SUITCASE, PAL.

16
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,916
- THAT DOESN'T 
MAKE ANY SENSE.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,375
- THAT'S ENOUGH, BOYS.

18
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,458
NOW PLEASE GET DRESSED.
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

19
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,625
WHY DOES THIS KEEP
HAPPENING TO ME?

20
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,000
- A BIT OF ADVICE, HERE, GRAY,

21
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,500
NEVER GET IN A FIGHT
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

22
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:01,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,125
- HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR CONVERSATION,

24
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,666
BUT...
- WHAT'S UP?

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,916
- WHEN I TOOK THIS JOB, 
I WAS ORIGINALLY THINKING

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,291
IT'D BE MORE OF
A SOLO MISSION, YOU KNOW?

27
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,625
SO WHY'D Y'ALL
HAVE TO COME ALONG?

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,500
- AWW, COME ON,
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

29
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,583
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

30
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,125
- WE'RE FAIRY TAIL'S
STRONGEST TEAM,

31
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,708
SO WE GOT TO STICK TOGETHER.

32
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,291
- AYE, SIR.
- AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

33
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,166
- YEAH, WE ARE.

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,833
- NO JOB IS TOO TOUGH,

35
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,750
NOT FOR ME, 
HAPPY, ERZA,

36
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,541
AND OLD DROOPY DRAWERS HERE.
- DON'T CALL ME THAT.

37
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,458
- HMM, WE ARE QUITE
A CAPABLE BUNCH.

38
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,541
- TRUE, THAT.

39
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,125
- YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME!

40
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,583
- LIGHTEN UP.

41
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,958
I'M JUST MESSING
WITH YOU, LOOPY.

42
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,458
- WELL, I DON'T APPRECIATE IT

43
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,416
AND THAT'S NOT MY NAME.
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,458
I TRULY DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU.

45
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,500
I LET MYSELF
GET CARRIED AWAY.

46
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,541
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

47
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,541
IF YOU WOULD LIKE,
YOU MAY STRIKE ME NOW.

48
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,625
- THAT'S OKAY.  I REALLY DON'T 
THINK IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST.

49
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,541
- Boys: SMART MOVE.
- ( gasps )

50
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,416
- ( whispers, murmurs )
- ARE THOSE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS?

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,541
- I GUESS THEY DON'T KNOW YET.
- I FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM.

52
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,875
- WHY IS EVERYBODY
STARING AT US?

53
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,666
- IT'S NOT THE GOOD
KIND OF STARING.

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,125
- IT FEELS LIKE PITY.

55
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,125
( gasps )

56
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,916
WHAT?!

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WHY DOES THE GUILD
LOOK SO BIZARRE?

58
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,291
- NO WAY.
- WHAT'S HAPPENED TO IT?

59
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,041
- NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

60
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,916
- Happy: THE PHANTOM LORD.

61
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,291
- Natsu: OUR GUILD...

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,708
SOMEONE DID THIS
TO OUR GUILD!

63
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,750
- ( gasping )

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,500
- BUT WHO WOULD DO
SUCH A THING?

65
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,333
- IT WAS PHANTOM.

66
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,666
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

67
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,416
- YOU MEAN PHANTOM DID THIS?

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,791
- Mirajane: WE COULDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO STOP THEM.

69
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,541
THEY GOT US GOOD.

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,958
- Narrator: THE BASEMENT OF
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD HALL, 

71
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,291
WHILE NORMALLY USED
FOR STORAGE,

72
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,041
IT IS NOW A PLACE
FOR THE MEMBERS

73
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,583
TO NURSE THEIR 
BROKEN SPIRITS.

74
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,958
- WE'VE NEVER BEEN
ON THE BEST TERMS 

75
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,875
WITH THOSE PHANTOM JERKS,
BUT COME ON.

76
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,708
- WANT TO TEACH
THEM A LESSON?

77
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,458
- BACK OFF, YOU GUYS.

78
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,625
DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE IN
ENOUGH TROUBLE ALREADY? 

79
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,708
- YO, WHAT'S UP, KIDS?

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,458
- UH, HI.

81
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,125
- SORRY WE WEREN'T HERE SOONER.

82
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,041
- WHY THE HECK ARE YOU ALL
JUST SITTING AROUND DOWN HERE?

83
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,750
- HOW'D IT GO, LUCY?

84
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,250
YOU FINISH THE JOB
LIKE A GOOD GIRL? 

85
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,791
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

86
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,625
- MASTER,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND

87
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,416
THE GRAVITY OF 
THIS SITUATION?

88
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,833
- THE GUILD HALL HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

89
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,500
- THERE'S NO NEED TO GET 
YOURSELVES ALL WORKED UP.

90
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,958
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
OR ANYTHING.

91
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,458
- WHAT?

92
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,708
- ( gulping )
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU

93
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,416
HOW COWARDLY THOSE DUNDERHEADS

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,458
IN THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD
REALLY ARE.

95
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,541
THEY STRUCK WHEN
NO ONE WAS HERE.

96
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,625
IS THAT ANYTHING
WORTH BRAGGING ABOUT?

97
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,375
- NOBODY WAS HERE?

98
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,041
- IT WAS AFTER EVERYONE HAD
ALREADY LEFT FOR THE NIGHT.

99
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,125
- I SUPPOSE WE CAN
BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.

100
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,666
AT LEAST NO ONE IN OUR GUILD
WAS HURT IN THE ATTACK.

101
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,958
- WE SHOULDN'T TROUBLE OURSELVES
WORRYING ABOUT PEOPLE

102
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,250
WHO DON'T EVEN HAVE THE GUTS
TO FACE US HEAD ON.

103
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,708
FORGET ABOUT THOSE FOOLS.

104
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,041
- AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN, GRAMPS!

105
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,666
WE CAN'T JUST LET THEM
TRASH OUR PLACE

106
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,166
AND GET AWAY WITH IT!

107
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,416
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS
ANY LONGER.

108
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,250
WE'LL HANDLE JOB REQUESTS
DOWN HERE

109
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,000
UNTIL THE UPSTAIRS
IS REPAIRED.

110
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,375
- WE SHOULDN'T BE WORRYING
ABOUT JOBS RIGHT NOW!

111
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,791
- NATSU! THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU!

112
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,333
- AND YOU SPANKED ME BECAUSE?

113
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,291
- HANDS TO YOURSELF, MASTER.

114
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,083
- ( chuckles )
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING, OLD MAN?!

115
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,625
- AH, KEEP YOUR DRESS ON.
I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK.

116
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE'S BEING LIKE THIS.

117
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,833
- Mirajane: LISTEN.

118
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,166
THIS IS JUST AS HARD ON HIM
AS IT IS ON YOU.

119
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,875
HE'S MAD, BUT CONFLICT
BETWEEN THE GUILDS

120
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,958
IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
BY THE COUNCIL.

121
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,375
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
THOSE PHANTOM CREEPS STARTED IT.

122
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,333
- I KNOW, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MATTER.

123
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,541
- ( grumbles ) 
JUST LET ME GO.

124
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
- Erza:
IF THE MASTER'S DECISION

125
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,041
IS TO NOT RETALIATE,

126
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,625
THEN WE MUST RESPECT IT.

127
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,125
- ( growls )

128
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,166
- WELL, THIS IS A PRETTY BIG
MESS WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW,

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,458
ISN'T IT, PLUE?

130
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,833
- WATCH OUT, BLONDIE.

131
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,708
YOU'RE ABOUT A STEP AWAY
FROM SWIMMING.

132
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,125
- I HAD NO IDEA
THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD

133
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,916
AND FAIRY TAIL HAD SUCH
A RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,666
- UH-HUH.

135
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,625
- HONESTLY, I THOUGHT ABOUT
JOINING THEM

136
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,458
BEFORE I MET UP
WITH NATSU.

137
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,083
THEY'VE GOT A REPUTATION
OF BEING

138
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,000
ALMOST AS CRAZY
AS FAIRY TAIL.

139
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,750
BUT I LOVE OUR GUILD.

140
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,208
I DON'T REGRET
MY DECISION AT ALL.

141
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,333
FAIRY TAIL IS KIND
OF LIKE MY FAMILY.

142
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,250
- VERY NICE PLACE YOU HAVE.
- WELCOME HOME.

143
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
- THEY LIKE TO SHOW UP
WITHOUT ASKING FIRST!

144
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,750
WHY ARE YOU HERE?!

145
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,250
- SINCE THE GUILD'S
BEEN ATTACKED,

146
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,875
WE CAN ASSUME THERE ARE
PHANTOM LORD MEMBERS IN TOWN.

147
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,208
- THEY'VE PROBABLY FOUND OUT
WHERE EVERYONE IN FAIRY TAIL

148
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:24,833
LIVES BY NOW.

149
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,375
- "WHERE WE LIVE"?

150
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,083
- MIRA SAID IT WOULD BE SAFER
IF WE HOLED UP TOGETHER.

151
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,208
YOU KNOW, STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.
- I GUESS SHE'S RIGHT.

152
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,750
- THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY
IN FAIRY TAIL

153
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,541
IS HAVING
A SLUMBER PARTY TONIGHT.

154
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,083
- YOU ARE AN ATTRACTIVE 
TEENAGE GIRL, AFTER ALL.

155
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,833
I WASN'T ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE

156
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,541
WITH YOU JUST BEING HERE ALONE
WITH NATSU AND GRAY.

157
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,833
I FELT I COULD ONLY RELAX
IF I STAYED HERE AS WELL.

158
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,291
- IT'S NOT TIME TO RELAX.

159
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,791
- SO IT WAS ALREADY DECIDED

160
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,208
THAT THESE TWO
WOULD STAY WITH ME?

161
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,708
WHY'D THEY HAVE TO
COME TO MY PLACE?

162
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,500
- WOW, YOU SURE HAVE A LOT
OF DIRTY CLOTHES.

163
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OUT OF MY STUFF!

164
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,791
YOU BETTER STOP THAT RIGHT NOW
OR YOU'RE BOTH DEAD MEAT!

165
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,125
- Natsu: HEY, PLUE,
DID YOU FIND SOMETHING TO EAT?

166
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,041
DON'T GO HOGGING IT ALL.

167
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,333
- Happy: LOOK, ERZA, I FOUND

168
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,166
SOME FRILLY PANTIES
YOU MIGHT LIKE.

169
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'D ACTUALLY WEAR

170
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,333
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, LUCY.

171
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,791
- I NEED TO GET SOME SHUT-EYE,

172
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,541
SO CAN YOU TRY
AND KEEP IT DOWN.

173
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,041
- YOU GUYS ARE TAKING THIS
"MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME" THING

174
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,291
A LITTLE TOO FAR.

175
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,708
- WE HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE.

176
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,291
YOU BOYS' HYGIENE.

177
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,208
I REFUSE TO SLEEP IN A ROOM
THAT REEKS OF SWEAT.

178
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A BATH
RIGHT NOW.

179
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,000
- BUT I ALREADY GOT INTO BED.

180
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,041
- COME ON, BOYS.

181
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,750
DO WE HAVE TO
TAKE A BATH TOGETHER

182
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,583
LIKE WE DID
WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

183
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,666
- WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
DO YOU GUYS HAVE?!

184
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,833
- THEY'RE THE STRONGEST TEAM.

185
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,625
- Lucy: MORE LIKE
THE STRANGEST TEAM.

186
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,541
- YOU SURE THIS IS OKAY?

187
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,333
- SHOULDN'T YOU STAY WITH LAKI
AND THE OTHERS

188
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,125
AT THE GIRLS' DORM?
- IT'S FINE.

189
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,875
I DON'T WANT TO
SPLIT UP OUR TEAM.

190
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,833
- THE THREE OF US
CAN FACE ANYTHING TOGETHER.

191
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,041
- I'LL ALWAYS PROTECT YOU.
- NO, I WILL.

192
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,250
- ( gasping )

193
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,208
- ( chews noisily )
- OKAY, NATSU, YOU'RE UP.

194
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,000
I'M ALL DONE WITH MY BATH.

195
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
- ( light snores )

196
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,500
- WANT TO TAKE HIS SPOT, GRAY?
- HMM?

197
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,708
- YOU SHOULD.
IT WAS SO RELAXING.

198
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,125
- GEEZ, I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL 
FEELING SO COMFORTABLE HERE.

199
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,000
- I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD GET DRESSED.

200
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,375
IS THIS A BIT MORE APPROPRIATE?

201
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,458
- IS THAT REALLY HOW
YOU CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES?

202
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,875
- THEN...

203
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,041
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA 
WHY PHANTOM ATTACKED US

204
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,541
OUT OF THE BLUE LIKE THAT?

205
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,916
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,250
WE HAVE HAD
OUR FAIR SHARE

207
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,916
OF SCUFFLES WITH 
THEM IN THE PAST,

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,541
BUT NEVER ANYTHING ON THIS
SORT OF MAGNITUDE BEFORE. 

209
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,375
- IF GRAMPS WASN'T
SO SCARED OF THEM,

210
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,166
WE COULD WIPE OUT
THOSE PUNKS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

211
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU AWAKE?

212
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,750
- COME ON, YOU KNOW MASTER
ISN'T AFRAID OF THEM, NATSU.

213
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,166
YOU SEEM TO BE FORGETTING

214
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,083
HE'S ONE OF THE TEN
WIZARD SAINTS.

215
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,708
- I NEVER GAVE YOU PERMISSION
TO READ THAT. GIMME!

216
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,291
- YOU CAN'T SNATCH
IT OUT OF MY HANDS

217
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,916
WITHOUT AT LEAST TELLING ME
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,458
- YES, I CAN.

219
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,333
I PROMISED LEVY SHE'D BE
THE FIRST TO READ IT.

220
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,791
SO YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.

221
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,791
- HMM.

222
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,541
- YOU'RE NOT
GETTING IT EITHER!

223
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,291
SO WHAT'S WITH THESE
TEN WIZARD SAINTS, ANYWAY?

224
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,541
- IT'S AN HONOR BESTOWED
BY THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

225
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,291
AN EXTREMELY COVETED TITLE

226
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,166
SHARED BY THE TEN MOST POWERFUL
WIZARDS ON THE CONTINENT.

227
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,833
- Lucy: REALLY?

228
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,750
- Happy: PHANTOM LORD'S MASTER,
JOSE, IS ONE OF THEM TOO.

229
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,000
- THAT'S TRUE.

230
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,625
AND SO IS HE.

231
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,791
- HE IS AFRAID!

232
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,875
HE'S SCARED THAT PHANTOM
HAS TOO MANY MEMBERS

233
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,333
FOR US TO HANDLE.

234
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,166
- COULD YOU PLEASE
USE YOUR INSIDE VOICE?

235
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,041
- THAT IS NOT TRUE
AND YOU KNOW IT.

236
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,666
IT'S JUST LIKE MASTER
AND MIRA SAID BEFORE.

237
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,166
THE CONSEQUENCES OF US
GOING TO WAR WITH PHANTOM

238
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,958
ARE NOWHERE NEAR
WORTH THE FIGHT.

239
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,541
THE ORDER OF THE MAGICAL WORLD
IS AT STAKE HERE.

240
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,958
- BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.
ARE THEY THAT STRONG?

241
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,458
- THEY AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON US?
WE COULD TAKE THOSE CLOWNS.

242
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,000
- NO, IF WE WERE
TO ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE,

243
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,000
NEITHER GUILD WOULD SURVIVE.

244
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,166
THEIR STRENGTH EQUALS OURS.

245
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,625
PHANTOM'S MASTER, JOSE,

246
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,916
IS ALSO ONE OF
THE TEN WIZARD SAINTS.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WHICH MEANS HE'S ON PAR
WITH MAKAROV.

248
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,791
THEY ALSO HAVE AN ELITE
GROUP OF WIZARDS

249
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,000
SIMILAR TO OUR S-CLASS
KNOWN AS THE ELEMENT FOUR.

250
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,583
HOWEVER, THEIR BIGGEST THREAT
MAY BE "BLACK STEEL" GAJEEL.

251
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,875
I BELIEVE THAT HE'S MOST LIKELY
THE ONE BEHIND

252
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,958
THE GUILD HALL'S DESTRUCTION.

253
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,041
HE'S KNOWN AS
THE IRON DRAGON SLAYER.

254
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,500
- HE'S A DRAGON SLAYER TOO?

255
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,833
I THOUGHT NATSU
WAS THE ONLY ONE.

256
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,875
- ( scoffs )

257
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,541
- SO IF HE'S
THE IRON DRAGON SLAYER,

258
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,250
DOES THAT MEAN
HE EATS IRON? 

259
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,500
- SO, GAJEEL, I HEARD
YOU MADE A MESS

260
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,291
OUT OF THE FAIRY TAIL
GUILD HALL.

261
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,125
OH, MAN, I WISH I COULD HAVE
SEEN THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES.

262
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,875
THEY PROBABLY RAN AWAY
CRYING TO THEIR MOMMIES.

263
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,500
"BOOHOO, SOMEBODY BROKE
MY PLAYHOUSE."

264
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,541
( laughs )
- ( growls )

265
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,583
- ( screams )

266
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,791
- ( laughter )

267
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,625
- HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

268
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,250
I DON'T LIKE TO BE BOTHERED
WHILE I'M EATING.

269
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,833
AND BESIDES...

270
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,625
THOSE FAIRY TAIL CLOWNS
CAN'T CHALLENGE US.

271
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,750
WE'RE WAY MORE POWERFUL
THAN THEY COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

272
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,041
- THE DIE HAS BEEN CAST.

273
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,166
I COMPLIMENT YOUR
EXCELLENT WORK, GAJEEL.

274
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,541
- I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE
HARD ENOUGH ON THEM.

275
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,541
SO I DECIDED TO LEAVE 'EM
A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA,

276
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,333
A PRESENT THAT'S SURE TO GET

277
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,541
THOSE FAIRY TAILER'S
PANTIES IN A KNOT.

278
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,583
- VERY GOOD, MY BOY.

279
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,750
BE SURE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE

280
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,625
THAT NO HARM
COMES TO THAT ONE

281
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,791
IF YOU PLEASE.

282
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,791
- ( laughs )

283
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,208
- Narrator: THE MAGNOLIA
SOUTHGATE PARK.

284
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
- ( gasps )
- Erza: EXCUSE US.

285
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,166
WE'RE FROM THEIR GUILD.
PLEASE LET US THROUGH. 

286
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,958
- ( gasping )

287
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,875
- WHY ARE THEY STILL UP THERE?
- ( whispering )

288
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,500
- SOMEBODY GET THEM DOWN,
ALREADY.

289
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,708
- WHOA, DO YOU SEE
THAT MARK ON HER?

290
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,041
- WE BETTER NOT GET INVOLVED.

291
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,875
- LEVY!
- JET! DROY!

292
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,666
- PHANTOM LORD DID THIS!

293
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,750
- MASTER.

294
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:23,166
- I CAN TAKE OUR HEADQUARTERS
BEING REDUCED TO RUBBLE.

295
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,125
BUT I WILL NOT LET HARM
COME TO MY CHILDREN

296
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,458
WITHOUT TAKING REVENGE.

297
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,250
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO TO WAR.

298
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:45,000
- Narrator: MAGNOLIA HOSPITAL,
A STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY

299
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,500
THAT IS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE

300
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,375
ANY SPECIAL CONCERNS
IN TREATING WIZARDS.

301
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,500
- Lucy: DROY, JET...

302
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,208
AND POOR LEVY.

303
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,208
PHANTOM LORD IS HEARTLESS.

304
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,208
HOW COULD THEY DO THIS?

305
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,208
- Levy: SO, LUCY.

306
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,583
I HEARD THAT YOU'RE
WRITING A NOVEL.

307
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,500
- UGH, SO THE WORD'S
GOTTEN AROUND ALREADY, HUH?

308
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,708
- WORD UP.
- I SHOULD'VE KNOWN

309
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,416
I COULDN'T TRUST THE CAT
AND THE PYRO

310
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,250
TO KEEP A SECRET.

311
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,000
- OH, I'M BEING RUDE.
I DIDN'T INTRODUCE MYSELF.

312
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:25,083
I'M LEVY MCGARDEN,
BUT JUST CALL ME LEVY.

313
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,916
- MY FRIEND
IN THE HAT IS JET.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,041
- HEY, THERE.
- AND THAT'S DROY.

315
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,416
- OH, WOW, YOU'RE SO CUTE.

316
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,083
- AND TOGETHER....

317
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,708
- All: ...WE'RE THE AWESOME
TEAM SHADOW GEAR!

318
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,041
- OH, THAT'S COOL.

319
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,541
- ANYWAY, I'M A HORRIBLE
WRITER, MYSELF,

320
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,125
BUT I REALLY LOVE TO READ.

321
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,416
DO YOU THINK I COULD READ
YOUR NOVEL SOMETIME?

322
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,208
- WELL, I-- I DIDN'T REALLY
PLAN ON ANYBODY READING IT.

323
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,125
- WHAT? HOW COME?

324
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,833
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF WRITING A BOOK

325
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,458
THAT NO ONE'S
EVER GONNA READ?

326
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,833
- YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE SAY
THAT BEING A WRITER

327
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,666
IS LIKE SHOWING YOUR BUTT
TO THE WORLD.

328
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,125
- ( gasps )

329
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,166
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE EMBARRASSED.

330
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,458
- COME ON, LUCY,
PLEASE SHOW IT TO ME.

331
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,250
AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR BUTT,

332
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,708
SO DON'T GET WEIRD.

333
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,375
THE BOYS MIGHT WANT
TO SEE IT THOUGH.

334
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,708
- BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY 
FINISHED WITH IT, YET.

335
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,333
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHEN YOU ARE DONE,

336
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,416
I WANT TO BE
THE FIRST ONE TO READ IT.

337
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,083
- Past Lucy:
UH, SURE.

338
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,958
- Levy:
YAY, I CAN'T WAIT.

339
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,250
- Present Lucy:
AND JUST THE OTHER DAY,

340
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,333
SHE WORKED SO HARD
TO HELP US OUT.

341
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,208
WHAT THEY'VE DONE
IS UNFORGIVABLE. 

342
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,750
THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

343
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,833
- Narrator:
OAK TOWN IS LOCATED

344
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,416
IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER
OF THE FIORE KINGDOM.

345
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,208
IT IS HOME TO MANY 
HISTORIC BUILDINGS,

346
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,166
BUT TOWERING ABOVE THEM ALL
IS THIS MASSIVE

347
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,166
BRANCH OF
THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD.

348
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,250
- ( raucous noise )
- OH, YEAH! THAT'S PRICELESS!

349
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,708
- THOSE FAIRY CLOWNS GOT
WHAT THEY HAD COMING TO 'EM.

350
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,083
- I HEARD GAJEEL WENT AND TOOK
OUT THREE OF THEM, HIMSELF.

351
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,583
- ( muttering continues )

352
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,375
- THIS GUY HERE...
- I'M DRINKING THAT!

353
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,958
- ( laughter )

354
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,291
- OH, WE CAN'T LET HIM
HAVE ALL THE FUN.

355
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,916
- YEAH, WE NEED
TO TRY PICKING OFF

356
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,791
A COUPLE OF FAIRY WINGS
OURSELVES.

357
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,375
- ( laughs )

358
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,291
- ( groans, gasps )

359
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,500
- ( angry muttering )

360
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,458
- Makarov: FAIRY TAIL
HAS COME CALLING.

361
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,583
- All: ( battle cries )

362
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,083
- YA!

363
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:42,291
ALL RIGHT, WHO WANTS
TO PLAY WITH FIRE?! 

364
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,208
- ( shouting )

365
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,875
- LET'S GET 'EM.

366
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,291
- PURPLE NET!

367
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,875
NOW WAKABA.
- ON IT.

368
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,833
HERE COMES SMOKE CRUSH.

369
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,666
- GUNS MAGIC!

370
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,791
THAT ONE'S MY SPARK SHOT.

371
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,416
- ( gasps )
- EAT THIS.

372
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,291
- VERY NICE SHOOTING, BISCA.

373
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,083
- GETTING A LITTLE
RUSTY THERE, AL.

374
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,083
LOCKED ON TARGET.

375
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,333
HOMING SHOT!

376
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,708
- HE'S A MONSTER.

377
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,083
- AND YOU DARED TO
LAY YOUR HANDS

378
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,375
ON THIS MONSTER'S CHILDREN!

379
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,250
WERE YOU FOOLISH 
ENOUGH TO BELIEVE

380
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,666
HUMAN LAWS WOULD PROTECT YOU
FROM MY RAGE?

381
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,958
- ( frightened murmurs )
- HE'S SO POWERFUL.

382
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,625
- ALL THE MEMBERS
ARE STRONG TOO.

383
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,166
- YEAH, AND
THEY'RE TOTALLY NUTS.

384
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,041
- I DIDN'T KNOW FAIRY TAIL
WAS LIKE THIS.

385
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,750
- PICTO MAGIC!
WILD STAMPEDE!

386
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,000
- WOOD MAKE MAGIC...

387
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,250
DAM OF BASHFUL LOVE!

388
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,958
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT 
SUPPOSED TO MEAN, LADY?!

389
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,958
- LET'S GET THE CAT!
- PIECE OF CAKE.

390
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,541
- OH, YEAH?

391
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,958
- ( grunting ) 
- DON'T FORGET.

392
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,625
I'M A WIZARD TOO.
- ( grunting )

393
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,416
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH CATS?
- OF COURSE NOT, SIR.

394
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,958
- JOSE! SHOW YOURSELF!

395
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,958
- ( grunts )

396
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,416
TELL ME, WHERE CAN
I FIND GAJEEL

397
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,958
AND THE ELEMENT FOUR?!

398
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,958
- ( metal clinking )
- AHH, THE LEGEND HERSELF.

399
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,791
TITANIA ERZA.

400
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,625
I GUESS LAXUS AND MYSTOGAN

401
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,625
ARE TOO SCARED TO PLAY.

402
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,166
OR DO THEY NOT CARE?

403
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,208
EITHER WAY, MASTER JOSE
KNEW EXACTLY

404
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,708
HOW THIS WAS GONNA GO DOWN.

405
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,791
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
PRETTY GOOD FIGHTERS...

406
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,458
FOR A BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS.

407
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,083
- UGH!

408
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE EVERYONE 
JUST TOOK OFF WITHOUT ME.

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,791
BUT LEVY AND THE BOYS NEED 
SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER THEM.

410
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,958
SO I GUESS IT'S UP TO ME.

411
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,625
IT'S RAINING WHILE
THE SUN'S STILL OUT?

412
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,416
( gasps )

413
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,708
WHO ARE YOU?

414
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,416
- DRIP, DRIP, DROP.

415
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
JUVIA IS THE RAIN WOMAN.

416
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,416
IT'S ALWAYS WITH ME.

417
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,833
- UH...

418
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,166
- AND WHAT SORT OF WOMAN
ARE YOU, PRAY TELL?

419
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,416
- I'M JUST THE REGULAR KIND.
- DRIP, DRIP, DROP.

420
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
- WHAT'S WITH ALL 
THE DRIP-DROPPING?

421
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,958
- PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

422
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,458
I'LL BE GOING NOW.
- WELL, TAKE THE RAIN WITH YOU!

423
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,083
- <i>NO, NO, NO.</i>

424
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,625
<i>NO, NO, NO.</i>

425
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,333
<i>NO, NO, NO, NO,</i>
<i>NO, NO, NO.</i>

426
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,083
<i>( speaking French )</i>

427
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,791
I BID YOU BONJOUR,
MADEMOISELLE.

428
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,750
- GREAT, ANOTHER WEIRDO?

429
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,541
- JUVIA, <i>MA PETITE AMIE,</i>

430
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,833
YOU MUSTN'T SHY AWAY FROM
THE TASK AT HAND.

431
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,500
- NO, MONSIEUR SOL.

432
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,708
- MY MONOCLE WHISPERS TO ME
MANY THINGS, <i>MON CHERI.</i>

433
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,625
IT TELLS ME THIS
<i>BELLE DAME</i> BEFORE US

434
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,250
IS OUR SOUGHT AFTER <i>CIBLE.</i>
- DOES IT?

435
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,291
SO SHE IS THE ONE.

436
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,458
- <i>"CIBLE"?</i> THAT MEANS TARGET.

437
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,375
- AH, <i>PARDONNEZ-MOI.</i>

438
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,458
I HAVE NOT
TOLD YOU MY NAME.

439
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,750
I AM SOL OF THE ELEMENT FOUR.

440
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,166
ALSO KNOWN AS
"SOL OF THE EARTH."

441
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,666
BUT IT'D BEHOOVE YOU TO CALL ME
"MONSIEUR SOL."

442
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,458
- I'VE HEARD OF
THE ELEMENT FOUR.

443
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,958
YOU'RE WITH PHANTOM!

444
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,000
( speaks French )
- CORRECT.

445
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,333
WE'VE BEEN SENT HERE
TO COLLECT YOU

446
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,333
AND BRING YOU BACK
TO THE GUILD WITH US AT ONCE.

447
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,333
<i>MA BELLE COMPAGNE</i>
IS A RAIN WOMAN

448
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,166
WHO'S ALSO PART
OF THE ELEMENT FOUR.

449
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,833
SHE'S KNOWN AS
"JUVIA OF THE GREAT SEA."

450
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,166
- YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO ATTACKED MY FRIENDS.

451
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,875
AREN'T YOU?!

452
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,083
( gargles )

453
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,208
- <i>AU CONTRAIRE, MADEMOISELLE.</i>

454
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,708
A REASONABLE GUESS, BUT WE ARE
NOT THE ONES TO BLAME.

455
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,708
THAT HONOR AND THE RENOVATION
OF YOUR GUILD HALL

456
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,708
WAS THE WORK
OF MONSIEUR GAJEEL.

457
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,583
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR,
WE WERE WITH HIM IN SPIRIT

458
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,166
AS THE SAYING GOES.

459
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,375
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

460
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,125
LET ME OUT OF HERE, NOW!

461
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,208
- DON'T WASTE YOUR ENERGY.

462
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,750
MY WATER LOCK SPELL
CANNOT BE BROKEN.

463
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,083

FOR OUR RETRIEVAL MISSION

473
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,583

AH HA.

OH, YEAH, NOW I'VE GOT
A FIRE IN MY BELLY.

478
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,458
- ( groaning )

480
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,625

THAT HE'S ONE OF THOSE?

481

THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
THE TWO IS FOREVER!

487
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,791
- I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HECK

488
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,125
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, LADY!

( groaning )

495
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,625
- YOU'RE NOT DOING TOO BAD

496
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,083
FOR BEING A SNOWMAN.

497
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,291
- I COULD SAY THE SAME
ABOUT YOU, YOU PYRO.

498

- JOSE MUST BE LURKING
ON THE TOP FLOOR.

503
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,875
WHEN I FIND HIM,
THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY.

504
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,541
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

505
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,000
- ( chuckles )

506
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,500
NOW THAT THEIR LITTLE

507
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,250
BOSS MAN'S OUT OF THE WAY,

508
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,666
IT'S ABOUT TIME I THROW MYSELF
INTO THE MIX.

509
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,166
( cackling )

510
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

511
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:15,208
- OH, MAN, WE TOTALLY
LEFT LUCY BEHIND.

512
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,791
DIDN'T WE?
- WE SURE DID.

513
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,916
AND I BET YOU SHE'S GONNA BE
PRETTY ANGRY AT US

514
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,291
WHEN WE GET BACK.

515
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,791
- OH! THAT'S GONNA BE
BAD NEWS FOR US.

516
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,708
MAYBE WE SHOULD
BRING HER A SOUVENIR.

517
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,625
- AYE, BUT KNOWING HER,

518
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,666
SHE'D PROBABLY RATHER
HAVE MONEY FOR BUYING FOOD

519
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,875
OR RENT OR SOMETHING.

520
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,666
- Both: NEXT TIME...

521
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,416
- Natsu: OH NO. I THINK
I JUST HEARD HER VOICE.

522
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,041
- UH-OH, SHE'S COMING TO GET US.

523
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,291
YOU BETTER HIDE
YOUR MONEY, NATSU.

524
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,583
- OH! I DON'T HAVE ANY!
