1
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,375
I can't claim to know
exactly what's happening.

2
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:27,250
But a situation such as this one
troubles me to say the least.

3
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:31,208
[MAKAROV] Hm. And the first
sign was them not answering

4
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,833
when you called?

5
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,041
[LUCY]
Yeah.

6
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,250
[YUKINO] A contract
between a celestial wizard

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,625
and their spirit is an
unbreakable, sacred bond.

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,458
So this sort of thing shouldn't
happen. It's unheard of.

9
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:48,791
I'm afraid this means something
extremely serious is going on.

10
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,916
With them ignoring you
and trying to hurt Lucy,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,916
something major's gone down,
but what could it be?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,666
I got no idea.
But when I see Loke again,

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,416
I'm gonna beat some
manners into him!

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,916
Why don't you take us back
to the beginning, Lucy.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,791
Maybe we can figure out
where things went wrong.

16
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:06,958
[LUCY grunts]

17
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,125
[MAKAROV]
They want total freedom?

18
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,541
But you have such a good
relationship with them.

19
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,041
Loke's like the head honcho

20
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,291
of all the zodiac
spirits, isn't he?

21
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,250
Maybe he's just being
super rude and trying

22
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,875
to stir up some kind of trouble.

23
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,208
Exactly, that's why we
should go with my plan

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,791
and beat the snot
outta that jerk!

25
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,041
Beating someone up
isn't a plan, you idiot.

26
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,750
Well at least I
thought of something!

27
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,166
How are you gonna fix it?

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,333
Shut up.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,416
I fear it's more than
defiance. It's a revolt.

30
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,041
But why would it just
happen so suddenly?

31
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,541
That's not it. I refuse
to believe they'd do that.

32
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,541
Yes, I don't want to
either. But still...

33
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,166
I know. I'll call
Grandpa Crux again!

34
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,583
[HAPPY] But when you
summoned him earlier,

35
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,291
Virgo beat him and then
forced his gate to close.

36
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,958
[LUCY]
I know he'll find a way.

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,916
Open.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,875
Gate of the Southern Cross!

39
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,458
Crux!

40
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,125
[LUCY]
Wait. What?

41
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,208
I summoned Crux, not you!

42
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,625
[HOROLOGIUM] "Coming here
is extremely dangerous,

43
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,958
so I had this gentleman
bring me." He says,

44
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,791
through continuous snoring.

45
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,750
Well, the others may have
roughed him up a bit,

46
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,666
but at least he
gets to sleep it off!

47
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,333
[HAPPY]
Library Panic

48
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,250
We're back!

49
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,958
Please tell me
the kitchen's open.

50
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,958
I could definitely use a
bite to eat after that gig.

51
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:01,750
[JET]
Uh...

52
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,833
[DROY]
Hello?

53
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,958
[LEVY]
Is something wrong, you guys?

54
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,208
Shh!

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,791
[LUCY]
Grandpa Crux.

56
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,000
Can you please tell us what's
going on in the celestial world?

57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,708
[CRUX] At first, everything
was so peaceful. And then,

58
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,000
all of a sudden, rebellion
began to spread like wildfire.

59
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,875
Contracts between Zodiac
spirits and their key holders

60
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,916
became null and void.
There was no warning for this,

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,791
much less any kind
of reason given.

62
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,833
[CRUX] They've been
running amok ever since.

63
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,625
Destroying the celestial world,

64
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:35,625
and sending us silver keys into
hiding, fearful for our lives.

65
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,625
Well what about
old mustache face?

66
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,583
Can't the Celestial Spirit King
restore order somehow?

67
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,625
[CRUX] Perhaps he could,
if anyone knew where he was.

68
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,000
He's disappeared without
any kind of trace.

69
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,291
You mean you haven't even
seen him since? That's bad.

70
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,291
Leo the Lion is
the official leader

71
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,291
of the Zodiac spirits,
so we can assume

72
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,041
they're acting
under his command.

73
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,666
And he had the nerve
to pretend like

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,416
he didn't even know who we were!

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,083
The only thing he
wanted to talk about

76
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,833
was how they were tryin'
to get "total freedom."

77
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,291
[CRUX]
Liberam.

78
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,666
What does that mean?

79
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,250
[YUKINO]
I brought this with me.

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,041
I had a feeling this book had
something to do with all this.

81
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,208
[HAPPY]
What is it?

82
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,833
Would you mind if I take a look?

83
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,750
Please.

84
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,333
Now, let me see here.

85
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,833
This seems to be a magic book
written in ancient Meridisian.

86
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,041
Quite a few entries on
"Liberam."Reading through this,

87
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,208
I think it's more like
an encyclopedia instead.

88
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,958
We can always count on you.

89
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,333
Let me ask you something.

90
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,625
How did you know to
find this specific book?

91
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,958
[YUKINO] Well, I did a little
research on my own,

92
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,625
and came across this title.

93
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,833
But that's about
as far as I got.

94
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,666
I thought someone here could
help me find out more.

95
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,916
[CRUX] I must admit, I wasn't
aware that such ancient writings

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
still existed in
the human world.

97
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,625
But I can tell you that
the word 'Liberam' refers

98
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,875
to a certain ritual the
celestial spirits can perform.

99
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,125
It's a ritual?

100
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,208
What all do you know about it?

101
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,458
[CRUX]
Hm.

102
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,750
All I know is speculation.
But the story goes

103
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,208
that a spirit can obtain
this freedom Leo spoke of

104
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,000
by performing the Liberam.

105
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,875
This part looks
important you guys.

106
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,333
It says here that "The Liberam
requires a celestial globe

107
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,166
to free the spirits
from their chains."

108
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,916
From their chains?

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,791
Is that really how
they feel about it?

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,541
It can't be.
They're our friends.

111
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,541
[NATSU] I guarantee pouting
about it won't solve anything.

112
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
[HAPPY] Yeah, you're just gonna
give yourself frown lines

113
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,166
if you keep that up.

114
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,500
[LUCY sighs]

115
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,791
[NATSU] I'm the only one
with a real plan here.

116
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,291
And that's kickin' Loke's
butt till he's back to normal.

117
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,916
At least you care. Thank you.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,041
This celestial globe
that the ritual requires.

119
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,958
Do you know where
it can be found?

120
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,833
[CRUX] I'm afraid I do not.
Hopefully, it's not already

121
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,375
in the hands of those
rebellious spirits.

122
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,041
That could be tragic.

123
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,041
It seems like we would know
if it was in their possession.

124
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,541
Aye sir.

125
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,333
[DROY] If they had it, I don't
think that they would have

126
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,083
revealed themselves to Lucy.

127
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,541
Yeah, they probably
would've already

128
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,208
started the ritual by now.

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,875
That is a valid point.
There's no reason for them

130
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,958
to show up if they're
really independent.

131
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,958
[ERZA] Have you been able
to find much information

132
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,708
on the Liberam in there, Levy?

133
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,458
Actually, there are pages
and pages of stuff on it.

134
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,333
But the ink is way
too old and faded

135
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,333
to tell what most
of it even says.

136
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,250
[ERZA] I wonder if we
can find another book

137
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,458
that can tell us more about it.

138
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,500
Wait a sec.

139
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,125
I have an idea.

140
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,333
[LEVY]
Yeah!

141
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,791
We should check out
the Library of Sorcery

142
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,583
to see if we can
find something there!

143
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:32,000
Hm. Perhaps we may even
discover that these bizarre

144
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,291
weather phenomena
we've been experiencing,

145
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,791
and the disruption in the
spirit world are related.

146
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,125
But we need evidence.

147
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,041
[ERZA]
I volunteer.

148
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,000
We need as much
reliable intelligence

149
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,708
on the subject as
we can possibly

150
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,500
get our hands on, and quickly.

151
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,625
And then we can make our move.

152
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,541
I trust you can
handle that, Erza?

153
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,500
[ERZA] Right! We'll
split into teams of two.

154
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,916
[ERZA] Cana and I, Wendy
and Carla, Gray and Juvia,

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,791
Gajeel and Lily,
and Mira and Elfman.

156
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,750
If we spread out we
can cast a wide net

157
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,291
for any relevant information.

158
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,791
Once Warren returns,
we can use his telepathy

159
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,083
to relay what've found
amongst the teams.

160
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,291
[ERZA] Lucy, Natsu,
Yukino, Levy, and Happy will

161
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,916
head to the Library of Sorcery.

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,041
Aye, Sir!

163
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,541
I love being a bookworm!

164
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,333
Are you fired up, Natsu?

165
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,916
Hey!

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,166
[LEVY]
He's gone!

167
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,375
[HAPPY] So are the clock
and the sleepy old man.

168
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,916
No. He didn't!

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,541
That nitwit will
be the death of me!

170
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,250
[NATSU]
Hey listen. Thanks for the help!

171
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,625
You guys rule!

172
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,833
[HOROLOGIUM] "I'm more than
happy to be of service.

173
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,208
But I can't say that it's
very intelligent of you

174
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,416
to go against the
redhead's orders like this"

175
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,583
He grumbles disparagingly.

176
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,041
[NATSU] If you know me, you
know that I don't let anybody

177
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,666
get away with hurting
Lucy's feelings!

178
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,083
[HOROLOGIUM] "I admire your
loyalty, but information should

179
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,333
always come before action."
He advises contrarily.

180
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,375
Well, it's too
late for that now!

181
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,875
[NATSU growls]

182
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,666
[NATSU]
Alright, ya bunch of star jerks,

183
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,708
you've got some
'splainin' to do!

184
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,750
Whoa! You two should find
somewhere safe to hide.

185
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,791
[CRUX] We will,
but please be careful!

186
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,666
[TAURUS] Welcome to the
celestial spirit world, mortal.

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,750
[NATSU]
Taurus? What's with you?

188
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,541
I thought you were supposed
to be all wacky and pervy.

189
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,958
[TAURUS]
Then you would be wrong.

190
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:30,541
I may have once behaved
so boorishly, but no more.

191
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,208
[NATSU groans]

192
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,375
[TAURUS] I pride myself
on gentlemanly manners.

193
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,083
Even as I destroy you.

194
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,791
Is that so?

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,916
I'm gettin' kinda
worried about Natsu.

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,666
Don't forget that
time works differently

197
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,416
in the celestial world, so even
though it's been a while,

198
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,875
he's probably just
now arriving there.

199
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,416
Yeah, good point.

200
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,000
We're all a little worried.

201
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,166
But our team needs to
focus on finding clues

202
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,916
to help us stop the Liberam.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,541
[HAPPY] There's gotta
be something promising

204
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,250
in all these stacks of books.

205
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,041
Have you guys found
anything that looks useful?

206
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,916
[LEVY] Not yet.
And we are gonna need

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,291
every single book on
that list I gave you.

208
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,750
[HAPPY]
Aye, Sir!

209
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,166
[LUCY]
Listen to this.

210
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,208
"There are stories
from long ago that tell

211
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,541
of the Liberam ritual
being performed.

212
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,666
But they're just legends,
and cannot be verified."

213
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,750
[LEVY] "The name
'Meridies' means 'south'

214
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,125
in the Meridisian language."
Duh, I know that already!

215
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,375
[YUKINO] According to this:
"The Liberam can only

216
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,250
be performed in a
specific location.

217
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,750
Known as the Astral Spiritus."

218
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,958
[LUCY] Does it happen
to say where that is?

219
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,333
Can we go there?

220
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,750
[YUKINO] It only says
what it is, not where it is.

221
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,416
Maybe there's an atlas
in here that can tell us.

222
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,666
[LUCY]
What about you?

223
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,833
Finding any info on
the celestial globe?

224
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,291
[LEVY]
No such luck.

225
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,750
And all these books are
worn and faded out, too.

226
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,875
But it's gotta be in
one of these old things.

227
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,083
[BOTH gasp]

228
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,583
[YUKINO]
What's happening?

229
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,625
[LUCY] Unfortunately. I think
I recognize this feeling.

230
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,625
[ALL gasp]

231
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,583
[LUCY]
Uh- oh!

232
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,583
[ALL scream]

233
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,041
[HAPPY]
Huh? What the heck was that?

234
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,166
Man, that hurts.

235
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,125
[YUKINO]
Are you doing okay, Levy?

236
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,458
Yeah. I guess so.
That was a major fall.

237
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,708
What do you think caused it?

238
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,208
What, do you see something?

239
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Keep your guard up, everybody!

240
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,750
[ALL scream]

241
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,333
[LUCY]
It's you.

242
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,958
As soon as I felt that rumbling
I was sure you were behind it!

243
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,375
[LUCY]
What do you want, Virgo?

244
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,166
Who? Me?

245
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,375
To give you
punishment, of course.

246
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,875
[LEVY]
Oh my gosh!

247
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,416
Has Virgo gone totally
nuts or something?

248
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,916
[LUCY]
Yeah, but I don't know why!

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,708
[VIRGO] Aw. Can't a girl
have a little fun?

250
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,416
And what's more fun
than punishment?

251
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,583
Hope you're ready.

252
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,291
Because I really
wanna take my time

253
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,458
and enjoy every second of this.

254
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,000
Solid Script Magic...

255
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,250
Iron!

256
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,750
You deserve a good
spanking for that!

257
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,791
[LEVY gasps]

258
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,250
Virgo, stop this!

259
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,583
Not gonna happen.

260
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,333
And although you might
think you can threaten me

261
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,166
with your little
Fleuve d'étoiles.

262
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,041
It's a toy compared to mine!

263
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,750
[LUCY screams]

264
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,291
[HAPPY]
Hang on, I got ya!

265
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,041
Lucy!

266
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,875
[VIRGO]
You're not getting away from me!

267
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:38,416
[grunting]

268
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,791
[LUCY]
Whoa! Where'd that come from?

269
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,125
I've been doing combat training

270
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,208
ever since I
rejoined Sabertooth.

271
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,958
I'll hold her back while you
look for some more clues!

272
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,166
[LUCY]
That's on you Levy,

273
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,333
kick that beautiful
brain into high gear!

274
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,166
[LEVY]
Got it!

275
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,000
Yukino's gotten super scary.

276
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,750
Remind me to never get
into a fight with her.

277
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,125
[LUCY] Why would you fight
her in the first place?

278
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,083
[VIRGO] Although it's
true that I love pain,

279
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,833
I prefer inflicting it so
much more than receiving it.

280
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,666
Well, that's just
too bad for you.

281
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,833
This would be a lot
easier if I actually knew

282
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,458
what I was looking for!

283
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,291
Wait. What is that?

284
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,500
[LEVY]
Could prove to be helpful.

285
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,916
[grunting]

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,166
[VIRGO] And now! I get to
punish you for hurting me!

287
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,375
[YUKINO gasps]

288
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,166
[VIRGO]
That was close!

289
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,125
Virgo, I'm ordering you to stop!

290
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,916
Oh are you? This is exciting!

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,583
Hearing you bark
out orders like that

292
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,166
really gets my blood pumping.

293
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,708
Okay. I knew she was
into some weird stuff

294
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,541
but this is crazy!

295
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,875
[LUCY]
I don't get it Virgo!

296
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,958
I thought we were friends!
Why are you doing this?

297
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,333
[HAPPY]
Where are you going?

298
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,333
I just hope that
my hunch is right.

299
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,041
She's not running away is she?

300
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,291
There could be more
celestial spirits around here.

301
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,583
Make sure Levy doesn't
run into any by herself.

302
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,791
[YUKINO]
I will!

303
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,000
I know you're having
a lovely little chat.

304
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,416
But don't turn away from me!

305
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,666
Because I really wanna
see that beautiful

306
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,416
face of yours,
all twisted with pain.

307
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,916
[NATSU]
Man, that hurt.

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,916
[TAURUS] It seems as though
that hit wasn't quite enough.

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,791
Alright, I know you
owed me one for when

310
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,000
I thought you were a monster
and kicked your butt.

311
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,916
[NATSU]
So, I suppose we're even now.

312
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,458
[TAURUS]
I don't recall such a moment.

313
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,666
[NATSU] Maybe you just need
me to give you a reminder

314
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,916
of what that felt like!

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,125
So come on!

316
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,916
[TAURUS] That would
prove udderly pointless,

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,083
in my opinion.

318
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,833
This new smarmy
attitude of yours

319
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,583
is really gettin' on my nerves!

320
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,291
Fire Dragon...

321
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,250
Roar!

322
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,583
Major owie.

323
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,125
[HAPPY] Your big ol' fat butt
is gonna squeeze my insides

324
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,250
right outta me.

325
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,666
That is so rude.

326
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,791
[HAPPY]
Think about how I feel.

327
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,791
[LUCY]
Where'd Virgo go?

328
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,958
[HAPPY]
Oh no!

329
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,208
I bet she ran off
to try and find Levy!

330
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,541
Where are we going? Did you
find some sort of clue?

331
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,916
Yeah, a list of donations.

332
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,583
And what we're
looking for is on it!

333
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,000
Are they donations that
were made to this library?

334
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,583
[LEVY]
Most definitely!

335
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,833
Which means the celestial globe
is somewhere in this building!

336
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,416
[YUKINO]
That's great news!

337
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,958
[LEVY] Apparently it was
discovered at an archaeological

338
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,708
dig site. I don't
think they realized

339
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,291
its true importance,
so they donated it here.

340
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,583
Besides magic books, this
library houses many artifacts

341
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,416
discovered in Fiore.
It's gotta be here!

342
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,833
[YUKINO] But, this place is
huge, do you know where it is?

343
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,916
[LEVY] Not yet, but
I bet we can find it!

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,625
There's bound to be a place
they keep those kinda things!

345
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,708
[LUCY]
Virgo, wait!

346
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,083
[VIRGO] Do I look like
the type of person

347
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,500
who waits for anything?
Get outta my way!

348
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,500
[HAPPY] This is way
worse than Lucy's butt!

349
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,833
[LUCY]
Please, Virgo, stop!

350
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,791
Oh yes.

351
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,166
Keep begging.

352
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,583
The more you plead,
the more excited I get!

353
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,791
So let's make it really tight.

354
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,125
She's gonna rip
my head right off!

355
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,333
Whatever I may have done
to make you mad, I'm sorry!

356
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,625
[VIRGO]
I'm not mad at all!

357
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,500
I can't remember ever
feeling this happy!

358
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,458
Well, Happy's
feeling really bad!

359
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,833
[LUCY screaming]
Ow!

360
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,333
[HAPPY]
Oh my gosh!

361
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,166
I don't think you can bend
Lucy like that for much longer.

362
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,875
You're gonna
snap her in half!

363
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,541
Let's talk about this!

364
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,666
Please Virgo!

365
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,958
[VIRGO giggling]

366
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,875
[NATSU yelling]

367
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,250
[NATSU]
Listen, cow!

368
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,791
You've been Lucy's celestial
spirit for years now!

369
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,208
Whenever she's in trouble,
she turns to you for help!

370
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,000
You helped her
take down Nirvana!

371
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,916
Don't you remember her at all?
How could you forget her?

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,666
[TAURUS] I have no idea
what you're talking about.

373
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,750
[NATSU]
Then I'll remind ya!

374
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,375
[LEVY]
So...

375
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,875
I don't see anything
that resembles a globe.

376
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,125
[LEVY] Maybe it's not
in this warehouse.

377
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,541
But I'm afraid that checking
all of them would take days

378
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,541
or maybe even
weeks to get through.

379
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,791
Hm. There's gotta be some
kind of clue hidden around here

380
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,958
that I'm just not seeing yet.

381
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,875
This is the most amazing
punishment I've been

382
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,166
lucky enough to be a part of!
I don't know if I can take it!

383
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,875
[BOTH screaming]

384
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,333
[HAPPY] Tell me when
the room stops spinning.

385
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,750
[LEVY] I just have to
stay calm and think.

386
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,000
I can find it!

387
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,416
[YUKINO] I'm worried
Virgo's not far behind.

388
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,333
[LEVY]
Huh?

389
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,875
[YUKINO] Whenever you found
the list she looked your way.

390
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,125
She was watching you.

391
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,000
[LEVY] If that's the case,
why didn't she follow us

392
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,958
down here earlier? She
could've caught us by now!

393
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,916
That's true, but I'm
wondering if she's just

394
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,583
waiting on you to
find the globe first

395
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,416
so she can take it from you!

396
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,208
[LEVY] You may be right.
We should hurry!

397
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,125
[BOTH gasp]

398
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,333
You'd better pump those legs
of yours faster than that

399
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,458
if you really wanna
get away from me!

400
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,166
This is not really a good
time to pass out, Happy!

401
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,041
[HAPPY] So many yummy
kinds of fish to choose from.

402
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,583
Are you actually dreaming?

403
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,708
[VIRGO laughing]

404
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,958
Yes, that's it!
Makes perfect sense!

405
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,583
Where're you going?

406
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,291
[LEVY] Sorry. Just
checking something out.

407
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,000
This one's the
East Warehouse.

408
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,833
[YUKINO] Okay. What's
the importance of that?

409
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,791
[LEVY] Well, if there's an
east, then there's probably

410
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,166
a west, north,
and south one too.

411
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,625
[YUKINO]
Right. Any of them significant?

412
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,125
The book you brought
was in ancient Meridisian.

413
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,708
And Meridies
translates to south!

414
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,416
So we should check
the south one.

415
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,416
Are you sure?

416
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah. But...

417
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,291
[LEVY] It would help if we
knew what floor it was on.

418
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,750
[YUKINO] I guess we'll have to
check them all until we find it.

419
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,833
[LUCY, HAPPY scream]

420
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,166
[BOTH]
Oh no are you okay?

421
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,041
No more falling today, please.

422
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,750
[HAPPY]
Death by fat butt.

423
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,750
Did you guys have any luck
in finding some clues in here?

424
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,833
Yeah, I think
I know where it is!

425
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,250
Hm?

426
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,791
I think we may have finally
lost the crazy maid.

427
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,291
[LUCY] If you wanna find
the south warehouse,

428
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,416
I've got just the
thing for that!

429
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,875
Now open,
Gate of the Silver Compass!

430
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:51,958
Pyxis!

431
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,916
[PYXIS squeaks]

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
Good to see you again.

433
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,875
Do you happen to know where we
might find the south warehouse?

434
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:06,333
[PYXIS squeaking]

435
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,375
[LUCY]
Alright!

436
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,833
Looks like we're
heading that way.

437
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,750
Thanks, Pyxis!

438
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,125
[PYXIS squeaks]

439
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,333
[YUKINO] It seems that we're
closer than we thought.

440
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,375
[LUCY]
Let's hurry!

441
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,500
[HAPPY shrieks]
She was watching us!

442
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,166
That's so creepy!

443
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,000
Go on and see if
you can find it, Levy.

444
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,083
Don't worry, she
won't get past us!

445
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,208
Thanks, ladies. I'm off.

446
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,833
[LEVY]
Please be careful!

447
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,666
[VIRGO]
There goes little Levy McGarden.

448
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,083
On her way to find the
celestial globe, I'm sure.

449
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,458
[LUCY]
Are you ready, Yukino?

450
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,541
[YUKINO]
I am.

451
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,958
[VIRGO]
I'd love to stay and hand out

452
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,416
more delicious punishment.

453
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,791
But that's not really why
I came all the way out here.

454
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,750
[VIRGO]
Hmph.

455
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,333
Gonna be feelin' that one.

456
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,666
[TAURUS] I must say, for
a human, you seem to have

457
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,041
an especially tough hide.

458
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,833
[NATSU]
And you got a thick skull!

459
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,666
And I'll keep
beatin' sense into it

460
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,708
until you remember everything!

461
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,250
[TAURUS]
Moo.

462
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,291
Now that you mention it
further, I do seem to recall

463
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,875
having contracts with humans.
As absurd as that sounds to me.

464
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,166
[NATSU]
You do?

465
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,541
[TAURUS]
But those relationships mean

466
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,875
absolutely nothing to
me now. I've mooved on.

467
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,333
What'd you say?

468
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,375
[NATSU] Think about how
horrible Lucy would feel

469
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,125
if she heard that!

470
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,708
[TAURUS] I have no idea
whoo you are talking about.

471
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,791
[NATSU]
Oh yeah?

472
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,875
Well, maybe this will
jog your memory!

473
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,125
Fire Dragon Sword Horn!

474
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,583
[TAURUS]
Moove.

475
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:36,500
[NATSU screaming]
Aw man!

476
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,333
[TAURUS]
Thanks for the visit.

477
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,166
[LEVY]
Holy crap! That's gotta be it!

478
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,625
[LUCY]
Levy, are you here?

479
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,583
Yeah, and I've got
the globe with me!

480
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,125
Nice work!

481
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,375
Now we should be able to stop
the ceremony from happening!

482
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,708
We need to back
to the guild ASAP!

483
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,250
I knew that you'd
eventually find it for me.

484
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,708
[LEVY] Let go!
[LUCY] Levy!

485
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,958
[VIRGO] No thanks!
[YUKINO] Hang in there!

486
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,083
[LEVY screams]

487
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,750
Feels so good, I may
have to punish myself.

488
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,000
[LUCY]
Virgo!

489
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,750
Please, you can't
go through with this!

490
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,291
[VIRGO] Sorry, but it's
mine. And as thanks,

491
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,958
I'll fill Magnolia full
of holes, just for you.

492
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,791
Listen. Before you guys go
through with the ceremony--

493
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,875
[VIRGO] Right, before that I'll
fill the Library full of holes!

494
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,625
[HAPPY] I don't think
she's gonna listen.

495
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:36,583
[NATSU screaming]

496
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,708
[BOTH]
Natsu!

497
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,166
[NATSU groans]

498
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,416
That was the longest fall ever.
What are you guys doin' here?

499
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,083
And where is "here"?

500
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,875
[HAPPY] We're in the
normal world, Natsu!

501
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,416
In a library!

502
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,916
But I bet you've never even
heard of one of those, have ya?

503
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,583
[YUKINO]
She's gone!

504
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,041
[HAPPY]
And she took the globe!

505
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,708
It's gone for real.

506
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,375
How in the heck are
we gonna get it back?

507
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,541
[NATSU]
Get what back?

508
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,125
[LEVY] So. What I was
gonna tell her...

509
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,291
There's a catch
with the ceremony.

510
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,500
I was trying to tell
her what it was.

511
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,000
[LEVY] I saw a note in the
catalog that listed the globe.

512
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,958
Celestial spirits can use
the Liberam to gain freedom,

513
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,666
but it comes at a heavy price.

514
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,041
Their lives will only last
12 days once it is done.

515
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,125
[ALL gasp]

516
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,750
Are you serious?

517
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,500
[YUKINO]
It's going to kill them?

518
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:32,083
[HAPPY] It's not really freedom
if you're not alive to enjoy it.

519
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,750
[HAPPY] Oh man, this
fish smell is amazing!

520
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,375
It's making me so hungry!

521
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,000
[NATSU] But it's the magic
ghost fish, not the kind ya eat!

522
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,250
[HAPPY]
So what?

523
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,083
[NATSU] So, is it
really a fish if it talks

524
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,208
and does other stuff?

525
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,666
[HAPPY]
Sure why not?

526
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,208
Show me one rule that says
fish aren't allowed to talk!

527
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,500
[NATSU]
I see your point, but--

528
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,166
[HAPPY] If they can talk,
it's even better!

529
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,125
They can tell me how
delicious they are!

530
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,625
[NATSU]
Now that's advertising!

531
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,875
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: Hisui Rises!

532
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,666
[HAPPY] Maybe they'll have
some great slogans like,

533
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,791
"Eat me!" or "Fish is love!"

534
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,750
[NATSU] Yeah, those
are totally awesome.
